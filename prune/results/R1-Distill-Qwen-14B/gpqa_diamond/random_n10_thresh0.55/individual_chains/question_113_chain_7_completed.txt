Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me think about what each of the given analyses tells me and how they can help identify the correct formula.

First, the FTIR data shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So, the compound probably has an -OH group, like an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, the other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch, maybe from a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 peak could be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an ester or a ketone with some conjugation, or perhaps a carbonyl next to an oxygen, like an ester or a conjugated double bond.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound must have at least one double bond. That might tie into the IR data as well, since the 1650 peak could be a conjugated double bond, perhaps part of an ester or another group.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Let me think about what that could be. A peak at 45 is a common fragment, maybe from something like (CH3)2O (which is 45: 12*2 +1*6 +16= 24+6+16=46. Wait, that's 46. Hmm, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene ion or something else. Wait, another possibility is that m/z 45 could correspond to a fragment like CH3CO+ with a mass of 45: 12+16+12+16? No wait, let me calculate. CH3CO is (12*2)+(1*3)+(16*2)=24+3+32=59. No, that can't be. Wait, what about (CH2)2O? No, that would be 12*2 + 2*4 +16=24+8+16=48. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think differently. The most common fragment at m/z 45 is probably the (CH3)2CO+ (acetone) ion, which is 45? Let me calculate: acetone is (CH3)2CO, so the molecular formula is C3H6O. Molecular weight: 3*12=36, 6*1=6, O=16. 36+6+16=58. But that's the molecular ion. Wait, perhaps a fragment. Oh wait, if you have a compound that upon fragmentation loses some groups, the m/z 45 could be a smaller fragment. Let me think about possible groups: maybe a CH3CO group losing a CH3 would leave O=C-O or something else. Alternatively, the fragment could be from an ester group. Wait, another possibility is that the m/z 45 is a ketone. Oh wait, maybe it's a fragment like a (CH3)2CO+ cation. Let me see: (CH3)2CO would have a molecular mass of 58, but perhaps a fragment of that is 45. Hmm, not sure. Another idea: maybe it's a CH2=CH-O group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should consider the possible molecular formulas given. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

Each of these has different degrees of unsaturation. Let me calculate that for each. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

For C6H12O: C=6, H=12, O=1.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=2/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring or a double bond.

C6H10O: H=10. DoU = (14 -10)/2=4/2=2. Two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond, or two rings.

C6H10O2: H=10, O=2. DoU = (14 -10 -2*2 +0)/2? Wait, no, O doesn't affect the formula directly. Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So X and N are zero. So for C6H10O2: (14 -10)/2=4/2=2. Two degrees.

C6H12O2: H=12, O=2. (14-12)/2=2/2=1. So one degree.

So the options have varying degrees of unsaturation.

Now, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond. So the compound must have at least one double bond, which is one degree of unsaturation. So if the molecular formula has more than one degree, maybe there's a ring or another double bond.

Looking back at the IR: the peak at 1700 is a carbonyl group. So the compound has a carbonyl, which is another degree of unsaturation. So that would make two degrees (if it's just a carbonyl with a double bond elsewhere), but wait, if the carbonyl is part of a ring, that could be just one. Hmm. Let me think: the FTIR also shows a broad peak at 3000, which is likely an O-H group (as in an alcohol or carboxylic acid). So the compound likely has both a carbonyl group and an O-H group.

So combining the IR data: an O-H (from the broad peak) and a carbonyl (from 1700). So possible functional groups could be a ketone with an alcohol, but that's less common. More likely, perhaps an ester (which has both an O-H and a carbonyl) or a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe a hemiacetal or something, but that's probably more complicated.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is an ester. Esters have both an O-H (in the -OH group) and a carbonyl (from the ester group). So esters have the structure RCOOR', which has a carbonyl (around 1700-1750 cm^-1) and an O-H stretch (if it's an alcohol, but in an ester, the O-H is from the alcohol part. Wait, no, in an ester, the -O- is part of the ester group, but the O-H is not usually present unless it's part of a hemiacetal or something. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: esters are R-O-CO-R', so they don't have an O-H group. So maybe the broad peak isn't from an O-H but from something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated system.

Wait, maybe the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. So like a diol with a ketone, or maybe a cyclic hemiacetal. Alternatively, maybe it's a beta-keto alcohol or something.

Alternatively, the O-H could be from a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, that would fit. But a carboxylic acid would have a very broad and strong O-H peak, which aligns with the IR data. Also, a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is usually around 1700 cm^-1. So the 1700 peak could be the carboxylic acid carbonyl.

Wait, but the other peak is at 1650, which might be a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, if the compound has an ester group, the carbonyl is around 1730-1750, but if it's conjugated, it could be lower. Wait, the 1700 is the main carbonyl, and 1650 might be a conjugated double bond.

But wait, the NMR showed vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. So if the compound is a substituted ester with a double bond, that would fit.

Now, considering the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45. Let me think of possible structures. If the compound has an ester group, perhaps the fragment is from the ester part. For example, if the ester is ethyl acetate, which is (CH3COOCH2CH3), its molecular ion would be at 88, but a fragment could be the acetic acid part, which would lose the ethyl group. So perhaps the fragment is (CH3COO-) which would be 60. Hmm, not 45. Alternatively, if the ester is something else, maybe a smaller ester.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options. Let's see each possibility.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU is 1. So it's either a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so it has a double bond. So perhaps a ring plus a double bond would be two degrees, but this option only has one, so that's a problem. So perhaps this formula is not the right one.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU is 2. So it could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. But from IR, we have a carbonyl and a vinyl group. So that's two DoU, which fits. But does the formula have an O, which would mean perhaps an alcohol or a carbonyl. Wait, the IR has a carbonyl, so that would require O, which is present in this formula as one O. But how can the compound have both O-H and carbonyl with only one O? Hmm, not possible. Unless the O is part of a carbonyl and another O is not present. Wait, maybe the O is part of an ester group, which has two O's, but this formula only has one O. So that doesn't fit. So maybe B is not correct.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So two DoU: maybe a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds. Since the NMR shows a vinyl group, that's a double bond. So another DoU could be a ring, or another double bond. The IR has a carbonyl, which is another DoU. So that's two DoU, which matches the formula's DoU. So this could fit. If the compound has a carbonyl (like an ester), an O-H group (like a carboxylic acid), and a double bond, but wait, the O count would be two. So maybe an ester group (which has two O's), a double bond, and an O-H group. But that would require three O's, which isn't the case here. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The IR shows a broad peak at 3000 (O-H), and a carbonyl. So if the formula is C6H10O2, that's two O's. So perhaps the structure is a diol with a carbonyl group, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, an ester would have two O's in the structure. So for example, if it's an ester with a double bond, like methyl vinyl benzoate or something similar. But wait, methyl vinyl benzoate would have the formula C8H8O2, which isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Lactones have a ring structure and an ester group. So that would account for the carbonyl and the O. But the formula here is C6H10O2. Let me see: a lactone would have the formula CnH2nO2. Wait, for a six-membered ring, n would be 5? No, wait, for a five-membered ring (gamma-lactone), the formula is C4H6O2; for a six-membered (delta-lactone), it would be C5H8O2. Hmm, but our options are C6H10O2. So that's not matching. So maybe not a lactone.

Alternatively, the compound could be an ester with a double bond. Let's say it's something like methyl acrylate, which is CH2=CHCOOCH3. The formula would be C5H8O2. Again, not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure has a conjugated system. For instance, an aromatic ring with substituents, but that's probably not the case here because the options don't include any benzene rings (since they're all C6H...).

Wait, but the options are all six carbons. So perhaps the structure is similar to something like methyl vinyl ether or another ester derivative.

Let me think about the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45 is a significant clue. Let me think about possible structures that would give this fragment. For example, if the compound is something like diethyl maleate, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another approach: m/z 45 corresponds to a fragment of the molecule. Let's calculate the possible fragments. For example, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is (6*12) + (10*1) + (2*16) =72 +10 +32= 114 g/mol. So the molecular ion would be at m/z 114. The fragment at 45 is about 40% of that. So perhaps the molecule breaks into two parts, one being 45 and the other 69.

Is there a common fragment with a mass of 45? Let me think: the acetate group (CH3COO-) has a molecular weight of 60 (12+12 + (16*2) + (1*3) )? Wait, CH3COO- is (12*2)+(1*3)+(16*2)=24+3+32=59. So that's 59. Not 45.

Another possibility: if the fragment is (CH2)2O, which is 48. But that's not 45. Wait, maybe the fragment is something like (CH3)2C=O, which is 58. No. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fragment is a ketene ion. A ketene has the structure RC=O, but I'm not sure about the mass. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a propionyl group (CH2CH2CO), but that's 57. Hmm.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a butyraldehyde group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a smaller structure. Let's think about the molecular formulas. The options have different numbers of O and H. Let me see which ones could have a 45 fragment.

Assuming the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the possible way to get a fragment of 45 could be if the molecule splits into a part with, say, C3H6O2. Wait, C3H6O2 has a molecular weight of (3*12)+(6*1)+(2*16)=36+6+32=74. No, that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe a group like C3H5O. That would be (3*12)+(5)+(16)=36+5+16=57.

Hmm, I'm stuck on this. Let's think differently. Another approach is to think about the possible structures that fit the other data.

The IR has a broad peak (O-H) and a carbonyl. The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So perhaps the structure is a diester or something with both an ester and a vinyl group.

Wait, another idea: if the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. These have conjugated double bonds next to the ester group. The IR would show a carbonyl around 1700 and a conjugated double bond (maybe the 1650 peak). The O-H peak could be from somewhere else, but in an ester, the O is part of the ester group. Wait, but esters don't have O-H groups (they are R-O-CO-R'). So unless the compound is a carboxylic acid, but that would have a broad O-H.

Wait, but the FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000. Could that be from an alcohol group? So if it's a compound with both an ester group (carbonyl) and an alcohol group (O-H), then the formula would have two O's. Looking at the options, C6H10O2 and C6H12O2 have two O's. So, perhaps the structure is an ester with an alcohol group.

Wait, but that's a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or some kind of cyclic structure. Alternatively, the compound could be a keto-alcohol, which has both a carbonyl and an alcohol group.

Wait, another angle: the mass spec. If the fragment is at 45, which is 45 amu, perhaps it's a (CH3)2CO+ ion (which is acetone, molecular weight 58), but that doesn't match. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CH2O+ group, which is 46. But not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a CH2=CH-O group. The molecular weight of CH2=CH-O would be 12*2 + 1*4 + 16 = 24+4+16=44. Close but not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from (CH3)2C=O, which is 58 (molecular ion). No. Maybe a CH2CH2CO+ group, which is 57. No.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a methylene group with some oxygen. Let me think: CO (carbon monoxide) is 28, but that's not relevant. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: look at the correct molecular formula and see what kind of fragments they can produce.

Looking at option C: C6H10O2. The molecular weight is 114. If a fragment is 45, the other part would be 114-45=69. So perhaps the molecule breaks into a 45 and 69 part. 69 could be a larger fragment, perhaps the rest of the molecule.

Alternatively, maybe the 45 is a common ion. For example, (CH3)2CHO+ would be 58, but again, not 45.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula C6H10O2 could be something like methyl vinyl carbonate or another ester. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a diester, but that would have more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, a lactone, but earlier I thought about that and it didn't fit.

Wait, maybe the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Let's take an example: methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its formula is C4H6O2. So that's not matching our options, which are C6.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like methyl vinyl benzoate, but that's larger.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible functional groups. The compound has a carbonyl (IR at 1700) and an O-H (IR broad). So if it's a carboxylic acid, then it's RCOOH. But then the formula would need to have two O's (since RCOOH is CnH2nO2), which fits options C (C6H10O2) and A (C6H12O2). So for a carboxylic acid, the DoU would be two (if there's a double bond) or one (if there's a ring). Let me check:

If the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), DoU is (2*6+2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: with a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds. So if it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, that would account for two DoU.

But then, where is the O-H from? Carboxylic acid has O-H, that's the broad peak. The carbonyl is the 1700 peak. The vinyl H in NMR suggests a double bond. So that would fit.

But wait, the mass spec fragment is 45. Let's imagine the structure is a substituted acrylic acid. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2COOH. But that's four carbons; our options are six. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic carboxylic acid with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a di-substituted ethyl acrylate, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a gamma,delta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. That would have a double bond and a carboxylic acid group. The formula would be C6H10O2. Let me check: C6H10O2. Yes, that's option C.

So, does this structure fit all the data?

FTIR: Broad peak at 3000 (O-H from COOH), peaks at 1700 (carbonyl of COOH) and 1650 (conjugated double bond, since the double bond is next to the COOH group, causing the carbonyl peak to shift down to 1700 and the conjugated double bond would show around 1650).

1H NMR: Vinyl hydrogens, which would be the protons on the double bond. So that fits.

Mass spec: The fragment at 45. Let's think about the possible fragments. The molecular weight is 114. The fragment at 45 could be a smaller group. For example, if the molecule breaks at the double bond, perhaps losing a propenoic acid group (which is 72, but that's not 45). Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid group breaks off as COOH (which is 60, but again not 45). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from the vinyl group. If the molecule is CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH, the possible fragments could be CH2=CHCH2CH2+ (which is 64), or CH2COOH (which is 58). Not matching.

Another possibility: the fragment could be a result of losing a larger group. For example, the molecule could lose the COOH group and the rest, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a part of the molecule. Let me think about molecular formula of 45. 45 is 12 + 12 + 16 + 5? Let me do the math: 45 = 12a +1b +16c. Let's see:

Possibly:
C3H3O: (3*12)+(3*1)+(16)=36+3+16=55. No.

C3H7O: (3*12)+(7*1)+(16)=36+7+16=59. No.

C2H5O2: (2*12)+(5*1)+(32)=24+5+32=61. No.

C4H9O: (4*12)+(9)+(16)=48+9+16=73. No.

Wait, maybe it's just CH2O: 12+2+16=30. No.

Alternatively, C3H5O2: (3*12)+(5*1)+(32)=36+5+32=73. No.

Hmm, this isn't working. Let me think differently. Maybe the fragment is a result of the ester group breaking. For example, if the compound is an ester, the ester could cleave into an acid and an alcohol. But in that case, the fragments would be the acid and the alcohol. The alcohol would have a lower mass.

Wait, if the compound is an ester like RCOOR', then upon fragmentation, it could break into RCOO+ and R''. The RCOO+ part would have a molecular weight of RCOO, which could be 45. Let's see: R would have to be such that RCOO is 45. RCOO would be (R's molecular weight) + (COO's weight, which is 44). So R would have to be a group with molecular weight 1 (which is impossible). So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester breaks into R'OH and RCOO+. R'OH would have a certain mass. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is the loss of a larger group. For example, the molecule could lose a part, leaving a smaller fragment. Let's say the molecular formula is C6H10O2. If it loses a C3H6O2 group, the remaining would be C3H4O. The molecular weight of C3H4O is (3*12)+(4*1)+(16)=36+4+16=56. That's not 45. Alternatively, losing C4H8O2: (4*12)+(8)+(32)=48+8+32=88. 114-88=26, which is CH2CH2, not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe I should think of the possible molecular ions. Let me think of the possible options again.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight 114. So the possible fragments are 45 and 69. What 45 could be? Maybe a (CH3)2C=O+ ion, which is 58, but that's not 45.

Wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHO, which is 58. Hmm. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CH-O group. Let me calculate that. CH2=CH-O is (12*2)+(2*1) +16=24+2+16=42. Close to 45, but not quite. Alternatively, CH2=CH-OH would be 45: (12*2)+(2*1)+(1)+(16)=24+2+1+16=43. No.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is CH2=CH-CO, which is 57. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the fragment is an ethyl group with some oxygen. CH2CH2O is 44. Close to 45 but not exact.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a propyl group with an O. (CH2)3O is 12*3 + 3 +16=36+3+16=55. No.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere with this. Maybe I should focus back on the other data.

The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. The IR has a carbonyl and an O-H. So the formula must have at least two O's (since a carboxylic acid has two O's in the COOH group). So options are C and A (since they have two O's).

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU is 1. So one degree: either a ring or a double bond. But the NMR has a double bond, so that's one DoU, which fits. But the IR has a carbonyl, which is another DoU. So that's two DoU, but the formula only allows one. So that's a problem. So option A is probably not correct.

So the correct formula must be option C: C6H10O2. Because it has two DoU, matching the two (carbonyl and double bond). So that's the likely option.

Now, the mass spec fragment at 45. Maybe it's from a different part. Let me think of the structure. Suppose the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. The molecular formula is C6H10O2. Upon fragmentation, perhaps it loses the CH2CH2COOH group (molecular weight 72), leaving the CH2=CH part, which would be 28, but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe it loses the COOH and some other groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but earlier I thought that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted ester with a double bond.

Wait, another idea: the fragment m/z 45 could be the result of the loss of the methyl group from an ester. For example, if the ester is an ethyl ester, losing the ethyl group (molecular weight 46) would leave the rest. But then the fragment would be 114-46=68, not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is a methyl ester. Losing the methyl (15) would leave 99, which isn't 45.

Hmm.

Alternatively, the fragment could be from the cleavage of the ester group into an acid and an alcohol. For example, if the ester is RCOOR', upon cleavage, it forms RCOO+ and R'OH. The RCOO+ would have a molecular weight of (R's molecular weight) +44. If the RCOO+ is 45, then R would be 1 (which is impossible), so that doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is not from the main ester group but from another part. Maybe a smaller group within the molecule breaks off. For example, if the molecule has a side chain that can fragment, like a propyl group attached to an oxygen. But I'm not sure.

In any case, considering the other data (FTIR, NMR), the most likely formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. Here's the analysis:

### FTIR Data:
- A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- Strong absorption peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated system (e.g., a double bond or conjugated carbonyl).

### 1H NMR Data:
- Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond in the structure.

### Mass Spectrometry Data:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests a smaller fragment with a molecular weight of 45.

### Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):
The degrees of unsaturation were calculated for each molecular formula:
- **C₆H₁₂O**: DoU = 1 (one ring or double bond).
- **C₆H₁₀O**: DoU = 2 (two rings, double bonds, or a combination).
- **C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 2 (two rings, double bonds, or a combination).
- **C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 1 (one ring or double bond).

### Analysis of Options:
1. **C₆H₁₂O**:
   - DoU = 1, which is insufficient to account for both the carbonyl group and the double bond indicated by the IR and NMR data.
   - **Eliminated**.

2. **C₆H₁₀O**:
   - DoU = 2, which could account for both the carbonyl group and the double bond.
   - However, the compound must have two oxygen atoms (from the O-H and carbonyl groups in the IR data), which this formula lacks.
   - **Eliminated**.

3. **C₆H₁₀O₂**:
   - DoU = 2, which matches the two degrees of unsaturation required (one for the carbonyl group and one for the double bond).
   - The two oxygen atoms fit the O-H and carbonyl groups observed in the IR data.
   - The NMR data aligns with the presence of a double bond and vinyl hydrogens.
   - The fragment peak at **m/z = 45** could correspond to a smaller fragment, such as a CH₃CO group or similar.
   - **Most likely candidate**.

4. **C₆H₁₂O₂**:
   - DoU = 1, which is insufficient to account for both the carbonyl group and the double bond.
   - **Eliminated**.

### Conclusion:
The compound most consistent with the spectroscopic data is **C₆H₁₀O₂**, as it satisfies the IR, NMR, and mass spectrometry data, as well as the degrees of unsaturation.

**Answer: C**
