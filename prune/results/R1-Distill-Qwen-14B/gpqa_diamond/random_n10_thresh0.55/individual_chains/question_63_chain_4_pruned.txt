Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that the non-rigid rotor model is an extension of the rigid rotor model, considering that the bond length isn't completely fixed. But wait, the question is about the fundamental state and the next state with the lowest energy. So maybe it's about transitions in the rotational or vibrational states.

The problem gives me the masses of two atoms, X and Y. Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. Oh right, amu is atomic mass units. I think 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So I should probably convert those masses to kilograms. Let me calculate that. Mx would be 20 * 1.66e-27 = approx 3.32e-26 kg. My is 2 * 1.66e-27 = 3.32e-27 kg. Wait, but maybe the problem doesn't require me to calculate the mass of the molecule right now. Let's see what else is given.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. Oh, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R is 2e-10 m. The angular frequency of vibration is 4e14 rad/s. Oh, so that's the vibrational part. Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy when absorbing a photon. So in the quantum model, the molecule can change either vibrational or rotational states.

The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state with the lowest energy would be the next vibrational state (v=1) or the next rotational state (rotational quantum number increases). But wait, the problem is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition requires less energy? Vibrational transitions are usually higher in energy than rotational ones because the vibrational energy levels have larger spacing.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number. The spacing between J and J+1 increases as J increases. The first rotational state is J=1, but maybe the ground state is J=0. Hmm, but the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the state of lowest energy, which in the rotation-vibration model
