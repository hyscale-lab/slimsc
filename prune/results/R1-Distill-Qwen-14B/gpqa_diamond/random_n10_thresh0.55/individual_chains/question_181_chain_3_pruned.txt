Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux ratio question. Let me start by understanding what's being asked. The question is about the Sun's neutrino production, specifically looking at two energy bands. They've stopped the pp-III branch reactions in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago, and I need to find the ratio of fluxes between band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV).

Wait, wait. I remember that neutrinos are produced through various processes in the Sun. The main ones are the proton-proton (pp) chains. Oh right, there are different branches of the pp chain. The pp-I branch is the dominant one, I think, which produces a lot of CNO cycle elements and eventually helium. Then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches, which are less significant. 

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped. All other reactions remain as they were. Hmm, what does the pp-III branch contribute? I think the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, maybe in the higher energy ranges. Like, maybe around 1 MeV or so. Because the pp-I and pp-II branches produce lower-energy neutrinos, right? Oh wait, wait. Let me think: the pp-III branch is one of the later steps in the proton-proton chains. It involves something like the fusion of a helium-3 and a helium-4 nucleus, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe the main point is that the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos
