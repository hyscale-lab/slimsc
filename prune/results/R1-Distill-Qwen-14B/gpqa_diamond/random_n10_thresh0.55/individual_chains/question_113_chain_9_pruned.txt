Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying hydrogens and oxygen counts. Hmm, I think I need to go through each piece of data given and see what they tell me.

Alright, the first clue is the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in FTIR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretching. But wait, the peak is at 3000, which is more like the range for O-H. O-H in alcohols or carboxylic acids, maybe. But I remember that a very broad peak could be from an alcohol or perhaps a carbonyl group's O-H, like in a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait, the question also mentions two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups. 1700 is typical for a ketone or maybe an ester. The 1650 might be an aromatic C=O or an amide, but since there's no N mentioned, maybe it's something else. Wait, maybe conjugated carbonyl groups? Like a carbonyl and a double bond nearby? Or maybe a conjugated ester or something.

Wait, but the two peaks might be from different functional groups. If there's a strong peak at 1700, that's probably a carb
