Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction uses the product from the first and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, wait, no, looking again. The product of the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, but the second starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Oh, right, maybe that's a typo but regardless, the reagents are what's important.

So, first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Second reaction: the product of the first (but with a different substituent, perhaps a benzyl group) reacts with reagent B (which is H2O) to form a carboxylic acid.

Wait, the second part says that the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) has been converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. The typical hydrolysis of nitriles can produce either amides or carboxylic acids, depending on the conditions. For example, acidic hydrolysis with strong acid and water can convert nitriles to carboxylic acids, but I think sometimes other reagents are involved.

Wait, but in the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about what that reaction is. Butan-2-one is a ketone. Reacting a ketone with NaCN... Oh, wait, in the presence of an acid catalyst, ketones can undergo a nucleophilic addition. So, maybe that's a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the carbonyl group.

But wait, when a ket
