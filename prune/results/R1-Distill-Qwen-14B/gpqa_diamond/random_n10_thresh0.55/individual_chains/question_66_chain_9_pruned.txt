Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these.

First, let me recall what each symmetry means. Lorentz symmetry has to do with how the laws of physics look the same in all inertial frames. Poincare symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translations in space and time, so it's a bigger symmetry group including Lorentz and translational symmetries.

Wait, but don't all theories in physics respect Poincare symmetry? Because it's about the invariance under the Poincare group, which includes rotations, boosts, translations. So if a theory doesn't respect Poincare, it's probably not a valid one. But wait, SMEFT is an effective theory. I think that effective theories still have to respect the symmetries of the underlying theory, which for the Standard Model would include Lorentz and Poincare.

So, operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry because the SM does, and thus the effective theory maintains that. But what about Poincare? Since Poincare includes translations, does SMEFT include that? Well, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's built with operators of higher dimensions. These operators are constructed to be Lorentz invariant. But P
