Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos and the Sun's reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. All other reactions are as usual. I need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux1/flux2.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. There are different branches, I think. The pp-I and pp-II are the main ones. Oh wait, pp-III is a higher energy branch involving heavier elements, maybe carbon or nitrogen. Oh, right, the pp-III branch involves the 3Î± process (like the CNO cycle?), but wait, no, CNO is a different thing. Or wait, maybe I'm confusing it. Let me get this straight.

Wait, the proton-proton chain steps: in the pp-I branch, two protons collide, form a deuteron, a positron, and a neutrino. That's the first step. Then, for the pp-II branch, the deuteron fuses with another proton to make tritium, then that fuses into helium-3. The pp-III branch probably involves the fusion of helium-3 into helium-4, right? Because that's part of the CNO cycle? Or perhaps that's a separate process.

Wait, no. The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain. The main proton-proton chain produces helium-4 via two helium-3 nuclei combining. So, in the pp-III branch, after creating two helium-3 nuclei, they combine into helium-4, releasing two protons. This process produces a lot of neutrinos, right? Because each step in the proton-proton chain emits neutrinos, especially the first one.

Wait, the first step in the proton-proton chain is a proton and proton colliding to form a deuteron, which is a proton and neutron bound together, but it's unstable. It emits a positron and a neutrino. So each of these steps emits a neutrino. But wait, in the pp-III branch, the main neutrino emission is from the first step. Because the other steps in the pp chain (like the deuterium capturing a proton to form trit
