Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to find the right reagents for each. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different reagents for A and B.

First reaction: butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile treated with reagent B (which is H2O) gives 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I think I should tackle each reaction separately, then see which options match.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. Then, it's reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, what's that product? Let me think. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)-CN. So, butanenitrile has four carbons, but here it's attached to the nitrile. So the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group and two methyl groups. So, perhaps it's an example of a nucleophilic addition to a ketone.

Butan-2-one is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with a nitrile source, like NaCN, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism typically involves the nitrile acting as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon.

But wait, in acid conditions, the carbonyl is activated. So NaCN might not be enough. Maybe we need an acid catalyst for the addition.

Wait, I remember that for the addition of HCN to ketones, you usually use an acid catalyst. So for the nucleophilic addition, reagent A could be an acid, like H3O+ (which is H+ from H3O+). So that would be option A or B, since both A and B have H3O+ for A.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the reaction is a substitution. But the product here seems to have both the hydroxyl and the nitrile on the same carbon, which would suggest that the nitrile group is added to the carbonyl group.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that this is a cyanohydrin formation. Oh, right! Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone reacts with cyanide ion in the presence of an acid catalyst. The reaction adds a cyanide and a hydroxide (or water) to the carbonyl, forming a geminal diol but with one of them being a nitrile.

Wait, but in this case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's the cyanohydrin. So yeah, the reagent A would be an acid catalyst. So H3O+ is a common acid catalyst. So that would make A as H3O+.

So in the options, for part A, which is the first reagent, options A and B have H3O+.

Now the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen? Typically, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to form carboxylic acids.

Wait, but the reaction conditions here are reagent B in H2O. So the reagent B is probably an acid or a base. Let me think about the hydrolysis of nitriles.
