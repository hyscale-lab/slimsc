Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with bosons and fermions. The question gives me a Lagrangian, which I think describes the interaction between the bosonic field X and some fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find out what particles it can decay into at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that doesn't look quite right. Maybe I should parse it again. Oh, perhaps it's written as L = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. No, wait, the way it's written is a bit confusing. Oh, maybe it's something like L = -λ f (ψ_f)^dagger (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, perhaps it's more like L = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Because in the standard Yukawa interaction, it's like that, where the boson couples to the fermion and its Dirac conjugate.

So the interaction term would involve the field X coupling to fermions. Now, for the decay of X, since X is a boson, it can decay into pairs of fermions. But which fermions can it decay into?

The key thing for kinematically allowed decays is that the mass of the boson must be greater than or equal to twice the mass of the fermion
