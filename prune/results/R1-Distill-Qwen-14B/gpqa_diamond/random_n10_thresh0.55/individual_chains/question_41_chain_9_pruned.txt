Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I know.

The question says a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. Oh, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1, so we can use that as a reference.

Wait, I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium as observed from another frame isn't just the same as the medium's speed plus the light's speed. Because light's speed in a medium is already lower than c, right? So I think this has to do with the addition of velocities, but not the simple vector addition. Oh, relativity maybe?

Wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v' = c/n, since the index of refraction n = c/v', so v' = c/n. Now, we need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame where the glass is moving.

So this is a Doppler effect problem, but not the usual Doppler shift for frequency. Wait, no, Doppler shift is about the change in frequency or wavelength when the source is moving relative to the observer. But here, the medium is moving, not the source or the observer. Hmm, maybe it's
