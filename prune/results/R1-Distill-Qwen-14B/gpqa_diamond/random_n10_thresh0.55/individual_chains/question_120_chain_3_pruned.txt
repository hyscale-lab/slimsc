Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think through this.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer the star, the larger the parallax. So, parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance. Like, plx = 1/distance, right? Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh right, plx in arcseconds is 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So a star at 1 parsec has a parallax of 1 arcsecond. 

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. So if I imagine the galaxy or universe as a big sphere, stars are spread out uniformly in all directions. Now, how does the number of stars per unit parallax range depend on plx?

Hmm, I think I remember something about flux or density in shells. Let me think about density as a function of distance. If the number density of stars is uniform (so same number per cubic parsec), then the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr would be the surface area of the shell times the thickness times the number density. 

Wait, the surface area is 4πr², and the volume of the shell is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πr² dr, where n is the number density per unit volume.

But parallax plx is 1/r. So r = 1/plx. So substituting r into the equation, the number of stars in a shell would be n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr. But wait, we're considering the number per unit range of parallax, so the question is how many stars are in a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx. 

Wait, let's think about dN, the number of stars in a small change in plx. Since plx = 1/r, then dr = - (1/r²) dplx. Because if plx increases, r decreases, so dr is negative. But when considering a small change, the magnitude is dr = (1/(r²)) dplx. Wait, actually, plx = 1/r → r = 1/plx. So dr = (d(1/pl
