Okay, let's try to figure out this physics problem. So the question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects how light travels through it. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact principles here.

So the setup is a light beam going through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the beam is going through the glass which is moving forward. How does that affect the observed speed of light?

I remember that in special relativity, the speed of light in a medium isn't just c/n because the medium's motion affects things. Or is that only when the medium is moving relative to the light's direction? Wait, no, in classical physics, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but that's in the rest frame of the medium. But when the medium is moving, how does that combine?

Wait, but wait, according to Einstein's theory, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But this is in a medium, so maybe it's different. Oh wait, but the problem states that the speed of light in the glass is n times slower than in vacuum. So when the glass is moving, does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because the glass is moving at velocity
