Okay, so I have this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergencesâ€”those are like infinities that pop up in calculations, making the math messy. So regularization helps make those infinities manageable so you can calculate meaningful results.

Wait, but not all theories require regularization. Let's think about each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, that's the non-quantum version. So in classical theories, do we have issues with divergences? Well, in electromagnetism, when you calculate things like the energy of a charge distribution, sometimes you get infinite terms. Like, the self-energy of a point charge is problematic because you get an infinite charge density. But in classical E&M, I don't think they use regularization because it's not a quantum theory. Instead, maybe they just accept the infinities or find a way around them with different models, like considering particles with a finite size.

But wait, the question is about theories that "never require regularization." So if a theory is free of divergences, it doesn't need regularization. Which theories are like that?

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory. I remember hearing that QED is a renormalizable theory. Renormalization is a process that deals with the infinities by absorbing them into physical parameters like mass and charge. But renormalization isn't exactly the same as regularization, though they're related. Regularization is a step in the renormalization process, used to make the calculations finite so you can renormalize. So QED does require regularization because it has divergences.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong force. It's also a quantum field theory, and I know it's non-abelian and uses things like asymptotic freedom. But like QED, it has its own issues with divergences. So it would require regularization as part of handling these infinities.

Superstring Theory... Hmm. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory that doesn't require renormalization because it's a theory of extended objects (strings) rather than point particles. In string theory, the interactions are different, and calculations don't produce the same kind of divergences. Or wait, does it still need some kind of regularization? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Some sources say that string theory is finite, meaning it doesn't have the same divergences, so it might not require regularization. But I'm not 100% sure.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So if a theory inherently doesn't produce infinities, it wouldn't need regularization. So which of these is that?

Classical Electrodynamics (Option D) doesn't use regularization because it's not a quantum theory. But does it have divergences? Yes, as I thought earlier, but maybe they're handled in a different way, or perhaps the theory doesn't require the same kind of regularization as quantum theories.

Wait, but the question is about theories that never require regularization. So looking for a theory that doesn't have any divergences
