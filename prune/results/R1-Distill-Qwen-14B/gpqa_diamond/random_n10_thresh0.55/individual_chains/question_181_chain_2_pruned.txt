Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and neutrinos are a byproduct of nuclear reactions, especially in the core where fusion happens.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, that's roughly the time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So, if the pp-III stopped, the effect would be noticeable here on Earth after that time. But how does that affect the neutrino flux?

The neutrino flux here depends on the production in the Sun's core. The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? I think the main pp reactions are the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Oh wait, the pp-III branch is one of the steps in the proton-proton cycle, which produces helium. If the pp-III stops, then the production of certain neutrinos would decrease.

Wait, when the pp-III branch stops, which neutrinos are affected? I remember that the dominant neutrinos are the electron neutrinos produced in the proton-proton chain. Specifically, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos via the reaction where two protons combine with a deuteron to form helium-3, but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again. The pp chain has several steps. The initial steps are two protons fusing into deuterium and emitting a posit
