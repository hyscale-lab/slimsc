Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Hmm, wait, I remember that in such models, the energy levels are quantized and depend on both rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state for both rotations and vibrations.

Wait, the question mentions that the molecule is in its fundamental state. So that's the ground state for both rotation and vibration. When it absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next lowest energy state. But wait, what's the next state? Because in the rotation-vibration model, transitions can be either vibrational, rotational, or a combination.

But the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, maybe the next state is the first excited state, which could be a vibrational or a rotational transition. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

In the quantum mechanical model, the energy levels of a diatomic molecule can be described by a combination of vibrational and rotational states. The total energy is the sum of the vibrational energy and the rotational energy.

The fundamental state is the ground state for both vibration and rotation, so that would be the first vibrational level (v=0) and the ground rotational state (which is usually the lowest rotational state, J=
