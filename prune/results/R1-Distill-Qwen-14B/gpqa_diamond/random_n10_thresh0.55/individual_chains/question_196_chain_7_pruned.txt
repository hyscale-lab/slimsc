Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, so in the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. That would be (1/2)mv_max^2 = (1/2)kA^2. Solving for v_max gives sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. Here, it's relativistic, so we have to consider relativistic effects.

In relativity, the kinetic energy is given by the total energy minus the rest mass energy. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of relativistic momentum and energy. The relativistic energy equation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But I'm not sure how that applies here.

Wait, the potential energy of the oscillator is (1/2)kx². But when it's relativistic, the total energy isn't just kinetic plus potential in the same way. Oh, but wait, in relativity, the energy isn't just the sum of kinetic and potential; the kinetic energy is part of the total energy. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the virial theorem, but I'm not sure if that applies here. The virial theorem relates the average kinetic and potential energies, but in the relativistic case, the expressions might be different.

Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic is (1/2)mv². In the non-relativistic case, the average kinetic and potential energies are equal, each being (1/2)kA²/2. But in the relativistic case, maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², but the total energy includes relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, no, perhaps the system's total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all energy is potential. So at maximum displacement x = A, all the energy is potential, E = (1/2)kA².

But wait, that can't be right
