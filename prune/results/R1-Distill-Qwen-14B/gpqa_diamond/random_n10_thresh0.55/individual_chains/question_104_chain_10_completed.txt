Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand everything.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, each with the same mass as our Sun. Each star has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravity. The shift tells us about the star's wobble, which relates to the planet's mass and orbital period.

The problem gives the shifts for each planet. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1?

Hmm. Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is denoted as K. The formula for K depends on various factors. Let me think about the formula.

I think the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²) )^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2π)) ) * ( (P * (1 day in seconds) ) )^(-1/3) )

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Maybe a simpler approach. Oh wait, both planets have the same mass, right? Because the question says both have masses similar to Neptune. So M_p1 = M_p2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the question says both have masses similar to Neptune, so their masses are about the same. So M_p1 ≈ M_p2.

And the stars have the same mass, M_*1 = M_*2 ≈ M_sun.

So, the RV method measures K, which is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. So K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²) )^(1/2) ) ) times (P)^(-1/3) }, or something like that. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the formula as:

K = ( ( (2πG) / (c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )

But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so 1 - e² is 1. So that term goes away.

Also, since M_p is much less than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, which is the same for both stars. So M_*1 = M_*2.

So K is proportional to M_p / (M_*^(2/3)) ) / (P^(1/3)).

Wait, let's see: K = (something) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, no, because the formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) )^(1/2) ) * (1/(2π)) ) * (P)^(-1/3) ) / c, or something like that.

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh, right, I can't actually look it up right now, but I'm trying to think from memory.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ratio K1 and K2.

Since both have the same M_p and M_*, the formula for K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), and directly proportional to M_p and something else that's the same for both planets.

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, so K = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/2) ) * ( (2π / P ) )^(1/3) ) / c

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to set up the ratio.

Let me denote:

K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet 1, K2 for planet 2.

We have K1 proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) P1^(1/3) )

Similarly, K2 proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) P2^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_* are the same for both, the ratio K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Which can be rearranged to (K1 / K2 )^3 = P2 / P1

So, P2 = (K1 / K2 )^3 * P1

Wait, wait. Let me redo the ratio.

K1 = C * (1 / (P1^(1/3)) )

K2 = C * (1 / (P2^(1/3)) )

So, K1/K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) ) 

=> (K1/K2)^3 = P2 / P1

So, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Therefore, the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

But in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstroms, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 is (5/7).

Wait, so P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = (25/49 ) = approximately 0.5102.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the period of planet 2 than planet 1. So the ratio is P2/P1 = approx 0.51, which is about half. So P2 is about half of P1. So the period of planet 2 is shorter than that of planet 1.

Wait, but wait, no, according to the formula.

Wait, wait, the formula I have is:

K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3) )

So, higher K means shorter period. Because K is larger when P is smaller.

So, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K2 > K1. So K2's semi-amplitude is larger. That would mean that P2 is smaller than P1.

So, the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3, which is (5^3)/(7^3) = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet 2 is about 36% the period of planet 1.

Which means, the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1 by a factor of ~0.36. So the question is, how many times longer is planet 2's period compared to planet 1's? Since it's shorter, the factor is less than one. So the ratio is about 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but let me double-check the ratio setup.

Let me think again:

K = (some constants) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So, K1 = C / (P1^(1/3))

K2 = C / (P2^(1/3))

So, K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) )

Which can be written as (P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/K2.

So, (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

So, K1 is 5, K2 is7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So, planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter, about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period. So how many times longer is planet #2's period than #1? It's 0.36 times as long, which is about 0.36 times. So, the orbital period of planet #2 is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's, meaning it's shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity method measures \( K \), which is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \). Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that both planets have the same mass and their host stars have the same mass, the proportionality simplifies to:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. This means planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's period by a factor of ~0.36.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~0.36**
