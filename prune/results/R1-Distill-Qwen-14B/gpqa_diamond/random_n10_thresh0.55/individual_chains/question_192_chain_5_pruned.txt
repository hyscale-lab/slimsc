Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a spherical conductor with a cavity. Let's see what I remember from my studies.

The setup is this: there's a large spherical conductor of radius R, and inside it, there's a smaller spherical cavity. The cavity isn't at the center because the center is separated by a distance s from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Hmm, I remember that when a charge is placed inside a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, this conductor is neutral, so before the charge was placed, the conductor had no charge. Once +q is inside the cavity, the conductor must respond. Oh right, the charges in the conductor will rearrange themselves. 

Wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges should reside on the surface. But since the cavity isn't at the center, the charges inside the conductor might redistribute. So, the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) will have an induced charge. Because the charge +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface must develop an induced charge of -q. But then, the conductor itself is neutral, so the outer surface must have a charge of +q. 

So the conductor's outer surface has charge +q. Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so its distance from the center of the conductor is L, and from the center of the
