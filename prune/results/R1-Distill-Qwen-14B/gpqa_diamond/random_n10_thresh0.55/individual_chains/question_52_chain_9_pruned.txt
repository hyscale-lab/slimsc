Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have dark spots, it affects their overall brightness and temperature. But how does that tie into the ratio of atoms in different energy levels?

First, the problem gives some details. The star has 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, so the spots are cooler regions, right? Because when they cover the surface, the star's average temperature decreases.

The next part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, when there are spots, the ratio is lower than when the star doesn't have spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Wait, the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So the ratio when no spots (R1) is higher than when spots are present (R2). The factor would be R1/R2.

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is determined by their relative energies and the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) )

Here, E_i and E_j are the energies of the two levels, g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy), and k is Boltzmann's constant.

But wait, the transition corresponds to 1448 Å, which is in the visible or near UV range. So, the energy difference between the two levels can be found using the wavelength. The formula E = hc/λ.

Hm, let's compute that. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is ~3e8 m/s. Wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-7 meters.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But maybe it's easier to work in terms of eV. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E ≈ 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV. Wait, that's a big energy difference. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. 1448 Å is 144.8 nm. Because 1 Å is 0.1 nm, so 1448 Å is 144.8 nm. And I know that the energy for a transition is inversely proportional to wavelength. So higher wavelength (lower energy) means lower E. Let me re-calculate.

E = hc/(λ * e), where e is the charge, but maybe it's easier to use a known formula. Alternatively, the energy difference can be calculated using E (eV) ≈ 1240 / λ(nm). Because 1240 eV·nm is a commonly used constant for this purpose.

So λ is 144.8 nm. So E ≈ 1240 / 144.8 ≈ 8.56 eV. Oh, same as before. That's a pretty high energy, but perhaps it's a transition between two high energy levels.

But wait, I'm getting confused.
