Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a muon's operator along an arbitrary direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the operator is P, and it's along a direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators have eigenvalues related to their components. So, the operator here is probably the spin operator since we're dealing with a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle.

So, the components of P are given: Px, Py, Pz. Each is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Let me write them down.

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. So that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]. That's the Pauli Y matrix times ħ/2.

Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. That's the Pauli Z matrix times ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P (which is in an arbitrary direction n in x-z plane) would be a combination of Px, Py, and Pz? Or wait, since the direction is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because it's in x-z, meaning θ is the angle from the z-axis.

Hmm, so the operator P is along n, so P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). But wait, n is in x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, n is a unit vector. So n_x is sinθ (since in spherical coordinates, x = sinθ cosφ, y= sinθ sinφ, z= cosθ. But since n is in x-z, φ=0 or π? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The direction is in x-z, so the angle θ is with the z-axis, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So, P = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z.

Because n_x is sinθ, n
