Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. Alright, I remember from my classes that electric potential energy between charges is important here.

So the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times 1.6×10^-19 coulombs. So each is 3.2×10^-19 C.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system.

Wait, the system's minimum energy. So I think this would relate to bringing all these charges into place and calculating the potential energy. But wait, since the system is isolated, perhaps we're considering the potential energy between all the charges.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are at 2m from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2m away from P, which has the 13th charge.

I think the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But wait, calculating all pairs might be tedious, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, but the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P. So maybe I can calculate the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, and then also the potential energy between each pair of the
