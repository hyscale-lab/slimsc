Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but let's think it through step by step. The question is about a star with spots and how their effect on the star's brightness compares to an exoplanet transiting in front of it. The goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spots do.

First, let me read the problem carefully. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere (so half the star's surface) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So the spots are at 5000K.

The question says that because of the spots, the star's brightness as observed will vary as it rotates, similar to how a planet transiting a star would cause a dip in brightness. But they want to find the exoplanet radius that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

Hmm. So I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to what a planet would cause. Let's break this down.

First, let's think about the star without any spots. If there's an exoplanet transiting in front of it, the dip in brightness (the transit depth) is proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

Now, the spots are on the star's surface. When the star rotates, different spots come into view. Because one hemisphere is spotty, as it rotates, the spots will come into and go out of view from our perspective, causing the observed brightness to vary. But because the spots are cooler, they make the star appear dimmer when they're on the side facing us.

Wait, but in the problem, the star's brightness variation is due to the spots. So the amplitude of this variation is what we need to equate to the transit caused by an exoplanet.

So I think the approach is to calculate the change in brightness due to the spots and set that equal to the change due to the planet, then solve for Rp.

Let me think about how the spots affect the star's brightness. When the star is viewed with spots facing us, the total brightness is less than when the spots are on the far side. The variation in brightness is the difference between the star's normal brightness and when the spots are visible.

The star's normal brightness (without spots) is L = 4πRstar^2 σ Teff^4. But wait, spots are cooler. The total emitted flux from the spots is less than the surrounding areas.

But the key is the change when the spots are on the observed side. The effective area with spots contributes less to the total flux. So perhaps I can model the change in brightness as the difference between the star without spots and the star with spots visible.

Alternatively, considering the star's surface is split into two regions: the spotted hemisphere (which is 20% filled with spots) and the rest. But wait, the star's surface is a sphere, so each hemisphere is half the surface area.

Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So in that hemisphere, 20% of the area is spots, 80% is normal. The other hemisphere is completely normal.

So the total area of the star is 4πR^2. Each hemisphere is 2πR^2. The spotty hemisphere has 0.2 * 2πR^2 area covered by spots, and 0.8 * 2πR^2 as normal. The other hemisphere is entirely normal.

So when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view (as seen from Earth), and then the other hemisphere does. The brightness variation is the difference in flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible versus when it's not.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the hemisphere we see changes over time. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less flux than the surrounding. So the total flux from the star when the spotty side is visible is less than when the non-spotty side is visible.

The change in flux is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux. The amplitude of the variation is half the difference, I think. Wait, when the star has its spotty side facing us, the flux is lower. When the other side is facing, it's normal. So the maximum flux is when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, and the minimum is when the spotty is visible.

The amplitude would be (F_max - F_min) / 2, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the full range is F_max - F_min, but the amplitude is often the peak-to-peak variation. However, in transit curves, the amplitude is typically the half of that, but I might get that wrong. I'll think about it again.

Wait, perhaps I should model the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible and when it's not.

The total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible (F_spotty) is the sum of the flux from the spotty part and the non-spotty part.

The spotty hemisphere has 20% of its area covered by spots. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². The rest is normal. So the flux from the spotty hemisphere is:

Flux_spotty_hemisphere = [ (0.2 * area_spots) * σ T_spot^4 ) + (0.8 * area_spotty_hemisphere) * σ T_eff^4 ) ] 

Wait, no. Each small area element contributes flux based on its temperature. So total flux from the spotty hemisphere is the sum of the flux from the spots and the flux from the non-spotty parts.

But wait, the spots are cooler. So each spot has T_spot = Teff - 1000K = 5000 K.

The spotty hemisphere's contribution is:

flux_spotty = (0.2 * (2π R²)) * σ (5000)^4 + (0.8 * (2π R²)) * σ (6000)^4

Similarly, the non-spotty hemisphere's contribution (when it's facing us) is:

flux_non_spotty = 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

But wait, when the star is rotating, either the spotty or non-spotty hemisphere is facing us. So the total flux when the spotty side is visible is:

F_spotty_total = flux_spotty + flux_non_visible_non_spotted.

Wait, no. Wait, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the non-spotty hemisphere is on the far side and not visible. So the total flux is just the flux_spotty (the spotty hemisphere) plus the flux from the non-spotty hemisphere? No, because the non-spotty hemisphere is on the other side and not visible. Oh no, wait: the star is a sphere. When one hemisphere is visible, the other is not. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is from the spotty hemisphere plus any flux from the non-spotty part of that hemisphere? No, wait. No, each hemisphere is either visible or not. So when the star rotates, the visible hemisphere changes.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star as having two hemispheres: one with spots, the other without. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is from that hemisphere. When the non-spotty is visible, the flux is from that hemisphere.

But in reality, each point on the star's surface emits light, and when the star rotates, the visible part changes. So let's model the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible and when it's not.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux from that hemisphere is:

F_spotty = (Area_spots) * σ T_spot^4 + (Area_spotty_hemisphere - Area_spots) * σ T_eff^4

Wait, but the spotty hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%, so Area_spots = 0.2 * (2π R²) )

So:

F_spotty = (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (5000)^4 + (0.8 * 2π R²) * σ (6000)^4

Similarly, when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_non_spotty = 2π R² * σ (6000)^4

But wait, when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, its flux is 2π R² * σ (6000)^4, because all of it is normal.

So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F_spotty, and when it's not (i.e., the non-spotty is visible), it's F_non_spotty.

The variation in flux, ΔF, is F_non_spotty - F_spotty.

The amplitude of the brightness variation would be (ΔF) / F_non_spotty, I think. Because when the spotty side is visible, the flux is lower, so the change is F_non_spotty - F_spotty.

Wait, no, the maximum flux is F_non_spotty, and the minimum is F_spotty. So the amplitude would be (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / 2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the amplitude could be the peak-to-peak variation, which is F_non_spotty - F_spotty. 

Wait, the problem says the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as that caused by the planet. So the planet's transit would cause a dip in brightness when it passes in front, which is a decrease in flux by (Rp/Rstar)^2. So the amplitude would be (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the flux drops by that amount.

But wait, the star's brightness variation due to the spots is (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty. Because the maximum flux is F_non_spotty, and the minimum is F_spotty. So the amplitude is (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty.

So let's compute F_spotty and F_non_spotty.

First, let's express everything in terms of the star's total flux without any spots. The normal flux per unit area is σ Teff^4. So the total flux from the star without any spots would be F0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the star is viewed with the non-spotty hemisphere, F_non_spotty = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the star is viewed with the spotty hemisphere, F_spotty is:

F_spotty = (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (5000)^4 + (0.8 * 2π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

Let me compute these terms.

Compute F_non_spotty:

F_non_spotty = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

Compute F_spotty:

F_spotty = (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (5000)^4 + (0.8 * 2π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

Let's factor out 2 π R² σ:

F_spotty = 2 π R² σ [ 0.2 (5000/6000)^4 * (6000^4) + 0.8 (6000^4) ) ]

Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, factor 2 π R² σ (6000)^4:

F_spotty = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4 [ 0.2 * (5000/6000)^4 + 0.8 * 1 ]

Because 5000^4 = (5000/6000) * 6000^4.

So let's compute the terms inside:

(5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4. Let me compute that:

5^4 = 625, 6^4=1296. So 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 0.2 * 0.482253 ≈ 0.09645.

0.8 * 1 = 0.8.

Adding those gives 0.09645 + 0.8 = 0.89645.

So F_spotty = F_non_spotty * 0.89645.

Because F_non_spotty is 2 π R² σ (6000)^4, and F_spotty is that multiplied by 0.89645.

So F_spotty = 0.89645 * F_non_spotty.

Therefore, the change in flux when the spotty side is visible is F_non_spotty - F_spotty = F_non_spotty - 0.89645 F_non_spotty = (1 - 0.89645) F_non_spotty = 0.10355 F_non_spotty.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is this change divided by F_non_spotty, which gives 0.10355, or about 10.355% variation.

Wait, but wait. The amplitude when the star's brightness varies from max to min, the dip is from F_non_spotty to F_spotty. So the dip is (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty = 0.10355, which is about 10.355% decrease in brightness.

But wait, when modeling the exoplanet transit, the change in brightness is (Rp/Rstar)^2. Because the planet blocks a part of the star's light. So the dip in brightness is (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2), which is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So in the problem, the dip caused by the spots is about 10.355%, and the dip caused by the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2. We need to set them equal.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355.

Taking the square root, Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, that would be approximately 0.32, which is option D. But wait, the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

So D is ~0.32, which would be the answer.

But wait, wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because in the exoplanet transit, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. But wait, in the case of the spots, the dip is 0.10355, which is approximately 10.355%. So the square root of that is about 0.3218, so Rp/Rstar is about 0.32, which is option D.

But wait another thing. The star's effective temperature is given, but the spots are cooler. When modeling the brightness variation, does the star's overall flux change? Let me double-check the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the fraction of the star's surface that is cooler and how that affects the total flux. Another approach is to compute the equivalent blackbody flux.

Wait, the flux from the star without spots is F0 = sigma Teff^4. The total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F_spotty = (1 - 0.2) * sigma Teff^4 + 0.2 sigma (Teff - 1000)^4, because 20% of the hemisphere is covered in spots, which are 1000K cooler.

Wait, but no, that's not quite right. Because when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is from the entire visible hemisphere. So 20% of the visible hemisphere is spots, 80% is normal.

So perhaps the correct way is:

Flux when spotty hemisphere is visible:

F = (0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) * (sigma * 2 pi R^2) / (4 pi R^2) * 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 ?

Wait, maybe an alternative approach is better. Let’s compute the ratio of the fluxes.

The total flux when the spotty side is visible is F_spotty = (0.8 * T_eff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) * (pi R^2) * sigma.

Wait, no. The entire star emits 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4. But when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux we receive is (area_visible) * sigma * T^4. The area_visible is 2 pi R^2.

But the T varies across the visible hemisphere. 20% of the visible area is at T_spot and 80% at T_eff.

So F_spotty = [ 0.8 * (2 pi R^2) * sigma T_eff^4 + 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) * sigma T_spot^4 ] / (4 pi R^2) ) * 4 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 ?

No, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think in terms of the fraction of the star's surface.

The star's total flux is F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotty = 2 pi R^2 [0.8 sigma Teff^4 + 0.2 sigma (T_spot)^4 ].

The factor 2 pi R^2 is the area of the hemisphere. The 0.8 and 0.2 are the fractions of that area with normal and spot temperatures.

So F_spotty = 2 pi R^2 sigma [ 0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4 ].

The flux when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible is F_non_spotty = 2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

So the difference in flux is F_non_spotty - F_spotty = 2 pi R^2 sigma [ Teff^4 - (0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) ) ].

Simplify inside:

= 2 pi R^2 sigma [ 0.2 Teff^4 - 0.2 T_spot^4 ].

= 2 pi R^2 sigma * 0.2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

So the change in flux is this value.

The amplitude of the brightness variation would be this change divided by the normal flux when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, which is F_non_spotty.

So amplitude A = (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty.

Let me compute this.

F_non_spotty = 2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

Change = 2 pi R^2 sigma * 0.2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

So,

A = [ 2 pi R^2 sigma * 0.2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 ]

Simplify:

A = 0.2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

= 0.2 [ 1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 ].

Substituting Teff = 6000 K, T_spot = 5000 K.

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 = 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So,

A = 0.2 [ 1 - 0.482253 ] = 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

So the amplitude is about 10.355% of the star's flux.

Now, the exoplanet's transit would cause a dip in brightness equal to (Rp/Rstar)^2. So we set this equal to A.

(Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

So the radius ratio is approximately 0.32, which is option D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere, we analyze the problem as follows:

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature of 5000 K. The brightness variation caused by the spots arises from the difference in flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible versus when it is not.

### Step 1: Flux from the Spotty Hemisphere
The flux from the spotty hemisphere is calculated as:
\[
F_{\text{spotty}} = 2 \pi R^2 \sigma \left[ 0.8 \cdot (6000)^4 + 0.2 \cdot (5000)^4 \right]
\]
where \( 0.8 \) and \( 0.2 \) represent the fractions of the hemisphere covered by normal and spotted areas, respectively.

### Step 2: Flux from the Non-Spotty Hemisphere
The flux from the non-spotty hemisphere is:
\[
F_{\text{non-spotty}} = 2 \pi R^2 \sigma (6000)^4
\]

### Step 3: Brightness Variation
The change in flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:
\[
\Delta F = F_{\text{non-spotty}} - F_{\text{spotty}}
\]
Substituting the expressions for \( F_{\text{spotty}} \) and \( F_{\text{non-spotty}} \):
\[
\Delta F = 2 \pi R^2 \sigma \left[ (6000)^4 - \left( 0.8 \cdot (6000)^4 + 0.2 \cdot (5000)^4 \right) \right]
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\Delta F = 2 \pi R^2 \sigma \cdot 0.2 \cdot \left[ (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 \right]
\]

The amplitude of the brightness variation is the fractional change in flux:
\[
A = \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotty}}}
\]
Substituting \( F_{\text{non-spotty}} = 2 \pi R^2 \sigma (6000)^4 \):
\[
A = 0.2 \cdot \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right]
\]

### Step 4: Compute the Amplitude
The temperature ratio is \( \frac{5000}{6000} = \frac{5}{6} \), and \( \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.482253 \). Substituting:
\[
A = 0.2 \cdot \left[ 1 - 0.482253 \right] = 0.2 \cdot 0.517747 \approx 0.10355
\]
Thus, the amplitude of the brightness variation is approximately \( 10.355\% \).

### Step 5: Compare to Exoplanet Transit
The brightness variation caused by an exoplanet transiting the star is proportional to \( \left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \). Setting this equal to the amplitude \( A \):
\[
\left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
\]

### Final Answer
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
