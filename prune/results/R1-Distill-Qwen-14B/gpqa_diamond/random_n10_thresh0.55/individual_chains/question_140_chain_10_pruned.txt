Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see, the question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, and when a precipitate G is formed, heating it gives B, whose melting point is near 277 K. Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to give a product with two oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out what Substance X is. The clue says it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog. So, reagents in organic chemistry... common ones are like H2SO4, NaOH, maybe NH3. Wait, but which one has isotopes? Maybe something like H2O? Or something else.

Wait, what about potassium permanganate? No, that's KMnO4. Or maybe it's something like sodium or potassium. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a heavier isotope of hydrogen, like deuterium. But then what's the substance? Maybe it's something like D2O, heavy water. But would that fit the reaction?

Wait, the reaction releases gas W where the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So, if W is a molecule, like maybe H2O? No, because H2O has H (1 proton, 0 neutrons) and O (8 protons, 16 neutrons). Wait, but the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So, maybe something like CH4? No, that's four H (each 1p, 0n) and C (6p, 6n). Wait CH4: each molecule would have 4 H atoms, so 4*(1p+0n)=4p and 6n for C. Total would be 4+6=10 p and 6n. No, that's not same.

Wait, maybe it's CO2? No, CO2: C (6p,6n), O (8p,8n). Each molecule would have 6+16=22p, and 6+16=22n. Oh wait, that's 22 each. So same number? Yes!
