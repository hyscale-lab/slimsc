Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to choose the right reagent A and catalyst B from the given options.

Hmm, first, let's visualize the structures. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring amine, with a methyl group on the third carbon. The product looks like the pyrrolidine ring has a substituent at position 1, which is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. Wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl would be a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group, right? So it's like the pyrrolidine has a substituent that's a cyclohexene connected by CH₂.

Wait, 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine. So the substituent is a CH₂ connected to a cyclohexene ring. So the structure is pyrrolidine with a CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂? No, wait—cyclohexylidene would be a cyclohexene (a six-membered ring with a double bond) attached via a methylene (CH₂) group. So the substituent is CH₂-Cyclohexene.

So the reaction is taking 3-methylpyrrolidine and reacting it with compound A under acid catalysis to form this product. What kind of reaction forms such a substituent?

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine. Under acid catalysis, amines can undergo various reactions. One possibility is forming an imine, but that usually requires a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe an alkylation or some kind of addition.

Wait, another possibility is that the amine is acting as a nucleophile. In acid conditions, the amine would get protonated, making it a better leaving group? Or maybe the amine could attack an electrophilic species.

Looking at the product, the substituent is a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group. So the structure suggests that the pyrrolidine's nitrogen is connected to a CH₂ group,
