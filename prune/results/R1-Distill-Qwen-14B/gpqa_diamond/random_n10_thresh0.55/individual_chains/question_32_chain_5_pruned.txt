Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons, which I think means it's lithium-6 because lithium has 3 protons and 3 neutrons make it Li-6. So the mass number A is 6.

Wait, I remember that the energy in particle accelerators is often given as the kinetic energy or the total energy. But RHIC colliders typically accelerate heavy ions to relativistic speeds, so the energy mentioned here is probably the total energy, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

The formula for the total energy (E) of a particle is E = gamma * m_0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh right, because when the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, you can't ignore relativistic effects.

So first, I need to compute gamma. The speed v is 0.96c. Let me calculate gamma.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) 

v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Take the square root: sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

Wait, wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Let me double-check that calculation. 1 divided by 0.28 equals 3.57142857... So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass of the nucleus X, which is Li-6. The mass of a single Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.660539 ×10^-27 kg. The mass of Li-6 can be found using the periodic table. The atomic weight is about 6.941 g/mol. Wait, but the exact value might require using the mass defect or standard tables, but maybe in particle physics, the mass is often given in MeV/c². Alternatively, the problem expects me to know the mass number, perhaps using the nuclear mass as approximately A * u, but I might need to look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the mass in terms of u, then convert to energy using E = m c². But I'm not sure about the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of a proton and neutron to compute the mass of Li-6.

Wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So total mass would be
