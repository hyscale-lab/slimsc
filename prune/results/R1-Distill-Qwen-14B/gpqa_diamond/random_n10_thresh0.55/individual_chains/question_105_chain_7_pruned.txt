Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

Okay, the question is about a star similar to the Sun, with some dark spots on one hemisphere. The problem talks about photometric observations showing brightness variations, and how this could resemble the presence of an exoplanet. The goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as these spots.

Hmm, right. So the star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar is about the same as R_sun. The spots have a filling factor of 20%, which probably means that 20% of the star's surface is covered by these dark spots. Each spot is cooler, with a temp difference of 1000K. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, so the spots are at 5000K.

Wait, the problem says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So I think the idea is that the dip in brightness when the planet transits (blocks some light) is similar to the dip due to the spots rotating in and out of view.

So, the dip in brightness, or the amplitude of the light curve, depends on the area blocked. For a planet transit, the amplitude is roughly (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is the area of the planet's disk relative to the star's disk.

But in this case, the star has spots. Let's model this. The star's brightness with spots would vary as the spots rotate into and out of view. Since it's only one hemisphere with spots, and the other is normal, when the spotted side is facing us, the star's brightness drops a bit, and when it's the other side, it's normal.

Wait, no. Wait, the star is rotating, so the spots come into view as the star rotates. The problem says that it's only one hemisphere, so as the star rotates, the spots on that hemisphere would come into view for part of the rotation period.

But for the purpose of the light curve's amplitude, perhaps we can model the maximum dip caused by the spots. Since the spots are cooler, the total light output when the spots are visible would be less than when the unspotted side is visible.

Wait, no. The star's brightness is normally when all areas are at 6000K. The spots are at 5000K. So when the spots are on the hemisphere facing us, the total flux would be lower. So the variation in brightness is due to the change in the area of the spots being visible as the star rotates.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20%, meaning 20% of the star's surface is covered by spots. So the total flux from the star when the spots are visible would be lower than when they're not. So the change in brightness (the amplitude) would be proportional to the difference in flux caused by the spots.

So, the star without spots would have a certain flux. When the spots are on the side we see, the flux is lower. So the difference is the amplitude.

Now, the question is: what's the equivalent planet radius that would cause the same amplitude.

So I need to calculate
