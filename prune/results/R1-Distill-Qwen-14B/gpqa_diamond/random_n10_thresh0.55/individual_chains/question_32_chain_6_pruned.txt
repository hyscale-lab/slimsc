Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so the nucleus in question here must be a heavy one. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6 because the atomic number is 3 (protons) and 3 neutrons make 6 nucleons in total. So the mass number A is 6.

Now, the question is about finding the energy of the RHIC. Oh wait, RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy, and we're to find the kinetic energy given that the speed is 0.96c. Alternatively, maybe it's the total energy, but I think in particle physics, when they say energy for accelerators, it's usually the kinetic energy. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should proceed and see.

The speed is given as 0.96c. So v = 0.96c. I need to find the energy of the nucleus. Since this is a relativistic problem, I should use the relativistic equations. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy, right? And the kinetic energy K is E - m c².

So, the steps I should take are:

1. Calculate the gamma factor for v = 0.96c.
2. Find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus.
3. Multiply gamma by the rest mass energy to get the total energy.
4. If the question asks for kinetic energy, subtract the rest mass energy from the total. But wait, what's the actual question? The question says, "what is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" Hmm, in accelerators, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I need to clarify this.

Wait, I think in the context of colliders, the energy specified is the kinetic energy per particle. So probably, the question is asking for the kinetic energy. So I need to calculate the kinetic energy, which is (gamma - 1) * m c².

But let's make sure. Let me outline the steps.

First,
