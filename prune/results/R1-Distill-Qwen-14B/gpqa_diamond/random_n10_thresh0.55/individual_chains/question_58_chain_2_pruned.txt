Okay, so I have this question about which physical theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my theories, but let me think through it.

First, I'll try to remember what regularization is. From what I recall, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergent integrals or infinities that pop up when you calculate things like loop diagrams. It helps make the theory mathematically consistent by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle these infinities. But not all theories might need this, especially if they're free of such divergences naturally.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory deals with everything at a higher level, like strings vibrating instead of point particles. I remember that in string theory, the fundamental objects are strings, and they might have a natural cutoff scale because of the string length. So maybe superstring theory doesn't need regularization because the theory is already finite or has a way to handle high energies without the usual divergences?

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), QCD becomes weakly interacting because of asymptotic freedom. Wait, but does it require regularization? I think QCD calculations often involve dealing with things like renormalization. But maybe regularization is still needed because of loop divergences. Unless it's an abelian theory, but QCD is non-abelian, so probably needs regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED has divergences, especially in calculations like the electron self-energy or photon vacuum polarization. These require regularization techniques like introducing a cutoff or using dimensional regularization. So QED definitely needs regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't usually have these kinds of divergences because they're not quantized. Classical ED deals with fields and Maxwell's equations, which are smooth and don't have the same issues as quantum theories. So classical theories don't require regularization because they don't have the same infinities from quantum loops or renormalization issues.

Wait, but the question is about high energies. In quantum theories, high energies can lead to issues like Landau poles or other divergences. But classical theories don't have that because they don't account for quantum effects. So the theory that never requires regularization would be the classical one because it doesn't have the
