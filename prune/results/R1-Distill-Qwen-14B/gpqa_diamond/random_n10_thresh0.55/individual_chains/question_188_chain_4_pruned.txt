Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 angstroms. All the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D.

Wait, interatomic distance... Oh right, in a crystal, the interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms, which is the same as the lattice parameter 'a' in a cubic system. But wait, a rhombohedral crystal isn't cubic, right? So the lattice parameter 'a' is the edge length of the rhombohedral unit cell.

Oh wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are all the same, a = b = c, and all angles are equal too. So in this case, a = 10 angstroms, and each angle is 30 degrees. Got it.

Interplanar distance (d) for a given plane (hkl) in a crystal can be found using the formula derived from the Bragg's law, which is:

d = (a * sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2lh cos γ )) ) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)^2 )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing the formula. Let me recall. The more general formula for interplanar distance in
