Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The formula I think is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? Because for a non-relativistic oscillator, potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², and kinetic is (1/2)mv², so setting them equal gives v_max squared equals kA²/m, so v is sqrt(kA²/m).

But wait, this is a relativistic case. Oh right, in relativity, energy isn't just kinetic plus potential; you have to consider the total energy including rest mass energy. So I need to think about the total energy of the oscillator.

The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². But since it's relativistic, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, the total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I think the approach is to equate the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) to the total relativistic energy.

Wait, but in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, is the potential energy still (1/2)kx²? I think so because the problem says it obeys Hooke's law, so F = -kx. So yes, the potential is (1/2)kx².

At maximum displacement, x is A, so the potential energy is (1/2)kA². But the kinetic energy would be zero there, but wait, no—wait, the maximum speed occurs when kinetic energy is maximum, which is when the oscillator passes through the equilibrium position (x=0), right? So actually, the maximum speed isn't at the amplitude, but at the equilibrium point. Wait, no—did I mix that up? Wait, in the non-relativistic case, maximum speed is when all potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. So in the non-relativistic case, when x is zero, all the energy is kinetic, so that's when speed is maximum. So for the maximum speed, the position is x=0, and all the energy is kinetic.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the question is about the maximum speed. So the maximum speed would occur when the potential energy is zero, and the total energy is entirely kinetic. So the total energy
