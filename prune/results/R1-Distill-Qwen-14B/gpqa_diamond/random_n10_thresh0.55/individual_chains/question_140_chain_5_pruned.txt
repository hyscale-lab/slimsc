Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the problem is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y to produce gas W, a precipitate G, and some product B. Hmm. I need to figure out what these substances are based on the clues given.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe X is something that has an isotope with a higher atomic mass, like chlorine maybe? Or perhaps it's an isotope of oxygen or another element. I'll keep that in mind.

The reaction between X and Y is violent and releases gas W. W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of neutrons and protons? So the molecule is made of atoms where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. What elements have that?

Let me think: For example, hydrogen has 1 proton and 1 neutron (in its isotope deuterium), so H2 would have 2H atoms, each with 1 proton and 1 neutron. So the molecule would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule would be equal (2 each). So that fits. So gas W is probably hydrogen gas, H2.

So if W is H2, that suggests that the reaction produces hydrogen gas. So what reaction produces H2 when a substance reacts with another liquid?

Wait, another possibility: Could it be another molecule like D2, but that's just deuterium, which is rare. Alternatively, maybe it's another atom with equal protons and neutrons. For instance, carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, but a molecule would need to have each atom having equal. So, maybe it's CO? No, wait, that's a molecule, but each atom is C and O. Oh wait, O has 8 protons, but if the isotope is O-16, that has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. But the molecule would be O2. So O2 has each O atom with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the molecule would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So the number of neutrons and protons in the molecule would be equal. Oh, that's another possibility.

So W could be O2 or H
