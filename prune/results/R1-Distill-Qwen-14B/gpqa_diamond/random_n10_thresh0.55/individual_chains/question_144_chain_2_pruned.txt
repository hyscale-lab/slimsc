Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all different distances in meters, so I need to figure out how to calculate this.

I remember that the mean decay length depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Decay length L is usually given by L = v * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. But wait, how do I find τ? Oh right, from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the lifetime is related to the width. The uncertainty principle says that Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I think I might have that backwards. Let me think: the energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, so if Γ is the width (which is like the uncertainty in energy), then Δt is roughly τ, so Γ τ ≈ ħ → τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Yeah, that's right.

So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I should check the units. ħ has units of GeV·seconds, right? Because when you compute ħ in terms of GeV, it's approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, no, no, ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So Γ is given in MeV, so I need to convert that to GeV to have consistent units.

Wait, Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ → 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV. Let me calculate that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, no, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32: 0.32 goes into 6.582 about 20.56875 times. So 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the velocity v. How do I find that? I think it's derived from relativistic energy considerations. The total energy E is given by E = γ m c². The particle's rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma γ = E / (m c²) → E is 8 GeV, so γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈6.6667. So γ ≈6.6667.

The velocity v can be found using the relation γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me solve for v. Let me compute β = v/c. 

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) → sqrt(1 - β²) = 1/γ → 1 - β² = 1/(γ²) → β² = 1 - 1/(γ²). 

So β = sqrt(1 - 1/(γ²)). Plugging in γ ≈6.6667: 1/(γ²) is 1/(44.4444)≈0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is approx 0.9887. So β ≈0.9887, which is about 0.989c. So v ≈0.989c.

So velocity is about 0.989 times the speed of light. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

Now, the mean decay length L is v * τ. Let's compute that.

v = 0.989 * 3e8 m/s ≈2.967e8 m/s.

τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So L = v * τ = 2.967e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s. Let me compute that:

2.967e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.967 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 → 6.113 * 1e-1
