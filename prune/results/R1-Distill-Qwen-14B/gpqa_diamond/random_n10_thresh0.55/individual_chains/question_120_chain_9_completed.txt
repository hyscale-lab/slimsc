Okay, so I've got this question about the distribution of stars in the sky and how their number per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, the parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. So plx = 1/distance, which means as distance increases, parallax decreases. Got that.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution probably means that the number density of stars is constant throughout space. So, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the size of that volume.

Wait, they're asking about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (d plx) as plx changes. I need to relate the number of stars to the parallax. Maybe I should think in terms of volume.

Parallax plx is in arcseconds, and distance d is in parsecs. Since d = 1/plx, a small change in plx would correspond to a change in distance. Let me think about the differential.

Taking d = 1/plx, so if plx increases by a small amount dplx, what's the corresponding change in distance? Let's see, differentiating both sides: dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the way to go. Maybe I should think about the number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + dplx.

Each shell at a certain distance has a volume. The volume between two spheres of radii d and d+dd is 4π d² dd. But since d is 1/plx, the volume in terms of plx would be more complicated.

Wait, let me express the volume in terms of plx. The volume between plx and plx + dplx would correspond to the distance between 1/plx and 1/(plx + dplx). Wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe it's easier to calculate the differential volume element in terms of plx.

The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr. But r is 1/plx, so r = 1/plx. Let's compute the volume between plx and plx + dplx.

Wait, actually, the volume between plx and plx + dplx would be the volume of a spherical shell at radius r, with thickness dr. So first, express r as 1/plx.

So, dr = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx. So dr/dplx = -1/(plx²). Therefore, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, but since dplx is a positive small change, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, r decreases. But for volume, maybe I should take the absolute value.

So the volume element is 4π r² dr. Substituting r = 1/plx and dr = (1/plx²) dplx (taking absolute value), so:

Volume = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. r is 1/plx, so r² is 1/plx². dr is (1/plx²) dplx. So Volume dV = 4π r² dr = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx² dplx) )= 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the volume between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, if the number density of stars is uniform, say n stars per cubic parsec, then the number of stars in that volume would be n * dV = n * (4π (1/plx^4) dplx).

But the problem says stars are uniformly distributed, so n is a constant. Therefore, the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) would be proportional to (1/plx^4).

Wait, but wait another moment. That would make the number of stars per unit plx (dV) to be proportional to 1/plx^4. But that's the number in a shell. The question is, how does the number per unit plx change with plx? So if plx increases, the number per dplx decreases as 1/plx^4.

But looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, which would be the case if the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to that. So the number of stars per unit plx range (dplx) is ~ (1/plx^4) dplx. So as plx increases, the number per unit plx decreases as 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that seems a big drop-off. Let me think again about the reasoning. If the distribution is uniform, more volume is at larger distances, but wait, no: for a fixed dplx, the volume at higher plx (closer stars) is smaller. Or wait, no, higher plx is lower distance, so maybe that's the opposite.

Wait, plx is in arcseconds, and higher plx means closer stars. So when plx increases, the stars are closer. So a small range dplx at higher plx (like plx=1) corresponds to a larger volume than the same dplx at lower plx (like plx=1000). Wait, no, the volume depends on the cube of the radius. Hmm, I think I might have messed up the earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it by considering that the number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume of that shell. The radius is r = 1/plx, so the volume is 4π r² dr. But r is 1/plx, so dr is the change in radius. Let me express dr in terms of dplx.

r = 1/plx => dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign just indicates that increasing plx decreases r, but the magnitude is (1/plx²) dplx.

So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx² dplx) ) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in that volume is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx, where n is the number density.

So the number of stars per unit plx range (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the options are asking how the number of stars per unit plx range changes with plx. So as plx increases, the number per unit plx decreases like 1/(plx^4).

But the options list option A as ~1/plx^4. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait! I think I made a mistake here. Another way to think about it is to consider that the number of stars in a given volume depends on that volume. Since the number density is uniform, the number of stars is proportional to the volume.

The volume between plx and plx + dplx is (4π/3) [ (1/plx)^3 - (1/(plx+dplx))^3 ) ].

Wait, but when dplx is small, this can be approximated. Let me do a Taylor expansion of 1/(plx + dplx)^3.

Approximately, 1/( (plx) + (dplx) )^3 ≈ 1/plx^3 * [1 - 3 (dplx)/(plx) ].

So the volume is approximately (4π/3) [1/plx^3 - (1 -3 dplx/(plx) ) / plx^3 ] = (4π/3)(3 dplx)/(plx^4) ) = 4π dplx/(plx^4).

Which brings me back to the same conclusion: the number of stars in a dplx range is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the answer would be A) ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought for number counts, it's usually 1/(distance squared), but maybe that's in terms of flux or something else. Wait, let me think again.

In astronomy, the number of stars you can observe in a certain direction depends on the volume, which for a given distance, is proportional to the cube of the distance. So if you have a flux limited survey, but here the question is about a flux-unlimited scenario because it's uniform distribution.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the luminosity distance, but no, the question is about parallax, which is a direct measure of distance.

Alternatively, let's think about the number of stars per unit volume. If stars are uniformly distributed, n is constant. So the number in a shell is n * 4π r² dr. But r is 1/plx, so substituting:

dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So the number is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx) = n *4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Hence, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer should be A) ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). For a uniformly distributed population of stars, the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself, assuming a constant number density \( n \).

The volume of a spherical shell at distance \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) with thickness \( dr \) is given by \( 4\pi r^2 dr \). Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) (ignoring the negative sign for simplicity). The volume of the shell becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to the volume, so:

\[
\text{Number of stars} \propto n \cdot \text{Volume} \propto n \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( d\text{plx} \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). As \( \text{plx} \) increases, the number of stars per unit \( d\text{plx} \) decreases according to this relationship.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/\text{plx}^4**
