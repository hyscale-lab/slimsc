Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They mention that the pH is ideal, which probably means that the conditions are such that other factors like protonation of EDTA aren't complicating things. The temperature is 25°C, which is room temperature, so I don't think that affects the calculations here. The formation constant, K_ca-edta, is given as 5x10^10. 

Hmm, I remember that EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant (Kf) tells us how strong the complex is. A high Kf means the complex is stable, so the reaction goes to completion.

The problem is to find the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca²+] in the solution. Since it's a complex, I think the formula would involve the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. 

Let me write down what I know. The complex is CaEDTA²−. The reaction for its dissociation would be:
Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the complex is formed by Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So the formation is:
Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ⇌ CaEDTA²− 

But the formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). So yes, Kf would be 5x10^10.

But wait, in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M.

But wait, the question is about the free calcium ions. So if the complex dissociates, we'll have some free Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

So assuming that the complex dissociates, but the Kf is so large (5e10) that almost all of the Ca is in the complex form. Wait, but wait, the way Kf is set up is that it's the formation of the complex. So a large Kf implies that the reaction favors the formation of the complex. Therefore, at equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is much higher than the reactants. So in this solution, since the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex, the amount of dissociation would be very small, meaning [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] would be small.

Alternatively, I think the formula is Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). We know [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M, and Kf is 5e10. But I don't know [EDTA^4−], but wait, EDTA in solution can exist in different protonated forms. But the question says the pH is ideal, so perhaps the assumption is that [EDTA^4−] is equal to the concentration of free EDTA. Or maybe that it's fully deprotonated. Wait, but in reality, EDTA exists as a series of species depending on pH. However, the problem states that the pH is ideal, so I guess we don't have to worry about that. Maybe we can assume that the concentration of EDTA^4− is the same as the concentration of free EDTA in solution. Or perhaps it's given that the solution is such that EDTA is in the Y^4- form. So I can proceed without worrying about the different forms.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. Let me think about the dissociation. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex.

Each mole of CaEDTA²− that dissociates produces one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−.
