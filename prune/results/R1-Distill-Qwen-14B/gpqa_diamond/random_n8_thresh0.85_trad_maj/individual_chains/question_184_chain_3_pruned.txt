Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reaction steps. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the target molecule to visualize it better. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (-OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3), and position 3 has a nitro group (-NO2). So, numbering them clockwise, ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. Wait, actually, I might have mixed up the numbering. Let me recall. The numbering in benzene derivatives is such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So perhaps the actual substituents' positions are 1, 2, 3, but maybe ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at position 3, and tert-butyl at position 2.

Wait, in benzene, the numbering could vary, but let's assume that the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3 in a way that's adjacent to each other. So, ethoxy is in position 1, nitro in 3, tert-butyl in 2. Or maybe it's different. Wait, the actual arrangement might not be adjacent. Let me see the target structure: the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3? Or maybe they are in positions 1, 2, and 3 in a way that they are all meta or para to each other. Wait, perhaps I should focus on the reaction steps first.

The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group, tert-butyl, and a nitro group. So, we need to introduce these groups onto the benzene ring in the correct positions.

I remember that when multiple substituents are introduced, the order of reactions matters because the directing effects of each group influence where the next substituent will attach.

Let me think about the substituents and their directing effects. Ethoxy (-OEt) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Nitro (-NO2) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Tert-butyl is a bulky, activating, and ortho/para-directing group because it's an alkyl group.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, tert-butyl is a strong activating group because it's an alkyl chain, so it's ortho/para-directing. But it's bulky, so steric hindrance might be a factor.

In the target molecule, we have three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So perhaps the order of introducing these substituents is important to get the correct positions.

I think the strategy is to first introduce the substituents that are more sensitive to the reaction conditions. For example, nitration is typically done under strong acidic conditions (like H2SO4 and HNO3), which could potentially complicate things if other substit
