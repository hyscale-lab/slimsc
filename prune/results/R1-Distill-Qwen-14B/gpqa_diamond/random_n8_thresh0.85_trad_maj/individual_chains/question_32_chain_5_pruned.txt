Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let me start by understanding the question.

The question asks for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, Lithium has an atomic number of 3, so Li-6 maybe? Because natural Lithium has isotopes, but if it's 3 neutrons, then protons are 3, so mass number is 3+3=6. So it's a Li-6 nucleus.

So first, I need to find the energy of the nucleus when moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativistic mechanics, the energy of a moving particle is given by the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

The formula for total energy (E) is gamma multiplied by the rest energy (m0c²), where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, right. So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Given v = 0.96c, so let's compute gamma.

Let me compute v^2/c^2: (0.96c)^2 / c^2 = 0.96² = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, sqrt(784)=28, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. Because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that again. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is 0.28. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Exactly, 1 divided by 0.28 is 3.57142857... So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy (m0c²) is the rest energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The nucleus consists of protons and neutrons. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons in total.

The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². Wait, or is it the other way around? I think protons are about 938.272 MeV/c², and neutrons are around 939.565 MeV/c². So each.

So for Li-6, the mass would be 3*(proton mass) + 3*(neutron mass). Let me compute that.

Proton: let's say 938.272 MeV/c² each.

Neutron: 939.565 MeV/c² each.

So 3 protons: 3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons: 3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total rest mass energy: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV.

Wait, that's 5633.511 MeV. But 1 GeV = 10^3 MeV, so that's approximately 5.6335 GeV.

Wait, but I remember that the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of its parts due to binding energy. Oh, right! That's called the mass defect. So the actual rest mass energy would be a bit less than the sum because when the nucleus forms, some mass is converted into binding energy.

But wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about binding energy. Hmm. Do I need to consider that? Because if it's a problem in an exam setting, perhaps they're considering the rest energy as the sum of the individual nucleons without the mass defect. Because calculating mass defect requires knowing the exact binding energy, which might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to proceed without considering the mass defect. Let me proceed with the sum of individual nucleon masses. So the rest energy is 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

Now, multiply that by gamma (3.5714) to get the total energy.

So E = gamma * m0c².

So E = 3.5714 * 5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute that.

First, 5 GeV * 3.5714 = 17.857 GeV.

Then 0.633511 GeV * 3.5714 ≈ 0.633511 * 3.5714 ≈ let's see:

0.6 * 3.5714 = 2.14284

0.033511 *3.5714 ≈ 0.1194.

So total ≈ 2.14284 +0.1194 ≈ 2.26224.

So 17.857 + 2.26224 = 20.11924 GeV.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

5.633511 * 3.5714:

Compute 5 * 3.5714 = 17.857

0.633511 *3.5714:

Let me compute 0.633511 * 3.5714. Break it down:

0.6 *3.5714 = 2.14284

0.03 *3.5714=0.107142

0.003511 *3.5714 ≈ 0.012535.

Adding them up: 2.14284 + 0.107142=2.25, then +0.012535=2.2625.

So 5.633511*3.5714≈17.857 +2.2625=20.1195 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, close but not exact. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me recalculate gamma.

v = 0.96c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28.

Wait, 0.28 is exactly 28/100, so sqrt is 28/100, yes. So 1/0.28 is exactly 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma is exactly 25/7.

Wait, 25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So the exact gamma is 25/7. Hmm, perhaps I should compute the rest energy more accurately, considering the
