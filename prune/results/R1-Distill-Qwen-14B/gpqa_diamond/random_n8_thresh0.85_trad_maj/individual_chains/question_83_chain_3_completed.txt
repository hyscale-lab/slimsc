Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration and pH calculations. But let's take it step by step. 

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We're diluting it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so hopefully, I can figure this out.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. When we titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction should be straightforward: the H+ from the acid will react with OH- from the base to form water.

Let me outline the steps I think I should take:

1. **Calculate the initial concentration after dilution.**
   Because we're mixing two solutions, the concentration will change. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³, so the total volume is 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid before dilution are volume (in liters) multiplied by molarity. So, 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the concentration is moles divided by total volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 L = 0.025 M.

2. **Find out the equivalence point details.**
   At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid present. The moles of acetic acid are 0.001. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the problem is asking about the equivalence point pH, so I'll need to calculate that.

3. **Calculate the pH at equivalence point.**
   At equivalence, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution would be a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution. 

   The concentration of acetate ions in the solution would be calculated by taking moles of acetate (same as initial acetic acid) and dividing by the total solution volume after adding NaOH. So when we add 10 cm³ of NaOH to the 40 cm³ diluted solution, the total volume is 50 cm³. So concentration would be 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

   The pH can be found using the Kb of acetate. Since Kw = 1e-14, and Ka is given as 1.85e-5, Kb would be Kw/Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. 

   The hydrolysis reaction for acetate is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

   The Kb is small, so we can assume x is much smaller than 0.02. So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02. Solving for x gives sqrt(Kb * 0.02) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. The OH- concentration is about 1.04e-5, so pOH is log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. pH would be 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. Oh, wait, I think I messed up the initial moles. Because the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M, but when you add 10 cm³ of NaOH (assuming it's 0.1 M), the moles of NaOH added would be 0.1 M * 0.01 L = 0.001 mol, which exactly neutralizes the 0.001 mol of acetic acid. So the solution at equivalence is just sodium acetate in 50 cm³. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. 

Wait, but when we calculate the pH for the acetate solution, perhaps I should use the correct approach with the Kb. Let me recompute that.

Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. 

The concentration is 0.02 M, so the acetate ion will hydrolyze:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming the change is x, then:

Kb ≈ x² / (0.02 - x) 

But since Kb is very small, x is negligible compared to 0.02, so it's approximately x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10. 

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. 

So OH- is 1.04e-5 → pOH is about 4.98 → pH is 14-4.98 = 9.02. But none of the options have a pH that high. The options for equivalence point are 8.52, 6.73, 7, 6.92. So I must have made a mistake. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation of the equivalence point is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the pH at equivalence point for a weak acid and strong base is determined by the concentration of the conjugate base. So the pH is calculated using the Kb of the conjugate base. 

So, with 0.001 mol of CH3COOH, adding 0.001 mol of NaOH converts all to CH3COO^- and Na+.

The solution volume is 40 cm³ (diluted) plus 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

So, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small compared to initial concentration 0.02, then:

Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 → [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 9.02. But none of the options have 9.02. The options have equivalence points at 8.52, 6.73, 7, 6.92. So why is this discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution step. Let me recheck the initial concentration.

Original volume: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid.

Diluted with 20 cm³ water.

Total volume is 40 cm³. So moles of acetic acid are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol.

Diluted concentration: 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. That part seems correct.

At equivalence, the volume of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the total solution is 50 cm³. So acetate concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Hmm. So why is the pH not matching any option? Maybe I'm miscalculating Kb. Let me compute it again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. That's correct.

So, the pH is ~9.02, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something in the approach. Maybe the assumption that x is negligible isn't correct here. Let me try to calculate it without the approximation.

Set up the equation: x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10. Let me rearrange: x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So initial approximation holds. So perhaps I made a mistake in the question? Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, the equivalence points are all below 7 except option A (8.52). Hmm, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, wait, no, because sodium acetate is a base, so pH should be higher than 7, not lower. So why are the options' equivalence points lower than 7?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial problem. Let me read again: the problem is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. But maybe I should have considered the dilution again. No, I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of Kb. Let me compute Kb again. Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximation. Let's try that.

x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10*(0.02 - x)

Since 5.405e-10 is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈0.02. So x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So OH- is ~1.04e-5, pOH is ~4.98 → pH ~9.02. So none of the options match.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again. 

Wait, perhaps the initial solution after dilution isn't correct. Let me compute that again. 

We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. The moles are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Diluting with 20 cm³ (total 40 cm³), so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is to find the pH after adding 25% of the titrant needed to reach equivalence. So for the first part, pH at 25% titration.

So I need to find the pH when 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence has been added.

The total NaOH needed for equivalence is 10 cm³ (as calculated earlier). So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³.

So, in the solution at 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So initially, we have 0.001 mol of CH3COOH. Adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH will convert 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-.

So moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is the initial diluted 40 cm³ plus the 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added → 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa = -log(1.85e-5) → Let me compute that. 

1.85e-5 is 1.85 × 10^-5. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa ≈ 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) → let's compute the ratio.

0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333 → log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So approximately 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, and 8.52 as the equivalence point. But earlier, I calculated the equivalence point as pH 9.02, which isn't an option. So perhaps I have a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the equivalence point's calculation is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the 25% titration part. Let me recheck.

At 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are 0.00025. So, yes, the corresponding moles of acetate would be 0.00025. The remaining acetic acid is 0.00075. 

The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So the log of 1/3 is -0.477. Adding to pKa (4.733) gives 4.256, which rounds to 4.26. So this part seems correct.

But then why is the equivalence point pH not matching any option? The options' equivalence points are all lower than 7, which can't be right because it's a weak acid titrated with a strong base, which should give a basic solution at equivalence.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the solution at equivalence isn't just acetate ions. Wait, no, because all the acetic acid would have been neutralized.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact formula without the assumption that x is negligible. Let's try that.

The Kb expression is x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10. Solving:

x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)

But since Kb is small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈0.02. So x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, as before. So the calculation seems correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should check the options again. The options for equivalence points are:

A) 8.52

B) 6.73

C)7

D)6.92

None of these are close to 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point. Wait, perhaps the problem is not a 1:1 reaction.

Wait, the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is 1:1. So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe the initial moles of acetic acid is wrong? Let me check again.

Initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Correct.

NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. Correct.

Wait, maybe the initial solution after adding NaOH isn't 50 cm³. Wait, 40 cm³ (diluted) plus 10 cm³ NaOH gives 50 cm³. So correct.

So [CH3COO^-] is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact solution for Kb:

x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈0.02 → x ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH is ~4.98 → pH is ~9.02.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different approach, like considering the dilution differently.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution of the acetic acid. Let me recount:

We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Dilute with 20 cm³ water → total 40 cm³.

So concentration is 0.05 * (20/40) = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the pH at 25% of the titration in terms of volume, not moles. Hmm. Let's think. If the equivalence point is at 10 cm³, then 25% would be 2.5 cm³, as I calculated. But perhaps the problem is considering 25% of the total solution's volume? No, the question says 25% titration, which usually refers to the volume of titrant added relative to the equivalence point volume.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the equivalence point pH. Maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution after equivalence is considered, but no, the equivalence point is when all acid is neutralized.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the exact value without the approximation. Let's solve the Kb equation without neglecting x.

So, x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)

We can set up the equation: x² + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation: a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

So sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1 *1.081e-11 )

Calculate each part:

(5.405e-10)^2 ≈ 2.92e-19

4 *1 *1.081e-11 =4.324e-11

So adding them: 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11 (since 2.92e-19 is negligible).

So sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2.

We take the positive root: [6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ] / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

So x ≈3.288e-6 → [OH-] ≈3.288e-6 → pOH ≈5.486 → pH=14-5.486=8.514. So approximately 8.51. Which is close to option A's 8.52.

Ah! So that's why. I was making a mistake by neglecting the x term in the denominator, which, although small, changes the result enough when considering the exact calculation. So the pH at equivalence is about 8.51, which matches option A's 8.52.

Wait, but earlier approximation gave me 9.02, but the exact calculation gives 8.51. So I must have made a mistake in the earlier assumption.

So in summary:

At 25% titration, the pH is approximately 4.26.

At equivalence, the pH is approximately 8.51, which rounds to 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A is (4.26;8.52), which matches.

So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, followed by titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

---

### **Step 1: Initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution**
The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L}.
\]

The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

---

### **Step 2: pH at 25% titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the NaOH required to reach the equivalence point has been added. The total moles of NaOH required for equivalence are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH for equivalence} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.01 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Thus, at 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

After adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH:

- Moles of acetic acid remaining:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

- Moles of acetate ion formed:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where:

\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

---

### **Step 3: pH at the equivalence point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. The total moles of acetate ions are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ions undergo hydrolysis in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \( K_b \):

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]

Assuming \( [OH^-] = x \), we solve:

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

The hydroxide ion concentration is \( [\text{OH}^-] = 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \), so the pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.486.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.486 = 8.514.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.

---

### **Final Answer**
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. These values match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
