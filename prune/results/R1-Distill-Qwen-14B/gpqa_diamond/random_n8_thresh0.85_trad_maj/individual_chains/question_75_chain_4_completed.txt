Okay, so I've been given this question about molecular biology and genetics, and I need to figure out why the transgenic mouse model isn't overexpressing the GADD45G protein as expected. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The question says that the researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of GADD45G. They added a sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed.

The provided DNA sequence is the plus strand of the construct. Let me look at the sequence. It starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then after that, there's TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, but the construct was modified to include the hemagglutinin (HA) sequence. I think HA is a small peptide tag, maybe around 10-15 amino acids. So the initial part of the coding sequence should code for HA before GADD45G.

Looking at the sequence, after ATG, the next few codons are TAC, then CC, AT, etc. Wait, TAC is the first codon, which is Tyrosine. But HA typically starts with something like YPYDVPDYA or similar. Hmm. Oh wait, but maybe the construct includes the HA tag at the beginning. Let me think about the reading frame.

Wait, the HA tag is added to the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the HA coding sequence should come right after the start codon. Let me recall, the HA tag is usually about 11 amino acids. The nucleotide sequence for HA would be something like ATG (start), then codons for YPYDVPDYA. Let me see: Y is TAC, P is CC, Y is TAC, D is GAT, V is GTT, P is CC, Y is TAC, D is GAT, A is GCT, etc. Wait, but the given sequence is much longer than that. Hmm.

Looking at the given plus strand sequence, the start is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... Wait, so after ATG, the next codons are TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), then TAC (Tyr) again. That's the initial part. So that's three codons after the ATG. The HA tag would be about 10-12 codons, right? So the initial part of the gene should code for that.

But wait, looking at the sequence provided, the initial part after ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA. Let's translate that into amino acids.

ATG is Methionine (start). Then TAC is Tyr, CCA is Pro, TAC is Tyr, GAT is Asp, GTT is Val, CCA is Pro, GAT is Asp, TAC is Tyr, GCC is Ala, AAA is Lys, TGA is stop. Wait, TGA is a stop codon. Oh wait, so the sequence goes ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... So the stop codon is at position 12 or so. That's way too early. Oh! So the coding sequence includes a premature stop codon.

That would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a much smaller protein than expected, or perhaps no protein if the stop codon is in frame. So the construct might not be correctly designed. The HA tag is probably only partially present, or not at all, if the stop codon is within the HA coding sequence.

Wait, but why is there a stop codon so early? Maybe during the cloning process, a mistake was made. The HA sequence probably didn't include a stop codon and the next part of the gene (the GADD45G) starts after, so the construct should have the HA followed immediately by the GADD45G coding sequence. But in this case, the sequence after ATG leads to an early stop.

Looking at the plus strand sequence, the first codon after ATG is TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), then TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), etc., until position 12: AAA (Lys) and then TGA (stop). So the HA tag isn't even completed before the stop. So the HA might not even be present, and the GADD45G coding sequence isn't being translated because the ribosome stops at TGA.

So the problem is that the coding sequence includes a stop codon (TGA) early on, which terminates translation before the GADD45G protein is made. That would prevent the overexpression.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Missense mutation in HA sequence. If that's the case, perhaps the HA is expressed but with a wrong amino acid, but the stop codon is still present. The presence of a stop would still prevent the full-length protein.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early because of a stop codon in the coding sequence. That matches what I'm thinking. The TGA is causing the ribosome to stop, so no full-length protein is made, and the HA tag is cut off as well.

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. The HA tag usually includes some amino acids before and after the tag for proper folding, but if it's missing, maybe the protein is degraded. But in this case, the stop codon would mean the protein isn't made at all, not just degraded.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. But wait, the stop codon is TGA. UAA is a different stop codon. So if the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist, but the stop codon here is TGA. So the ribosome would still translate up to TGA and stop. So this option is about another stop codon.

Wait, the sequence has TGA as the stop. So the question is, does the mouse have the machinery to recognize TGA as a stop? In most cases, all stop codons are recognized, regardless of the organism. So the absence of a tRNA for UAA wouldn't affect the translation of TGA.

So the main issue is the presence of the TGA stop codon in the coding sequence, which is causing the ribosome to terminate early. Therefore, the correct answer is B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.


The question involves identifying why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed in a transgenic mouse model. The researcher introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic determinant at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence. However, the provided DNA sequence shows that the coding sequence includes a premature stop codon (TGA) early in the sequence, immediately after the start codon (ATG). This stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, preventing the full-length protein from being synthesized. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A:** A missense mutation in the HA sequence would not explain the lack of protein expression, as the stop codon still prevents full-length protein synthesis.  
- **Option B:** The premature stop codon (TGA) in the coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, which aligns with the observed lack of overexpression.  
- **Option C:** A lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, but the presence of a stop codon would prevent the protein from being synthesized in the first place, making this option less likely.  
- **Option D:** The absence of a tRNA for UAA would not affect the translation of TGA, as all stop codons are typically recognized by the ribosome.  

The primary issue is the premature stop codon, which halts translation early and prevents the production of the full-length protein. 

Answer: B
