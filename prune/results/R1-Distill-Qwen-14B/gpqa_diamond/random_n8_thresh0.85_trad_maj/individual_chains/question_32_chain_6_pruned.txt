Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and determining the energy of the nucleus moving at a speed close to the speed of light. Hmm, let me think through this carefully.

The question is asking: What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c? X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. So first, I need to figure out what nucleus X is.

Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium atom has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons is 6 nucleons. So the atomic mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which would have a mass number of 6.

So, the nucleus is moving at v = 0.96c. I remember that relativistic speeds require using the gamma factor. The energy in such cases is given by the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy.

The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that. Since v is 0.96c, let's plug that in.

v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is approximately 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714286.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. Then 1-0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So 1/0.28 is indeed 3.571428..., so gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The rest mass energy is the mass of the nucleus multiplied by c squared. But since we're working in units where c is a constant, and we'll be using GeV, I think we'll need the mass of the nucleus in GeV/c², and then multiply by c² to get energy in GeV.

Wait no, when using E = gamma * m c², the mass is in GeV/c², so E would be gamma * m in GeV. Because m c² is the rest energy. So perhaps I should find the rest mass of Li-6 in GeV/c².

Alternatively, maybe I can look up the mass of Li-6. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be 3*(938) + 3*(939) MeV/c².

Wait, let me compute that. 3 * (938 + 939) = 3 * (1877) = 5631 MeV. That's 5.631 GeV. Wait, no, wait. 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 3*(938 + 939) = 3*(1877) = 5631 MeV, which is 5.631 GeV. So the rest mass energy is 5.631 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. The actual mass of Li-6 is a bit different. Because in reality, the nucleus has binding energy, so the mass is slightly less than the sum of individual nucleons. But since the question is about the energy in the collider, which is the total relativistic energy, the rest mass we should use is the actual rest mass of the nucleus.

Oh wait, wait! I think I made a mistake. Because when you have a nucleus, the mass isn't just the sum of protons and neutrons. The mass of the nucleus is the sum minus the mass defect due to binding energy. So perhaps I should use the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, maybe I should look up the exact atomic mass of Li-6. I think for the purpose of this problem, they might expect me to use the sum of protons and neutrons, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the average mass of a nucleon (since Li-6 has 6 nucleons), perhaps around
