Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. The question is asking about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right, so first, I need to find the relative speed between the two astronauts. I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities like you would in classical mechanics. I think you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, what's that formula again? Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u and v are the speeds of the two objects relative to the same frame. But wait, wait! Which one is moving faster? The first astronaut is at 0.6c, and the second is at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the second astronaut, the first is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Let me plug in the numbers. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²/c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So (0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. I think that's correct. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. That would match options C and D for the relative speed part.

Next, the total energy of the system. The total energy in relativity is the sum of the energies of each astronaut, including their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or wait, actually, each astronaut's total energy is gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is 1.25 * 2m * c²
