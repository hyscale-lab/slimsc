Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, causing them to rotate plane-polarized light. These are also called enantiomers. So the question is asking which of the given moieties exhibit this property.

Let's look at each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have different conformations, but optical isomerism requires a chiral center or some sort of asymmetry. Wait, this compound has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. The dinitro groups are in the 6 and 6' positions, and the dicarboxylate groups are in 2 and 2'. So each ring has substituents on positions 2 and 6. I think that in biphenyls, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it can have enantiomers. Specifically, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent the molecule from being superimposed on its mirror image. For example, if each ring has two groups in positions that can't be mirrored, the molecule might be chiral. Alternatively, maybe this is a case of biphenyl with substituents causing the molecule to have a plane of symmetry or not. Wait, if the substituents on each ring are symmetrical, like in 2 and 6, perhaps the entire molecule isn’t chiral. Wait, the entire structure is symmetric across the central bond because each phenyl has the same substituents. So maybe this doesn't have optical isomerism. Alternatively, if the substituents make the molecule asymmetric. Wait, the substituents are on 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me think: if each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carbamate at 2, but since the rings are connected 1,1', the substituents are in positions that might actually make the molecule symmetric. Hmm, maybe this isn't a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the central bond allows for rotation, but if the substituents are in positions that prevent free rotation and create a rigid structure, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry or not. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Maybe I should move on to the other options and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see, the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2COOCH3. Or wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO... Wait, maybe I should better draw the structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- with methyl ester. So the compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So structure: CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO- as the acid is CH2CH2COOH. If it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, then it's CH2(OH)CH2COO- as the acid, and the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Now, does this have a chiral center? Let's see: the central carbon (the CH2) with OH, CH2, and the COOCH3 group. Wait, the central carbon is attached to OH, two CH2 groups, and the carbonyl. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3? So, the molecule would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central CH2 would have two CH2 groups, an OH, and the COOCH3. So the central carbon is bonded to OH, two CH2 groups, and the COOCH3. Wait, no, wait: if it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, that can’t be right. Wait, wait. Let me think again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- so in 2-hydroxy, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to
