Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the fluorescent green signal isn't showing up when they look under the microscope. Let's go through the setup step by step.

First, the experiment involves a bicistronic vector, which means it has two genes in one construct. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand uses the CBA promoter, and the receptor is preceded by an IRES element. 

Wait, I remember that the CBA promoter is a strong promoter, so the ligand should be expressed pretty well. The IRES is important because it allows for internal ribosome entry, which can drive the expression of the downstream gene, the receptor, without needing a separate promoter. So both ligand and receptor should be expressed.

Looking at the stop cassettes: between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP. Then between receptor and eGFP is lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh right, these stop cassettes are under the control of specific lox sites. So, in the presence of Cre recombinase, the lox sites are recognized and the stop cassette is excised. 

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic. So, in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed as ORF1 (ligand) with mCherry, but the stop cassette would prevent the receptor from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor would have its own stop cassette. But when Cre is introduced, like with the SOX10-Cre mice, the Cre would delete the respective stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed. 

Wait, but the question says that after crossing to SOX10-Cre, they don't see the green signal, which is from the receptor-eGFP. So why isn't eGFP being expressed?

Let me think about the vectors. The ligand is under CBA, which is a constitutive promoter, so ligand should be expressed everywhere in the cells where the vector is active. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, which allows it to be translated after the ligand. But without Cre, the stop cassettes block their expression. So when Cre is present (from the SOX10-Cre mice), the Cre should excise the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

Wait, but wait. The vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Oh, wait, no, the vector is a bicistronic construct with lox sites. So the lox sites are for the stop cassettes. So for the ligand, it's ligand-ORF followed by a stop cassette that has loxP sites. For the receptor, it's preceded by an IRES and a lox2272 stop cassette. 

Wait, but the presence of Cre would delete the stop cassettes. So, in the presence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed along with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP. Because Cre would cut out the stop cassettes. So the expression of the ligand and receptor would be under the control of the promoters upstream. 

But when they look for the green signal (eGFP), they don't see it. So perhaps the receptor-eGFP construct isn't being expressed. Why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Hmm, paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But in the same construct, both are expressed in the same cells, so paracrine might not matter here. Also, the question is about expression in Western blot and microscopy. Not sure if this is relevant yet.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean it's not on the cell surface, not fluorescent. But if it's stuck, then maybe you wouldn't see the green signal. But why would that happen? Unless the construct is misfolded. But the question doesn't mention anything about transport issues, so maybe this isn't the main reason.

Option C: The enhancer for expression is missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand. If the enhancers are missing, perhaps neither is expressed. But the question says they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and did a Western blot. Oh, wait, the Western blot result was that the actin loading was proportional, so the blot is working. They probably checked if the proteins were expressed. But the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the vector is working, they should see both ligand (mCherry) and receptor
