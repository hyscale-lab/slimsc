Okay, so I've got this question about transiting planets and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, let me think through this. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii, but the star of Planet_1 is more massive—twice as much as Planet_2's host.

Wait, the probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. Specifically, the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 times (1 / (a_planet)), where a_planet is the semi-major axis. Or wait, maybe it's more about the orbital plane's alignment. Oh right, the probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / (a * (1 - e)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero. So the probability simplifies to something like (R_planet / R_star) * (1 / a), but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should look up the formula.

Oh right, the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/a) ), but wait, I think that's not exactly correct. Let me think again. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit will cause a transit is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1/(a (1 - e²)^½ )). But in this case, e is zero for both, so it's (R_p/R_s)^2 * (1/(a) ). Wait, but I'm not so sure. Maybe it's (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1/(a) ) times something else.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability P is given by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a) ) / ( (R_p + R_s)^2 )

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me get this right. The standard formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a) / (a) ) )? No, that can't be right. Alternatively
