Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a series of reactions, and we need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, let me start by listing out what I know from the given reactions.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. I remember that when metals react with certain gases, maybe something like aluminum reacting with chlorine? Or perhaps it's about a reaction with a transition metal. Wait, but red product... I'm thinking maybe copper or something else. Alternatively, I think about the reaction of metals with halogens. Oh wait, maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen gas. So for example, if A is sulfur, and B is something else? Or perhaps A is a metal like sodium reacting with chlorine? No, sodium and chlorine would form NaCl, which is white, not red.

Wait, wait. Another thought: the product C is a bright red solid. That makes me think of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, but that's blue. Hmm, or maybe... I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where a metal reacts with a diatomic gas. Let me think again.

Wait, the next reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So, maybe gas D is a halogen as well, or maybe something like O2? Or perhaps it's a different gas. But since C is a product, let's think about E. E is produced from C and D. If C is a metal compound, and D is something like fluorine, then E might be a more highly fluorinated compound. Or perhaps D is a diatomic gas like O2, and E is something like a metal oxide.

Wait, but the third reaction says that C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, if C is a metal oxide, for example, when it reacts with water, it would form a metal hydroxide? Wait, but then if it's a hydroxide, maybe that's not right because the product is acids. Oh, unless the oxide is of a non-metal. Wait, perhaps C is
