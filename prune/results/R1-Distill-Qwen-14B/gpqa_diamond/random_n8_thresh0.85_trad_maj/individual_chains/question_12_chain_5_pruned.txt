Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. And the pion is stationary. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I remember that in such decay problems, conservation laws are key—like conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, but wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have such small mass, almost considered massless. Oh right, in many cases, especially high-energy physics, the neutrino's mass is neglected. So maybe I can treat it as a photon-like particle with zero rest mass. That should simplify things.

So the pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So the magnitude of the muon's momentum (p) should equal the neutrino's momentum (p), but in opposite directions.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, each particle's energy is the sum of their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy.

Wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its energy would be E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2 * c^2, but wait, units-wise, maybe it's better to ignore the c's since the masses are given in MeV/c² and we're working in units where c=1. So E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) and E_nu = p, since for neutrinos, m_nu is near zero.

So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p.

But the initial energy is E_initial = m_pi = 139.6 MeV. So:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, that looks like an equation I can solve for p. Let's rearrange it.

Let me denote m_mu as 105.7 for simplicity.

So sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = 139.6 - p.

Square both sides:

p² + m_mu² = (139.6 - p)^2

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * p + p².

So p² + m_mu² = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides:

m_mu² = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p

Rearranging for p:

2 * 139.6 p = (139.6)^2 - m_mu²

So p = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / (2 * 139.6 )

Calculating the numerator: (139.6)^2 is approximately 139.6 * 139.6. Let me compute that. 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. But wait, let me compute accurately:

139.6 * 139.6 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 1
