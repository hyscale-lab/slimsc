Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

We have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4●2H2O. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C. We're asked to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in this solution.

Wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? So I need to find [HPO4^2-].

Hmm, and the question provides the Ka values for H3PO4. Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. Those are the dissociation constants for each step.

I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. The species can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, or PO4^3-. Since the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, which are different phosphate salts, this might form a buffer solution. Oh right! Buffer solutions involve a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). So when it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. H2PO4^- can act as both an acid and a base. But wait, in solution, H2PO4^- can deprotonate to HPO4^2- (that's the conjugate base), or it can donate a proton to become H3PO4.

But Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus water. So that's providing HPO4^2- ions.

So in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. That makes me think of a buffer solution because H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are conjugate acid-base pairs (they can interconvert by losing or gaining a proton).

In such a solution, the pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the acid would be H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem is not directly asking for pH. It's asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions. Hmm. Or wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think.

Wait, but perhaps the solution doesn't involve a buffer, because both salts are providing different species. Alternatively, maybe they form a buffer, and the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will be determined by the amounts of the two salts.

Wait, let me calculate the molar amounts of each salt first.

For KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 136.09. Let me compute that. 1 / 136 is approximately 0.00735 moles.

Wait, more accurately, 136.09 is the molar mass. So 1 / 136.09 = approximately 0.007344 mol.

Each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^- and one mole of K+.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005615 mol.

Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2- and two moles of Na+.

So, in the solution, we have:

Moles of H2PO4^-: 0.007344 mol.

Moles of HPO4^2-: 0.005615 mol.

The volume is 0.2 L, so concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007344 / 0.2 = 0.03672 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005615 / 0.2 = 0.028075 M.

Wait, but wait. The question is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- ions. But I'm now confused because the initial approach might not account for the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-, but the K2 and K3 are very small, so HPO4^2- is the dominant species in this scenario.

Wait, but in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the salts. So the total concentration of phosphate species would be the sum of H2PO4^-
