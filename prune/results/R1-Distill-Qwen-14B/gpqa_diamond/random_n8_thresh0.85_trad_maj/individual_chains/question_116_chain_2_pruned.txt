Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to NMR and all that, but let me try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

First, the problem describes compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating to 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm integrating to 4H. Hmm, I remember that NMR signals give information about the environment of the protons. So, triplet and quartet suggest splitting due to neighboring protons. 

The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6Hâ€”wait, 0.9 is usually a region where methyl groups (CH3) appear, especially if they're adjacent to something like an oxygen or another group. Six hydrogens would mean two methyl groups, maybe. But wait, 6H as a triplet. So each of those protons is split into a triplet by neighboring protons. Triplet implies each proton is next to two others, so maybe each CH3 is next to another group with two protons. Or maybe it's a di-substituted group?

The second signal is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means each proton is adjacent to three others. So, perhaps these are two sets of two protons each, each quartet. Wait, no, quartet is a splitting into four peaks, so each proton is next to three others. Let me think. Maybe these are two adjacent CH2 groups. Like, each CH2 is next to another CH2. For example, maybe it's a CH2CH2 group, but in what situation would that happen? Or perhaps it's a central CH2 with two adjacent CH2 groups. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: for compound A, the NMR has two signals. So, the molecule is probably symmetric, so all equivalent protons are in the same environment, leading to these two signals. The 6H in triplet could be two methyl groups (each with 3H) that are each next to a CH2 group. So, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3 or something like that. Wait, no, but that would have more signals. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl ether or something similar, but no, that would have oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane derivative? Or
