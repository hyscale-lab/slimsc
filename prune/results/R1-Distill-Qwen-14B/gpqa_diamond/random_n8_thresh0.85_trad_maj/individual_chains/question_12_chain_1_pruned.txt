Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with particle physics yet. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: Find the KE of the product particles in the reaction Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. The Pi(+) is stationary. The rest masses are given as Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two KE values.

Hmm, I remember that in particle reactions, conservation laws are key. So I should think about conservation of energy and momentum here. Since the pion is stationary initially, the total momentum before the reaction is zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino after the reaction should cancel each other out. Because the neutrino has negligible mass, its momentum would be approximately equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the muon's.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the neutrino's mass. Oh right, in particle physics, neutrinos are considered massless in many cases, especially in beta decay processes. So I can treat the neutrino as massless for this calculation.

So the setup is a pion at rest decaying into a muon and a neutrino. The pion's rest mass is higher than the muon's, so the muon must have some kinetic energy, and the neutrino will carry away some energy and momentum as well.

I think I'll need to use energy and momentum conservation. Let's denote the pion as Pi, muon as mu, and neutrino as nu.

Let's denote the energies and momenta as follows:
- For the pion: since it's stationary, its energy is just its rest mass energy, E_pi = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.
- For the muon: energy E_mu = sqrt(p_mu² c² + m_mu² c^4). Since m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², E_mu = sqrt(p_mu² + (105.7)^2) MeV, assuming c=1.
- For the neutrino: since it's massless, E_nu = p_nu * c = p_nu (again, c=1 here, so E = p).

Now, conservation of energy: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

Conservation of momentum: since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after should be zero. So p_pi (which is zero) = p_mu + p_nu. But the pion's momentum is zero, so p_mu + p_nu = 0. Which implies p_mu = -p_nu. But since momentum is a vector, their magnitudes are equal. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Wait, but the neutrino's momentum is in the opposite direction. So in terms of magnitudes, p_mu = p_nu. Let me denote the magnitude as p. So p_mu = p and p_nu = p, but opposite directions.

Wait, no: because the pion is at rest, the total momentum after must be zero. So the muon's momentum plus the neutrino's momentum must equal zero. So p_mu = -p_nu. So their magnitudes are equal.

Wait, but neutrinos have spin 1/2 and are leptons, so maybe their direction is opposite to the muon. But in any case, the magnitudes are the same. So p_mu = p_nu, but opposite in direction. So when I write the momentum equation, it's p_mu + p_nu = 0 → p_mu = - p_nu.

But perhaps it's easier to work with magnitudes and directions. Let me proceed.

So from momentum conservation: p_mu = - p_nu. So the magnitudes are the same, but directions opposite.

Now, the energy conservation equation:

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

Substituting E_mu and E_nu in terms of p:

E_pi = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p.

But wait, E_pi is 139.6 MeV. So:

139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p.

Let me denote sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) as S. So:

139.6 = S + p → S = 139.6 - p.

But S is sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) → (S)^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2.

Substituting S = 139.6 - p:

(139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2.

Expanding the left side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2.

Simplify by canceling p^2 on both sides:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p = (105.7)^2.

Compute the numerical values:

139.6 squared: let me calculate that.

139.6^2 = ?

Well, 140^2 is 19600. So 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (a-b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So a=140, b=0.4.

(140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600-112=19488 +0.16=19488.16.

Hmm, wait, but 139.6 is (140 - 0.4), so 139.6^2 = 19488.16 MeV².

Similarly, 105.7²: Let's compute 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7= 1140. So (105.7)^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 10000 + 1140=11140 +32.49= 11172.49.

So putting it back:

19488.16 - 2*139.6*p = 11172.49.

Compute 2*139.6 = 279.2.

So,

19488.16 - 279.2 p = 11172.49.

Subtracting 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 279.2 p.

Calculate 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Let me do this step by step.

19488.16
-11172.49
------------
= ?

Hmm, 19488.16 minus 11000 is 8488.16. Then minus 172.49: 8488.16 - 172.49 = 8315.67.

So 8315.67 = 279.2 p.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that.

Well, 279.2 × 29 is approximately how much? Let's see: 280 ×30=8400. So 279.2 ×29 ≈ 8096.8 (since 279.2 ×30=8376, minus 279.2 →8376-279.2=8096.8). But our numerator is 8315.67, which is larger than 8096.8.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me do this division:

279.2 × 29 = 8096.8.

Subtract: 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

So 218.87 / 279.2 → approximately 0.783.

So p ≈ 29.783 MeV/c.

Wait, let me check with a calculator approach.

Wait, 279.2 × 30 = 8376 → which is higher than 8315.67. So 30 would give 8376, which is 8376-8315.67 = 60.33 more. So 30 - (60.33 /279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784.

So p ≈ 29.784 MeV
