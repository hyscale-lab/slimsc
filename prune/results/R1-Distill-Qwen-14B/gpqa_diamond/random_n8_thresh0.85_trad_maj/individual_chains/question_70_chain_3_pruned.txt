Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the reactions provided and try to identify the substances involved. I'll go through each part one by one.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, when I think of bright red products in chemistry, one that comes to mind is maybe something like sulfur trioxide or maybe a metal oxide? Wait, another thought: sulfur is bright red in its elemental form, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving a transition metal. Let me think about the stoichiometry here. 8 equivalents of B per mole of A. That ratio might give a clue about the formula of the product. For example, if A is Fe (iron) and B is S (sulfur), FeS would need one S, but 8 S would make FeS8, which I'm not sure about. Alternatively, maybe A is something else. Or perhaps B is O2? Wait, but O2 is a diatomic gas. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe B is H2. 8 equivalents of H2 reacting with A. So, for example, if A is Fe, then Fe plus 8 H2 might form FeH8? That doesn't ring a bell. Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2, but again, not sure.

Wait, the next part: when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E could be something like phosgene? Or maybe a highly toxic gas like HCN, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2, and C is something like CO, but I'm not certain.

Then, C reacting with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids, one strong and one weak. Let's think about possible compounds that do that. For instance, something like SO3. When SO3 reacts with water, it forms H2SO4, which is a strong acid. But wait, that's only one acid. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is something like NO2. NO2 reacts with water to produce HNO3 and HNO2. HNO3 is a strong acid, and HNO2 is a weak acid. Oh, that fits: F would be HNO3 (strong), G would be HNO2 (weak). So if C is NO2, that could make sense.

So let's backtrack. If C is NO2, which is a brown gas, not bright red. Wait, but the product C is described as bright red. Hmm. That's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps C is something else. Another thought: maybe C is SO3, but that's a colorless gas. Wait, but the product is bright red—maybe it's a solid. Alternatively, if A is Fe, and B is S, then FeS8? I'm not sure about that. Or maybe A is copper reacting with sulfur to form CuS, but that's not red either. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is with another element.

Wait, let me think again. If C reacts with water to form A, F, and G, and F is a strong acid and G is a weak one. Let me consider possible compounds. Another option is that C is a nitrate, but I'm not certain.

Wait, going back. If C is NO2, then when it reacts with water, it produces HNO3 (strong acid) and HNO2 (weak acid). Also, when NO2 is reacted with a gas D, which is in a 1:1 ratio with B in another reaction. Let me look at the next part: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. What gases B and D could this be?

Wait, if B is O2 and D is H2O, but that might not fit. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is another diatomic gas. Wait, let's think: D reacting with B gives H, a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, etc. But H is a product of D and B. If B is O2 and D is H2, then O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. But that would require a 2:1 ratio, so maybe not. Hmm.

Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, but again, the ratio might not fit. Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is O2, but same issue.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider the formation of E. E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. If C is NO2, and D is H2O, but that's a liquid. Alternatively, maybe D is O2. Wait, but how? Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps E is something like SO2, but that's a gas. Or maybe E is something like Cl2O7? Not sure.

Wait, let me think about the reactions again. So A + 8 B → C (bright red). C + 2 D → E. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

If C is NO2, then F is HNO3, G is HNO2. So when NO2 reacts with D, what D could produce E, which is extremely hazardous? Maybe D is O2? Then NO2 + O2 forming something? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2. Then, NO2 + Cl2 → what? Perhaps forming something like NOCl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is something like NCl3, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about D reacting with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Common solvents are H2O, ethanol, etc. If B is O2 and D is H2, then H could be H2O. But O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. So the ratio would be 2:1. But according to the problem, the ratio is 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, Cl2 + H2 → 2 HCl, so the ratio is 1:1. Oh, that makes sense. So B is Cl2, D is H2. H would be HCl, but wait, HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, not quite right.

Wait, another possibility: B is H2 and D is Cl2. So H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl. That's a 1:1 ratio. HCl is a gas, but the problem says H is a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is something else.

Wait, perhaps B is H2 and D is another diatomic gas. Let me think, if H is a solvent like ethanol, but I'm not sure how that would form from B and D.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is C (carbon). Then O2 + C → CO or CO2. But that's in a 1:1 ratio? For example, 2 C + O2 → 2 CO (ratio 2:1), which doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is H2O and D is something else. No, because B is a gas. Oh, right, in the problem, B is a gas. So B can't be H2O, as that's a liquid.

Wait, going back to the first reaction. A is a solid, reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C, which is bright red. What solid reacting with 8 equivalents of a gas to form a bright red product? Another thought: maybe A is S (solid sulfur), and B is O2. Then, S + O2 → SO2 or SO3. But SO2 is a gas, not solid. Alternatively, if A is Fe and B is S, but FeS is a solid, but I'm not sure about the color.

Alternatively, perhaps A is copper, B is sulfur. Cu + S → CuS? Not sure about the color. Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe and B is something else.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. So C is something that can be hydrolyzed. If C is SO3, then SO3 + H2O → H2SO4 (strong acid) and possibly another product. Wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid, but SO3 plus H2O just makes H2SO4, which is one acid. So that doesn't fit because the problem states two different acids.

Alternatively, C could be something like N2O5, which upon hydrolysis would produce HNO3 and HNO2. Wait, N2O5 plus water gives 2 HNO3 and HNO2? Not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe it's another compound.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of E being extremely hazardous. What are examples of extremely hazardous substances? Maybe something like sarin gas, but that's more of a nerve agent. Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is highly toxic. Or maybe E is something like HCN, which
