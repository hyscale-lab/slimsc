Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method depends on the size of the planet and its star, and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, how exactly do these factors play in?

So, the problem says both planets have the same mass. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh, right, orbital period relates to the distance from the star. From Kepler's third law, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. Since Planet_1's period is shorter, it must be orbiting closer to its star.

The host stars have the same radii. Interesting. But their masses are different. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Hmm, but wait, the star's radius is same. Radius plays a role in the transit depth. Because the transit depth is (Rp / R*)^2, so a larger star would make the depth smaller, but same radius here, so same depth. Wait, but the planet's mass is same, but what about their radii? Oh, wait, I don't think we know that. The question doesn't give planet radii. Oh, wait, the question says both are Earth-like, so perhaps their radii are similar. But wait, same masses but Earth-like, so same size? Hmm, maybe. So planet radius might be same.

Wait, but when you do the transit probability, the main factors are the relative sizes and the orbital inclination. The probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Because for a planet to transit, its orbital plane must be edge-on relative to us. The probability is about the fraction of the orbit's circumference where the planet passes in front of the star, which is when the planet's orbital distance is such that it can cross our line of sight.

Wait, the transit probability P is approximately (R* / a) * (some factor involving the star's radius and the planet's distance). So if a is the semi-major axis, then the probability is higher when a is smaller relative to R*. So a planet closer in (smaller a) has a higher chance of transiting.

Wait, but since a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's law, and the star's mass. The formula is a^3 = (G(M+M_p) * P^2 ) / (4π²). But since M_p is much
