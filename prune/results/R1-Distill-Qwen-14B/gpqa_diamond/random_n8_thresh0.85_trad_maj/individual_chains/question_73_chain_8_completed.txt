Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let's see what I remember from my physics classes.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. Wait, but when dealing with relativistic speeds, I can't just subtract their velocities like in classical mechanics. Oh right, I remember that you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

So, the formula for adding velocities is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Let me get this right. Since both are moving in the same direction, I think I subtract the smaller velocity from the larger one. So u is 0.6c, and v is 0.5c. Plugging in, that's (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute the denominator first. (0.6 * 0.5) is 0.3, so 0.3 c² / c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. Numerator is 0.1c. So 0.1c / 0.7 equals approximately 0.1428c. Which is roughly 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for v_rel.

Now, for the total energy. I think each astronaut's energy should be calculated using the relativistic energy formula: E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute each one's energy. First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, but wait. The problem says "the total energy of the system". Are they considering the rest mass energy, or are they adding the two energies as kinetic plus rest? Oh, the formula I used includes the rest mass because E = gamma m c² is the total energy (kinetic plus rest). So the total energy is E1 + E2.

So let's compute E1 + E2: 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² ≈ 5.964 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower, so not that. Option D's E is 5 mc², which is close but not exact. So the correct option for E is 5.96 mc².

Putting it together, the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². So looking at the options, option C is v_rel =0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

Combining the results, the relative speed is \( 0.14c \) and the total energy is \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.

Answer: C
