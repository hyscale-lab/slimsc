Okay, so I have this physics problem here about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where its visible light is emitted. And the question is about the excitation of iron atoms in two different stars. Let me think.

The problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, that's a specific energy difference, probably delta E.

We need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures T1 and T2. The options are A to D, involving ln(2) and some expressions with T1 and T2.

Since the stars are in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I think this involves the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of different energy levels in a system to temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where g's are the statistical weights. But wait, in this problem, the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So I guess that n_upper_1 / n_lower_1 equals twice n_upper_2 / n_lower_2. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio between the two stars.

Wait, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or some lower state) is higher in star_1. So, let me get this straight. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

R1 = (n_upper_1 / n_lower_1) = 2 * (n_upper_2 / n_lower_2) = 2 R2.

But wait, in the Boltzmann equation, each R is given by (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), right? Assuming g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars, which I think they are because it's the same transition in iron. So the statistical weights (g) would be the same for both stars.

So R1 = (g_u/g_l) exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
R2 = (
