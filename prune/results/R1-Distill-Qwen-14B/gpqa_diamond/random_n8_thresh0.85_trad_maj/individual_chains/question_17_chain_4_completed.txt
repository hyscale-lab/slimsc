Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with these kinds of questions. But let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about any side reactions there. The temperature is 25°C, which is room temperature, so activity coefficients are probably assumed to be 1, I think.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca^2+ pretty tightly. The formation constant (K) is a measure of how strong that binding is. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

So the problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in the solution. I think I need to use the formation constant equation. The formation constant, K, for a complex like Ca-EDTA is given by:

K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

Wait, right, because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand. So when it binds to Ca²+, it forms a complex. The equation should represent that correctly.

Given that the concentration of the complex, [Ca-EDTA], is 0.02 M. So that's the numerator. The denominator is the product of the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. But wait, in solution, the EDTA is present in a particular form. Wait, but the problem says to assume pH is ideal, so I think that the EDTA is fully deprotonated, so [EDTA^4-] is just the concentration of free EDTA.

Wait, but wait. EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on pH. Since the pH is ideal, maybe we can assume that all EDTA is in the Y^4- form. So, [EDTA^4-] is just the concentration of free EDTA.

But wait, in the solution, the total EDTA comes from both the complex and the free EDTA. So the total EDTA concentration is [EDTA_total] = [EDTA^4-] + [Ca-EDTA]. But if the complex is very stable, which it is because K is large (5e10), then the concentration of free EDTA would be very low. So, [EDTA^4-] would be much smaller than [Ca-EDTA]. But I'm not sure if that approximation is valid here.

Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of the complex. So, the initial [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M. Now, the complex dissociates a little into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But since K is very large (5e10), the dissociation is minimal. So, the amount of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be very small compared to 0.02 M.

So, let's denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, assuming that each complex that dissociates releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait, that makes sense because the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ Ca-EDTA. So, the stoichiometry is 1:1:1.

So, [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 M because x is so small that 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, substituting into the K expression:

K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])  
5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x)  
5e10 = 0.02 / x²  
So, x² = 0.02 / 5e10  
x² = 2e-3 / 5e10  
Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, right? So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12. So x² = 4e-13? Wait, wait, let me calculate again.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2 M. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me think: sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6. So sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, because 6.5 * 2 is 13. So 2e-6.5 would be 2 * (1e-6.5) ≈ 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7. Wait, wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

So [Ca²+] is around 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me recheck. The formation constant K is 5e10. So:

K = [Ca-EDTA] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA] )

We assumed [Ca²+] = [EDTA] = x.

So, 5e10 = 0.02 / x² → x² = 0.02 /5e10 → 0.02 is 2e-2 → 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → x²=4e-13 → x=2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7 M. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, can I think of it as the concentration of free Ca²+ being (0.02 M) / (sqrt(K)) ?

Because rearranging K = [C]/(x²), x = sqrt( [C]/K )

[C is 0.02, K is 5e10. So x = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) )

Which is sqrt( (2e-2) / (5e10) ) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7.

Yes, that's the same result. So the answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²+]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant equation:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, \( K = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the concentration of the complex \([\text{Ca-EDTA}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Since the dissociation of the complex is minimal due to the large \( K \), we assume that \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\). Substituting these into the equation:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{0.4 \times 10^{-12}} = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
