Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and phosphate ions. Hmm, let me take a deep breath and think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. In it, there's 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium phosphate. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I won't need any adjustments for that. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO₄^3-.

Wait, but orthophosphate is H3PO4. Oh wait no, orthophosphate is the fully protonated form, H3PO4, but in solution, it can lose protons to form H2PO4^- and so on. So in this context, the orthophosphate ions probably refer to HPO4^2-? Or maybe PO4^3-? Wait, no, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated species, which is PO4^3-. But wait, this is a buffer solution problem, so I might be mixing things up.

Wait, the salts given are KH₂PO4 and Na₂HPO4·2H2O. So, KH₂PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. The Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since the formula is Na2HPO4, it's HPO4^2-). So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These are the conjugate acid and base of the phosphate buffer system.

Wait, the buffer system here would be H2PO4^- (which can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-). So the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm, orthophosphate is generally considered as H3PO4, but in solution, it's more likely that when we talk about orthophosphate ions, we're referring to HPO4^2-? Or maybe PO4^3-? Wait, no, I think orthophosphate is the HPO4^3- form, but wait, no. Wait, no, wait, the phosphate ion is PO4^3-. The fully deprotonated form is PO4^3-.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: H3PO4 is the triprotic acid. It can lose three protons. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (with Ka1 = 7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8). The third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 =
