Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the optical theorem comes into play here.

The given phase shifts are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁ = 67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The question tells me to ignore the rest, so I guess higher-order phase shifts beyond δ₄ aren't considered here.

Wait, I think the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude (f) at the direction of the incident beam (θ=0°) is given by something like f(0) = (1/(2m))^(1/2) times the sum of e^(2iδ_l) for each l, multiplied by some factors. Or wait, am I mixing things up? I recall that the scattering amplitude f can be expressed in terms of the phase shifts δ_l. Specifically, f(θ=0) has an imaginary part that depends on the sum of certain terms involving the phase shifts.

Wait, the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is related to the sum over l of (2l + 1) times sin(2δ_l). Because for each angular momentum state l, the contribution to the imaginary part comes from 2δ_l. Oh wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression. Let me think.

I remember that the optical theorem relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. The formula is something like Im(f(0)) = (1/(4π)) * ∑ (2l + 1) sin(2δ_l), where the sum is over all partial waves l. Alternatively, maybe it's (1/(2m))^{1/2} multiplied by that sum. Wait, no, the exact expression might involve the reduced mass or something else.

Wait, I think the general expression is:

f(θ, φ) = ∑ [ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ] P_l(cosθ) e^{iφ l}

So for the forward direction, θ=0°, cosθ=1, and P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So f(0) = ∑ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1). Then, the imaginary part of f(0) is the sum over l of (2l+1) * Im(e^{2iδ_l} - 1). Since e^{iθ} - 1 = e^{iθ/2} (e^{iθ/2} - e^{-iθ/2}) = 2i e^{iθ/2} sin(θ/2). So the imaginary part would be (2l+1) * 2 sin(δ_l), because 2i * sin(δ_l) comes from the expansion.

Wait, let me work it out more carefully. The term e^{2iδ_l} - 1 can be expanded as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) - 1. The imaginary part is sin(2δ_l). So Im(f(0)) is the sum over l of (2l+1)* sin(2δ_l) multiplied by something else. What's the overall factor?

Wait, I think the general formula is:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2m))^{1/2} * (1/(2)) ) * sum( (2l + 1) sin(2δ_l) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to look up the formula mentally. I think the correct expression for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2m))^{1/2} * (1/(2)) ) * sum_{l} (2l + 1) sin(2δ_l)

Wait, but I'm not confident. Another approach: in the partial wave expansion, the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ, φ) = ∑_{l=0}^{∞} (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} P_l(cosθ)

So f(0) is the sum over l of (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l}.

The imaginary part of f(0) is the sum of (2l+1) * Im(e^{2iδ_l}) ) = sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

So the imaginary part is sum_{l} (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

But wait, I think I missed a factor. Because earlier,
