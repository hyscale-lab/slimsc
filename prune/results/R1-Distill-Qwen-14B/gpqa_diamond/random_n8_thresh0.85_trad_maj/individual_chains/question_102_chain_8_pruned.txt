Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair and a mouse model. Hmm, I'll need to break this down step by step.

Alright, let me read through the question again to make sure I get all the details. So, the setup is that they've identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and want to study their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets creating a binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices.

They've made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means two genes in one construct. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. So, the structure is probably CBA promoter driving the ligand, then an IRES for the receptor.

Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Oh, right, I remember that loxP sites are used for Cre-mediated recombination. So, when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are excised, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them in Western blot. The blot shows a signal proportional to actin, which suggests the proteins are being expressed and detected correctly.

Then they made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, I think. SOX10-Cre would activate Cre in neural crest cells or their derivatives.

After the offspring are born, they visualize under a confocal microscope. They're looking for green signal, which would come from eGFP. But they didn't see any green signal. So what's wrong?

The options are A to D. Let's think each one through.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But in this case, the vector is bicistronic, so both ligand and receptor are being expressed in the same cells. If they're paracrine, maybe the ligand acts on neighboring cells where the receptor isn't expressed. But if the same cell is expressing both, perhaps it's autocrine. But why would this cause no eGFP signal? The eGFP is under the receptor's expression, so presence of ligand on the same cell wouldn't directly affect eGFP expression. Unless the ligand-receptor interaction affects expression, but the question says they've already expressed the proteins as per Western blot. So maybe A isn't the main issue.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in Golgi. Well, eGFP is a fluorescent tag, so if the receptor isn't reaching the cell surface, it won't fluoresce. Also, if the construct is stuck in Golgi, it might not be expressed on the membrane. But how would that happen? The question says they expressed the proteins correctly in Western blot. Western would detect the protein regardless of its localization. So if the receptor is not properly trafficked, the Western would still show the protein, but it might not be on the cell surface. But in the question, the Western blot is done on total proteins, so it would pick up regardless of localization. So maybe the eGFP is expressed, but not at the cell surface. But if the vector is correctly made, the receptor should traffic properly. Another possibility: The eGFP is fused to the C-terminus, which might interfere with proper folding or trafficking. But then the Western would detect it. So perhaps it's correctly expressed but not on the surface. But why would the mouse model not show eGFP under confocal? Maybe the expression isn't in the right cell type.

Wait, the vector is under CBA promoter for the ligand. The receptor is after IRES. So both should be expressed in the same cells. But perhaps the problem is that the Cre isn't properly excising the stop cassettes. Let's think: the vector is a bicistronic construct with loxP and lox2272 sites. The loxP is upstream of the ligand, and lox2272 is upstream of the receptor. Wait, the ligand is at 5' with mCherry, stop in loxP cassette, then the receptor with eGFP and stop in lox2272. So when Cre is introduced, which recognizes loxP sites, it should excise the stops, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But what if the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is present? They crossed the mice with SOX10-Cre, which probably targets Cre to neural crest-derived cells. So in those cells, the stops should be excised, leading to expression of both mCherry and eGFP.

So if no green signal (eGFP), it suggests that the eGFP isn't expressed. Or the construct isn't properly activated.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter. The CBA promoter is a strong promoter, so probably it's sufficient for expression. The receptor is after IRES, which allows for internal ribosome entry, so it's expressed in the same cells as the ligand. If the promoter is missing, both might not express, but the Western blot showed that the proteins were expressed. So C is probably not the issue.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, wait, the question says the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. Now, if the stop cassette isn't properly excised, the receptor may not be expressed. But if the stop is there, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But in the presence of Cre, the stop is excised.

Wait, the vector: the ligand is at 5', mCherry, with a
