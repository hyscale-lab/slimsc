Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to tackle it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of certain functional groups, maybe like nitriles or something else. Wait, or was it for elimination reactions? No, I think hydrolysis... Let me think. Oh right, maybe it's for the hydrolysis of an ester or maybe a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? Or perhaps it's related to the formation of an alcohol from a nitrile. Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused about the exact reaction here. Oh wait, I think when you have a nitrile and treat it with H2O and H+ (maybe like HI and red phosphorus?), it can hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI might be used for the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. Or perhaps it's for the dehydrohalogenation, but that might require a different setup.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. Oh, but I'm not 100% sure. Let's think about the other part first: determining what Compound X is.

Looking at the IR data first. The IR shows strong peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which is a broad region, probably indicating O-H stretching, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then, there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a carboxylic acid, ester, ketone, or maybe an aldehyde. But combined with the 3400-2500 peak, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because esters also have carbonyl but their O-H is usually less broad or absent, unless it's an acid. Wait, no, esters don't have O-H. So if the IR has both a strong 3400-2500 (broad, possibly O-H) and 1720 (carbonyl), that points to a carboxylic acid. So compound X is possibly a benzoic acid derivative.

Now looking at the NMR data. Let's parse it.

The 1H NMR shows several signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a singlet around 10.5, which is very deshielded. That's characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. So, the compound has a -COOH group.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, two protons as a pair in the para positions. So, if the ring has substituents in para positions, like a methyl group and a substituent with a COOH group.

Wait, but the carboxylic acid is usually attached to the ring as a substituent. So if the ring has a COOH group and another substituent in the para position, that would make sense. Let's think about the substituents. For example, if the ring is benzene with a COOH group at position 1 and another group at position 4, but wait, the substituents can be in positions 1 and 4 or 2 and 5, etc. But the NMR shows two doublets, each 2H, which is typical for a para-substituted benzene. So the ring has two substituents in para positions, one being the COOH group, and the other something else.

Wait, but let me think. The two doublets each integrating to 2H suggest that the aromatic protons are split into two sets of two equivalent protons. So, the substituents are in the para positions. For example, if you have a substituent at position 2 and another at position 5, then the protons at 3 and 6 would be equivalent, and protons at 4 and 1 would be equivalent. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent in the para position, and maybe a substituent elsewhere. Wait, perhaps it's a disubstituted benzene where the substituents are at the para positions, but I might be getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent in the ortho, meta, or para positions relative to each other.

But wait, let's think about the H NMR for benzene derivatives. For example, if you have two substituents on a benzene ring, say at positions 1 and 4, then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The coupling would determine the splitting. Let's say substituents are at 1 and 4. Then, the protons at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the substituent at 1, and their chemical shifts would be influenced by the substituent. Similarly, protons at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to the substituent at 4.

Wait, but in our NMR, the two doublets are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. Let me think about typical shifts. The higher ppm (8.0) would correspond to protons that are more deshielded, which is typical of being ortho to an electron-withdrawing group, like a COOH group
