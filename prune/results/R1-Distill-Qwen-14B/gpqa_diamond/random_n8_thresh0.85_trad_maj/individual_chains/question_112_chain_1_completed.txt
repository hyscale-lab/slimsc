Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of all these concepts. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The first thing I remember is that when a state is given as proportional, I need to normalize it. So I'll probably have to find the normalization constant so that the sum of the probabilities is 1.

Wait, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I know are the standard basis states for spin-½ particles. So, the state |alpha> can be written as a vector in this two-dimensional space. The components are (1+i) for |up> and (2-i) for |down>. But since it's proportional, I'll have to normalize it.

Let me write down the state. Let's say |alpha> = c1 |up> + c2 |down>, where c1 is (1+i) and c2 is (2-i). To normalize, I'll calculate the inner product of |alpha> with itself and set it to 1. The inner product is c1^* * c1 + c2^* * c2. Wait, no, more accurately, it's |c1|^2 + |c2|^2, because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

So I should compute |1+i|^2 and |2−i|^2. The modulus squared of a complex number a+bi is a² + b². So for 1+i, it's 1² +1² = 2. For 2−i, it's 2² + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the sum is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but the question says it's proportional, so maybe the state is already given in terms of |up> and |down> without normalization. Hmm, but for probabilities, I definitely need the state to be normalized. So I'll proceed with the normalized version.

The next part of the question asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator's matrix representation A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Let me write that down.

So matrix A is:
[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0 ]

What's the nature of this operator? It looks like a spin operator in the x or y direction, but wait, let me think. The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. The spin operator S is (ħ/2) sigma for each direction. So, for example, Sx has elements [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2,0]], but that's not exactly correct. Wait, no—sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so Sx would be (ħ/2) sigma_x, which would have elements [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So yes, operator A is Sx, the spin-x operator.

So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of Sx, which are the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). These correspond to spin-up and spin-down along the x-axis.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the probability of measuring the electron in each eigenstate of Sx. Alternatively, we can express the state |alpha> in terms of the eigenbasis of A (which is the Sx eigenbasis) and then the probabilities are the square of the coefficients.

So, let me denote the eigenstates of A as |+x> and |-x>, where:
|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

We can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the expansion coefficients directly. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate of A, which will give the amplitude, and the square gives the probability.

Wait, let's think about it. The probability to measure a particular eigenstate is the square of the amplitude of that eigenstate in the given state.

So let me find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me write |alpha> as:
|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>

So I can solve for a and b.

Alternatively, compute a = < +x | alpha > and b = < -x | alpha >.

Let's compute a first. The state |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So:

a = < +x | alpha > = [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) / sqrt(7) ]

Wait, but wait, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, and normalized by 1/sqrt(7), so:

So |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down> ] / sqrt(7)

So,

a = [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

The inner products simplify as:

a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Wait, because <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1, and cross terms are zero. So:

( <up| + <down| ) ( |up> ) = <up|up> + <down|up> = 1 + 0 =1

Same for |down> component:

( <up| + <down| ) ( |down> ) = <up|down> + <down|down> = 0 +1=1.

So a becomes ( (1+i) + (2 -i) ) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)

Simplify numerator: 1 +i +2 -i = 3. So a = 3 / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14)

Similarly, compute b = < -x | alpha >.

The state |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So,

b = [ ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Again, inner products:

<up| (1+i)|up> = (1+i) * <up|up> = 1+i
<up| (2-i)|down> = (2-i) * <up|down> =0
< down| (1+i)|up> = (1+i) * <down|up> =0
< down| (2-i)|down> = (2-i) * <down|down> = 2 -i

So the numerator is (1+i) + (2 -i) ) ?

Wait, no. Let me compute each term:

Breaking it down: [ <up| - <down| ] multiplied by (1+i)|up> gives (1+i) <up|up> - (1+i) <down|up> = (1+i)(1) - (1+i)(0) =1+i.

Then, [ <up| - <down| ] multiplied by (2−i)|down> gives (2−i) <up|down> - (2−i) <down|down> =0 - (2−i)(1) = -(2−i).

So the total numerator is (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So b = [ (-1) + 2i ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

So the coefficients a and b are:

a = 3 / sqrt(14)
b = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

Wait, but when calculating the probabilities, we take the square of the modulus of a and b. So |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Calculating |a|^2: (3)^2 / (14) )=9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

|b|^2: [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, wait a minute! Because when you have a complex number z = a + ib, the modulus squared is a² + b².

So |b|^2 is [ (-1)² + (2)^2 ] / (14) = (1 +4)/14=5/14 ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are about 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357. But looking at the options, the first option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which would sum to 1. So this seems to match.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation of a and b because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate a.

a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

(1+i) + (2-i) = 3 + 0i =3.

So a = 3 / sqrt(14). So |a|^2 is 9/14.

For b, I had:

[ (1+i) * <up|up> ] + [ (2−i) * <down|down> ] ?

Wait no, in the calculation for b, the inner product is:

b = [ ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So when you compute the inner product, you get:

(1+i) <up|up> - (1+i) <down|up> + (2-i) <up|down> - (2-i) <down|down>

Which simplifies to (1+i)(1) + 0 +0 - (2-i)(1) = (1+i) - (2-i) = (1 -2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So the numerator is (-1 +2i) and denominator is sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) = sqrt(14).

So b = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14). So |b|^2 is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1+4)/14=5/14.

So probabilities are 9/14≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A has probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, which matches approximately.

Now, the second part of the question is to find the average value of that operator.

The operator A is given, and the state is |alpha>.

The average value (expectation value) is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But wait, another approach: since A is Sx, the spin-x operator. The expectation value would be <Sx> = (ħ/2) <sigma_x>, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Alternatively, compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

But let me compute it using the definition.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7), let's write this as a vector.

Let me denote |up> as (1,0) and |down> as (0,1). So, the state |alpha> can be written as a vector:

( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2−i)/sqrt(7) )^T.

Operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

Compute A|alpha>:

First element: 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2) * (2−i)/sqrt(7) = (ħ/2)(2−i)/sqrt(7)
Second element: (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2−i)/sqrt(7) = (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7)

So A|alpha> is:

[ (ħ/2)(2−i)/sqrt(7),
  (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Now, compute <alpha| A |alpha>, which is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A|alpha>.

Conjugate of |alpha> is [ (1−i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ].

So the dot product is:

[ (1−i)/sqrt(7) ) * (ħ/2)(2−i)/sqrt(7) ) ] +
[ (2+i)/sqrt(7) ) * (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Compute each term.

First term: (1−i)(2−i) * (ħ/2) /7
Multiply (1−i)(2−i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 −i −2i + i²
= 2 −3i −1 (since i²=−1)
= 1 −3i

Second term: (2+i)(1+i) * (ħ/2) /7
Multiply (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i
= 2 +2i +i +i²
= 2+3i −1 =1 +3i

So putting it all together:

= [ (1 −3i) + (1 +3i) ) ] * (ħ/2) /7
= (2) * (ħ/2) /7
= (2 * ħ/2) /7
= ħ /7.

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says the average is hbar/7. So option A has probabilities 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7.

Alternatively, let me think if there's a smarter way to compute the expectation value. Since A is the Sx operator, the expectation value is <Sx> = (ħ/2) times the expectation of sigma_x.

Another way: the expectation of sigma_x for a state |psi> is (psi_x, psi_y, psi_z) where psi is the spinor. Wait, no, more accurately, the expectation value is (psi_x^* psi_x + ... )? Wait, no, another approach: the expectation value of sigma_x is given by the formula:

< sigma_x > = ( |c1|^2 + |c2|^2_ ... wait, no, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so the expectation is c1^* c2 + c2^* c1, where c1 is the first component and c2 the second.

Wait, the expectation value is <sigma_x> = [ (c1^* c2) + (c2^* c1) ].

So for our state |alpha> = [ a, b ]^T, the expectation would be a^* b + b^* a.

So a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), b is (2−i)/sqrt(7).

Compute a^* = (1−i)/sqrt(7)
Compute b^* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7)

a^* b = (1−i)(2−i) /7. Let's compute this:

(1−i)(2−i)= 2 -i -2i +i² = 2 -3i -1=1 -3i.

b^* a = (2+i)(1+i) /7. Compute:

(2+i)(1+i)=2(1) +2i +i(1) +i^2 =2 +3i -1=1+3i.

So a^* b + b^* a = (1-3i +1 +3i)/7 = (2)/7 = 2/7.

So <sigma_x> is 2/7. Therefore, <Sx> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

So yes, the expectation is ħ/7, which matches the earlier calculation.

So now, looking back at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7 → which matches our probabilities and expectation.

Wait, but wait another thing! The probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6429 and 0.3571. So 0.64 and 0.36 are approximations, but the option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which are close. So probability 1 is 9/14=0.642857..., which is approximately 0.643. So 0.64 is a reasonable choice.

So option A is the one with 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7.

Wait, but I should double-check the probabilities. 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357142. So the first probability is about 64.28%, the second about 35.71%. So when the options give 0.64 and 0.36, it's a slight approximation but correct.

So the options are:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7 → which matches.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves an electron state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The state is normalized as |α⟩ = [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]/√7. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A is to be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize, compute the modulus squared of the coefficients:
- |1+i|² = 1² + 1² = 2
- |2-i|² = 2² + (-1)² = 4 + 1 = 5

The total normalization factor is √(2 + 5) = √7. Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩}{\sqrt{7}}
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of operator A
The operator A has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]
This corresponds to the spin-x operator \( S_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ + |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ - |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

### Step 3: Expand |α⟩ in the eigenbasis of A
To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x⟩ \) and \( |-x⟩ \), express |α⟩ in terms of these eigenstates. The coefficients are:
\[
a = ⟨+x|α⟩ = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{2} \sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad b = ⟨-x|α⟩ = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{2} \sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

The probabilities are the square of the moduli of these coefficients:
\[
|a|² = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad |b|² = \left(\frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357
\]

### Step 4: Average value of A
The expectation value of A is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle α|A|α⟩
\]
Using the matrix representation of A and the normalized state |α⟩, compute:
\[
A|α⟩ = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \\
\frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}
\end{bmatrix}
= \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}}
\begin{bmatrix}
2 - i \\
1 + i
\end{bmatrix}
\]
The inner product ⟨α|A|α⟩ is:
\[
\langle α|A|α⟩ = \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} \left[(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)\right]/\sqrt{7}
\]
Simplify:
\[
(1-i)(2-i) = 1 - 3i, \quad (2+i)(1+i) = 1 + 3i
\]
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{(1-3i) + (1+3i)}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357, and the average value is \( \hbar/7 \). These match the values in **Option A**: 0.64, 0.36, and \( \hbar/7 \).

Answer: A
