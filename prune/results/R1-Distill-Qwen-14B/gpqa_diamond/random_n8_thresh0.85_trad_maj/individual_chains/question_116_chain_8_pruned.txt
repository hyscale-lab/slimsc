Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll try my best.

The question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, NMR signals can tell us about the structure, right? Let's think about what those signals could mean.

A triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is a downfield region for protons, but 0.9 is more like upfield. Wait, no, 0.9 is actually upfield. Oh wait, no, I think I got that backwards. High ppm is more deshielded, so downfield. So 0.9 is upfield, which is typical for CH3 groups attached to something like CH2, maybe in an ethyl group. 

So the triplet (0.9 ppm, 6H) probably comes from two sets of equivalent CH3 groups. Like maybe two CH2CH3 groups. Because each triplet would have two neighboring protons. Wait, no, a triplet suggests each proton is next to two equivalent protons. Oh, wait, wait. Let's think about splitting. A triplet is caused by coupling with two equivalent protons. So maybe each of these 6H are in a environment where they're next to a CH2 group. Like maybe two CH2CH3 groups. Because each CH3 would be next to a CH2, so each triplet. So perhaps it's something like (CH2CH3)2. But wait, the other signal is a quartet (1.3 ppm, 4H). Quartet means each proton is next to three equivalent protons. Or wait, no, a quartet arises from coupling with three equivalent protons. Because for n+1, where n is the number of neighboring H. So a quartet would come from a CH2 group next to a CH3 group, because 3 H on the CH3 would split the CH2 into a quartet.

Wait, let me think. Suppose we have a structure like CH2CH2CH3. No, that's not possible. Wait, maybe a structure where a CH2 is adjacent to a CH3. So, maybe the quartet is from a CH2 next to a CH3, which would cause each of the CH2 protons to split into a quartet. So, each quartet has 4 peaks, meaning they're split by three neighboring H (so the CH3 has three H, so the CH2 next to it would be a quartet).

So putting it together: the quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H) is a CH2 group, and the triplet at 0.9 ppm is two CH3 groups. The structure that fits this is diethyl something, maybe ethyl groups attached to something else.

Wait, another possibility: if there are two ethyl groups attached to a central carbon. Like maybe CH2CH2C(CH2CH3)2. Wait, no, that might not have the right NMR. Wait, if the central atom is connected to two ethyl groups and another group. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl ether? No, that's OCH2CH3, but that would have
