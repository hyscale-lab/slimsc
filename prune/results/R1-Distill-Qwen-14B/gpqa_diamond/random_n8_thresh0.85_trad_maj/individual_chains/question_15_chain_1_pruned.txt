Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, let me see. Alright, the question is comparing two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time.

Wait, so both have been detected via the RV method, which means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh, right, the RV method gives us that. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right? Because a shorter orbital period usually means a closer orbit.

And both have circular orbits, which is good because eccentricity can complicate transit probabilities. So no worries about that factor.

Now, the host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But wait, both stars have the same radii. Interesting. So higher mass but same radiusâ€”Planet_1's star must be more massive but perhaps smaller? Or maybe it's the same size because it's evolved? Wait, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved. So, the host of Planet_1 is probably a main-sequence star with higher mass, same radius as the evolved star. Hmm, how does that affect the transit probability?

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. The formula for transit probability is something like (R_planet + R_star) / (a_planet), but wait, no, I think it's actually (R_star + R_planet) squared over a squared, but I might be mixing it up.

Wait, no, the transit probability (P) is approximately (R_star / a) * something else? Or is it the ratio of the size of the planet's orbit to the star's size? Let me think. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit.

Wait, I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits. Oh wait, no, the geometric probability is (R_star / a), because the planet has to pass in front of the star as seen from Earth. So the probability is roughly (R_star / a), but wait, actually for small R_planet,
