Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. But wait, this is relativistic, so things are different. Let me think.

The problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, so it's obeying Hooke's law. The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max. And the options involve some combination with c, the speed of light.

In the classical case, maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator occurs when all potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv². Solving that gives v = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's option C. But wait, this is relativistic, so that can't be right.

Relativistic mechanics come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So the classical formula isn't valid here. I remember that in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². It's (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total mechanical energy in relativity would still be the sum of kinetic and potential, but the expressions are different. At maximum speed, the oscillator is at the equilibrium point, where all potential energy is converted to kinetic. Wait, no, actually, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2)kx², and kinetic is (γ-1)mc² v²/(something). Wait, not sure.

Let me think again. The total mechanical energy E is conserved. At maximum displacement (x=A), the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so all energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, is the potential energy still (1/2)kA²? Or does it change? Hmm, I think the potential energy in relativistic cases can be different, but sometimes people approximate it as classical. Or maybe in this problem, they're assuming the potential is classical, but the kinetic is relativistic.

Wait, but the problem says it's a relativistic oscillator, so I can't treat it classically. So let's model the energy properly.

At position x, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². The kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The total mechanical energy E is the sum of both. At maximum amplitude A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential, so E = (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium position (x=0), the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is the kinetic energy. So, E = (γ - 1)mc². So set them equal:

(1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc².

So, (γ - 1) = (kA²)/(2mc²).

Then, γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

But γ is also equal to 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

Let me denote (kA²)/(2mc²) as a term for simplicity. Let's call it term = (kA²)/(2mc²). So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + term.

Wait, but if term is small compared to 1, maybe we can approximate. But not sure if that's the case here. Let's proceed algebraically.

We can rewrite the equation as:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + term).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + term)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + term)^2.

So,

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + term)^2 ].

Hmm, let's compute 1 - [1/(1 + term)^2] as [ (1 + term)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + term)^2.

Wait, wait: 1 - (1/(1 + term)^2) = [ (1 + term)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + term)^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2 term + term^2) -1 = 2 term + term^2.

So,

v² = c² (2 term + term^2) / (1 + term)^2.

But term is (kA²)/(2mc²). Let's substitute back.

So,

v² = c² [ 2*(kA²)/(2mc²) + (kA²/(2mc²))^2 ] / [1 + kA²/(2mc²)]^2.

Simplify numerator:

2*(kA²)/(2mc²) = (kA²)/(mc²).

So numerator becomes (kA²)/(mc²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Denominator is [ (2mc² + kA² )/(2mc²) ]^2 = (2mc² + kA²)^2/(4 m² c^4).

Wait, maybe I should factor terms differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out (kA²/(2mc²))^2 from the numerator.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor:

Let me factor out (kA²/(2mc²)) from numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me denote term = (kA²)/(2mc²). So term is the same as earlier.

So,

v² = c² [ (2 term + term² ) ] / (1 + term)^2.

So,

v² = c² * [ term (2 + term) ] / (1 + term)^2.

We can write this as c² * [ term (2 + term) / (1 + term)^2 ].

But looking at the answer options, they seem to have square roots and terms like 1/(1 - ... ) or similar. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express v in terms of c. Let's see:

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + term)^2 ].

We can write this as v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + term)^2 ).

Hmm. Let me compute 1/(1 + term)².

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's expand 1/(1 + term)² as 1/(1 + 2 term + term²) ≈ 1 - 2 term + 3 term², but that's a Taylor expansion, which might not be helpful here.

Wait, perhaps we can write 1 - 1/(1 + term)^2 as [ (1 + term)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + term)^2.

Wait, that's how we got earlier. So,

v = c * sqrt( [ 2 term (1 + term/2) ] / (1 + term)^2 ) ?

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the expression for v.

Wait, from the earlier expression:

(γ -1) = (kA²)/(2mc²).

But also, since γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²),

So,

γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

Let me compute 1/γ²:

1/γ² = (1 - v²/c²) = [ 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)) ]².

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))]^2.

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2mc²) ))^2 ].

Taking square roots,

v = c sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + (kA²/(2mc²)) )^2 ] ).

Hmm, that's an expression, but let's see if it can be simplified.

Alternatively, let me write 1 - 1/(1 + term)^2 as [ (1 + term)^2 - 1 ]/(1 + term)^2.

Which is [1 + 2 term + term^2 - 1] / (1 + term)^2.

Which is [2 term + term^2] / (1 + term)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 term + term²) / (1 + term)^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( term (2 + term) ) / (1 + term) )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if any of the options match this. Let's look at the options:

Option A: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m)) )^2 )

Not sure. Let's compute:

Wait, maybe let's try to manipulate the expression.

We have v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + term )^2 ].

Which is [ (1 + term )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + term )^2.

Which is (1 + 2 term + term² -1 ) / (1 + term )^2.

= (2 term + term² ) / (1 + term )^2.

Factor numerator: term (2 + term ).

So,

v²/c² = [ term (2 + term ) ] / (1 + term )^2.

Hmm, in terms of term.

Alternatively, perhaps factor term as follows:

Wait, let me write term as (kA²)/(2mc²). Let me see if I can express this in terms of 1/(1 - term'), perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to express the fraction inside the square root as 1 plus something.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c²) )) )

Wait, that would be sqrt(1 + something), but my expression is sqrt(1 - something), so maybe not.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²) ))^2 )

Wait, that's similar to my expression. Let me compute.

Wait, my expression is v = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + term)]² )

Where term is (kA²)/(2 m c² )

So,

1 - [ 1/(1 + term) ]² = 1 - 1/(1 + term)^2.

Which is the same as [ (1 + term)^2 -1 ]/(1 + term)^2.

Which is (2 term + term²)/(1 + term)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 term + term²) / (1 + term)^2 )

= c * sqrt( term (2 + term) ) / (1 + term )

Hmm, but none of the options match this directly. Let me look again.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m)) )^2 )

Wait, that's 1 + [1/( ... ) ]^2.

Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me go back.

So, the total energy E is (1/2)kA², that's potential at x=A.

At x=0, the kinetic energy is E = (γ-1) mc².

So,

(1/2)kA² = (γ -1) mc².

Then,

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

γ = 1 + term, where term is (k A²)/(2 m c² ).

Thus,

1/ sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2 ) = 1 + term.

So,

sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1/(1 + term).

Squaring both sides,

1 - (v^2/c^2 ) = 1/(1 + term )^2.

Rearranged,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + term )^2.

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + term )^2 )

= c sqrt( [ (1 + term )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + term )^2 )

= c sqrt( (1 + 2 term + term^2 -1 ) / (1 + term )^2 )

= c sqrt( (2 term + term^2 ) / (1 + term )^2 )

= c * sqrt( term (2 + term ) ) / (1 + term )

Hmm. So,

v = c * sqrt( term (2 + term ) ) / (1 + term )

But none of the options directly match this. Let me compute denominator and numerator.

Alternatively, let me write the term as x = (kA²)/(2 m c² )

So, v = c * sqrt( x (2 + x ) ) / (1 + x )

But this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let me compute the expression under the square root:

x (2 + x ) / (1 + x )^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write it as [ x (2 + x) ] / (1 + x )^2 = [ x(2 + x) ] / (1 + x )^2.

But not seeing a straightforward way to simplify.

Wait, let's see the options again.

Looking at option D:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2)) )^2 )

Wait, that's exactly the expression I have. Because,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + term )^2 ] )

So option D is exactly that. Because term is (kA²)/(2 m c² )

So,

1/(1 + term )^2 = 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) )^2.

So option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( [1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2 ) )

Which matches what I derived. So option D is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me look. Option D says:

D) v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 mc^2))^2 ) )

Wait, no, wait: option D says 1/(1 + ... )^2 ?

Wait, option D says:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 mc^2) ))^2 )

Yes, exactly. So that's correct.

Wait, but I thought earlier that option D had the expression: 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2mc^2) )^2 )

Wait, no, no, no. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option D says: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, no, the denominator is (1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2 )))^2.

So yes, that's exactly what I have.

So the correct answer is option D.

But wait, let me check the other options quickly.

Option A has 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2m) ) )^2. But in our case, the denominator is (1 + term ), where term is (kA²/(2 m c² )). So, the denominator in option A is 1 - (kA^2/(2m) ), which would be a much larger term, perhaps leading to a negative denominator if kA²/(2m) >1. But that's not the case here, so Option A is likely incorrect.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2 m c² )) )

Hmm, that would be adding 1 and a term, but in our case, it's 1 minus a term, so option B is different.

Option C is the classical result, which we know isn't correct in the relativistic case.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we use relativistic energy conservation. The total mechanical energy \( E \) is conserved, and at maximum displacement \( x = A \), all energy is potential, given by \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all energy is kinetic, expressed as \( E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Solving for \( \gamma \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), substituting this gives:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( \text{term} = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \text{term}}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{(1 + \text{term})^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \text{term})^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \text{term} = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we get:

\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A**: The denominator involves \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m} \), which is not consistent with the relativistic energy conservation.
- **Option B**: The expression inside the square root incorrectly adds terms, which does not match the derived formula.
- **Option C**: This is the classical result and does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
