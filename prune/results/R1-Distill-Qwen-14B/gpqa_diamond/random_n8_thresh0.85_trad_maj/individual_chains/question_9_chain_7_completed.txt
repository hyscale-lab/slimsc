Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules refers to the various planes and axes that leave the molecule looking the same after certain operations. The notation C3h, I think, refers to a type of symmetry involving a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, the h in C3h stands for horizontal, right? So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis perpendicular to a horizontal mirror plane.

Let me think about each option and their structures.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Wait, the name is a bit complicated. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached. Trifuran would mean three furan rings, I think. And the numbering is a bit tricky. I'm picturing a structure with three phenyl groups attached to a central part, possibly a tricyclic system. The substitution pattern might be symmetric. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the symmetry here. If the molecule has three substituents arranged symmetrically around a central point, maybe it could have a three-fold axis. But wait, the h in C3h suggests a horizontal mirror plane as well.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

This one also has a benzo part, so a benzene ring. The trifuran indicates three furan rings attached. The numbering might be such that the substituents are in a symmetric pattern. I'm trying to visualize it. Maybe it's like a central tricyclic structure with benzene rings attached in a symmetrical way. But I'm not certain. Maybe benzene rings are arranged in a way that allows for a three-fold axis?

Option C: triisopropyl borate. So this is (i-Pr)3BO, right? The structure is a borate with three isopropyl groups attached to the boron. So the molecule is trigonal planar around the boron. Wait, each isopropyl group is a -CH(CH3)2 group. So, all three substituents are the same. So the structure should have a three-fold rotational symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane? Let's see: if you look along the B atom, each substituent is the same, so rotating 120 degrees would leave the molecule unchanged. But what about a mirror plane? If the molecule is non-planar, maybe the mirror plane is perpendicular to the B-atom's plane. Wait, the borate ion is trigonal planar, so the molecule is flat. So, a horizontal mirror plane would bisect the molecule. So, looking at this, triisopropyl borate has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), so it should have C3h symmetry. Hmm, so option C could be the answer.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure, I think. It has a bridge structure between two rings. The structure is a norbornane-like compound, which is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. Wait, but wait, I think quinuclidine is a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane? Or maybe another structure. Let me think. No, quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge, and it's known for its chair-like structure. But does it have C3h symmetry? Or maybe another symmetry type. Quinuclidine has a center of inversion, I believe. Because all the substituents are symmetrically placed. Wait, quinuclidine is a symmetric molecule, but what type of symmetry? It has a center of inversion, so it's symmetrical under a 180-degree rotation. So it's in the point group Ci. So it doesn't have C3h symmetry.

Wait, so if that's the case, then let me go back. The question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. So, the point group C3h would have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Let me think about each option again.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Structure is trigonal planar around B. So, three identical substituents, all isopropyl groups. So the molecule would have a three-fold axis of rotation. Also, because it's planar, there's a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the plane of the boron and substituents. So yes, that would give C3h symmetry. So this could be a candidate.

Option A: triphenyleno... The structure might have a trigonal arrangement, but I'm not entirely certain. The substituents are phenyl groups. If they're arranged symmetrically, maybe it's C3, but I'm not sure about the mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps option A has more than three substituents, making the symmetry lower.

Option B: benzo... This has a benzene ring attached. So, for example, if the structure is a central tricyclic system with three benzene rings attached symmetrically, then it might have a three-fold axis. But a benzene is a planar group. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe it's a six-membered ring with substituents in a way that allows for a three-fold symmetry. Alternatively, the presence of a benzene ring might disrupt the mirror plane. I'm not sure.

Another thought: which of these molecules is known for having C3h symmetry? Triisopropyl borate is a common example. Because it's a trigonal planar molecule with identical substituents, it definitely has a three-fold rotation axis. The horizontal mirror plane would slice through the boron and the plane of the substituents, reflecting each substituent onto itself, since they are all the same. So I'm leaning toward option C.

Wait, but the options are labeled A, B, C, D. The options list the molecules as:

A) triphenyleno... 

B) benzo...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So the options are given as A, B, C, D, each corresponding to the molecules listed. So the question is which of these four has C3h symmetry.

So, if option C is triisopropyl borate, which I think has C3h, then the correct answer is C.

Wait, wait, but I should double-check. What about the other options?

Quinuclidine (option D) has a Ci symmetry because it has a center of inversion. So it's not C3h.

Benzo[...]trifuran (option B) might have a three-fold axis, but let me think. If the substituents are arranged in a three-fold symmetric pattern, but perhaps their positions are such that only a three-fold rotation exists without a mirror plane. Alternatively, if the molecule is non-planar, the mirror plane might not be present. So perhaps it's C3, but not C3h.

Similarly, option A's structure might have a three-fold axis but no mirror plane, or perhaps a vertical mirror plane. So the presence of the mirror plane is crucial for C3h.

So, the only one that I'm confident has C3h symmetry is option C, triisopropyl borate.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the symmetry of each option. **C₃h** symmetry involves a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σᵢ). This means the molecule must appear unchanged after a 120° rotation and must also be symmetric with respect to a horizontal plane.

### Option A: **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
This molecule has three phenyl groups attached to a central tricyclic system. While the phenyl groups are symmetrically arranged, the molecule is non-planar, and there is no clear horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: **benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
This molecule has a benzene ring attached to a tricyclic system. The arrangement of the substituents may allow for a three-fold rotation axis (C₃), but the presence of the benzene ring disrupts the horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: **triisopropyl borate**
This molecule has a trigonal planar structure with three identical isopropyl groups attached to boron. The three-fold rotation axis (C₃) is evident, as rotating the molecule by 120° leaves it unchanged. Additionally, the molecule is planar, and a horizontal mirror plane (σᵢ) exists perpendicular to the plane of the boron atom and its substituents. This satisfies the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: **quinuclidine**
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge structure. It has a center of inversion (Ci) symmetry, meaning it appears unchanged after a 180° rotation. However, it does not have a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane, so it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion
The only molecule that satisfies the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry is **triisopropyl borate**.

Answer: C
