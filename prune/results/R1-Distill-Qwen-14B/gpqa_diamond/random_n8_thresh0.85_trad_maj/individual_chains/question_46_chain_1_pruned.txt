Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and figuring out how many products are formed, excluding ethene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform double bonds, right? So it's like swapping parts of the alkenes. Grubbs is especially good for ring-closing metathesis and other cross metathesis reactions.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. Wait, but wait, actually, 3-methylpent-1-ene... let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl branch on the third carbon. Wait, no, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but 3-methyl would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)2? Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pent has five carbons. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2. Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So if it's 3-methyl, then the third carbon (from the left) has a methyl group. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no, wait: pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, which is five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, the third carbon (C3) is CH2 in the original structure. So 3-methyl would add a methyl group to C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Because if the position is pent-1-ene, the chain must have five carbons. So C1 is double bonded to C2, then C3 is CH(CH3), followed by C
