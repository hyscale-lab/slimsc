Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology constructs and why a green signal isn't showing up under the microscope. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The setup is that they created a bicistronic vector using lox-Cre. I remember that bicistronic means two genes in one construct, so in this case, the ligand and the receptor are both being expressed from the same vector.

Looking at the vector details: the ligand's ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor has an IRES upstream, which I recall is an internal ribosome entry site—so the IRES allows for the translation of the second gene without the need for another promoter. So, the construct should express both ligand and receptor under these elements.

Now, between the ligand and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP, and between the receptor and eGFP, a stop with lox2272. Wait, I think loxP is a site recognized by Cre recombinase. So when Cre is present, it excises the stop cassette. So, in the absence of Cre, the stops would block expression of downstream fluorescent proteins. But when Cre is active, like in the presence of lox sites, the stops are removed, allowing the fluorescent tags to be expressed.

They transfected this plasmid into primary astrocytes and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. The blot's signal correlates with actin loading, which suggests that the blot is working correctly because actin is a housekeeping gene and a good loading control. But for the purpose of this question, the key observation is that after creating a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background, they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. Cre should be active in these mice, which would lead to the lox sites being cut, removing the stop cassettes. Then, the ligand and receptor should be expressed, along with mCherry and eGFP.

But when they looked under the confocal, there was no green signal. So why no eGFP? eGFP is on the receptor, right? So the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed or is not functional.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But I'm not sure how that would prevent eGFP from being expressed. The construct is in the same cells, so both should be expressed together. Unless the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells, but that doesn't prevent the eGFP expression in the same cell. So maybe this isn't the issue.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the eGFP is not properly trafficked, it might not fluoresce. But the problem says they used the Western blot and that the signal is proportional to actin. So if the protein is made but stuck in the Golgi, they might see it on the blot but not in the right place for fluorescence. But since they're looking for a green signal, maybe the GFP isn't getting to the cell surface, but the question is about expression in the mouse. Alternatively, if it's stuck in the ER or Golgi, it might not be expressed on the cell surface. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option C: Enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The construct has the CBA promoter for the ligand. CBA is a strong promoter, so it should drive expression. The receptor's expression is under the control of the IRES, which is after the ligand. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. The vector structure is: CBA promoter → ligand ORF → loxP-stop-loxP → mCherry. Then, IRES → receptor ORF → lox2272-stop-lox2272 → eGFP. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed (since the stop is after mCherry, which is after the ligand, but not sure). Wait, the presence of Cre would excise the loxP and lox2272 stops. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed, and the mCherry tag is just after it. Wait, no, the ligand is under CBA, then the stop is after mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, preventing mCherry from being expressed. But with Cre, the stop is removed, so both ligand and mCherry would be expressed. Similarly, for the receptor, the IRES would allow the receptor to be translated, and without the stop, eGFP would be expressed downstream.

Wait, but in the mouse model, they're homozygous for the construct. So the construct is present in their genome. They crossed with SOX10-Cre, which probably expresses Cre under the SOX10 promoter, active in neural crest cells or their derivatives. So the Cre should excise the lox sites, removing the stops. So the ligand and receptor should be expressed, along with their fluorescent tags.

But in the offspring, they're looking for green signal. The green is from eGFP on the receptor. So why no green? Possible options.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So the stop codon is in the way, and the eGFP isn't being properly expressed. Wait, but the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. If Cre deletes the stop, then the ORF continues into eGFP. But if the ORFs are not in frame, like if the receptor's stop is not properly spliced, the eGFP might not be correctly expressed. Alternatively, perhaps the fusion is incorrect. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the vector design. The ligand is at 5', fused to mCherry via a stop cassette. The receptor is at 3', with the IRES upstream, and then the ORF of the receptor, followed by a stop cassette, then eGFP.

Wait, but I think the way the construct is described, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, then after the ligand ORF is a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then mCherry. Then, after the IRES, the receptor ORF, followed by a stop cassette (lox2272), then eGFP.

When Cre is present, the loxP and lox2272 sites are recognized. So in the ligand region: Cre would excise the loxP-stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed after the ligand. Similarly, in the receptor region, the lox2272 would be excised, allowing eGFP to be expressed after the receptor.

Wait, but if the ligand and receptor are in a bicistronic construct with two separate stops, then Cre would allow both the ligand and receptor to be expressed, each with their fluorescent tags.

But in this case, the eGFP is on the receptor. So why no green?

Possibly, the eGFP isn't being expressed. One possibility is that the stop wasn't excised. But why would that happen? They crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should be active in neural crest or their derivatives. So the Cre should be active, excising the stop.

But perhaps the lox2272 site isn't compatible with Cre. Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different sites. I think that lox2272 is a variant that is more efficiently recognized by Cre, but perhaps in this case, the orientation or presence of other elements is causing an issue. Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't properly allowing the receptor to be expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame. Let me think about the way the construct is designed. The receptor ORF is followed by the stop cassette, then eGFP. So when Cre is present, the stop is excised, and the receptor is directly fused to eGFP. But if the stop is in the lox2272 cassette, the excision would remove the stop and allow the receptor and eGFP to be in frame. Wait, no: the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So when Cre deletes the stop, the receptor and eGFP would be connected. But if the stop is in a lox2272 cassette, perhaps the deletion doesn't just remove the stop but also affects the ORF.

Wait, perhaps the stop is in the same frame as the receptor. So the stop is after the receptor ORF but before eGFP. When Cre deletes the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, the receptor and eGFP would be in the same reading frame. But if the cassette is inserted in a way that the deletion doesn't just remove the stop but also causes a frame shift, the eGFP might not be correctly expressed. Alternatively, perhaps the insertion of the stop caused a frame shift, and when the stop is excised, the reading frame is restored, but the eGFP comes after.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's think about how the construct is built. The ORF of the receptor is followed by a stop codon, then the lox2272 site. Then, the eGFP starts. So, without Cre, the receptor's expression is stopped, and eGFP isn't expressed. With Cre, the stop is removed, so the receptor's ORF continues into eGFP. But if the stop was inserted in a way that the reading frame of eGFP is not correct, then eGFP might not be expressed.

Wait, but in the vector design, the stop is placed after the receptor's ORF. So the receptor's coding sequence is ended, followed by a stop, then lox2272, then eGFP. When Cre deletes the lox2272 and the stop, the receptor's coding sequence would end, and then the eGFP would start. But unless the stop was in-frame, the eGFP wouldn't be properly expressed. Wait, but generally, when you have a stop cassette, the stop is placed in a way that it's between the two ORFs, so the upstream ORF is terminated, and the downstream ORF is only expressed when the stop is removed.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the Western blot. The question says that in the Western blot, the signal is proportional to actin, which suggests that the proteins are being expressed. So the ligand and receptor are being expressed, as evidenced by the Western blot. But the eGFP is not showing up under the microscope. Hmm. Wait, but the Western blot is using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, which would be the ligand and receptor, I suppose. So if the ligand and receptor are being expressed, but eGFP isn't lighting up, that suggests that the eGFP isn't being expressed.

So why would the eGFP not be expressed, despite the presence of Cre? Well, perhaps the IRES isn't working. The IRES is upstream of the receptor ORF. So the IRES should allow for internal initiation of translation of the receptor, independent of the ligand's promoter. But if the IRES isn't functional, perhaps the receptor isn't being expressed, but that would affect the Western blot, which shows proper loading. Wait, no: the Western blot shows that the proteins are present, so the receptor is being expressed.

Wait, but the eGFP is on the receptor construct. If the eGFP is not being expressed, that's a problem with the downstream expression after the receptor. So perhaps the problem is that the eGFP isn't being correctly translated. But why?

Wait, in the vector, the receptor is followed by a stop, then eGFP. So when the stop is removed by Cre, the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF, but how? Let me imagine the DNA sequence. The receptor's ORF ends, then a stop codon, then the lox2272 site, then the start of eGFP. When Cre deletes the stop and the lox sites, the eGFP's ORF would start right after the receptor's. But this would potentially create a situation where the receptor's stop is removed, and the eGFP starts. So, the two ORFs are in the same reading frame.

But if the stop was in a different frame, perhaps the eGFP would not be correctly in frame, leading to a premature stop or no expression. Wait, but if the stop is after the receptor's ORF, and the eGFP's start is right after, without a frame shift, then in the absence of the stop, the eGFP would be expressed. So that suggests that the stop is in the same frame as the receptor, so when removed, the eGFP is correctly in frame.

Hmm, but if the eGFP isn't in frame, then the entire ORF would be messed up, leading to a nonfunctional protein. So, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor. That would explain why the Western blot shows the receptor (since it's expressed), but on the same construct, the eGFP isn't expressed because it's out of frame, leading to a premature stop or no protein. So in this case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, so no green signal in the confocal.

Looking at option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would fit. Because in that case, when the stop is excised, the eGFP is not in frame, so its expression is prevented.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the IRES isn't working. But IRES is supposed to allow for translation without a promoter. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor might not be expressed. But the Western blot shows that the proteins are expressed, so that can't be the case.

Option C: the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the ligand has the CBA promoter, which is strong, so that shouldn't be an issue. The receptor is under the IRES, which relies on the ribosome's internal entry, so I don't think an enhancer is missing. So this option seems less likely.

Option B: stuck in the Golgi. If the eGFP is expressed but retained in the Golgi, it wouldn't fluoresce. But the Western blot would detect the protein, so the blot would show a signal. Since the question says the blot is proportional to actin, the eGFP might not be detected on the blot if it's not properly made. But the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, which would be the ligand and receptor. So if the eGFP is on the receptor, but not expressed, then the eGFP wouldn't be detected on the blot either. But the question says the blot shows a signal proportional to actin, so maybe the eGFP isn't even being expressed.

Wait, but the eGFP is on the receptor. If the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't, that suggests that the eGFP's expression is not happening. So why? Maybe the stop wasn't excised. But the mouse was crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should delete the stop. Alternatively, the construct may not have recombined correctly.

Another thought: the vector is bicistronic, so the ligand and receptor are in the same construct. The IRES is after the ligand's stop, but wait, no. Let me re-examine the vector setup.

The vector is ligand (CBA-driven) → stop cassette (loxP) → mCherry. Then, IRES → receptor → stop cassette (lox2272) → eGFP.

Wait, no, the IRES is upstream of the receptor, meaning the receptor is expressed under the control of the IRES. The ligand is under CBA, then a stop, then mCherry. The receptor is after the IRES.

So when Cre is present, the ligand and mCherry are expressed (since the stop is removed), and the receptor and eGFP are expressed (since the other stop is removed).

But maybe in the mouse, the SOX10-Cre isn't active in the cells expressing the construct. So the stops aren't excised. Then, the ligand and receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the Western blot showed that the proteins are expressed, so that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: the SOX10-Cre is only active in certain cell types, such as neural crest cells. But the vector was transfected into primary astrocyte culture, but when they made a mouse model, perhaps the construct is inserted into a tissue-specific region. Wait, no, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So the construct is present in all cells. Then, crossing with SOX10-Cre would delete the stops only in the cells expressing Cre, such as neural crest-derived cells.

But the question says they visualize the mice under the confocal. So if the construct is under a tissue-specific promoter, but I don't think so. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is constitutive, so the ligand and receptor should be expressed wherever the construct is active.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is on the same construct as the receptor, but the IRES is driving the receptor's expression, and the eGFP is after the receptor, which is not under the control of the IRES. So the eGFP might not be expressed unless the stop is removed, allowing the eGFP to be translated.

But the presence of the IRES allows the receptor to be translated as a second ORF without a promoter. So if the stop is removed, the eGFP would be translated as part of the same ORF as the receptor. But if the eGFP is not in frame, it won't be expressed.

So perhaps the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, leading to no expression. That's option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the IRES doesn't allow the eGFP to be expressed because it's after the receptor. Wait, the IRES is upstream of the receptor, so the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed. The eGFP is downstream of the receptor, but with the stop removed. So if the IRES is only for the receptor, the eGFP would only be expressed if it's in the same ORF.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think about how the construct is set up again.

The vector is:

5' -- [CBA promoter] -- [ligand ORF] -- [loxP-stop-loxP] -- mCherry -- [IRES] -- [receptor ORF] -- [lox2272-stop-lox2272] -- eGFP -- 3'

In the presence of Cre, the loxP and lox2272 sites are excised. So the ligand ORF is expressed, followed by mCherry. The IRES drives the receptor ORF, followed by eGFP.

But the IRES is a ribosome entry site, so it allows translation of the downstream ORF (the receptor) without a promoter. If the stop is removed after the receptor, then the eGFP is expressed as part of the same transcript? Or is it a separate ORF?

Hmm, perhaps the eGFP is in a separate ORF, so the IRES is only for the receptor. So after the receptor ORF, the eGFP would need its own start codon and perhaps a separate ribosome binding site. But without that, perhaps the eGFP isn't being translated.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the receptor ORF is followed by a stop and then eGFP. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP starts right after. So the eGFP would be in frame with the receptor's ORF, meaning it's a fusion protein.

Wait, that can't be right. The receptor is a transmembrane protein, and the eGFP is fused to its C-terminus. So the eGFP would be a tag on the receptor. So the construct should be designed so that the receptor is followed by the eGFP in frame. So when Cre deletes the stop, the eGFP is expressed as part of the same ORF.

But if the eGFP is not in frame, then the entire ORF after the deletion would be out of frame, leading to a premature stop codon and no eGFP expression.

So option D says that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would cause the eGFP not to be expressed, so no green signal. But the Western blot detects the receptor (since the antibody is against it), so the receptor is being expressed. However, the eGFP isn't being expressed.

So the most likely reason is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed correctly.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor, with fluorescent tags (mCherry and eGFP) downstream of stop cassettes. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. The vector was designed such that Cre recombinase would excise the stop cassettes, allowing expression of the fluorescent tags. However, after crossing the mouse model with SOX10-Cre mice, no green signal (eGFP) was observed under confocal microscopy. The possible reasons for this outcome were analyzed as follows:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on nearby cells. However, the construct is designed to co-express both proteins in the same cell, and the absence of a green signal is unrelated to paracrine signaling. This option does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were improperly trafficked to the Golgi, it might not fluoresce. However, the Western blot shows a signal proportional to actin loading, indicating that the receptor is being expressed. This suggests that the issue lies in the expression of eGFP, not its trafficking. Thus, this option is unlikely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES element, both of which should drive expression. The absence of a green signal is not due to a missing enhancer for expression. This option is not supported by the construct design or the observed results.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   The vector design places the receptor ORF followed by a stop cassette, then eGFP. In the presence of Cre, the stop cassette is excised, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be co-expressed. If the stop cassette is excised but the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP would not be expressed correctly. This would result in the receptor being expressed (detectable by Western blot) but no eGFP fluorescence. This explanation aligns with the observed lack of green signal and is the most likely reason for the failure of eGFP expression.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, preventing proper expression of eGFP. 

Answer: D
