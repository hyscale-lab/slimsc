Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Oh right! Parallax (p) is the reciprocal of distance (d), so p = 1/d. Wait, no, I think it's d = 1/p, but I might be mixing units. Oh wait, no, in parsecs, distance d is equal to 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So d = 1/p. So if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. If parallax is 0.5, it's 2 parsecs away.

Now the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in what sense? I think it's uniform in terms of space density. So the number density of stars doesn't depend on where you are in space, only on the distance.

Wait, so if stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number per unit volume is constant. But when you look at them from Earth, their apparent distribution depends on distance and how we observe them (like through a telescope with a certain field of view or collecting area).

So the number of stars in a certain range of parallax depends on how many stars are at a certain distance. Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance, each parallax range (like from p to p+dp) corresponds to a shell at a distance from d = 1/p to d = 1/(p+dp). Wait, but wait, dp is a small change, so maybe to approximate, the shell thickness would be in terms of distance. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think about the volume in each shell. The volume of a spherical shell between radius r and r + dr is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be the volume multiplied by the number density of stars. Since the density is uniform, let's say n (number per unit volume), then N(r) dr = n * 4π r² dr.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since p = 1/d, so r = 1/p. So dr = -1/p² dp. Hmm, because if p = 1/r, then dp/dr = -1/r².
