Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, if I remember correctly, occurs when a compound has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Chiral centers are the key here because they allow for the creation of non-superimposable mirror images, leading to enantiomers. So, my goal is to check each of the four compounds and see if they have any such centers.

Let's go through each one step by step.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, that's a mouthful. So it's a biphenyl structure, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring, and there are nitro groups and carboxylate ester groups. Wait, the structure is [1,1'-biphenyl], so the two benzene rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. The substituents are 6,6' nitro and 2,2' carboxylate methyl esters.

Now, biphenyls can have different conformations, but for optical isomerism, we need a stereogenic center. I don't see any obvious chiral centers in the biphenyl itself, but wait—maybe the substituents create some. The nitro groups are strong meta directors, but I'm not sure if they're attached to any chiral carbons. The carboxylate esters are OOCR groups, but the carbons attached would be from the benzene rings. Wait, the positions 2 and 6 are where the substituents are. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. But each of those substituents is on a benzene ring, which is sp2 hybridized. So those carbons (the ones attached to NO2 and COO-) are part of the aromatic ring, which is planar and trigonal. They can't be chiral centers because they don't have four different substituents. So, maybe this compound doesn't have any chiral centers. But wait, maybe the bridge or the connecting point could be a chiral center. The biphenyl is connected at position 1 on each ring. The single bond between the two rings allows rotation, so the rings can twist. But for a chiral center, the point of connection would need four distinct groups. The central C (if any) is actually part of the benzene rings, so I think it's not a chiral center. So maybe compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait—another possibility: perhaps the substituents on the benzene rings cause some kind of axial chirality. Oh right! I remember that biphenyls can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the two rings are not identical. Since the substituents are at 6 and 2 positions, maybe the arrangement leads to a situation where the two benzene rings are connected in a way that they can't be superimposed on each other, leading to enantiomers. So, if the two substituents on each ring are in positions that make the overall structure non-superimposable, then the molecule could have optical isomerism through a phenomenon called biphenyl or atropisomerism.

Wait, but for axial chirality to occur, the molecule must have hindered rotation, so that the two phenyl rings can't rotate freely around the central bond. In the case of para-substituted biphenyls, rotation is possible, so they don't exhibit axial chirality. But if the substituents are in such positions that rotation is hindered, then the molecule can have axial chirality. So, our compound here has substituents at 6 and 2 positions on each ring. Let me visualize this: each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. If the substituents are in positions that make the two rings not mirror images, then when the molecule twists, it can lead to different configurations.

Wait, I think I need to draw it mentally. For each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. So the two rings are connected at their 1 positions. The substituents on each ring are 2 and 6, which are in the meta positions relative to the connecting bond. So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. If substituents on one ring are in the same positions relative to the connecting bond, would that allow for rotation without hindrance? Maybe, but perhaps in this case, the substituents are such that the rings are forced to adopt specific conformations, leading to axial chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, so that no matter how it twists, it's the same. Wait, if the substituents on each ring are in the same positions, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Let me think, each ring has NO2 at 6 and COOCH3 at 2. So if you look at the two rings, each has the same substituents. So maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Hmm, but that depends on their arrangement.

Wait, the substituents are in the same positions on each ring. So the molecule might be symmetrical when viewed from the connecting bond. So perhaps the two rings are mirror images of each other, leading to no axial chirality. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image. So, perhaps the arrangement creates a situation where the two rings are not mirror images, leading to enantiomers. I'm a bit confused here, but I think in this case, compound 1 might exhibit optical isomerism due to axial chirality.

2. The second compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think about its structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the propanoic acid has a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So the structure is methyl (2-hydroxy)propanoate. So the structure is: O

Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

Wait, wait, no. The ester is CH3OC
