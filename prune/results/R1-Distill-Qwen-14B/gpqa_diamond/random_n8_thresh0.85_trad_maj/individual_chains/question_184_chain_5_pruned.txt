Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence leads to the desired product.

First, let me try to visualize the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1 (which is actually the ortho position relative to the tert-butyl), and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, numbering in benzene rings can be tricky. Let me think: if the main substituent is at position 1, then the others are at 2 and 3. So the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Or wait, the numbering might vary based on substituents' priorities. But maybe that's not critical right now.

The synthesis steps involve several reactions, probably electrophilic substitutions. Let me recall the order of reactions' directing effects.

Benzene is the starting point. Each substituent will direct the next substitution. The substituents can be activating or deactivating and ortho/para or meta directors.

So, the substituents in the target are:

- tert-butyl (which is a bulky alkyl group). Alkyl groups are activating (since they're electron-donating via sigma bonds) and are ortho/para directors.

- ethoxy group (OEt), which is an activating, ortho/para director.

- nitro group (NO2), which is a deactivating, meta director.

Wait, but nitro is meta, while ethoxy and tert-butyl are ortho/para. So the order in which these groups are introduced will affect where the next group attaches.

Wait, but the sequence of adding these groups is crucial. Because each substitution will determine the positions available for the next.

Let me think about the possible steps:

Benzene → (Substitution 1) → intermediate 1 → (Substitution 2) → intermediate 2 → (Substitution 3) → target.

I need to decide the order of adding the substituents. The target has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. So three substitution steps, probably.

But perhaps some steps are functional group interchanges or other reactions.

Wait, let's analyze each substituent's effect on the ring's reactivity and directing.

Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So once a nitro group is present, any subsequent substitution would occur meta to it. But wait, if there are multiple substituents, the directing can be complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is introduced last. Because if we introduce nitro first, it would deactivate the ring, making other substitutions harder. But wait, the nitro group is a meta director. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we should add the activating groups first, which would make the ring more reactive for further substitutions, and then introduce the deactivating groups.

So let's think about the steps.

First, perhaps add the tert-but
