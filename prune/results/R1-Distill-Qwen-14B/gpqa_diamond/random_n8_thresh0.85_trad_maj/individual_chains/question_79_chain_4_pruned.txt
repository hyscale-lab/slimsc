Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of this. Let me read through what's given and figure out what I need to do.

The question says that compound X, with the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are provided, and I need to find out which of the options (A-D) is the correct starting compound X.

Wait, but what's the reaction here? 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, probably used in an acid-catalyzed ring-opening or maybe some kind of elimination. Oh wait, wait, sometimes it's used in the formation of epoxides or maybe in some rearrangement reactions. Or wait, another thought: could it be part of a Wittig reaction? No, the Wittig reagent is usually something like triphenylphosphine ylide. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide? Or perhaps an acid-catalyzed process, but the solvent is nonpolar, so maybe it's more about an elimination reaction.

Wait, but the product's NMR is given. So if the reaction is the formation of an epoxide, then perhaps compound X is a diene, and the reaction forms an epoxide. Alternatively, wait, maybe the starting material is an alkene, and the reaction conditions are leading to some change, like epoxidation.

Wait, but the product's NMR is given. Let me look at the 1H and 13C NMR data.

1H NMR:
Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So in the product, there are two singlets integrating to 3H each. That suggests two methyl groups that are each not split by neighboring protons. Then the aromatic region has some doublets. Let me think about the splitting patterns.

Looking at the aromatic signals:

6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H,
