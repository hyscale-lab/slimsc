Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, then determining the product after a series of reactions.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Each degree is a ring or a double bond. For C8H9NO: The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which is 4 degrees) and a double bond (1), and a nitro group (but wait, the formula includes O, so maybe a nitro group isn't present. Let's see, the compound has N and O, so maybe an amide or something else.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR is given as:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Let me think about each peak.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's a downfield shift, maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, but wait, aldehydes usually have a singlet unless there's something adjacent. Maybe it's an enal, where the aldehyde is conjugated with a double bond.

The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets each integrating to 2H. These could be aromatic protons. Let me see. If it's a para-substituted aromatic ring, the two protons would be equivalent. So maybe two phenyl groups or something similar.

Wait, the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH proton, but that's usually a singlet and a broad peak. Or maybe some vinylic protons that are not split much.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe OCH2 something.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a nitro compound, but the formula is C8H9NO. Wait, if it's a nitro group (NO2), that would account for two oxygens, but the formula only has one O. So maybe not nitro. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. The possible functional groups could be a benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes an amine or something.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 9.72. Aldehyde is the likely candidate. So maybe the compound is an aldehyde attached to a benzene ring, along with another substituent.

Looking at the other aromatic protons. 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) could correspond to a para-substituted benzene. Because in para substitution, each pair of protons would be a doublet. For example, if one ring has two substituents, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps there are two benzene rings. Let me think: If there's a benzene ring attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to another substit
