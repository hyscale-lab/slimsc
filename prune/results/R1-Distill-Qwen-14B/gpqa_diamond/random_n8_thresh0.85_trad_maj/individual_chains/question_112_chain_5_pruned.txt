Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first, I probably need to normalize this state. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors need to be normalized, meaning their inner product with themselves should be 1.

Wait, the problem says it's proportional to that, so I'll have to find the normalization constant. Let me think about how to do that. The normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the inner product of the state with itself.

So the state is |alpha> = c [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ], where c is the normalization constant. But wait, the question says it's proportional, so when I compute the inner product, the coefficients will give me the squared magnitude, and I can find c as 1/sqrt(inner product).

Let me calculate the inner product. The inner product is (1+i)*(1-i) + (2-i)*(2+i). Because |up> and |down> are orthonormal, their inner products are zero except when the same.

Wait, (1+i) multiplied by (1-i) is (1 + i)(1 - i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. Right?

And (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + 2i - 2i -i^2 = 4 +1 =5. Because (a-b)(a+b)=a² - b². Here, a=2, b=i, so 4 - (i²) = 4 - (-1) =5.

So the inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization constant c is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the first part of the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, operator A is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write out what A looks like.

In the basis { |up>, |down> }, the operator A has elements:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Because when i != j, A_ij = ħ/2. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2.

Wait, but the eigenstates of this operator are probably not |up> and |down>. So the given state is in the computational basis (|up> and |down>), but the operator's eigenstates are different. So I need to find the eigenstates of A, and then find the probabilities of measuring each of them.

Alternatively, maybe the operator A is proportional to the spin-x operator. Let me think. The spin matrices for Sx are (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Oh wait, wait! The matrix given here is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2,0]]. But the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator A is (ħ/2) * X, where X is the Pauli matrix.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as those of X, because it's just a scalar multiple. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, right? Which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator.

So our state |alpha> is written in the z-basis, but the measurement is in the x-basis. So to find the probabilities, I'll need to express |alpha> in terms of the x-eigenstates, and then the coefficients' squared magnitudes give the probabilities.

Alternatively, I can calculate the expectation value of A and also the probabilities in its eigenstates.

Wait, but maybe there's another approach. Since the operator A is proportional to X, perhaps
