Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with chirality, right? Chiral molecules are those that aren't superimposable on their mirror images, which makes them have optical activity. So the question is asking which of the given compounds exhibit this property.

The options are four different compounds, and the answer choices are combinations of them. Let me go through each one by one.

First, let's look at compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl rings connected by a single bond. I think when two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond, they can rotate, which might allow for different stereoisomers. But wait, for a molecule to be chiral, it needs a center of chirality. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me visualize this structure. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each phenyl, and 6,6' have nitro groups. So each phenyl has two substituents. If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then maybe it's chiral.

Wait, but in biphenyl systems, if the substituents are symmetric, then the molecule might not be chiral. Let me think: if the substituents are in the same positions on both rings, like 2 and 2', and 6 and 6' with nitro, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if I have two substituents on each ring, mirroring each other, then the molecule could be achiral. But wait, are the groups in positions that allow for a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is chiral if the arrangement around the single bond between the two benzene rings creates a chiral center or a situation where the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should hold off on this and look at the others.

Compound 2 is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure where the hydroxyl is on the middle carbon. So structure like CH2(OH)CH2COO- but wait, no, wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, that structure has a carbon connected to three different groups: a methyl (CH3), a hydroxyl (OH), and a carbonyl group (attached to the ester). So, the carbon with OH is connected to CH3, COOCH3, and two hydrogens (or wait, maybe not). Wait, let me think again. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3, but wait, the structure for 2-hydroxypropanoate is more precisely:

The formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, the carboxylic acid is at the end. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, and the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, then the second carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the CH2 group on one side),
- OH,
- CH2COOCH3 (the other side),
- and another CH2 group? Wait, no, wait, I think I'm getting the structure wrong. Let's re-express propanoate.

Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH3CH2COO-R. For methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

The propanoate part would
