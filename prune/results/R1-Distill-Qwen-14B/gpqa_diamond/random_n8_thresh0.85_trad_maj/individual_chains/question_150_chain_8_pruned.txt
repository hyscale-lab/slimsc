Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question involves identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, I remember that NMR is crucial for determining the structure, so I'll need to look at that closely.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So plugging in the numbers: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a ring plus double bonds or something like that.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) — that's a triplet. A triplet in the aromatic region? Wait, or maybe it's an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the triplet... maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group? Or perhaps an aromatic proton with coupling? Not sure yet.

6.98 (d, 2H) — doublet, two protons. That's probably part of an aromatic ring, maybe para-substituted. Like two protons in a para position, each as a doublet.

6.51 (d, 2H) — another doublet, two protons. So maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Like, if the first 6.98 is ortho to substituents, this might be something else.

6.27 (bs, 2H) — broad singlet, two protons. Broad suggests possible exchange or maybe adjacent to an electrondonating group, like OH. Oh wait, the molecular formula has an O and an N. So maybe there's some substitution on the aromatic rings.

3.66 (d, 2H) — doublet, two protons. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2 or something. Wait, but the integration is 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene group next to something else.

So putting this together, perhaps the molecule has two aromatic rings, each with substituents. Let me think about the structure. The 9.72 ppm triplet suggests an aldehyde group. Or maybe an aromatic proton adjacent to something else. Wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10, so perhaps that's the aldehyde proton.

But wait, if it's an aldehyde, the triplet would be because it's next to a CH2 group. So like RCHO with CH2 adjacent. So maybe the structure is something like CH2 adjacent to the aldehyde.

Looking at the other signals: 6.98 and 6.51 are probably two different aromatic rings. So perhaps the molecule has two benzene rings, each substituted. Let's think about the coupling.

Wait, the 6.98 is a doublet, two protons. Maybe in a para-substituted benzene, but which substituent would cause that? If it's a meta substituent, but wait, maybe each benzene ring has a substituent that's causing the coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a diaryl compound. Let me see. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. If it's two benzene rings (each C6H5), that would account for 12 carbons, but we have only 8. So maybe each ring is connected to another group, and the rest of the structure has the remaining carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a diphenyl compound with a side chain. Let's think, for example, diphenylbutanal? But let me count the carbons. Two benzene rings (12 carbons), but wait, the formula is C8, so that doesn't add up. So maybe each benzene is not intact. Hmm, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde with substituents.

Wait, let's think again. The NMR shows 9.72 (t, 1H). Aldehyde protons are usually singlets, but sometimes if they are next to a CH2, they could be split into a triplet. So, maybe the structure is something like CH2CHO attached to two aromatic rings.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. So maybe that's a CH2 connected to something else. Perhaps OCH2, but in the structure. Let me think, perhaps the molecule has a structure like Ar-CH2-CHO, but then where's the N? Oh, wait, the molecular formula has an N. So maybe the O is part of an amide or something else.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms: 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen. So maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with an amino group or an amide.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with an amine substituent. Hmm, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let me go through each step of the reaction. The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl — that's typically a diazotization reaction. So the starting material must have an amine group, perhaps a primary aromatic amine.

2. H2O — maybe hydrolysis?

3. Aqueous KOH and heat — that's a typical condition for elimination or perhaps a hydrolysis, maybe to form a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, so maybe the starting compound has an amine group. So, when treated with NaNO2 and HCl (diazotization), it forms a diazonium salt. Then, perhaps upon treatment with water, it undergoes hydrolysis
