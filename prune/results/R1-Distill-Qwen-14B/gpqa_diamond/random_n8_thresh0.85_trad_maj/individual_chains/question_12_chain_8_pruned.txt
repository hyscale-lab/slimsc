Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c² and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c². We need to find the kinetic energies of the products, which are the muon and the neutrino.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, right? But I'm not sure if their mass is considered here. The problem doesn't mention it, so maybe I can neglect it. So I'll assume the neutrino's rest mass is zero.

Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So their momenta must be equal and opposite, which means their magnitudes are the same.

Let me think about the energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The muon's energy will be its rest energy plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero. 

So, energy conservation equation:
m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu

But wait, I also need to consider momentum conservation. The momenta of the two particles must be equal and opposite. So, the magnitudes are the same, so |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum times c, since E = |p|c for massless particles. So E_nu = p c.

For the muon, the energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). So, E_mu = sqrt( p² c² + m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c²? Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. The energy of a particle is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). So, for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p² c² + (105.7 MeV)^2 ). 

Wait, let me correct that. Actually, the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4) / c²? No, wait, units are getting a bit confusing. Let's think in units where c=1 for simplicity, which is common in particle physics. So, E_mu = sqrt( p² + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p.

But I'm a bit confused about the units. Let me get it straight. Let me define all masses in MeV/c², and energies in MeV, and c is taken as 1 in these units. So, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV/c², so its rest energy is 139.6 MeV. The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV/c², so its rest energy is 105.7 MeV.

So, the energy conservation equation becomes:
m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu

But E_mu = sqrt( p_mu² c² + m_mu² c^4 ) → because E² = (pc)² + (mc²)^2 → in units where c=1, E² = p² + m². So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p, because for a massless particle, E = pc.

So, I can write:

139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p

This is the equation I need to solve for p. Let me denote sqrt(p^2 + 105.7²) as x. So,

x = 139.6 - p

But x² = p^2 + (105.7)^2 → substituting x,

(139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2

Expanding the left side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2

The p^2 terms cancel out.

So,

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p = (105.7)^2

Let me compute the squares:

(139.6)^2 is approx 139.6 * 139.6. Let me compute that:

139 * 139 is 19321, 0.6^2 is 0.36. Wait, maybe I should compute it accurately.

139.6 squared: (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 → 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

105.7 squared: (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 → 10000 + 1
