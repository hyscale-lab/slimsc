Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li has an atomic number of 3, I think. And the isotope with 3 neutrons would be Li-6, because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6, so the nucleus is ^6Li.

Now, the question is about relativistic energy. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c². But wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²). Oh right, so since v is 0.96c, I can plug that into the gamma formula.

First, I'll calculate gamma. Let me compute v²/c². v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 * c². So (0.96)^2 is 0.9216. So v²/c² is 0.9216. Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Hmm, wait, wait, 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28 times 3.5 is 0.98. Wait, wait, no, wait. 1 / 0.28 is the same as 100/28, which is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is ^6Li. The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus is approximately... I think the atomic mass is about 6.0139 g/mol. Wait, but I should probably look it up, but since I can't, I'll have to remember. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So for ^6Li, it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total rest mass would be (3 * 938) + (3 * 939) MeV. Let's compute that: 3*938=2814, 3*939=2817. So total is 2814 + 2817 = 5631 MeV. Oh wait, but when you have a nucleus, the actual mass is a little less due to binding energy. But for this purpose, maybe we just use the sum of protons and neutrons. Or perhaps I should use the exact mass from the periodic table.

Wait, the precise mass number for ^6Li. Let me think. The atomic weight is about 6.0139 g/mol. But protons and neutrons mass would give a higher mass. So the actual rest mass of the nucleus is less than 6 * 938 MeV. Let me try to find the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the mass of ^6Li is approximately 6.0139 amu. Oh right, because 1 amu is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.0139 amu times 931.5 MeV per amu gives the rest energy in MeV.

So let's calculate that. 6.0139 * 931.5. Let me compute this step by step. 6 * 931.5 is 5589. Then 0.0139 * 931.5 is approximately 12.93. So adding, 5589 + 12.93 = 5601.93 MeV. So the rest mass energy is about 5601.93 MeV, which is 5.60193 GeV.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I should use the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with the given data and the formulas.

So the rest mass energy m0 c² is 5601.93 MeV, which is 5.60193 GeV. Then, gamma is approximately 3.5714, so the total energy E is gamma times m0 c². So 3.5714 * 5.60193 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 multiplied by 5.60193. Let me break it down: 3 * 5.60193 is 16.80579. 0.5714 * 5.60193. Let me compute 0.5 * 5.60193 is 2.800965. 0.0714*5.60193 is approximately 0.4017. So adding 2.8 + 0.4017 is about 3.2017. So 16.80579 + 3.2017 is about 20.0075 GeV. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me do it more accurately.

3.5714 * 5.60193. Let me compute it as (3 + 0.5714) * 5.60193.

3 *5.60193 =16.80579.

0.5714 *5.60193: Let me compute 0.5 *5.60193 = 2.800965. 0.0714*5.60193≈0.4017.

So 2.800965 + 0.401
