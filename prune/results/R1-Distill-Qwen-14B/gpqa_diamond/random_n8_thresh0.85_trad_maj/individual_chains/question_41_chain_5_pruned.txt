Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me think about this. Alright, the question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is going in the same direction as the beam. Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c divided by the refractive index. So in the rest frame of the glass, the speed would be c/n, right? But wait, in this case, the glass is moving relative to the lab frame, so we have to consider a change of reference frames.

Oh right, this is a problem involving relative velocity, probably using the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add velocities classically. But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at c/n in the glass's frame. Hmm, so when transforming to the lab frame, we need to apply the Lorentz transformation.

Wait, but wait a second, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer as well. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer. Then, in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So I think we need to add the velocity of the light in the glass's frame to the velocity of the glass.

But wait, that's the thing—how does the velocity addition work here. The classical approach would just say v_light_lab = v_light_glass + v_glass. But that's only valid at non-relativistic speeds. Since this problem is about light, perhaps we should use the relativistic addition formula.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, wait, in this case, the light's speed in the glass is u = c/n. So let me plug that into the formula. So u' would be (c/n + v) divided by (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ).

Wait, let me compute the denominator. (1 + ( (c
