Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have the same mass, which probably doesn't matter much for this question. Both have circular orbits, so that simplifies things. They're both detected via the RV method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. The key is that Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, the host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting.

The researchers want to observe the planet that has the highest probability of transiting. So, the question is about figuring out which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. The options give different probabilities, so I need to compute the transit probability for each planet.

Wait, what determines the likelihood of a planet transiting its star? I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh right, the transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something related to the orbital distance. Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by (something else?) Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, I think the formula for the probability of a transit is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(d)), no, wait. Another approach. The transit probability depends on the ratio of the size of the planet's orbit to the size of the star, but I think it's more about the orbital distance and the star's size.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability of this alignment is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the distance between the star and the planet's orbit, but I might be mixing things up.

No, wait, the probability of transit is actually given by the formula: P = (R_planet + R_star) / a, but I think more accurately it's (R_planet + R_star) / a, but no, wait. Let me get this right. The probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a)^
