Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem states: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, wait, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the velocities like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)) or something like that. But wait, which astronaut are we considering here? Oh, the question is about their relative speed, so I think it's the speed of one as seen from the other's frame.

So the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the perspective of the 2m astronaut (moving at 0.6c), what is the speed of the 3m astronaut?

Wait no, actually, wait. The relative speed would depend on whose frame we're considering. So perhaps I should calculate the relative velocity from one astronaut's frame to the other.

Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, the problem says 'relative speed' without specifying direction, but since they're both moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference divided by 1 minus the product over c squared.

Wait, wait, the formula is v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the second object as measured in the first's frame. Or is it the other way around? Let me get this straight.

Wait, if object A is moving at u in the lab frame, and object B is moving at v in the lab frame, then the speed of B as seen from A is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Because from A's frame, the lab is moving at -u. So the velocity is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

In this case, astronaut A has mass 2m moving at 0.6c. Astronaut B has mass 3m moving at 0.5c. Both in positive x-direction. So from A's perspective, B's velocity is
