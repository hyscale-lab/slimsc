Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can get tricky. Let's see what the question is asking.

The target compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, so let me draw that structure mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2).

So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3, but wait, benzene is a ring with six positions. Wait, numbering... Let me think. The substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions in a way that they are adjacent? Or wait, no, maybe 1, 2, 3 in a meta arrangement? Wait, wait, the question says 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, and 3-nitro. So the benzene ring has substituents at carbons 1 (OEt), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (NO2). So they are in positions 1,2,3, which are adjacent to each other. So, it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Wait, but how? Because for substitution reactions, the order of adding groups matters because of directing effects. Benzene is activated or deactivated depending on substituents, and substituents direct incoming groups to ortho, meta, or para positions.

I think the best approach is to plan the synthesis steps. Starting from benzene, we need to add these three substituents in the correct order, considering the directing effects of each group.

Let me think about the substituents:

- Ethoxy group (OEt) is an activating group, ortho/para director.
- tert-Butyl group is a bulky, activating group (since it's an alkyl group), ortho/para director.
- Nitro group is a deactivating, meta director.

But wait, nitro groups are meta directors. So if I add a nitro group later, the existing substituents will influence where it goes.

But wait, which substituent is added first, second, third? Let's consider the plan.

We have to add OEt, tert-butyl, and nitro groups in some order.

But the final product has all three substituents in specific positions. So perhaps the key is to add substituents in an order where each new group directs the next substitution correctly.

Wait, let's think about each step. The first substituent will determine the positions where the next substituents can go. The second substituent will then influence the third.

But wait, maybe the nitro group is a meta director, but since it's a strong deactivating group, once it's present, any further reactions would be difficult because the ring is deactivated. So perhaps the nitro group should be added last. Because if we have nitro first, the ring is deactivating, making other substitutions harder.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added in a position where the other substituents can guide it correctly.

Wait, let's visualize the target molecule. Positions 1, 2, 3 are all substituted.

Let me number the benzene ring such that position 1 is OEt, position 2 is t-Bu, position 3 is NO2. So, let me imagine the ring: OEt at position 1, t-Bu at 2, NO2 at 3. So, in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted arrangement.

Wait, but in benzene, positions 1, 2, 3 would form a sort of consecutive trio. So, each adjacent.

So, perhaps the nitro group is in position 3, which is adjacent to both OEt (position 1) and t-Bu (position 2). Hmm, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps I should arrange the substituents in the order of their addition.

Let me consider adding the ethoxy group first. Benzene with ethoxy (OEt) is activated, so ortho/para director. Then, adding another substituent, perhaps the tert-butyl group, which is best added via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. After that, adding nitro group in a position that's directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts is for activating groups. If we add nitro last, but after adding OEt and t-Bu, the ring might have activating and deactivating groups.

Wait, but in Friedel-Crafts, the ring must be activated. So if I have OEt and t-Bu, both activating, then the ring is still activated. So perhaps I can add the nitro group via nitrating mixture.

Wait, but nitration is a strong deactivating step, and after that, any further substitution (like adding OEt or t
