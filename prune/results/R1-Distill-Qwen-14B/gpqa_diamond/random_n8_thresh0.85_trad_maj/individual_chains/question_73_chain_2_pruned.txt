Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

Alright, the problem is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Their masses are 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract the velocities like you would in classical mechanics. Instead, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. And for the total energy, I think each astronaut's total energy is their relativistic energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy.

Let me break this down into two parts: relative speed and total energy.

First, the relative speed. Since they're moving in the same direction, I think the relative velocity isn't just 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Oh wait, no, because in relativity, when you're in one frame moving at velocity u, and another object is moving at velocity v in that frame, the relative velocity isn't simply v - u. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity u' when two objects are moving at u and v is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, which direction are we considering here?

Wait, the question says the two astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. So from the perspective of the first astronaut (mass 2m) moving at 0.6c, what is the speed of the second astronaut (3m) moving at 0.5c?

Wait no, or is the relative speed from the perspective of one astronaut to the other? Or perhaps from the lab frame? Wait, no, the problem asks for the relative speed between the two astronauts. So I need to find the speed of the second astronaut relative to the first.

So u is the velocity of the first astronaut as seen from the lab frame, and v is the velocity of the second as seen from the lab. To find the speed of the second relative to the first, I should use the velocity addition formula: v' = (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused
