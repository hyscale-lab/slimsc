Okay, so I've got this question about an organic compound, and I need to figure out its formula based on the spectroscopic data given. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So it's something like benzene with two substituents attached. The FTIR shows ester groups, which means there's an -O-CO-O- somewhere? Wait, no, esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an ether-like linkage. The IR absorption peaks for esters typically show a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl, and maybe another around 1250-1050 cm⁻¹ for the C-O stretch in the ester. So the compound must have an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: There are six signals. Let's categorize them. Two are aromatic-H, so the ring has two sets of aromatic protons. That suggests the substituents are in a position that causes the ring protons to split into two different environments. Maybe para-substituted? Or perhaps ortho and meta, but wait, di-substituted could be either, but the coupling would lead to different splitting.

Two signals are vinyl-H. A vinyl group is a CH₂=CH- group, so these are probably the protons on a double bond. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, maybe adjacent to some other groups. Let me think about that. Also, the absence of CH₂ signals but presence of CH3 groups. So we have two sets of -CH3 groups. Each might be attached to something else.

Another thing: the aromatic ring is probably part of a larger structure. Since there's an ester group, maybe the substituents are an ester and another group. Wait, wait, no, because it's di-substituted. So perhaps one substituent is an ester group and another is a vinyl group or something else.

Wait, wait, let's think about possible structures. Maybe the compound is something like an ortho-substituted benzene with an ester and a vinyl group? Or maybe the substituents are an ester and another group that's a vinyl or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a methyl group. But wait, the NMR says two CH3 groups, so two different methyl groups. So maybe they're ester groups or maybe attached to other structures.

Wait, let's think about the formula. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The molecular formula for benzene rings with substituents: benzene has C6H6. Each substituent adds some groups. Let's say, for example, one substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R), and another might be a methyl group or something else. Wait, but the NMR has two CH3 groups, so maybe the substituents are an ester and a group that has two methyls attached?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a vinyl group and an ester group. Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 groups, so maybe those are part of the substituents.

Wait, another approach: let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation to get an idea of what's going on. The molecular formulas given have O2, so we can ignore O for that.

For each option:

A) C11H14O2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here. So (2*11 +2 -14 -0)/2 = (24-14)/2=5. So 5 degrees: benzene ring (3), ester group (1 double bond in carbonyl), and maybe a double bond elsewhere? Or maybe a ring and some double bonds.

B) C12H14O2: DoU = (2*12 +2 -14)/2= (26-14)/2=6. So 6 DoU: benzene (3), ester (1), and maybe another ring or double bond.

Wait, but for the given compound, it's a di-substituted benzene. So benzene is already 4 DoU (3 from ring, 1 from each substituent's double bonds? Maybe not. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Wait, another thought: the ester group is O-C-O, which doesn't add to the DoU as a double bond because it's an ether-like linkage but with a carbonyl. So the carbonyl is a DoU. So one substituent is an ester, which includes a carbonyl (so +1 DoU), making the benzene (3) plus the substituent's DoU.

Wait, but the benzene is 4 DoU? No, benzene is 3 (1 ring, 3 double bonds). So substituent groups can add more.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a vinyl group and an ester. Vinyl is CH₂=CH-, which has one DoU (the double bond). The ester has a carbonyl (another DoU). So in total, the benzene (3) plus substituents (2) gives 5 DoU. Wait, but the molecular formula options have 5 or 6 DoU.

Wait, let's recalculate for each option:

C11H12O2: DoU = (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So 6 DoU. Benzene (3) plus substituents. So substituents contribute 3 DoU. That could be possible if substituents have multiple rings or double bonds.

But the substituents are two groups. Let's say one is an ester (which has a carbonyl, 1 DoU) and another is a vinyl group (another DoU). So substituents contribute 2 DoU, plus the benzene's 3: total 5. But 5 <6. So that can't be. So perhaps there's another ring or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent groups have more DoU. Like, if one substituent is an ester (1 DoU) and the other is a cyclopropane or something else with a ring, which adds another DoU.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the NMR data again.

The 1H NMR has six signals. Two aromatic H, two vinyl H, two CH3 groups. So the substituents must account for the other protons besides the aromatic ones.

Wait, the aromatic ring: di-substituted. The two substituents could be such that each causes the ring protons to split into different environments. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, the ring would have two sets of protons, perhaps each triplet? Or maybe the substituents are ortho and meta, leading to two different types.

But perhaps the substituents themselves have protons. Like, maybe one substituent is an ester, which doesn't have protons, and the other is a group with protons, like a vinyl group or a methyl group.

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So two methyl groups. Perhaps each substituent has a methyl group attached? Like, one substituent is an ester (like -O-CO-OCH2CH3?), but that would have more than one methyl. Wait, no, if it's an ester, maybe it's something like -O-CO-(something with a methyl).

Wait, another approach: structure of the compound.

If the aromatic ring has two substituents, and one is an ester, and the other is a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-), but where would the methyl groups come from?

Alternatively, the substituents could be an ester group (like -O-CO-R) and a group with two methyl groups, like a tert-butyl group or something else. But wait, the NMR shows two separate CH3 signals, which suggests two different methyl groups.

Hmm, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a group with two methyl substituents. For example, maybe a methoxy group and an ester, but that might not give two CH3.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is a methyl benzoate derivative. Benzoate ester has the benzene ring and the ester group. But in this case, the other substituent would be a vinyl group or another ester?

Wait, perhaps the structure is a vinyl ester, like something attached to the benzene ring which includes a vinyl group and an ester.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and another group that has a vinyl and a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group (like -O-CO-O-R) and a group like -CH₂CH₂- but that might not fit.

Alternatively, think about the substituents as an ester and a group like -CH₂CH3. But that would give a CH2 group, which the NMR doesn't show. Because the 1H NMR shows no CH2 signals. So substituents can't be -CH2- anything.

Wait, the absence of CH2 groups: that suggests that any substituents don't have any methylene groups (CH₂). So the substituents must be either CH3, or attached directly without any CH2. Hmm.

So substituents could be like -O-CO-OCH3 (if it's an ester with methyl group), but then we have two substituents. Wait, but how would that fit the NMR.

Wait, the NMR has two CH3 signals. So perhaps each substituent has a methyl group. So maybe the two substituents are ester groups, each with a methyl? Like, two ester groups attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but each ester group would have an O-CO-O-R group. If R is methyl,
