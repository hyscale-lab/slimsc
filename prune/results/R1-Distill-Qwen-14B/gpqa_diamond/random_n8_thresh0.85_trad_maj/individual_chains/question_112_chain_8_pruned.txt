Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about an electron in a state |alpha> which is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which is the Sz operator. So, the state is a linear combination of these eigenstates, but I need to normalize it first because the problem says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Wait, the proportionality constant isn't given. So, I should compute the normalization factor. To normalize, the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients must be 1. So, the coefficient of |up> is (1+i), and for |down> it's (2 -i). Let me compute the square of their magnitudes.

The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), so the square is 2. Similarly, the magnitude of (2 - i) is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4+1)=sqrt(5), so square is 5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next part: the question asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i â‰  j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds like a matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Hmm, but wait, the size of the matrix depends on the basis. Since we're talking about spin, which is 1/2, the Hilbert space is two-dimensional. So, the matrix would be 2x2.

So, the operator matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. That's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 on the off-diagonal elements. I think this operator is the spin in the x-direction multiplied by something. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply that by hbar/2, we get the operator for Sx, since Sx = (hbar/2) sigma_x.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the eigenstates of this operator A. So, the operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So, I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Alternatively, maybe the eigenstates are the same as those of the Pauli X matrix, because A is just a multiple of sigma_x. Let me confirm: sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (hbar/2) sigma_x. So, yes, the eigenstates of A are the same as those of sigma_x. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1. So, the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)*1 = hbar/2 and
