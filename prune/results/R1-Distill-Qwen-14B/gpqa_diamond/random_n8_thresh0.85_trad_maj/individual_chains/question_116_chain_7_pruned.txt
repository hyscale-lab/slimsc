Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, Compound A has two signals in the proton NMR. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, NMR signals can tell us a lot about the structure. Let me think about what these signals could mean.

The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6 protons. That's a downfield shift, but 0.9 is upfield, so maybe it's a methyl group. Triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, a triplet in a methyl group? That usually happens when the methyl is next to a CH2 group. Because each proton in the CH2 would split the methyl into a triplet. So maybe it's something like (CH2)2CH3, but wait, no, more likely, two adjacent CH2 groups. Wait, for example, in a di-substituted situation.

Wait, 6H as a triplet—maybe two sets of three H each? Or perhaps a single group with six H in a triplet. Oh, wait, wait. Maybe it's a (CH2CH3)2 group. Let me think. No, perhaps it's a diethyl group—like two ethyl groups attached to something. Because each ethyl group has three CH2 and three CH3? Wait, no. Each ethyl group has two CH2 groups. Wait, no, each ethyl group is CH2CH3. So if the structure has two ethyl groups attached to a central carbon, then the CH2 groups would be next to the central C, and the CH3 would be the end. But wait, the triplet in NMR. Let me think about splitting.

If the CH2 is next to another CH2, like in an ethyl group attached to something else. Oh, wait, maybe the structure is neopentane or something else. Wait, no. Let me think. Suppose we have two ethyl groups attached to a central carbon. Then the central carbon is connected to two CH2CH3 groups. So for each CH2 in the ethyl group, the Hs would be adjacent to the CH2 next to the central C. So the CH2 next to the central C would be a quartet, because they're next to another CH2 (each H has two neighboring Hs, but I'm getting a bit confused). Wait, but the given NMR has a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. So 4H in a quartet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diethyl group attached to a central CH2. Let's see. Like CH2CH2(C) something. No, wait. Let me think of another approach. The triplet at 0.9 for 6H likely comes from two equivalent CH3 groups, each next to a CH2. Wait, 6H would be two CH3 groups each with 3H. So that would make sense. So each CH3 is a triplet because each is next to a CH2 group.

Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H: 4H suggests two sets of two H each. Maybe two CH2 groups each with 2H. Each CH2 is next to another CH2, leading to a quartet. Hmm.

Wait, putting it together: Maybe the structure is (CH2CH3)2CH2? No, that would have more H. Alternatively, perhaps it's a central CH2 connected to two CH2CH3 groups. So the structure would be CH2(C H2CH3)2. Wait, that makes the central CH2 connected to two ethyl groups. Let's count the Hs. The central CH2 has 2H, each ethyl group has 2 CH2 groups? No, wait, each ethyl is CH2CH3. So the ethyl groups each contribute 2H in the CH2 and 3H in the CH3.

Wait, maybe the structure is (CH2CH3)2CH2. No, that's not possible, because that would be CH2 connected to two ethyl groups. Wait, but then the central CH2 would be between two ethyl groups. So the two CH2 groups from the ethyls would be adjacent to the central CH2. Then the central CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups (from the ethyls). So each of those CH2 groups (the ones in the ethyl) would have neighboring Hs.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is diethyl something. Or maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative, but that seems less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is neopentane, which is 2,2-dimethylpropane. But neopentane's NMR would have a singlet for the central C's CH groups, but wait, no, neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, so the structure is C(CH3)4. So the NMR would show a singlet for the 12 H (no, wait, no, wait: no, wait, wait. No, wait, neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, which is (CH3)C-CH2-CH3? No, no, wait. No, neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, which is CH(CH3)2CH2CH3? No, no. Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Neopentane is actually 2,2-dimethylpropane, which is (CH3)C-CH2-CH3? No, wait. No, wait. Neopentane is (CH3)C-CH2CH3? No, no, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: the formula for neopentane is C5H12, right? So the structure is 2,2-dimethylpropane, which would be CH2C(CH3)2CH2? No, wait, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)2CHCH2CH3? No, that's pentane. Wait, no. Wait, maybe the structure for neopentane is (CH3)C-C(CH3)2? No, that can't be right. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, maybe compound A is diethyl ether? No, because diethyl ether's NMR would have different signals. Wait, but diethyl ether has a central O connected to two ethyl groups. So the CH2 groups next to O would have different chemical shifts. But the NMR given here doesn't have any peaks around 3.3 ppm (where OCH2 would be). So probably not ether.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group attached to an oxygen, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH(CH2CH3)2)CH2. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexane derivative. Like, maybe it's a ring with substituents. But the NMR doesn't suggest that. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the triplet and quartet. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) probably comes from two equivalent CH3 groups. Each CH3 is adjacent to a CH2 group, which is itself adjacent to another CH2 group, hence the triplet. So each CH3 is next to a CH2 that's next to another CH2. So the structure would be something like CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's a diethyl group attached to a single carbon. So, the structure is
