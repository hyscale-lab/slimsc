Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the options given. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. 

First, I'll look at the IR data to find out what functional groups are present in Compound X. The IR peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates either an O-H stretch or an N-H stretch. But the next peak is at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, often associated with carbonyl groups like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe an acid. Then there are peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which might correspond to C=C stretching, maybe in an aromatic ring.

Now, the NMR data. Let's break it down. The first peak is at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs) with 1H. That's a high chemical shift, possibly an aldehyde proton or maybe a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, if it were an aldehyde, the peak would be around 9-10 ppm, but it's broad. A carboxylic acid proton usually appears around 10-12 ppm and is broad. So considering the IR has a 1720 peak, which could be an ester, acid, or ketone. Hmm.

Next, the NMR shows 8.0 ppm as a doublet (d) integrating for 2H. That's in the aromatic region. Similarly, 7.2 ppm as a doublet for 2H. This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Like maybe two substituents opposite each other, since the protons are split into two doublets. So maybe something like a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. But wait, the integration is 2H each, so it's like two sets of equivalent protons. So perhaps a disubstituted benzene, para.

Looking at the other peaks: 2.9 ppm as a multiplet (m) for 1H. Then 1.7 ppm as m for 2H, 1.4 ppm as a doublet (d) for 3H, and 0.9 ppm as a triplet (t) for 3H. These seem like they could be part of an alkyl chain, perhaps with a branching. Let me think about that.

So the 0.9 triplet suggests a methyl group at the end of a chain (like CH2CH2CH3, where the CH3 is at the end). The 1.4 doublet is probably a CH2 that's next to another CH2. Wait, or maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Like, maybe a CH(CH2CH3) group? Or perhaps a branching point. Let me draw possibilities.

Let me consider the possible structure. The aromatic ring is para-substituted. Each substituent probably has an alkyl chain attached. But looking at the NMR, the substituents might be a carbonyl group and an alkyl group.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a carbonyl. So maybe the compound is a phenyl ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. But the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a bit high for a ketone (which is around 2.1 ppm usually). Oh wait, no, the 10.5 is probably the acidic proton, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But wait, the IR at 1720 could also be an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with an acidic proton elsewhere.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is broad and integrates to 1H. That's a strong indicator for a carboxylic acid proton. So if that's the case, the IR at 1720 would make sense as a carbonyl from the acid. So the compound might be a benzoic acid derivative.

But wait, benzoic acid's IR would have a broad O-H around 2500-3300, which matches the first IR region. The 1720 would be the carboxylic acid's carbonyl. So that seems to fit.

Looking at the NMR again, the aromatic protons are two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted ring. So perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and a carboxylic acid group. But let me look at the other peaks.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to some substituent. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be two adjacent CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is likely a terminal methyl (like CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, putting this together: perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a group like CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH? Or maybe the substituent is an ethyl group with a branching.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene could be a carbonyl group attached to an alkyl chain. Let me think about the NMR.

Looking at the 1H NMR, besides the aromatic protons, the rest of the peaks seem to be from an alkyl chain. Let's see: 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is maybe a CH between two CH2 groups. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups in a chain. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) could be a methyl attached to a CH. And the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) would be a terminal methyl in a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH(CH2CH3) group. Because the CH(CH3) would have a methyl as a doublet, maybe. But wait, maybe it's a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene. So the structure would be something like benzene with a substituent that is a CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH? Or maybe the substituent is a branching point.

Wait, the aromatic ring would have two substituents: one is the carboxylic acid group (if that's the case) and the other is an alkyl group. But the NMR data doesn't show more than the 1H at 10.5 ppm. So perhaps the substituents are a carboxylic acid group and another group, maybe an isobutyl or something similar.

Wait, let me think about the substituents. The aromatic region has 4 protons, meaning two substituents. So the substituents are likely a -COOH and another group.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any other protons except for the aromatic and the alkyl chain. So perhaps the substituents are a -COOH and a branched alkyl group, like an isobutyl or something.

So maybe the structure is 4-(something)benzoic acid. Let's look at the options. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me check the structure.

4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: the benzene ring has a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions. The sec-butyl group is (CH2CH(CH2CH3)) attached to the ring.

Looking at the NMR data for that structure. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches what's given.

Now, the substituent's NMR. The substituent is a sec-butyl group: the structure is benzene-COOH, and para to that is a CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Let me see.

The NMR of the substituent: the CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. The CH(CH2CH3) would have a proton that's split by adjacent groups. Let's see:

The CH2 in the substituent would have protons that are adjacent to the CH. The CH would be the -CH- in -CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be this CH. Then, the two CH2 groups would be the -CH2- attached to the benzene and the -CH2- in the sec-butyl.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which could be the two protons on the CH2 adjacent to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is the methyl group on the CH, which is a -CH(CH2CH3). That methyl would be attached to the CH, so in the NMR, it's a doublet because the CH is split into two by the neighboring protons. Wait, but the CH has one proton, so perhaps the splitting is more complex. Alternatively, maybe the 1.4 ppm is a -CH2-CH2- group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the substituent. If it's a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So the substituent is:

Ring–CH2–CH(CH2CH3)

So the substituent has a CH2 group attached to the ring, then another CH with a methyl group and a CH2CH3 group attached.

Wait, no, the
