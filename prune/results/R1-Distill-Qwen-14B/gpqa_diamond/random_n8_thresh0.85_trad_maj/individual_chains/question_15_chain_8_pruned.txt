Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about detecting transiting planets. Alright, let's read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, the researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time, so they want to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting. Both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits. 

The host stars are a bit different. Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius because the Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they ended up with the same radii. 

The question is about which planet is more likely to transit, based on the transit probability. 

Hmm. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. The formula for the transit probability (P) is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by some factor related to the orbital distance and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. 

Wait, I think the transit probability can be approximated by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a/(R_s)) * (some geometric factor). No, wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(a * (1 - e^2)^0.5)), but since both have circular orbits, the eccentricity e is zero, so that factor is 1. 

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think. The transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. The alignment probability is roughly (R_s / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis (which for a circular orbit is the orbital radius). So the total probability is (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s^2 / a^2) ) = (R_p^2 / a^2). But wait, that would mean the probability is (R_p / a)^2. 

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me go back. The transit probability is the product of two factors: the geometric probability and the Doppler boosting factor. But for this problem, Doppler boosting might not be a factor because they're already detected via RV. So maybe we're just considering the geometric probability.

The geometric probability P_geo is approximately (R_p + R_s) / (a * sqrt(1 - b^2)) ), where b is the impact parameter, which depends on the alignment. Wait, but when considering the maximum possible, the highest probability occurs when the orbit is edge-on, so the impact parameter b is zero. But in reality, the probability depends on the chance that the inclination is correct. 

Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is (R_p/R_s)^2 * (1/(a/R_s)), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, perhaps the transit probability is (R_p/R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbit's inclination is such that the planet passes in front. 

Wait, I think the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)) ) × [something], but I'm not getting it right. Maybe I should recall that the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)^2. Wait, does that make sense? 

Wait, more accurately, the geometric transit probability is given by P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a/R_s)) * 1/(sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2)) )? Hmm, maybe not. I'm getting stuck here, perhaps I should look for a formula.

Wait, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s + R_p) / a ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)) )? Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s^2 / a^2). Let me think.

Wait, another approach: The transit probability depends on the size of the star and the planet relative to the distance. The planet must pass in front of the star from our point of view. So the chance is higher if the star is smaller (so planet is larger relative to the star) and the planet's orbital distance is smaller (so the path it takes is more likely to cross our line of sight).

Wait, the probability also depends on the orbital distance. For a circular orbit, the probability that the planet's path passes in front of the star is equal to (R_p + R_s) / (a) ) × (R_s / a) )? Or maybe it's (R_s + R
