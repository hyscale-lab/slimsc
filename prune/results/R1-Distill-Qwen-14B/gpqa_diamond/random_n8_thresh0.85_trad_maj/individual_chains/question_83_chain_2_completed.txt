Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. The question is asking what the pH will be at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options given are A to D, each providing two pH values.

Hmm, I remember that when you titrate an acid with a base, the pH changes depending on where you are in the titration. So, first, I need to figure out the initial concentrations after dilution, then determine what happens at 25% and at equivalence.

Let me start by calculating the initial concentration after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we dilute it, the concentration decreases. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. 

The initial moles of acetic acid can be calculated using Molarity = moles / volume (in liters). So moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). 

Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 liters. So moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) before dilution is 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles / volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So let's find the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 (from earlier). Since NaOH reacts 1:1 with acetic acid (because the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O), the moles of NaOH needed are also 0.001.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. 

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. 

But the question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let's tackle each point.

First, 25% titration. That means we've added 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. The equivalence volume is 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

So how many moles of NaOH have been added? Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters) → 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

The acetic acid initially was 0.001 moles. After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, some of it will have reacted.

The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- + H2O. So moles of acetic acid remaining will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed will be 0.00025 moles.

Now, the total volume of the solution at this point is the initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added, so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This looks like a buffer solution, so the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should work here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

First, let's find pKa. Given Ka = 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 → -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Now, plugging into the equation: pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. The log of 0.3333 is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Rounding, that's about 4.26. So at 25% titration, pH is approximately 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and strong base. This will make the solution basic because acetate ions will hydrolyze in water.

So let's find the concentration of acetate ions at equivalence. At equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH. So total solution volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

Moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-) is 0.001 moles, as all the acetic acid (0.001 moles) has reacted. 

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw = Ka * Kb → Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.4054e-10.

So Kb is 5.4054e-10. 

The hydrolysis equation can be approximated by:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming that x is the concentration of OH^- produced, and x is small compared to initial concentration (0.02 M), so we can approximate.

So x² / 0.02 ≈ 5.4054e-10 → x² ≈ 0.02 * 5.4054e-10 → 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 M. Then pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.486. Therefore, pH = 14 - 5.486 ≈ 8.514. So approximately 8.51.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A is 4.26 and 8.52. That matches. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, let me recalculate the Kb part. Another approach: Using the Kb expression for acetate.

The Kb is 5.4054e-10. Let's calculate the pH at equivalence point.

For a weak base, the pH can be found using:

OH^- = sqrt(Kb * C), where C is the concentration of the base.

So, Kb = 5.4054e-10, C = 0.02 M.

sqrt(5.4054e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let's compute that.

Log(3.288) is about 0.5168, so log(3.288e-6) is 0.5168 -6 → -5.483. So pOH is 5.483, pH is 14-5.483 = 8.517. So approximately 8.52.

So at equivalence, pH is about 8.52, and at 25% titration, pH is around 4.26. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52. So that would be the correct answer.

But wait, the given options don't have 4.26 and 8.52 together except option A. Wait, let me check the other options.

Option D: pH 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% titration. Let me check that again.

Wait, maybe I messed up the volume at 25% titration. Let me reevaluate.

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume (10 cm³) is 2.5 cm³. Adding 2.5 cm³ to the initial 40 cm³, the total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). 

The moles of acetic acid initially were 0.001. Moles of NaOH added (2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M) is 0.0025 L * 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol.

So, moles of acetic acid after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Concentration of acetic acid: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = 4.733 + log(0.005882/0.017647) = 4.733 + log(1/3) → 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. So about 4.26, which matches option A.

So the equivalence point pH is ~8.52, and 25% is ~4.26, so option A. But wait, the options are a bit different.

Wait, looking at option D: 4.57 and 6.92. I don't think that's right. Let me think, did I make a mistake in the equivalence point calculation?

Wait, another approach for the equivalence point. Maybe using the formula for a sodium acetate solution.

At equivalence, the solution is 0.02 M sodium acetate. The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M, so the expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], then Kb = x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x is negligible compared to 0.02, so x² ≈ 0.02 * Kb.

x² ≈ 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.484 → pH ≈ 8.516.

So, 8.52 is correct. So the only option with 4.26 and 8.52 is A.

Wait, but another thing to consider: when we dilute the acetic acid, the initial pH after dilution is different. But the first part of the problem is about the pH during titration, so maybe that's not directly needed, except for the 25% and equivalence points.

Wait, but why is there an option D with pH 4.57 and 6.92? Maybe I made a mistake in the 25% calculation. Let me recheck the 25% titration.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should consider the initial dilution correctly. Oh wait, no, I think I did that correctly. 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is 0.001 moles, diluted to 40 cm³, so 0.025 M. Then, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, 25% titration is 2.5 cm³, which adds 0.00025 moles of NaOH.

Wait, another possible mistake: when calculating the ratio of [A-]/[HA], did I get it right?

Yes, [A-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M, [HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. So ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.333.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(1/3) → 4.733 + (-0.477) = 4.256, which is about 4.26. So that's correct.

So the only option that matches is A. But wait, let me check the other options.

Option D: 4.57;6.92.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the initial dilution was not correctly accounted for. Wait, let me think again. I think I did the initial calculation correctly.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the 25% titration. Let me consider that 25% titration refers to the volume of the titrant relative to the solution being titrated. Wait, no, because the equivalence point is when you've added as much NaOH as the moles of acetic acid. So the 25% titration is 25% of the equivalence volume.

So, I think my calculations are correct. So the pH at 25% is 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52, which is option A.

Looking at the options: Option A is 4.26;8.52, which matches.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the equivalence point. The moles of NaOH required to neutralize 0.001 moles of acetic acid are also 0.001 moles (1:1 reaction). The volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH at equivalence} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻), forming a solution of sodium acetate. The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm³} + 10 \, \text{cm³} = 50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetate} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ↔ CH₃COOH + OH⁻}.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the formula for weak base hydrolysis:

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH⁻]^2}{[CH₃COO⁻]} \implies [OH⁻] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [CH₃COO⁻]}.
\]

Substituting values:

\[
[OH⁻] = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} \approx \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484.
\]

The pH at the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.484 \approx 8.516 \, \text{(rounded to 8.52)}.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume (10 cm³) is added, which is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 10 \, \text{cm³} = 2.5 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COO⁻} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.5 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]}\right),
\]

where:

\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733.
\]

Substituting values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \, \text{(rounded to 4.26)}.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Option A: 4.26; 8.52**

Answer: A
