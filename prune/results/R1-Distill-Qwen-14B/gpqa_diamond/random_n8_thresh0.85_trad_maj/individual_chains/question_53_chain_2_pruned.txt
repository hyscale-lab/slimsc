Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that's probably benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen in the ester linkage. So, the compound must have an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Two aromatic H's, two vinyl H's (with specific splitting patterns), and two CH3 groups. No signals for CH2. So, the structure probably doesn't have any methylene (CH2) groups, which suggests that any substituents might be either methyl, vinyl, or aromatic groups.

Wait, the aromatic ring is di-substituted. So, let's think about possible substitution patterns. For a benzene ring with two substituents, the positions could be para, meta, or ortho. But how does that affect the NMR?

The aromatic H signals: two signals. So, perhaps the two substituents are in such a way that the aromatic protons are split into two sets. For example, in a para-substituted benzene with two identical substituents, there would be two types of aromatic protons: those adjacent to the substituents and those opposite. Wait, no, para substitution would actually result in two equivalent H's in each ortho positions, but I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) or 1,3 (meta) arrangement.

Wait, but in the NMR, there are two aromatic signals. That suggests that the two substituents are such that the ring has two distinct types of aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, but perhaps they're not identical. Oh, wait, the compound is di-substituted, and if the substituents are different, then the ring would have two sets of aromatic H's. For example, if two different groups are attached in para positions, then each ortho position to each substituent would have different H environments.

But wait, the substituents could also be in such a way that the ring's H's are split into two groups. Like, for example, if one substituent is an ester group and the other is a methyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR has two signals for aromatic H's. So, maybe each substituent is in a position that makes the H's around it split into two sets. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that the ring has two distinct H environments.

Hmm, moving on to the vinyl H's. The problem states that there are two signals: one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl H's are typically in an sp² hybridized environment, like in an alkene or a conjugated system.

So, perhaps the ester group is attached to the ring via an oxygen, like in phenyl acetate, but wait, in that case, there might be more CH2 groups elsewhere. Or maybe it's an ester directly attached as a substituent.

Wait, the ester group would be something like R-O-CO-R'. So, the substituent on the benzene could be an ester group, perhaps with a vinyl group elsewhere.

Wait, or maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group. Let's think about that.

So, if the benzene ring has two substituents: one being an ester group (like OAc, or O-R where R has a carbonyl) and another being a vinyl group (like CH2CH2, but wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH–, but that's a double bond). Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group and another is a methylene group, but the NMR says no CH2 groups. So, that might rule out substituents with CH2.

Wait, the NMR doesn't have CH2 signals, so any substituent cannot have a CH2 group. So, substituents on benz
