Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about molecular symmetry, specifically which molecule has C3h symmetry. I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry implies. From what I recall, the notation is a bit tricky. The 'C' stands for a cyclic group, and the subscript 3 means the highest order of rotation is 3 (so 120-degree rotations). The 'h' indicates there's a horizontal mirror plane involved. So C3h symmetry means the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis. Alternatively, maybe the h is part of a larger group, like in the dihedral group, but I'm not 100% sure.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Hmm, okay, triphenylene suggests a structure with three benzene rings attached to a central core. The name also includes three furan rings, I think. Wait, trifuran means three furan groups attached. So the structure probably has a central part with multiple substituents. I'm trying to visualize this. If it's a central ring with substituents in a symmetric arrangement, maybe it has three-fold symmetry. The numbering 1,3,6,8,11,13 might place the substituents in a way that allows rotation by 120 degrees. But does it have a mirror plane? If the molecule is symmetric with a plane that bisects it, perhaps. But I'm not certain yet.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Benzo suggests a benzene ring. So this molecule has a benzene fused with something else. Trifuran would imply three furan rings attached. Wait, the way it's written, benzo is fused to the trifuran. So maybe it's a structure where a benzene ring is connected to three furan rings in a specific arrangement. I'm trying to imagine the structure. The positions are 1,3,4,6,7,9. Maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for rotation symmetry. If the substituents are spaced every 120 degrees, that would hint at C3. But does it have a mirror plane? Maybe, but I'm not sure.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate.

Oh, triisopropyl borate is (B(OCH(CH2CH3)2)3). So the boron is attached to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is a substituent. The structure of triisopropyl borate is symmetric because all three substituents are the same. Because all three are identical and arranged symmetrically around the boron, the molecule should have a three-fold rotational axis. So that gives it C3 symmetry. But wait, does it have a mirror plane as well? If the molecule is planar and has a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the three-fold axis, then it would have C3h symmetry. Wait, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule. So the plane in question could be the one that includes the boron and the center of each isopropyl group. Hmm, not exactly. Wait, the molecule is symmetric, so perhaps it has multiple mirror planes. If the molecule is symmetric across a plane that is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule (like a horizontal plane), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the borate ion is trigonal planar, so the mirror planes would be in the same plane as the trigonal arrangement. So maybe it's C3v symmetry, which includes a vertical mirror plane. But I thought that C3h is a different point group.

Wait, I might be mixing up the point groups. Let me recall: C3h is a subgroup of the dihedral group D3h. C3h has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So in such a case, the mirror plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis. So for triisopropyl borate, is the mirror plane horizontal? Or is it vertical?

Triisopropyl borate is a flat molecule with the boron in the center, and three isopropyl groups arranged around it. The molecule is symmetric in the plane of the molecule. So any rotation in that plane would be part of the symmetry, and there are mirror planes that pass through the boron and each pair of isopropyl groups (which would be vertical). But wait, maybe there's a horizontal mirror plane as well, which would be perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. But wait, the molecule is planar, so a horizontal plane would actually be the plane of the paper. Or maybe I'm getting confused between different symmetry elements.

Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry. Because D3h includes a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, D3h has a three-fold axis, three two-fold axes, a horizontal plane, and others. So if the molecule has D3h symmetry, it would have a horizontal mirror plane. So then, it would have C3h as a subgroup. But the question is about C3h, not D3h. So if the molecule has D3h, it would automatically have C3h, but maybe the question is considering only the necessary elements.

Wait, but sometimes when a molecule has a horizontal mirror plane and a three-fold axis, it might belong to C3h or D3h. I'm getting a bit stuck on this.

Option D: Quinuclidine.

Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a bridge structure. Its structure is a norbornane-like structure but with a seven-membered ring. I think its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]heptane. So, it's a bridged molecule. I'm trying to think about its symmetry. Quinuclidine has a center of inversion and three planes of symmetry. So its point group is probably Td or something else, but I'm not sure. Wait, I think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis of symmetry. Because you can rotate it 120 degrees and it looks the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Because if it does, then it would have C3h symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's in a higher symmetry group.

Wait, I'm not confident about quinuclidine's symmetry. Let me think again. Quinuclidine's structure has a central nitrogen, with three bridges. No, wait, quinuclidine is a hydrocarbon, right? It's a bicyclic molecule with a bridgehead. So, the molecule is symmetric. If you look down the three-fold axis (which comes from the three equivalent bridges), then rotation by 120 degrees would leave it the same. But does it have a mirror plane? Yes, I think quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule, perhaps vertical. So if it has a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane, but what kind?

Wait, the point group for quinuclidine is actually C3. Because it has a three-fold rotation axis, but no mirror planes? Or maybe it has a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, I'm not so sure. Alternatively, quinuclidine might have D3h symmetry, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe it has a horizontal mirror plane. So, if it has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it's C3h. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider each option's point group.

Triisopropyl borate: It's a planar molecule with three identical substituents. So, the point group is D3h. Because it has a horizontal mirror plane (sigma_h), a three-fold rotation axis (C3), and three vertical mirror planes (each bisecting a pair of substituents). So D3h includes C3h as a subgroup. So it has C3h symmetry, but perhaps the question is asking for the exact point group. But the question is which has C3h symmetry, whether it's a subset or not.

Wait, no. Because if D3h includes C3h, then a molecule with D3h would have C3h symmetry as part of its group. So triisopropyl borate would have C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine: I think it's in the Td point group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's C3v. Alternatively, perhaps it's C3h. I'm a bit shaky on this.

Benzo[...]trifuran...hexaone: Let's think. If the molecule has three substituents arranged symmetrically, perhaps at 120 degrees apart, then it would have a three-fold axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? For example, if the molecule is planar and has a plane that reflects across the center, then yes. Alternatively, maybe it's in a different point group.

Wait, the third and fourth options are both some sort of fused rings. The first option is triphenyleno[...]trifuran, which probably has a central structure with three phenyl groups attached, leading to a symmetric arrangement.

So, triphenyleno[...]: three groups arranged symmetrically could imply C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the groups are all in one plane, then perhaps a horizontal mirror plane would be present. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, thinking about the molecular structures: Triphenylene has three benzene rings connected in a symmetric way, perhaps forming a triangular structure. So the molecule would have a three-fold axis. If there's a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis (like a horizontal plane), then C3h would be present. But if the mirror planes are vertical, then it would be C3v.

Similarly, benzo[...]trifuran would have a benzene ring and three furan rings. Maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that allows a three-fold rotation. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Now, considering the options again. The question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. So, the presence of a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. As I thought earlier, it's a planar molecule, trigonal planar, so it has a three-fold axis in the plane. Wait, no, the three-fold axis would be perpendicular to the plane because the substituents are arranged around a central point in a trigonal planar arrangement. So the rotation axis is perpendicular to the plane. If the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane, that would be the plane of the molecule itself. But in that case, the mirror plane is in the same plane as the three substituents. Hmm, maybe not. Or perhaps the horizontal mirror plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis.

Wait, in point groups, the 'h' in C3h refers to a horizontal mirror plane, which is perpendicular to the C3 axis. So for triisopropyl borate, the rotation axis is perpendicular to the plane (since the substituents are in a trigonal planar arrangement around the boron). So the rotation axis is along the z-axis. The horizontal mirror plane would then be the xy-plane, which is the plane of the molecule. So, the molecule can be mirrored across this plane, which would imply C3h symmetry.

But wait, in this case, the molecule is already planar, so any horizontal plane passing through the molecule would be a mirror plane. So yes, triisopropyl borate would have a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it has both a C3 axis and a sigma_h, so it's in C3h.

Alternatively, think about whether triisopropyl borate's point group is C3h or D3h. D3h would have additional vertical mirror planes. Triisopropyl borate has three vertical planes of symmetry as well. So it's in D3h, not C3h. Because D3h includes a C3 axis, three sigma_v planes, and a sigma_h plane.

So in that case, the molecule has more symmetry than just C3h. But the question is which has C3h symmetry. So if a molecule has D3h, it automatically has C3h. So option C would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but the question is which of the options has C3h. So if option C has D3h, which includes C3h, then it would satisfy the condition. So option C would be a correct answer.

But wait, let me think about the other options again.

Option A: Triphenyleno[...]trifuran. If it's a planar molecule with three substituents arranged symmetrically, maybe it has D3h symmetry as well. But I'm not certain.

Option B: Benzo[...]trifuran. It might have a different symmetry. Maybe C2v or something else.

Option D: Quinuclidine. I think it has a three-fold axis, but not a horizontal mirror plane. Or maybe it does. Wait, quinuclidine's structure is such that it's a bridge structure, so perhaps it's chiral? No, wait, quinuclidine is actually a meso compound because it has a plane of symmetry. So it's not chiral. Therefore, its point group includes a mirror plane. If the mirror plane is horizontal, then it would have C3h. So if quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry. But I'm not entirely sure about its point group.

Alternatively, I remember that quinuclidine has a point group of C3. Because it has a three-fold axis, but no mirror planes? Or maybe I'm mixing it up with another compound.

Wait, let me think: quinuclidine is bicyclo[2.2.2]heptane. It has a bridge structure. So the molecule is symmetric with a three-fold axis. If you look from above, you can rotate it 120 degrees and it will look the same. But mirror planes—does it have any? I think yes. Because it's a planar molecule? No, it's a bridged bicyclic structure. So, perhaps it has a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule. For example, a plane that cuts through the central bridge and reflects the molecule onto itself. So if it has a three-fold rotation axis and a vertical mirror plane, then it's C3v. But the question is about C3h, which requires a horizontal mirror plane. So unless the mirror plane is horizontal, which it might not be, quinuclidine may not have C3h symmetry.

So, going back. Which options have C3h symmetry?

Option C: Triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So it has C3h.

But perhaps the question is about whether any of the molecules have exactly C3h symmetry, not higher. But I think the question is which has C3h, regardless of whether it has more.

Alternatively, perhaps only triphenyleno[...]trifuran has C3h. Let me think.

Looking at the options again, the correct answer is probably option A or C.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A.

Wait, the question is multiple-choice with four options, and the options are labeled A to D.

Wait, the options are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So, the options are:

Option A: Triphenyleno...

Option B: Benzo...

Option C: Triisopropyl borate

Option D: Quinuclidine

Now, I think triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h, so it would have C3h. But the question is which one has C3h. So, option C would be correct.

But then, let's think about option A: Triphenyleno... I'm not sure, but perhaps it's a planar structure with a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, considering the substituents: triphenylene would have three phenyl groups attached to a central structure. If the central part has three-fold symmetry, then the overall molecule would have a three-fold axis. And if the molecule is planar, there's a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but the molecule also has three furan rings. So perhaps the entire structure is planar, leading to a horizontal mirror plane.

If that's the case, then option A would have C3h symmetry.

But I'm not entirely sure about the structure of option A. The name is a bit complex. The 'trifuran' part suggests three furan rings, each attached via specific positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of option A is such that each of the three substituents is symmetrically placed, leading to a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tough. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate, which definitely has D3h symmetry, hence C3h.

Wait, but the question is about C3h symmetry, not the exact point group. So any molecule with C3h symmetry is acceptable, whether it's in a higher symmetry group or not.

So, if triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, it has C3h. So it must be option C.

But wait, the options list option C as triisopropyl borate. So that's one.

Alternatively, maybe Benzo[...]trifuran (option B) has C3h symmetry. Let me think again.

Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The benzo suggests a benzene ring fused to three furan rings. The numbering suggests that the benzene is connected in a way that the substituents are symmetrically placed. Maybe it's a planar molecule with a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that allows a three-fold rotation, and there's a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis (horizontal), then option B would have C3h symmetry.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Another approach: Which of these structures are known for having C3h symmetry?

Triisopropyl borate is a common example used to explain trigonal symmetry. It's a classic case for D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So option C would be the correct answer.

So going back, the answer is option C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃h** symmetry requires a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) perpendicular to the rotation axis.

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
- This molecule consists of a central structure with three phenyl groups and three furan rings attached symmetrically. 
- The numbering suggests that the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). 
- If the molecule is planar, it could also have a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ), making it a candidate for **C₃h** symmetry. 
- However, the exact structure is complex, and without more detailed information, it is uncertain if it satisfies the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry.

#### **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
- This molecule includes a benzene ring fused with three furan rings. The numbering indicates a symmetric arrangement of substituents. 
- It likely has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). 
- Whether it has a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) depends on its planarity and symmetry. Without explicit structural details, it is unclear if it satisfies **C₃h** symmetry.

#### **Option C: Triisopropyl Borate**
- Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule with boron at the center and three identical isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically. 
- It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) in the plane of the molecule. 
- Additionally, it has a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) perpendicular to the rotation axis. 
- This molecule is known to belong to the **D₃h** point group, which includes **C₃h** symmetry as a subgroup. Therefore, it satisfies the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry.

#### **Option D: Quinuclidine**
- Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a bicyclo[2.2.2]heptane structure. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) due to its symmetric bridge arrangement. 
- It also has a plane of symmetry, but this plane is likely vertical rather than horizontal. 
- Since it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ), it does not satisfy the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Among the options, **triisopropyl borate (Option C)** is the only molecule that clearly has **C₃h** symmetry, as it belongs to the **D₃h** point group, which includes **C₃h** symmetry as a subgroup. The other options either lack sufficient symmetry or have uncertain structural details to confirm **C₃h** symmetry.

**Answer: C**
