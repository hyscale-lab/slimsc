Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and figuring out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Oh right, metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, typically swapping the ends.

So the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But in this case, since the molecule is a double bond, the configuration might affect the outcome. Let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent means five carbons, and the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Or wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH(CH3)CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, wait, the formula of pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl branch on carbon 3. So 3-methyl would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Or is it C1=C-C-C-C? Let me think again.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, right. So 3-methyl would be that, but with a methyl group on the third carbon. So the third carbon from the double bond. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, that can't be right. Let me count: Carbon 1: CH2=, Carbon 2: CH-, Carbon 3: CH(CH3), Carbon 4: CH2, Carbon 5: CH3. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, Grubbs catalyst induces ring-closing metathesis when possible. Alternatively, it can do cross metathesis or ring-opening. But in this case, since we have a mono-olefin, perhaps the reaction would be a ring-closing metathesis if possible, but wait, the molecule is straight-chain. Wait, actually, 3-methylpent-1-ene is a straight-chain molecule. So with Grubbs, maybe there's a possibility
