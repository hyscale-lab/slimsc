Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound. Let me read through the question carefully and think it through step by step.

The question says that the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's probably something like benzene with two substituents attached. The FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks for an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), which typically absorbs around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. So, that's a clue that the structure includes an ester group.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It has six signals:

1. Two signals for aromatic H. Wait, aromatic signals usually come in sets based on their neighboring groups. Since the ring is di-substituted, the substituents could be in positions that lead to different environments for the aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are para, ortho, or meta, the splitting would change. But in this case, there are two aromatic signals. Hmm, maybe it's a 1,3-disubstitution (meta) or perhaps something else. Let me think. Each substituent could affect the neighboring protons. So maybe the two substituents are in positions that split the aromatic ring into two sets of equivalent protons. Like, perhaps one substituent is in position 1, and another in position 3. That would leave two sets of aromatic protons: maybe two equivalent protons in one position and another two in another. But wait, a benzene ring with two substituents can have different scenarios. For example, if the substituents are para, then the ring has two sets of equivalent protons, each as doublets, right? Or maybe each substituent is such that it creates two distinct environments. So, the two signals in the NMR for aromatic H could be from two different sets of equivalent protons.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets, especially when they're part of a substituent with a neighboring group. A doublet of quartets suggests that the proton is coupled to two different sets of protons. Wait, maybe it's adjacent to a CH group that's coupled to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester? Like, maybe the ester is connected to a vinyl group, such as an allyl ester or something similar.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. Since there's no signal for –CH2, that suggests that all the CH2 groups are either not present or are in environments where their signals are integrated into another peak or split in a way not detected as a separate peak. So, maybe each CH3 is in a different environment because of their substituents. Or perhaps it's two equivalent CH3 groups, but that would give only one signal. Wait, the question says two signals, so they must be in different environments. Hmm.

Putting it all together, since the compound is di-substituted on a benzene ring and has an ester group, perhaps it's a substituted benzoate ester. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe something like methyl benzoate, but that's monosubstituted. Here, it's di-substituted, so perhaps one substituent is an ester group and another is something else.

Wait, or maybe the benzene ring has two ester substituents, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is attached as a substituent, and the other substituent is a vinyl group. For example, maybe we have a structure where the benzene has an ester group and a vinyl group attached. Let's imagine that.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. Vinyl groups are typically part of double bonds, so maybe the substituents on the ring are an ester and a vinyl group attached in such a way that each vinyl H is split into different signals. Or perhaps the substituent is an ester group connected to a vinyl group, like maybe a propenoate ester or something.

Alternatively, maybe it's a structure where the benzene has an ester group (like O-CO-O-R) and another substituent which is a vinyl group, such as CH2CH2, but that doesn't quite make sense. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like an allyl group attached via an ester.

Let me try to draw this out in my mind. Suppose the benzene ring has an ester group, say, OCOOR, attached to the ring. Then, another substituent could be a vinyl group, maybe as a CH2CH2 group, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent like CH2CH2COOR, but that seems more complicated. Maybe the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group attached to adjacent carbons, which would create a certain splitting in the NMR.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. Let me think about that. If the substituent is a vinyl
