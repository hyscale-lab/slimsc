Okay, so I have this question about a mouse model study involving the GADD45G protein. The person is trying to create a transgenic mouse where GADD45G is overexpressed. They added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells but can't overexpress the protein. They're looking at the construct's plus strand sequence, and they noticed something wrong.

Hmm. Let me think. The construct is the coding sequence with the HA tag. So the HA tag is at the beginning. The problem is that the protein isn't being expressed, so they're looking for why.

The options are about possible issues with the construct. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: The sequence for the HA determinant has a missense mutation. That would mean the HA tag is incorrect, which could make the protein not be recognized for purification. But would that prevent expression? Maybe not necessarily, but it could affect affinity purification.

Option B: The ribosome terminates early. That would mean a premature stop codon somewhere. If the mRNA has a stop codon early, the ribosome would stop. So looking at the sequence, I should check for any in-frame stop codons.

Option C: No linker causing proteolysis. A linker is often added between the tag and the protein to prevent proteases from cutting it. If it's missing, proteins might be cleaved. But the construct here adds the HA tag directly. So without a linker, maybe the HA is getting cleaved, but would that prevent expression? Or would it just prevent detection? Maybe expression is still happening, but the protein is not detected because it's cut off.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Mouse cells have the standard tRNAs, right? UAA is a stop codon. If the mouse lacks tRNA for UAA, then the ribosome wouldn't recognize the stop. But wait, UAA is a standard stop codon, and I think all cells have tRNAs for the standard start and stop. So perhaps this is a red herring.

Looking at the given DNA sequence, I need to see if there's a premature stop codon.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let's look for the first stop codon.

Looking through the sequence:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the first codon is ATG (start). Then TAC is Tyrosine, CCA is Proline, TAC is Y, etc. Continue looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Wait, the construct is the coding sequence, so it's from ATG to the end.

Let me scan the sequence for any of the stop codons.

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking through the sequence, let me go step by step.

Looking at the sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G T T C C A G AT T A C G C C AA T G A C T C TG GAA GAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC AAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CC G GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCG CTC AGG GCT GCG TCA CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCG CTC ACT GCC GGC GT C TAC GAG TCA GCC AAG GCT TTA CGT GGC CCC CGA CAA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGG TGA GGA GGA CCG AGG CGA CAT CGC GCT GCA GAT CCA TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTG CAG AAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCG TAT CGT GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CCG GCG GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAA GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GCT TGG AGA AGC TAG CAG CGT TAA CGA GGC AGC CAG CAG CGT GAA GCT CAG CCT GTT TTG CGA GGA GAG AGC GCG CGT TA C GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA 3'

Wait, perhaps I should look for the actual stop codons in the sequence.

Wait, the codons are read in triplets.

Let me parse the DNA sequence into codons, considering the reading frame starts at ATG (the first codon is ATG).

So let's split the sequence into triplets, starting from the ATG.

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G T T C C A G ATT ACG CCA ATT GAC TCT GGA GAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC AAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CC G GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCG CTC AGG GCT GCG TCA CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCG CTC ACT GCC GGC GT C TAC GAG TCA GCC AAG GCT TTA CGT GGC CCC CGA CAA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGG TGA GGA GGA CCG AGG CGA CAT CGC GCT GCA GAT CCA TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTG CAG AAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCG TAT CGT GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CCG GCG GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAA GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GCT TGG AGA AGC TAG CAG CGT TAA CGA GGC AGC CAG CAG CGT GAA GCT CAG CCT GTT TTG CGA GGA GAG AGC GCG CGT TA C GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA

Wait, I think I made a mistake in splitting. Let me re-do this with the actual DNA sequence.

The whole plus strand is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G T T C C A G ATT ACG CCA ATT GAC TCT GGA GAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC AAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CC G GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCG CTC AGG GCT GCG TCA CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCG CTC ACT GCC GGC GT C TAC GAG TCA GCC AAG GCT TTA CGT GGC CCC CGA CAA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGG TGA GGA GGA CCG AGG CGA CAT CGC GCT GCA GAT CCA TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTG CAG AAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCG TAT CGT GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CCG GCG GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAA GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GCT TGG AGA AGC TAG CAG CGT TAA CGA GGC AGC CAG CAG CGT GAA GCT CAG CCT GTT TTG CGA GGA GAG AGC GCG CGT TA C GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA 3'

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the stop codons in the mRNA. Since the DNA is the coding strand, the mRNA would be complementary.

Wait, actually, the given sequence is the plus (coding) strand. So the mRNA is the same as this, except T becomes U.

Looking for the stop codons in the mRNA, which would be UAA, UAG, UGA.

Looking through the sequence:

- Let's look for any occurrence of UAA, UAG, UGA.

Wait, let's go through the DNA sequence, which is the same as the mRNA except Tâ†’U.

Looking for triplet sequences that would correspond to stop codons.

Looking for the triplet TAA in DNA (which is UAA in mRNA), TAG (UAG), or TGA (UGA).

Looking through the DNA:

The sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So first codon is ATG (Met), then TAC (Y), CCA (P), etc.

Looking for any TAG, TGA, or TAA.

Wait, looking at the end of the sequence:

... TGA GGA GGA CCG AGG CGA CAT CGC GCT GCA GAT CCA TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTG CAG AAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCG TAT CGT GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CCG GCG GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAA GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GCT TGG AGA AGC TAG CAG CGT TAA CGA GGC AGC CAG CAG CGT GAA GCT CAG CCT GTT TTG CGA GGA GAG AGC GCG CGT TA C GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA

Wait, here's a TGA in the DNA sequence. Let me see: ... AGA AGC TAG CAG CGT TAA CGA GGC ... So the triplet TAG in DNA is complementary to ATC. No, wait. No, wait. Wait, the DNA is in the plus strand. So the mRNA would be same as the plus strand, so any TGA would become UGA, which is a stop.

Wait, looking more carefully.

Looking at the sequence, I see "TGA" appears. Let me pick that out.

Looking at the end: ... TGA GGA GGA CCG ... So the triplet is T G A, which in DNA is TGA. So in mRNA, that's UGA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, that's in the middle of the coding sequence. So this would cause the ribosome to terminate early. Because if there's a stop codon in the middle, translation would stop there.

Wait, but where is this TGA? Let me see the exact position.

The part is: ... TGA GGA GGA CCG ... So the T G A is in the middle. So that would cause a premature stop. So that would make the construct have a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. But the person is trying to overexpress the GADD45G, so if the stop is in the middle, the protein wouldn't be full-length, perhaps leading to no detectable expression.

So that's option B: the ribosome terminated early.

But wait, the question says that the person couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. So if the construct has a stop codon, the protein would be too short or not made at all.

Alternatively, maybe the construct is read through beyond that? No, because the stop codon would halt translation.

But wait, let me look again. The TGA is after the HA tag? Because the HA is at the N-terminus. So the HA tag is supposed to be at the beginning, and the GADD45G coding sequence follows.

Wait, when they introduced the HA tag, perhaps it's at the start of the coding sequence. So the HA sequence is before the GADD45G starts. So in the plus strand, the HA would be at the beginning.

But in the given DNA sequence, the first codon is ATG (start), then TAC (Y), etc. So the HA would be part of the coding sequence. So if the HA tag is part of the construct, then the GADD45G coding is right after.

So in the plus strand sequence, the HA is part of the coding, then the GADD45G starts.

Wait, but in the DNA, the HA is a short peptide. Let me think about the HA tag. The HA tag is usually a short peptide, like YPYDHH. So it's added as a short sequence at the beginning.

But in the construct, the person modified the coding sequence by introducing the HA at the N-terminus. So the HA would be the first part of the coding sequence. So the HA is in the first part of the mRNA, after the start codon.

But if there's a TGA (stop codon) in the middle, that would cause the protein to terminate early.

So the presence of TGA in the middle would lead to a truncated protein, which might be why they can't detect overexpression.

So the issue is that the construct has a premature stop codon, causing early termination.

Looking at the options, option B is "The ribosome terminated the translation early." That would be caused by a premature stop codon.

Alternatively, looking at the sequence, is there a TGA or another stop codon?

Yes, I found TGA in the sequence.

Wait, another thought: Is the TGA part of the HA tag? Because if the HA wasn't correctly added, but in this case, it's part of the coding sequence.

But regardless, the presence of a TGA in the middle would cause a stop.

So the problem is that the construct has a stop codon in the middle, leading to premature termination.

So the correct answer would be option B.

Another possibility is option C: lack of linker causing proteolysis. But that would mean the protein is expressed but gets cut. But the question says they couldn't overexpress, which suggests little or no protein is made, not that it's cleaved.

Option A: If the HA has a mutation, maybe the antibody can't bind, but the protein is expressed. But the problem is they couldn't overexpress it, so it's more likely a problem with the construct causing no protein.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. But UAA is a stop, and all cells have that. So not likely.

So the main issue is a premature stop codon.


To determine why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed, we analyze the provided DNA sequence of the plus strand and evaluate the options:

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**  
   A missense mutation in the HA tag could affect purification but would not necessarily prevent protein expression. The issue here is the lack of overexpression, which suggests a more fundamental problem.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early**  
   Scanning the DNA sequence for stop codons reveals the presence of **TGA** in the middle of the coding sequence. In the mRNA, this corresponds to **UGA**, a stop codon. This premature stop codon would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated or non-functional protein. This aligns with the observation of failed overexpression.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**  
   Without a linker, proteases might cleave the protein. However, this would not prevent expression but could lead to undetectable or truncated protein. The issue here is the complete lack of overexpression, which points to a problem upstream, such as premature termination.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**  
   UAA is a standard stop codon, and all cells, including mice, have the corresponding tRNA. This option is unlikely to explain the lack of protein expression.

### Conclusion:
The presence of the **TGA** codon in the middle of the coding sequence is the most plausible explanation. This stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, preventing the full-length protein from being expressed. This aligns with the observation of failed overexpression.

**Answer: B**
