Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The question says: We have a state |alpha> that's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think this means they're the standard basis states for spin-1/2 systems.

Then, we're supposed to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator's matrix representation A has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that sounds familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 0s on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So if I remember right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and X is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is diagonal with 1 and -1. So our operator A here is (hbar/2) times X. So the eigenstates of A should be the same as the eigenstates of X, right?

Wait, because if you have an operator multiplied by a scalar, its eigenstates remain the same. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of X. So what are the eigenstates of X? Oh right, the eigenstates are the superposition states: (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because X flips the spin states, so its eigenstates are the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations.

So the first part is to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate. So we need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates of A. Then the square of the coefficients will give the probabilities.

But wait, |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I should normalize it to get the actual state. Because the way it's written is "proportional", so the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> divided by its norm.

So the norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2. Let me compute that. |1+i| is sqrt(1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(2), so squared is 2. |2 -i| is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2)=sqrt(4+1)=sqrt(5), so squared is 5. So total is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the eigenstates of A (which is (hbar/2) X) are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). So I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, or maybe find the expansion coefficients of |alpha> in this basis.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>. Let me set up the equations.

Let |alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>.

Expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, this is:

a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) = [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

But we know that |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So equating the coefficients:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these equations as:

a + b = (1+i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)
a - b = (2 - i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)

Wait, more accurately, from the expressions above:

Coefficient of |up>:
(a + b) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
Coefficient of |down>:
(a - b)/sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So, equation 1: a + b = (1+i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) )  →  (1+i)√(2/7)
Equation 2: a - b = (2 -i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → (2 -i)√(2/7)

Now, I can solve for a and b.

Adding equation1 and equation2:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7) → [3] * sqrt(2/7)
So a = (3) * sqrt(2/7) / 2 = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Subtracting equation2 from equation1:

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7) → [ (1+i -2 +i ) ] → ( -1 + 2i ) sqrt(2/7)
So b = ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7) / 2 = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ] / ( 2 sqrt(7) )

Now, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Let me compute |a|^2 first.

a = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

So |a|^2 = [ (3^2) * 2 ] / (4 * 7) ) = (9 * 2)/(4 *7 )= 18/(28)=9/14 ≈0.6429.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857... which is about 0.643.

Now |b|^2: Let's compute b. So b is [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / ( 2 sqrt(7) )

The magnitude squared would be [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * (sqrt(2))^2 ] / ( (2 sqrt(7))^2 )

Compute numerator:

(1 +4) *2 =5 * 2=10.

Denominator: (4 *7 )=28.

So |b|^2 =10/28=5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1. That's correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Looking at the options given:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7 → 0.64 and 0.36 sum to 1, which matches. So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.6429 and 5/14 ≈0.3571. So option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which is very close. But wait, 9/14 is exactly 0.642857... So 0.64 is correct, but 0.36 is 5/14 which is 0.3571. So 0.36 is a rounded value.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculation of a and b.

Wait, the expression for |alpha> is a|+x> + b|−x>, which we expressed in terms of a and b. But perhaps I should compute a and b differently. Maybe another approach would be better.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |−x> to get the coefficients.

Yes, that might be a better approach. Because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So the inner product < +x | alpha > is ( <up| + <down| )/sqrt(2) multiplied by [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So let's compute that:

< +x | alpha > = [ ( <up| + <down| ) (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Which is [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <down|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|down> ] / (sqrt(14)).

But <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1, and <up|down> is 0, same for <down|up>.

So this simplifies to [ (1+i)(1) + (2 -i)(0) + (1+i)(0) + (2 -i)(1) ] / sqrt(14).

Which is [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) → [3] / sqrt(14).

So < +x | alpha > = 3 / sqrt(14).

So the probability P(+x) is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.64286.

Similarly, compute < -x | alpha >.

| -x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So < -x | alpha > is [ ( <up| - <down| ) (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Which is [ (1+i) <up|up> - (2 -i) <down|up> + (1+i) <up|down> - (2 -i) <down|down> ] / sqrt(14).

Again, cross terms are zero, so:

(1+i)(1) - (2 -i)(1) / sqrt(14)

Wait wait, no. Let me compute each term:

= (1+i)(1) + 0 (since <down|up> is 0) + 0 (since <up|down> is 0) - (2 -i)(1)

= (1+i) - (2 - i) ) / sqrt(14).

Simplify numerator: 1 + i -2 +i = (-1 + 2i).

So < -x | alpha > = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

So the probability P(-
