Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, I think the nu here is a neutrino, right? Because pion decay typically involves a lepton and a neutrino. So Pi plus is at rest before decaying into a muon plus and a neutrino.

The rest masses are given: the Pi(+) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon plus has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. Hmm, wait, I remember that neutrinos are very light, but in problems like this, sometimes their mass is neglected. So maybe I should treat the neutrino as having zero rest mass. Or maybe the problem assumes it's a massless particle, which would simplify things.

So the problem is asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving two KE values. I think in this decay, the pion is at rest, so the muon and neutrino will move off in opposite directions with certain energies.

I remember that in such decay processes, the total energy is conserved, and so is momentum. Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So let's think about conservation of energy and momentum. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Each particle's energy is the sum of their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy is just its kinetic energy, right? Or if we consider it as a relativistic particle, it's kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy, but if m is zero, then E = pc. So for the neutrino, E_neu = p_neu c, where p is its momentum.

For the muon, its energy E_mu is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). So E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2 ). Also, since momentum is conserved, p_mu = p_neu (but opposite in direction), so p_mu = p, p_neu = p as magnitudes. So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_neu.

Setting E_initial = E_mu + E_neu:

139.6 MeV = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c

Hmm, I think that's the equation I need to solve for p. Let me write this as:

Let’s denote p c as x. Then the equation becomes:

139.6 = sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x

I can rearrange this:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expand the right side:

= (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 x + x²

So, substituting:

x² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x + x²

The x² terms cancel out.

So, 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x

Let me compute 105.7² and 139.6².

105.7^2 = (100 + 5.7)^2 = 10000 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 approximately. Wait, wait, let me compute it accurately.

105.7 * 105.7. Let me calculate:

105 * 105 = 11025. 0.7 *105 = 73.5. So, (105 +0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49 Me
