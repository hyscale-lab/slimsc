Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, the question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, I think. So the mass number A would be 6.

I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, the energy isn't just kinetic but also includes rest mass energy. Oh wait, the problem is probably asking for the total energy, not just the kinetic part. Or maybe it's the kinetic energy? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The question says "energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." RHIC accelerates ions to high speeds, so their total energy would be gamma times the rest mass energy. But maybe the question just wants the kinetic energy, or perhaps the total. Hmm.

Wait, the problem statement is a bit unclear. The question says "the energy of the RHIC". I think in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy each beam has. Or sometimes the total energy. But I'm not 100% sure. Let's proceed with both possibilities and see which one makes sense with the given options.

First, let's find the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. The atomic mass of Li is approximately 6.941 g/mol. Wait, but more accurately, the molar mass is about 6
