Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Pi(+) is at rest, so the pion isn't moving initially. 

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Hmm, wait, the neutrino's mass is usually negligible, right? I think in these kinds of problems, the neutrino is assumed to have zero mass because otherwise, it complicates things a lot. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So, the pion is at rest, and it decays into a muon and a neutrino. Since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. So, the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That means their magnitudes of momentum are equal, but their directions are opposite.

But wait, in terms of energy, the pion's total energy is just its rest energy because it's at rest. So the total energy before decay is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Since the pion is at rest, its energy is all rest mass energy. So, the muon and neutrino share this energy. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino's rest mass is zero. So, the muon's total energy will be its rest energy plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is purely kinetic since its rest mass is zero.

Let me denote the muon's energy as E_mu and the neutrino's energy as E_nu. So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Also, the pion's decay must conserve momentum, so the momentum of the muon (p_mu) is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the neutrino's momentum (p_nu). So, p_mu = -p_nu.

Each particle's energy is related to its momentum and rest mass. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. But since we're working in units where c=1 (as MeV and MeV/c² are used), the equation simplifies to E² = p² + m².

So for the muon, E_mu² = p_mu² + (105.7)^2.
And for the neutrino, E_nu² = p_nu² + 0, since m=0. So E_nu = p_nu.

But since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), E_mu² = (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2.

Wait, no, because p_mu is in the opposite direction, but since we square it, the magnitude is what matters. So yes, E_mu² = (p_mu)^2 + (105.7)^2, and E_nu = p_nu = p_mu (since p_nu = -p_mu, but magnitude is same).

So substituting E_nu = p_mu into the muon equation:

E_mu² = (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2.

But we also have E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.

So now, I can set up two equations:

1. E_mu + E_nu = 139.6
2. E_mu² = (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2

Let me call E_nu as x for simplicity. Then E_mu = 139.6 - x.

Substituting into equation 2:

(139.6 - x)^2 = x^2 + (105.7)^2.

Expanding the left side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2 = x^2 + (105.7)^2.

The x^2 terms cancel on both sides:

(139.6)^2 - 279.2 x = (105.7)^2.

Calculating the squares:

139.6^2 is (approx) 139.6 * 139.6. Let me compute that. 140^2 is 19600, minus 0.4*2*140 + (0.4)^2. Wait, wait, no, perhaps better to compute it as (130 + 9.6)^2 = 130² + 2*130*9.6 + 9.6² = 16900 + 2496 + 92.16 = let's see: 16900+2496=19396, plus 92.16=19488.16.

Wait, but 139.6 squared: 139.6 *139.6. Let me compute it more accurately.

139 *139 = (140-1)^2 = 140² - 2*140 +1 = 19600 - 280 +1= 19321.

Wait, no, that's 139 squared. 139.6 is 139 + 0.6.

So (139 + 0.6)^2 = 139² + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6².

139² is 19321. 2*139*0.6= 2*83.4=166.8. 0.6²=0.36.

So 19321 + 166.8=19487.8 +0.36=19488.16 MeV².

Similarly, 105.7^2: 105^2=11025, plus 2*105*0.7=147, plus 0.7^2=0.49 → 11025+147=11172 +0.49=11172.49.

So substituting back into the equation:

19488.16 - 279.2 x = 11172.49.

Rearranging: 19488.16 -11172.49 = 279.2 x.

Compute 19488.16 -11172.49: 19488 - 11172.49 is 8315.57 (since 19488.16 -11172.49 = let me do it step by step:

19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 minus 11000 is 8488.16.

8488.16 minus 172.49 is 8315.67.

So 8315.67 = 279.2 x → x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that division.

279.2 * 30 = 8376 → which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 29. So 279.2 *29.7 ≈ let's see:

279.2 * 30 =8376.

So 29.7 *279.2 = 279.2*(30-0.3)=8376 - (279.2*0.3)=8376 -83.76=8292.24.

Hmm, 8292.24 is less than 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67-8292.24=23.43.

So 23.43 / 279.2 ≈ 0.084. So x ≈29.7 +0.084=29.784 ≈29.78 MeV.

So x is E_nu ≈29.78 MeV.

Then E_mu = 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82 MeV.

Wait, but the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu.

So KE_mu =109.82 -105.7 =4.12 MeV.

And the neutrino's kinetic energy is E_nu, which is 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait in the beginning, I assumed E_nu = p_mu. Because for the neutrino, E_nu = sqrt(p^2 c^4 + m^2 c^4), but since m=0, E_nu = p c. But since we're using units where c=1, E_nu = p.

But in the equation, E_mu² = (p_mu )^2 + m_mu^2.

Wait, hold on, wait, the pion is at rest, and the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, p_mu = - p_nu.

So, their magnitudes are equal, so |p_mu|=|p_nu|=p.

So, E_mu² = (p)^2 + (105.7)^2.

E_nu² = (p)^2.

So E_nu = p.

Thus, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt( E_nu^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

But E_mu + E_nu =139.6.

So, substituting E_mu =139.6 - E_nu into the equation:

(139.6 - E_nu)^2 = E_nu^2 + (105.7)^2.

Expanding: 139.6² - 2*139.6 E_nu + E_nu² = E_nu² +105.7².

Cancel E_nu²: 139.6² -279.2 E_nu = 105.7².

So, 139.6² is 19488.16 as computed earlier.

19488.16 - 279.2 E_nu = 11172.49.

So, 19488.16 -11172.49 = 279.2 E_nu.

Which is 8315.67 = 279.2 E_nu.

So E_nu =8315.67 /279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV.

E_mu = 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82 MeV.

Then, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.82 - 105.7 =4.12 MeV.

So KE of mu is 4.12, neutrino is 29.78. Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 and 29.8, which matches.


To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use the conservation of energy and momentum principles. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), and the neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed to have negligible rest mass (\(m_\nu = 0\)).

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay must be equal:
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu
   \]
   Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is purely its rest energy:
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**: For each particle:
   \[
   E_{\mu^+}^2 = p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2, \quad E_\nu^2 = p_\nu^2.
   \]
   Since momentum is conserved and the pion is stationary, the magnitudes of the momenta of \(\mu^+\) and \(\nu\) are equal:
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu.
   \]

3. **Substitution**: Let \(E_\nu = p_\nu\) (since \(m_\nu = 0\)) and \(E_{\mu^+} = 139.6 - E_\nu\). Substituting into the energy-momentum relation for \(\mu^+\):
   \[
   (139.6 - E_\nu)^2 = E_\nu^2 + (105.7)^2.
   \]

### Solving for \(E_\nu\):
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot E_\nu + E_\nu^2 = E_\nu^2 + 105.7^2.
\]
Cancel \(E_\nu^2\) and rearrange:
\[
139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot E_\nu.
\]
Compute the squares:
\[
139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49.
\]
\[
19488.16 - 11172.49 = 279.2 \cdot E_\nu.
\]
\[
8315.67 = 279.2 \cdot E_\nu \quad \Rightarrow \quad E_\nu = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Finding \(E_{\mu^+}\):
Using energy conservation:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = 139.6 - E_\nu = 139.6 - 29.78 \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energies:
The kinetic energy of the muon is:
\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The kinetic energy of the neutrino is:
\[
KE_\nu = E_\nu = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) for the muon and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\) for the neutrino. This matches **Option D**.
