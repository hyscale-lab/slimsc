Alright, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Okay, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's six carbons from the benzene rings (since phenyl groups are common in such structures), but wait, C8H9NO... Let me think. Benzene rings have six carbons, so maybe there's a side chain attached. Let's see: two phenyl groups would be 12 carbons, but wait, that's way over. Oh wait wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So 8 carbons in total.

Looking at the NMR data: the peaks are at 9.72 ppm as a triplet (1H), 6.98 as a doublet (2H), 6.51 as another doublet (2H), 6.27 as a broad singlet (2H), and 3.66 as a doublet (2H). Hmm.

The first thing that comes to mind is that the peak at 9.72 is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet, but in this case, it's a triplet. Wait, but maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde, so coupling with adjacent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol tautomer, but that's less likely. So assuming it's an aldehyde group.

Then looking at the aromatic regions: 6.98 and 6.51, both doublets. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, each proton is equivalent, and they couple with two adjacent protons. Wait, no, wait. If it's a para-substituted ring, each proton is a doublet because each is next to one proton on the adjacent carbon. But in a para-substituted benzene, each H is in a pair. So, perhaps that's two different para-substituted rings?

Wait, I have two sets of doublets. 6.98 ppm and 6.51 ppm. Maybe each is a different para-substituted ring. So maybe the molecule has two phenyl groups attached to a central structure.

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad singlet suggests maybe some exchange, like an acidic proton, such as an -OH group. Or maybe it's a conjugated system, like in an enol structure. But given that it's a singlet and broad, perhaps it's two -OH protons, but wait, usually -OH protons are split or appear as broad singlets. But integrating to 2H could mean two -OH groups, or maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic ring with some coupling.

Wait, but another possibility is that the 6.27 is part of a conjugated diene. Or maybe it's a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom. Hmm, not sure.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet of 2H. That's probably a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. So maybe -O-CH2- something.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a molecule with two phenyl groups attached to a chain. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Wait, looking at the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 → (9)/2 = 4.5? Wait, that can’t be right because you can’t have half a degree. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So the calculation is:

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = [2C + 2 - H - X + N]/2

C=8, H=9, X=0 (since no halogens), N=1, O=1.

So, 2*8=16 +2=18. Minus H (9) gives 9. Minus X (0) gives 9. Plus N (1) gives 10. Divided by 2: 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation.

Breaking that down: each benzene ring has 3 DoU (since each ring is 3). But wait, if there are two benzene rings, that's 6 DoU, but we have only 5. So perhaps that's not possible. So maybe one benzene ring and another double bond or ring.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps one ring is a benzene (4 DoU, since benzene is 3 DoU (3 rings) plus one more double bond). Wait, no: benzene is 4 DoU? No, benzene has 3 DoU: one ring (counts as 1) and three double bonds (count as 3), but actually, it's one ring and three double bonds. Wait, no, each ring and each double bond is a DoU. So benzene has three double bonds and one ring: but wait, that's four DoU. Wait, no. Each ring is one DoU, each double bond is another. So benzene has three rings? No, wait, benzene has one ring (counts as one DoU) and three double bonds (each is another, so three DoU). So total four DoU. But in our case, the compound has five DoU, so that's one more than benzene. So maybe it's a benzene ring plus another ring or double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a benzene ring and an enal (alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde), which would have a double bond and a ring (from the aldehyde's structure), but I need to think.

Looking back at the NMR. The triplet at 9.72 could be an aldehyde proton that is next to a CH2 group. Because, for an aldehyde (RCHO), the aldehyde proton is usually a singlet. If it's a triplet, maybe it's coupled with two adjacent protons on a CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde. So the aldehyde is at the end of a CH2-CHO group. So that could be a structure like CH2-CHO attached to something else.

So in that case, the 3.66 doublet would be the CH2 next to the aldehyde. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2(Ph)CH2CHO, but that doesn't fit the formula. Wait, let's see.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about the possible structures. If it's an aldehyde attached to a chain that has two phenyl groups, but that might not add up.

Wait another approach: the reagents given are first NaNO2 and HCl (which is nitrous acid, usually for diazotization), followed by H2O, then aqueous KOH and heat.

So the reaction conditions: first, diazotization, which suggests that the starting compound has an amino group (-NH2) because diazotization is for aryl amines. Wait, but wait. Diazotization is typically for aromatic amines, which are usually in the form of an amine group attached to a benzene ring. So the compound has an -NH2 group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If it has an amine group, then the formula includes NH2. So let's see: if the structure is something like a benzylamine derivative.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any signals that I would expect from an NH2 group. NH2 protons usually show up broad around 1-5 ppm, but in this NMR, the only broad signal is at 6.27 ppm, which is in the aromatic region. Hmm, maybe the -NH2 is in a different environment, or perhaps it's a part of an enamine or something else.

Wait, but the first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl. This is usually used for diazotization of aromatic amines. So the starting compound must have an aromatic amine group, like an aniline derivative.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data again: the 9.72 ppm is a triplet, 1H. Maybe that's an NH group, but aliphatic amines usually have NH protons around 1-5 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde.

Wait, but the initial thought was that 9.72 is the aldehyde proton. So how does that fit with the reagents? Maybe the starting compound has an aldehyde group and an amino group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: C8H9NO. If it's an aldehyde (CHO, which is O), plus an amine group (NH2, which is N), let's calculate.

Structure could be something like Ph-CH2-CHO, but that would be C8H8O. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. So perhaps there's an NH2 group somewhere.

Wait, another approach: the first reaction is diazotization, which would convert an aromatic amine to a diazonium salt. Then, when you add water (H2O), it's a hydrolysis step. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions, like hydrolysis to phenols (if aromatic ring is activated), or to azo compounds, etc. The third step is aqueous KOH with heat, which suggests some kind of elimination or hydrolysis, possibly to form a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, putting this together: the starting material has an aromatic amine group. After diazotization, the amine is converted to a diazonium salt. Then, in the presence of water, it undergoes hydrolysis. Typically, aromatic diazonium salts hydrolyze to phenols if the ring is activated (like with electron-donating groups), but if the ring is deactivated, it might decompose differently.

But wait, after the first two steps, the product is treated with aqueous KOH and heat. That could be for elimination, perhaps forming a double bond or ring.

Wait, but let me think about the overall reaction. The starting material is an aniline derivative. Diazotization converts the amine to a diazonium chloride. Then, perhaps hydrolysis under acidic conditions (HCl is present in the first step) would form a phenol. But wait, after the first step, when you add H2O, which is just water, perhaps it's a simple hydrolysis.

Wait, another possibility: the diazonium salt can undergo a Sandmeyer reaction, but that usually involves CuCl or other catalysts. Since the second step is just H2O, perhaps it's a hydrolysis to form a phenol.

Wait, but then the third step is aqueous KOH and heat. That might be a saponification or some kind of elimination. Alternatively, it could be a dehydration to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me think about the NMR of the starting material. If the starting material is an aniline derivative with a substituent attached, perhaps a side chain that includes an aldehyde group.

Wait, but another thought: the starting compound might be a benzalacetophenone derivative, but that doesn't fit the formula. Alternatively, it's a diphenyl compound with an amino group and an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the starting structure is something like diphenylamine with a side chain. Let me try to work out the formula.

Wait, let's think about the NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) is probably the aldehyde proton. The 3.66 ppm (2H, doublet) is likely a CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde, as we thought earlier. So perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO, but that's C8H7O. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. So where's the N?

Ah, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-NH2? But that would be more hydrogens. No, maybe an aldehyde and an amino group somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an α-amino ketone or something similar. But I'm getting a bit
