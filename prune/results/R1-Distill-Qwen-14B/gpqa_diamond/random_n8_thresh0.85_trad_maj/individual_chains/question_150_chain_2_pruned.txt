Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, so first, I should calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, wait, the formula for that is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, I think I've got it wrong. No, wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Let me plug in the numbers. C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So 2*8 + 2 = 18. 18 -9 =9, minus X, but X is zero here. Plus N, which is 1. So 9 +1=10. 10 divided by 2 is 5 degrees of unsaturation. So 5. That could be a ring and some double bonds or rings and double bonds. 

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t) and 1H. That's a high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, it's a triplet. Aldehyde protons are usually singlets, but maybe it's something else. Or maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde. Or maybe it's an acidic proton like in a phenol, but 9.72 is more like an aldehyde.

Then 6.98 ppm is a doublet (d) of 2H. Lower downfield, maybe aromatic protons. Then 6.51, also a doublet (d) of 2H. Hmm, that looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are equivalent, and coupling between adjacent protons would give doublets. So maybe two aromatic rings are present, each with substituents in the para positions.

Wait, the two doublets could be part of a conjugated diene or perhaps a substituent on a benzene ring. But for a benzene ring, if it's a para-substituted, the ring protons would be as a doublet each, but maybe split into a certain pattern. Or perhaps it's a substituent with two different sets of aromatic protons.

Wait, but wait, the 6.98 and 6.51 are each 2H. So maybe two different aromatic rings, each with two sets of protons. Or perhaps a single aromatic ring with substituents leading to two doublets.

Wait, another peak: 6.27, a broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH proton, but wait, that's 2H. So maybe a dienol, or perhaps some conjugated protons. Or maybe it's a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen. Hmm.

Then 3.66 ppm is a doublet (d) of 2H. That's upfield. Maybe an OCH2 group, like an ether or an ester. Or maybe an amino group adjacent to CH2, but with NMR, 3.66 is more likely to be an ether or adjacent to oxygen, like a methylene group attached to an oxygen.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something with an aldehyde group, two aromatic rings (maybe with substituents), and an ether or something similar.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So let's see: if it's a diphenyl compound, each phenyl is C6H5. So two phenyl groups would be C12H10. But our formula is C8H9NO, which is way smaller. So maybe it's not two benzene rings. Alternatively, perhaps one benzene ring and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative. Let's think: benzaldehyde is C7H6O, but our compound is C8H9NO, which is larger. So perhaps it's a benzaldehyde with substituents.

Another approach: The NMR shows a triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H). So perhaps that's the aldehyde proton. But why a triplet? Aldehydes usually show as singlets. Hmm. Unless it's coupled with another proton. Maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde, like in a vinyl group adjacent to the aldehyde. Or perhaps it's part of a di-substituted aldehyde.

Wait, another thought: could it be an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde? For example, something like CH2=CHCHO. But in that case, the aldehyde proton would be split if it's adjacent to a double bond. So the aldehyde H would couple with the adjacent CH2. But in the NMR, it's a triplet, so that would mean coupling with two protons. So maybe the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group which is adjacent to a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the 3.66 ppm, it's a d (doublet) of 2H. So perhaps that's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, which is in turn connected to something else. Maybe an OCH2 group next to a carbonyl. For example, in a structure like R-O-CH2-CHO, but that's just a guess.

Let me consider the possible structure. Let's see. The 9.72 is a triplet (1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H).

Wait,
