Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The elements Aij are such that Aij = ħ/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Then I also have to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. Wait, so the operator in question has a matrix where the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. That must be a 2x2 matrix because the state is in a two-level system (since it's a spin-1/2 particle, I think).

Wait, the operator's matrix is A with elements Aij = ħ/2 when i≠j, else 0. So for a 2x2 matrix, that would look like:
[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Is that right? Because for a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j can be 1 and 2. So when i=1 and j=2, it's ħ/2, and when i=2 and j=1, it's ħ/2. The diagonals are zero.

Wait a minute, but operators are usually Hermitian, right? Because their eigenvalues are real. So let me check: for a matrix to be Hermitian, the elements must satisfy A_ij = A_ji*. So in this case, A12 = ħ/2, and A21 would have to be the complex conjugate of A12. But in the problem statement, it says Aij is zero when i=j and ħ/2 otherwise. So if it's a real number, then the matrix is symmetric. So if ħ is real, then the matrix is Hermitian. Because A_ij = A_ji, which is the same as their complex conjugates since the elements are real. So that's fine.

So the operator matrix is:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0  ]

Wait, but that would make the operator A equal to (ħ/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|). Alternatively, it's like the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

Wait, but the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so this operator is Hermitian, which makes sense because it's an observable.

So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So to find the probabilities, I need to express the state |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates, right?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize the operator A and find its eigenvectors, but since A is proportional to σ_x, I can use the known eigenstates of σ_x.

Wait, so the eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because σ_x |+x> = +|+x>, and similarly for the other.

But first, I think I need to normalize the given state |alpha>, because the problem says it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.

So let me compute the normalization. Let me write |alpha> as a vector in the basis |up>, |down>.

Let me denote |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>.

So the components are (1+i) and (2 -i). The normalization factor is the inverse of the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each component.

So the magnitude of the first component is |1 + i| = sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). The magnitude of the second component is |2 - i| = sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1)= sqrt(5).

So the norm is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (2) + (5) =7.

So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, I need to find the probability of measuring the eigenstates of operator A, which are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of σ_x.

So the eigenstates are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to find the probabilities, I can compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x>, take the square magnitudes.

So first, let's compute the inner product of |alpha> and |+x>.

Inner product < +x | alpha > is:

( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2)  multiplied by  [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) .

So this becomes:

[ (1+i) + (2 -i) ) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Wait, because each term would be <up|alpha> and <down|alpha>, but multiplied by 1/sqrt(2) each.

Wait, let me compute this more carefully.

Wait, the inner product < +x | alpha> = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7) ]

So the product is (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ <up| (1+i)|up> + <up| (2-i)|down> + <down| (1+i)|up> + <down| (2-i)|down> ]

But <up| down> is zero, and <down| up> is zero. So the cross terms vanish.

So it's (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <down
