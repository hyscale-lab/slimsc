Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. The initial solution is made by diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, they titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I should calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid. Then, I can figure out how much NaOH is needed at 25% titration and at equivalence. After that, I can determine the pH at each of those points.

So, step 1: diluting acetic acid.

The initial volume is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. When you dilute it with the same volume (20 cm³) of water, the new concentration can be found using M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. V2 is 0.04 L (since 20+20=40 cm³). So,

M2 = (M1 * V1)/V2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

So, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, wait. Because the formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So, M2 = (M1 V1)/(V1 + V2) ? No, wait, V2 is the final volume. So, V1 is 0.02 L, V2 is 0.04 L. So M2 = (0.05 * 0.02)/0.04 = (0.001)/0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's correct.

So now, the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will equal moles of CH3COOH initially.

So, let me calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.

Volume is 40 cm³ = 0.04 L. Molarity is 0.025 M.

Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. So, 1e-3 mol?

Wait, 0.025 * 0.04 is 0.001. Yup.

So, at equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will be 0.001 mol as well.

But since the NaOH is 0.1 M, what volume of NaOH is needed for equivalence?

Volume (L) = moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So, the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But the question is at 25% titration, which I think refers to 25% of the equivalence point. So, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "at 25% titration"—so that's 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So
