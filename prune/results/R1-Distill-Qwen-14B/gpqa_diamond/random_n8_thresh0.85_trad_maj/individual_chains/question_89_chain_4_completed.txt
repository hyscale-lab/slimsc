Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. I'm going to take it slow because I'm still learning the ropes.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. Hmm, I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, forming an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Oh wait, wait! The structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons. So when KOH is added, it should eliminate to form an alkene. That makes sense.

So the product from the first reaction, product 1, is probably 1,3-adamantene or something similar. But wait, the NMR data says 4.79 ppm for 2H. That region is usually around where alkenes have protons, but wait, 4.79 is a bit high for a typical alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? No, wait, an epoxide would have protons around 3.5-4.5 ppm, and the coupling would be more like a triplet if it's a vicinal diol or something else. Oh, another thought: maybe it's a diol. Because KOH can also cause substitution, but wait, with two Br atoms, elimination is more likely, but if conditions are such, maybe substitution occurs. But with excess KOH and heating, elimination (E2) is more favorable. So the product should be an alkene.

Wait, but the NMR shows 4.79 for 2H. Maybe that's an epoxide? No, wait, no, because KOH wouldn't form an epoxide. Wait, maybe it's an ether? Or perhaps a ketone? Wait, the IR spectrum has an absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Oh, so that suggests a carbonyl group is present. So product 1 has a carbonyl. So what reaction of dibromide gives a carbonyl?

Oh, wait! Maybe it's a di-elimination, but more likely, it's a vicinal dihalide undergoing dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. Wait, but that doesn't directly explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, could it be a Hoffman elimination or something else? Or perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for cyclic ketones. Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit with the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone because of some kind of oxidation? But KOH is a base; I don't think it would oxidize. Wait, maybe it's a di-elimination to form an alkyne? No, because alkyne protons are usually around 1-2 ppm, not 4.79. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination, forming a diene. But the IR shows a carbonyl, which would mean a ketone or aldehyde. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a conjugate elimination, forming an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. But wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me think about the structure.

Adamantane is a diamond-like structure, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. In 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons. When KOH is added, perhaps each Br leaves, and the adjacent carbons each lose a Br and form a double bond. Wait, but that would require adjacent Brs, but 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: wait, maybe the positions are on adjacent bridges. Maybe the structure allows for the two Br atoms to be on adjacent bridgeheads. I think in adamantane, the bridgeheads are the positions where the rings are fused.

Wait, if the two Br atoms are on bridgehead carbons, perhaps their elimination would form a double bond between them. So the product would be a bicyclic diene with a carbonyl? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So 4.79 for 2H, maybe a singlet? Or perhaps a triplet, etc. Hmm. The 10H in the middle region (2.41-2.23) suggests some kind of bridge structure, perhaps.

Wait, another angle: the IR at 1720 cm−1 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. So maybe the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH is producing a ketone. How? Maybe a double elimination followed by some kind of cyclization or oxidation. Wait, but KOH isn't oxidizing. Alternatively, perhaps it's a base-induced elimination to form an alkene, but where does the carbonyl come from?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene and then an oxidation. But wait, without an oxidizing agent, that's unlikely. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination. Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but with two leaving groups. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a double SN2 substitution, but with KOH providing hydroxide ions. So each Br would be replaced by an -OH group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would become 1,3-diol. But then where's the carbonyl? Because the IR has a C=O.

Wait, so if product 1 is a diol, but the IR shows a C=O, that doesn't fit. So perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction. Let me think again.

An alternative approach: the IR has a C=O stretch at 1720, which is typical for a ketone. So product 1 must be a ketone. So how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone when treated with KOH?

Wait, perhaps it's a Hoffman elimination or a similar process, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and elimination occurs, forming an alkene and leaving a carbonyl group. Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones. Wait, unless it's a conjugated elimination where the loss of H and Br leads to a double bond and a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. But wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me imagine the structure. If the two Brs are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, maybe elimination would form a double bond between them, and the adjacent carbons might have a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a vicinal dihalide elimination to form an alkene, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a cyclic ketone. Let's think: when vicinal dihalide is treated with a base, sometimes a cyclic ketone can form via a process called the oxymercuration or some other elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: maybe the product is an epoxide, but the IR doesn't show an epoxide's C-O-C stretch around 1250 cm-1. It shows a carbonyl, so probably a ketone.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but that's for forming alkenes, not ketones.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a base-induced elimination forming a conjugated diene with a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are on carbons that are both adjacent to a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol ether, but that doesn't fit the IR's strong carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone where the carbonyl is between the two bridgeheads. So when the two Brs are eliminated, each H is abstracted, and a double bond is formed, but that would not directly give a ketone. Hmm.

Another idea: maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to a carbonyl group. Wait, wait, maybe each Br is removed, and each adjacent C loses a Br and a H, leading to a double bond and a carbonyl. Wait, but how?

Oh! Wait, maybe it's a conjugated diene with a carbonyl. Or perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl via some rearrangement. For example, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, and upon elimination, a double bond is formed, but with a carbonyl group elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone because of some kind of oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution. If each Br is replaced by an -OH, forming a diol. Then, perhaps, under certain conditions, the diol could form a ketone via some kind of elimination. But that doesn't fit with the first step conditions.

Wait, the first step is heating with excess KOH. So perhaps it's a double substitution, making a diol. But then, the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe a subsequent reaction is happening. Wait, no, product 1 is after the KOH step.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't a diol but something else. Maybe the diol is then dehydrated to form a ketone? But that would require acid conditions, not base.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a cyclic ether, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the next parts of the question to see if that gives me any clues.

Next, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Hmm, Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or something that could undergo Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, but product 1 is a solid, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, product 2 is formed. Then, product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78 C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups.

Wait, so product 2 must have a double bond for ozonolysis to act upon. So product 2 is an alkene. But product 1 had a carbonyl, so perhaps product 2 is an alkene adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, let's think again. Product 1 has a carbonyl (because of IR at 1720). Then product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene. For example, if product 1 is a ketone like cyclohexanone, but under certain conditions, it might not form an alkene. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and when treated with a Lewis acid, it undergoes some rearrangement or elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, but product 1's structure is unclear to me. Let's go back. Maybe I should consider that product 1 is an epoxide. Wait, but the initial reaction was with KOH, which would form an epoxide if it's a vicinal dihalide. Wait, but then the IR would show the epoxide's C-O-C stretch around 1250 cm-1, but the IR here shows a C=O at 1720. So maybe not an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's when a diester cyclizes to form a cyclic ketone. But in this case, the starting material is a dibromide, not a diester. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: maybe the dibromide undergoes a double elimination to form a conjugated diene and a carbonyl group. So perhaps the structure of product 1 is a diketone or a ketone with a double bond nearby.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol ether, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR data for product 1. The 4.79 ppm is a triplet for 2H. So maybe those are two equivalent protons adjacent to something. For example, adjacent to an electronegative atom or a carbonyl. So perhaps they are on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, like O=C-CH2-CH2-. Wait, but that would split the signals. Or maybe they're on a double bond, like CH2-CH2, but then why the high ppm?

Wait, if the protons are adjacent to a carbonyl, they would be deshielded. For example, in an acetal or an ether. Wait, but in a ketone, the adjacent protons would be around 2.1 ppm. So 4.79 is higher. Maybe it's an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product 1 is an enol. Enols have protons around 4-5 ppm, and they can show splitting based on adjacent groups. So maybe the 4.79 ppm is an enol proton. But then the IR would show a carbonyl, which it does. So product 1 could be an enol.

But how would enol form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH? I'm not too sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form an enol. But I'm not familiar with that mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ether with an adjacent carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's try to think about the steps:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (carbonyl present)
2. product 1 + Al isopropoxide → product 2 (alkene present)
3. product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3 (with deshielded H)

So, step 3 is ozonolysis of product 2, which must be an alkene. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond and form carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

In step 2, product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, which is often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. Alternatively, it can catalyze eliminations. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an alkene formed by an elimination reaction. For example, if product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent alcohol group, elimination (like dehydration) would form an alkene. But under what conditions does that happen? Acidic conditions, usually. But Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid and can provide the necessary conditions for such eliminations.

Wait, so perhaps product 1 is a ketone with adjacent -OH groups. So when heated with Al isopropoxide, which can help in the elimination of water, forming a double bond, hence product 2 is an alkene.

So, putting it together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (a diol or a ketone with an -OH group)
Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. Let me think. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's 1,3-diketone, but that would require two carbonyls. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mono-ketone.

Wait, but how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon treatment with KOH? Maybe each Br is replaced by an -OH, but how does that form a ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening reaction. Wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so maybe the elimination leads to a ring opening, forming a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 is a cyclic ketone where the two Brs have been eliminated, forming a carbonyl. Like, for example, if two adjacent Brs are removed, and the adjacent carbons form a double bond and a carbonyl group. But that's a bit vague.

Wait, perhaps it's better to accept that product 1 has a carbonyl and proceed.

So, product 1 has a carbonyl and some CH2 groups. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide, which likely forms an alkene by elimination (maybe dehydration of an alcohol adjacent to a carbonyl group, forming an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone).

So, product 2 would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. When ozone is bubbled through product 2, it cleaves the double bond. Ozonolysis of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone typically gives two carbonyl compounds. But the structure would dictate the exact products.

The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, not counting those that exchange with solvent.

What's the most deshielded proton? That would typically be near electronegative atoms or in an environment with high electron withdrawal. For example, protons adjacent to carbonyl groups are deshielded and appear downfield.

In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each carbonyl group is formed. So if product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, say (CH2)2C=CH-CO-R, the ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, more accurately, the ozonolysis of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (like cyclohexenone) would give a diketone. But in the case of a longer chain, it would give two carbonyls.

In the structure, the most deshielded protons would be on the carbonyl-adjacent carbons. Let's imagine product 2 has a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-R, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R, with a double bond in between. Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, like:

R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-R, but that's a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R, with the double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the structure of product 2 is such that ozonolysis will break the double bond into two carbonyls, each with their own adjacent protons.

For example, if product 2 is a diene, like CH2=CH-CO-R, then ozonolysis would break into two carbonyl groups. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a simple alkene, like R-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-R, but that's not near a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the ozonolysis of product 2 would generate two aldehyde or ketone groups. The most deshielded protons would be on the carbons adjacent to these carbonyls.

In the NMR of product 3, these protons would couple with their neighboring protons. Let's say each carbonyl has two adjacent CH2 groups. Each CH2 would couple with each other, leading to a splitting pattern.

For example, if each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, and each of those CH2 has two neighboring protons, the coupling would be a quartet, but wait, let's think.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 group is next to another CH2, so each CH2 would have two neighboring H's (from the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet. But if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group which is also adjacent to another CH2 with different coupling, it might lead to more complex splitting.

Wait, but in the case of ozonolysis, the structure after cleavage would have two ends, each with a carbonyl. So if product 2 was an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, say CH2=CH-CO-R, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls, giving two fragments, each ending with a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, and the protons adjacent to the carbonyls would each have two neighboring H's. So each of those protons would be a triplet due to coupling with two equivalent H's on the adjacent CH2.

Alternatively, if each CH2 group has two H's, and each H is adjacent to another CH2 with two H's, each would couple with two H's, leading to a triplet of triplets or a more complex splitting.

Wait, let's think of a specific structure. Suppose product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone: R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R, but that doesn't make sense because the double bond would be between the CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps it's R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R with a double bond, but that would require four bonds.

No, wait, alpha,beta-unsaturated would have the double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. So like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-R, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Another approach: when an alkene is ozonolyzed, it breaks into two carbonyl groups. The structure of product 2 must be an alkene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product with carbonyl groups.

Assuming product 2 is a simple di-substituted alkene, say CH2=CH-R, ozonolysis would break it into two formaldehyde groups if R is a methyl or similar. But in our case, product 2 is more complex.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a cyclohexene derivative with a ketone group. Ozonolysis would cleave the ring, forming a di-ketone. But I'm not exactly sure.

But regardless, the important point is to figure out the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in product 3.

Let's say that in product 3, the most deshielded protons are on carbonyl-adjacent CH2 groups. Each of these CH2 groups would have two H's. Now, each H is next to another CH2 group. So each H in the first CH2 would be adjacent to the H's in the next CH2.

Wait, but in a CH2-CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would be next to two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would couple with two H's, leading to a triplet. So each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but wait, if each CH2 has two H's, and each H is adjacent to the two H's on the neighboring CH2, then the splitting would be a triplet for each H. But wait, the coupling constants might be similar, leading to a triplet of triplets if there are multiple coupling partners.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled to two equivalent H's, the splitting would be a triplet. Because each H has two neighboring H's (like in -CH2-CH2-), each H would split into a triplet.

Wait, but in reality, each H in a CH2 group is split by the adjacent CH2 group's two H's. So for each H in the first CH2, it's coupled with two H's from the next CH2, leading to a triplet. So all four H's in the two CH2 groups would appear as triplets.

Wait, but what if the structure is more like -CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-? Then each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, each with two H's. So each H in the middle CH2 would be coupled with two H's from the adjacent CH2 on each side. So each H would be split into a triplet by each adjacent group. But since the coupling is to two different sets of H's, it would be a triplet of triplets or something more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is next to another CH2, which is next to another CH2, leading to each H being coupled to four H's. But that's unlikely because each H can only couple to adjacent H's.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is only adjacent to one other CH2 group. Like -CO-CH2-CH2- with each end attached to something else. So each H in the middle CH2 would be coupled to two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

But wait, the most deshielded H would likely be on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. So each of those H's would be a triplet.

Wait, but the question says the most deshielded hydrogen atom, excluding those that exchange. So perhaps it's a proton adjacent to a carbonyl.

If the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-O=, then the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would each have two H's. Each H in those CH2 groups would be adjacent to another CH2 group with two H's on each side. So each H would be coupled with two H's on each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but the splitting is due to coupling with neighboring H's. Let me think about a specific example. Suppose the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-O-. Then, each CH2 group has two H's. The CH2 groups in the middle would have H's that are adjacent to two H's on each side. So each H would be split by the two H's on the left and the two H's on the right. But wait, each H can't couple with four H's at the same time because they are not all adjacent. Only the adjacent H's on the neighboring CH2 would couple.

Wait, no, each H in a CH2 group is adjacent to the H's in the next CH2 group. So for example, take the CH2 group in the middle, each of its H's is next to two H's on each side. Wait, no, each H is only adjacent to the H's on the next carbon, which is the next CH2 group. So each H in the central CH2 would be next to two H's on the left and two on the right? No, because it's a chain.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine a three-carbon chain: O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO. The central CH2 is connected to CH2 on both sides. The H's on the central CH2 would be adjacent to two H's on each side. So each H on the central CH2 would couple with two H's from the left and two H's from the right.

Wait, but in reality, each H on the central CH2 is only adjacent to the H's on the adjacent CH2 groups. So each H on the central CH2 would have two neighboring H's (from the left CH2) and two from the right. But wait, no, each H is only adjacent to the H's on the same carbon and the immediate next carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the coupling between adjacent carbons. Each H in the central CH2 would be adjacent to two H's on the left CH2 and two on the right, but that's not possible because each H is only on a single CH2. Alternatively, perhaps each H is only coupled with the H's on the next CH2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each H in a CH2 group is coupled with the H's on the adjacent CH2 group. So, for example, each H in the leftmost CH2 (O=C-CH2-) is adjacent to the H's in the middle CH2. So each H in the left CH2 would couple with two H's from the middle CH2, leading to a triplet. Similarly, each H in the middle CH2 would couple with two from the left and two from the right, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me think of a simple case. If a CH2 group is between two other CH2 groups, each H in the middle CH2 would be adjacent to two H's on each side. So each H would have four neighboring H's, which would lead to a more complex splitting. But in reality, the coupling constants might average, or it could result in a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's in the middle CH2 are each coupled with two H's from one side and two from the other, but since the coupling constants are similar, it would result in a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's get back to the question. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to two other CH2 groups, each with two H's, then each H would have two coupling partners on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but wait, each H in the CH2 group would be next to two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would split into a triplet. But if the adjacent groups have different coupling constants, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two H's on one adjacent CH2 and two on another, but that's not possible unless the structure is a chain longer than three carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, so the middle CH2 is between two CH2 groups. Each H in the middle would be adjacent to two H's on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but let me think about how that would split. Each H in the middle would be split by the two H's on the left and the two on the right. So each H would have two coupling partners (from the left) and two from the right. But these couplings are separate, so the splitting would be a triplet for each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So each H would show as a triplet of triplets. But looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets.

Wait, but another possibility: if the H is in a CH2 group next to another CH2 group, which is next to a CH group, then the coupling could be more complex. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is in a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to two other CH2 groups on either side. Each H in that CH2 would be coupled with two H's on each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the CH2 group is at the end, adjacent to only one CH2, then each H would be a triplet.

But considering the ozonolysis product, it's more likely that the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, leading to each CH2 group having two H's adjacent to each other. So each H in the CH2 would be adjacent to two H's from the same CH2 and two from the adjacent CH2. Wait, no, because each H is on the same CH2, so the coupling would be between the two H's on the same group, leading to a singlet if they're equivalent, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the H's are in a chain: O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO. So each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. So the middle CH2's H's would be adjacent to two H's on each side. Each H would be split by two from the left and two from the right, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two adjacent H's (from one CH2) and another two from the next, but that's a bit unclear.

Considering all this, the most likely coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


The problem involves the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH, followed by subsequent transformations and analysis of the final product using NMR. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, likely undergoing a base-induced elimination to form a carbonyl-containing compound (product 1). The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group, confirming the presence of a ketone or similar structure.  
   - The NMR data (4.79 ppm for 2H, 2.41–2.23 ppm for 10H, and 1.94 ppm for 2H) suggests a structure with CH₂ groups adjacent to a carbonyl group.

2. **Reaction with Al isopropoxide**:  
   - Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This likely facilitates an elimination reaction, forming an α,β-unsaturated ketone (product 2). The double bond formed in product 2 is critical for the next step.

3. **Ozonolysis of product 2**:  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. The cleavage of the α,β-unsaturated ketone results in two carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group, making it highly deshielded and downfield-shifted in the NMR spectrum.

4. **Coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. This CH₂ group is also adjacent to another CH₂ group. Each hydrogen in the CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens in the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet of triplets due to the splitting from two distinct coupling constants.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.
