Hmm, okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about elastic scattering of electrons. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the phase shifts given are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The problem says to ignore the rest, so I guess higher-order phase shifts beyond δ₄ aren't considered here. The electrons have an energy of 50 MeV, but I'm not sure yet how that plays into this.

Wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f has both real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part is related to the total cross-section via the optical theorem. Oh right, the optical theorem says that the total cross-section σ is 4π/k² times the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (which is along the incident direction, so angle θ=0).

So the formula I'm recalling is: Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total. But wait, no, I think actually the optical theorem gives Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total. Alternatively, maybe it's Im(f(0,0)) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total. Hmm, I'm not super confident, but I'll go with that for now.

But wait, the problem doesn't directly give the total cross-section. Oh, right, but phase shifts are involved. The scattering amplitude f can be expressed in terms of the partial waves. For each angular momentum l, the contribution to f is something like f_l(k, k', θ), and when we sum over all l, we get the total f.

In particular, the forward direction (θ=0) simplifies things because the angular part (Legendre polynomials) can be evaluated at cosθ=1. So for each l, the amplitude is f_l = (2l+1) * ( (k'/(2k))^{l} ) * (exp(iδ_l) - 1 ) / (something). Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression.

Wait, I think the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is f(θ,φ) = Σ (2l+1)
