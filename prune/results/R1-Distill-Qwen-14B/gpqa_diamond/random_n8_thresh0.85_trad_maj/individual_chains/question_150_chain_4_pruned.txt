Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has a molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and the compound undergoes a series of reactions. I need to find out what the final product is from the given options.

First, let me understand the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let's break this down. The peak around 9.72 ppm is a triplet, which is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe this compound has an aldehyde group.

Looking at the other peaks, the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm regions are doublets each integrating to 2H. Those look like aromatic protons. The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad singlets in aromatic regions might suggest some kind of coupling or maybe some exchange, but I'm not sure yet. The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H, likely an OCH2 group because the molecule has an O in the formula.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees: probably one ring (from benzene) and some double bonds. Benzene is 3 degrees, then maybe one double bond and a ring or another double bond.

Looking at the NMR again, the triplet at 9.72 would be an aldehyde. So maybe the structure has a benzaldehyde part. Let's think about the 6.98 and 6.51 regions. Those are likely two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps from two benzene rings. If the two doublets are each 2H, perhaps the aromatic rings are para-substituted.

Wait, let's think of a structure. Maybe it's a diphenyl compound with a connecting chain. Let's say phenyl groups attached to a butyl chain. The aldehyde is at the end. But let me try to sketch this.

The 3.66 ppm doublet (OCH2) suggests that the two protons are adjacent to an oxygen. So maybe a CH2-O- group. If the aldehyde is at one end, perhaps the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CHO. But wait, that would have a CH2 group, but the NMR shows a doublet for that group. Alternatively, maybe it's Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, that would have more CH2 groups. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde connected via an ethylene group or something. Let me think: the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe in a conjugated system. Or maybe it's a coupling between two aromatic rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a conjugated diene system. Let me consider the possibility of a diene.

Another thought: the triplet at 9.72 ppm for the aldehyde. The splitting into a triplet suggests that the aldehyde proton is next to two protons. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and don't split much. Oh, wait the triplet could be due to coupling with adjacent protons. So, perhaps the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system.
