Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to understand what's going on. The question is about identifying a compound X based on an NMR analysis of the product formed after a specific reaction.

The problem states that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are provided, and we need to figure out what X is from the options given.

Wait, but what's the reaction here? 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh right, that's for acid-catalyzed ring openings. So perhaps compound X is an epoxide, and the reaction is some kind of ring-opening. But wait, the product's NMR is given, so maybe the reaction is the opening of the epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a different kind of reaction, but I think that's more likely.

Wait, but in the options, the possible compounds are all epoxides or related structures. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So, styryl is a vinyl benzene group. So the structure would be an epoxide (oxirane) connected to a styryl group at position 2 of the epoxide ring.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. That would be an epoxide where one substituent is a propenyl group attached to a phenyl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2Ph but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2=C(CH2Ph)- attached to the epoxide. Hmm, not sure.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the epoxide has a methyl group and a styryl group attached. So positions 2 and 3 on the epoxide have substituents.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. This is similar to option A, I think. Styrylepoxide implies the epoxide is connected via a styryl group. So perhaps the structure is an epoxide where one of the substituents is a styryl group attached to the second carbon of the epoxide.

Wait, but the reaction is of X with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Oh, wait a second. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, and when epoxides react with amines, it's typically an acid-catalyzed ring-opening. But wait, the solvent is nonpolar, and the reaction is at 403 K, which is a higher temperature. Hmm, but without knowing the exact conditions, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring opening, but maybe using this reagent as a base for an SN2 attack?

Wait, but if X is an epoxide, reacting with an amine might lead to ring-opening. The product would then have an am
