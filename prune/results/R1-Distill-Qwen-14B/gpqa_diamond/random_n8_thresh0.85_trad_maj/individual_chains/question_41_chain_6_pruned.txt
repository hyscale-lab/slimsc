Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and moving glass. Hmm. Let me try to think it through. Alright, the question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. And the options are given as A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about how velocities add up here, especially because we're dealing with light and moving media. So let's break it down. I remember that in physics, when you have objects moving relative to each other, you use velocity addition formulas. But wait, this is about light, so maybe it's more related to special relativity? Or maybe not, because the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. Hmm.

Wait, but the glass is moving. So the light is moving through a medium (glass) that's itself moving. Oh right, I think the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. Like in glass, the speed is lower than c. But in this case, the glass is moving.

Wait, how does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light in it? I remember that in classical mechanics, when a medium is moving, you might just add the velocities. But that can't be right because in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. But wait, the problem is about the speed of light in the glass. So perhaps the speed of the light within the glass is c divided by n, regardless of the glass's motion. Or is it?

Wait, no, that's for when the medium is at rest. Because when the medium is moving, the speed of light within it could change, depending on the reference frame. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe it's about how the observer in the lab sees the speed. So the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. Hmm.

Let me think about the situation. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards us, and the light is moving through it in the same direction as the glass's velocity.

Wait, but in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n because of the refractive index. So in the glass's frame, the light's speed is v_light = c/n in the direction of propagation.

Now, if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, then to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, I need to perform a Lorentz transformation because we're dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, but wait, v is probably much less than c, so maybe a classical approach is sufficient.

Wait, but if the glass is moving at velocity v, and within it, the light is moving at c/n, then from the lab frame, the speed would be v_light_lab = v_glass + (c/n) ?

Wait, no. Because in the glass's frame, the speed is c/n, so when you switch to the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, the lab would observe the light's speed as (c/n) + v? But that can't be right because if v is significant
