Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says that 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, this solution is titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, first, I think I should figure out what's happening at each of these points: 25% titration and equivalence point. Let me start by understanding the initial setup.

So, acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate them, they react to form acetate ions and water. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻ Na⁺ + H2O.

First, maybe I should find out the concentrations before titration. Oh wait, no, because the solution is diluted before titration. Let's see:

The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) and its concentration is 0.05 M. So, moles of acetic acid = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 * 0.020 = 0.001 moles.

Then, we add 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration of acetic acid is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Wait, wait, 0.001 divided by 0.04 is 0.025 M? Let me double-check that calculation. 0.001 divided by 0.04 is indeed 0.025. Yeah, that's correct.

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume needed to reach the equivalence point will determine other things, but first, let's find what happens at 25% titration.

Wait, 25% titration of what? I think in titration, the percentage refers to the solution being titrated. So, 25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Alternatively, it could be that 25% of the equivalence point volume has been reached. Hmm, I might need to clarify that.

Wait, the question probably refers to the point where 25% of the acetic acid has been titrated. So, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. So, 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. So the NaOH added would be 0.00025 mol, since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume used would be moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³. So, at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, maybe I should approach this using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Since at 25% titration, part of the acetic acid is converted to acetate. Let me think.

So, in the solution after dilution, we have 0.025 M acetic acid. Let me denote the initial concentration as C. When we add some NaOH, it will react with the acid:

CH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH3COO⁻ + H2O.
