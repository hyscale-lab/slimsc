Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me see if I can figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on stellar abundances, but I'll try to walk through it step by step.

So the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one. Alright, let's break down the information.

First, let's list out all the given data:

Star_1:
- Mass: 1.5 times the Sun's mass.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. I remember that [X/Y] means log10(n_X / n_Y) relative to the Sun. So this is the logarithm of the ratio of silicon to iron abundance compared to the Sun.

- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. [Fe/H] is the iron abundance relative to hydrogen. A value of 0 means the same as the Sun's, so Star_1 has solar iron abundance.

Star_2:
- Mass: 1.2 times the Sun's mass.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So magnesium to silicon ratio is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun's.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. So magnesium abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun's.

Sun's composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. Let me calculate that. Subtract 12 from both sides: log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. But wait, what's the actual number? Let me think. 10^-4 is 1e-4, 10^-5 is 1e-5. So 10^-4.5 is about 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5. So nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The formula is 12 + log10(n_X/n_H) equals the given number. So for Fe, it's 7.5, so log(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5. So nFe/nH =10^(-4.5) ≈3.16e-5. For Mg, log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So now, we need to find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. So [n_Si_1 / n_Si_2].

Hmm, how do I approach this? Let me think about each star separately.

Starting with Star_1.

Star_1 has [Fe/H] = 0, so nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun. Since [Fe/H] is 0, same as the Sun.

Also, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So log(n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) = 0.3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the [X/Y] notation is log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So, [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) - log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) = 0.3.

But for Star_1, since [Fe/H] is 0, n_Fe_1 /n_H_1 = same as Sun's. So n_Fe_1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1 /n_H_sun).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to express the ratios in terms of the solar values.

Alternatively, let's model the abundances.

For Star_1:
n
