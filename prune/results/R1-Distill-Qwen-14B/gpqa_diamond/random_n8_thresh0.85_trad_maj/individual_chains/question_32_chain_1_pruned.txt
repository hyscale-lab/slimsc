Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), and I'm supposed to find the energy when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. 

First, I need to figure out which nucleus we're dealing with. The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So X is Li-6. Got it.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their relativistic mass increases, which affects their energy. So the energy here is the total relativistic energy of the nucleus.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, m0 is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. But wait, the question is giving me the speed as 0.96c, so I can calculate gamma based on that.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let me plug in v = 0.96c. So v² is (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². Then v²/c² is 0.9216, so 1 - that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Hmm, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.0784's square root is indeed 0.28, so 1/0.28 = 10/2.8 ≈ 3.5714. So gamma is approximately 3.5714286.

Next, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 1.007276 GeV/c² for a proton and 1.008665 GeV/c² for a neutron. Wait, but wait, I think the average mass of a nucleon is about 1.0074 for protons and 1.0087 for neutrons. But for a nucleus, perhaps the average is roughly 1.0073 GeV/c² each? Or maybe I should calculate it more precisely.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total rest mass should be the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Protons: 3 * 1.007276 ≈ 3.021828 GeV/c².

Neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 ≈ 3.025995 GeV/c².

Adding them together: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 GeV/c².

So m0 is approximately 6.0478 GeV/c².

Now, the energy E is gamma multiplied by m0 c². But wait, since I'm using units where c is factored in, I think I can just multiply gamma by m0 in GeV. Because when I have E = gamma m0 c², and m0 is in GeV/c², c² would be (GeV c²)/(GeV c^2) ? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, mass is in GeV/c². So when I multiply by c², the units become GeV. So yes, E = gamma * m0 * c², but since m0 is in GeV/c², the c² cancels that, so E is in GeV.

So E = gamma * m0.

Gamma is approximately 3.5714286, and m0 is 6.0478 GeV/c². So E = 3.5714286 * 6.0478 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 3.5714286 * 6 is 21.4285716. Then 3.5714286 * 0.0478 is about 0.1709.

Adding them together: 21.4285716 + 0.1709 ≈ 21.5995 GeV. Wait, that's about 21.6 GeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 21.419, which is close but not exactly 21.6. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should calculate gamma more precisely. Let me recalculate gamma.

v = 0.96c. So beta = v/c = 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So that's precise.

Now, m0 was 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Let me get precise mass numbers.

Proton mass: 1.007276 GeV/c².

Neutron mass: 1.008665 GeV/c².

3 protons: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 GeV/c².

3 neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 GeV/c².

Total m0: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 GeV/c².

So E = 3.57142857 * 6.047823.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *6.047823.

I can do this step by step.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *6 = 21.4285714.

Then 3.57142857 *0.047823.

Compute 0.047823 *3.57142857.

0.047823 * 3 = 0.143469.

0.047823 *0.57142857 ≈ 0.047823 * (4/7) ≈ 0.047823 *0.5714 ≈ approx 0.0273.

So total is approx 0.143469 +0.0273 ≈ 0.170769.

So E =21.4285714 + 0.170769 ≈ 21.59934 GeV, approximately 21.6 GeV.

Wait, but the options don't have 21.6. Let me look again.

Options:
A) 18.475 GeV
B)23.069 GeV
C)20.132 GeV
D)21.419 GeV

Hmm, none of the options are 21.6. I must have made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating m0. Let me recalculate the masses.

Li-6: 3 protons, 3 neutrons.

Proton mass: 1.007276 GeV/c² each.

3 protons: 3 *1.007276 = 3.021828 GeV/c².

Neutrons: each neutron is 1.008665 GeV/c². 3 *1.008665 = 3.025995 GeV/c².

Total m0 = 3.021828 +3.025995 = 6.047823 GeV/c². That seems correct.

Gamma is 3.5714286.

So 6.047823 *3.5714286 = ?

Let me compute it more accurately.

I'll do 6.047823 *3.5714286.

Let me break it down:

6.047823 *3 = 18.143469

6.047823 *0.5714286.

Wait, 0.5714286 is approximately 4/7, since 1/7 is about 0.142857, so 4/7 ≈ 0.5714286.

So 6.047823 *0.5714286 = ?

Let me compute 6 *0.5714286 = 3.4285716.

0.047823 *0.5714286 ≈ 0.047823 *0.5 = 0.0239115, plus 0.047823 *0.0714286 ≈ 0.003417. So total ≈ 0.0273285.

So 3.4285716 + 0.0273285 ≈ 3.455899.

So 6.047823 *3.5714286 = 18.143469 + 3.455899 = 21.599368 GeV.

So approximately 21.599 GeV, which rounds to about 21.60 GeV.

But the options don't have that. Let's see the options again. Option D is 21.419. Hmm, that's about 0.18 GeV less than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the rest mass of the nucleus. Because when you have a nucleus, the mass is actually less than the sum of individual protons and neutrons due to binding energy. Oh wait, but in this case, since we're using the rest mass for relativistic purposes, do I need to account for the mass defect (binding energy) or not?

Wait, no. The relativistic energy calculation uses the rest mass of the object. The rest mass in this case is the actual rest mass of the nucleus, which includes the binding energy. So perhaps the correct approach is to find the actual rest mass of Li-6, not just add up the individual nucleon masses.

Wait a minute, I think that's where I went wrong. Because when you just sum the protons and neutrons, you're ignoring the mass defect (the binding energy). But for the nucleus's rest mass, we should use the actual measured value, not the sum of individual nucleon masses.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The sum of individual nucleon masses is the 'rest mass' if the nucleus were just a collection of free nucleons. But in reality, the nucleus has a binding energy which is (mass defect) converted into energy via E=mc². So the actual rest mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of individual nucleons. Therefore, when calculating E = gamma * m0 * c², m0 is the actual rest mass of the nucleus, which includes the binding energy.

So I shouldn't use the sum of the nucleon masses but the actual mass of Li-6.

Hmm. So I need to find the actual rest mass of Li-6. Let me look up the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, since I don't have access to external resources, I'll have to remember from standard data. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01753 GeV/c². Wait, no, atomic mass is usually given in atomic mass units (u), and 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c², which is 0.9315 GeV/c².

So Li-6 has a mass of about 6.01753 u.

So converting that
