Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem states that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows an ester group, which means thereâ€™s an OCOOR group somewhere. The 1H NMR has six signals: two for aromatic Hs, two for vinyl Hs (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two for CH3 groups. There are no CH2 signals.

Hmm, so I need to determine the molecular formula from the options: A) C11H14O2, B) C12H14O2, C) C12H12O2, D) C11H12O2.

First, let's think about the aromatic ring. It's a benzene ring with two substituents. The ring is substituted, so the structure could be something like an ester attached to the benzene in a way that affects the aromatic protons.

The NMR tells me about the substituents. Let's break down what each part of the spectrum indicates.

1. **Aromatic protons (two signals):** 
   In a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents can be in different positions. Depending on that, the number of unique aromatic protons can vary. For example, if the substituents are para, there are two sets of protons: two Hs each. But wait, in that case, the splitting would be more than one signal? Or maybe if the substituents are in certain positions, like para, but each has their own effect. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in a para position, but each substituent brings a different environment. Wait, maybe it's a case where the substituents are in positions that cause the ring to have two sets of equivalent protons. For instance, if it's para, the protons are equivalent, but if it's ortho, the coupling can lead to more signals. Hmm, but the question says two signals for aromatic Hs. So perhaps each substituent is ortho, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a strong de-shielder, causing different splitting.

Wait, another thought: the substituents could be such that the ring is split into two different environments. Let me think of an example: maybe a para-substituted ester with another group, but that's a di-substitution. Wait, no, because the compound is di-substituted, so two groups attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but another approach: the aromatic signals in NMR. If the substituents are in the para position, the protons may be equivalent, but if it's in the meta, perhaps two different sets. Or perhaps one substituent is strong enough to cause two different coupling patterns. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that the ring has two sets of equivalent protons.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester group and the other is something else, but in such a way that the ring has two distinct sets of aromatic protons. For example, if one substituent is an ester (-OOCR) and another is a methyl group, then the ring could have two different sets of adjacent protons.

Wait, but the NMR only shows two signals for aromatic Hs, so that suggests that there are two types of aromatic protons. So perhaps the substituents are in such a way that each substituent affects two protons, making them different. For example, if the substituents are adjacent (ortho) to each other, the ring would have two types of protons: the ones adjacent to each substituent and the ones across. Or maybe it's a case where the substituents are meta, leading to two different environments. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a strong de-shielder, causing the ring protons to split into two groups.

But I might be getting stuck here. Let me think about the other parts of the NMR. 

2. **Vinyl protons (two signals):**
   The NMR shows two signals for vinyl Hs: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets.
