Okay, so I have this physics problem about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the scattering amplitude in quantum mechanics is related to the phase shifts. The problem gives me some phase shifts and asks about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, the phase shifts are δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, and so on. The given values are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh, and I'm supposed to ignore the rest, so I guess only these five contribute.

The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction. I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using the partial waves. The formula I remember is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ [ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ) ] for each l.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. That means θ=0°, right? Because the incident beam is along the initial direction, which I'm assuming is the 0° direction.

So, when θ=0°, the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ) becomes P_l(1). I recall that P_l(1) is 1 for all l because P_l(1) equals 1. So each term in the sum becomes (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l * 1.

But wait, the amplitude f(θ) is given by f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ... Oh, maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula. Let me think again. Oh right! The general expression is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) ]

But maybe I should think in terms of the partial wave expansion. Alternatively, another formula I remember is that the scattering amplitude can be written as f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ) ].

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the partial wave expansion in terms of the real and imaginary parts. The amplitude f(θ) can be separated into real and imaginary components. The imaginary part would come from the sine terms, I think.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: The amplitude f is a complex function, so f = f_real + i f_imaginary. The phase shifts δ_l contribute to both parts.

But another approach: I remember that the total scattering amplitude's imaginary part at θ=0 is given by the sum involving the phase shifts. Because at θ=0, the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) = 1, so each term is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

So, the imaginary part of f(θ=0) would be (1/(2k)) * sum over l of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l), because e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l = [cos δ_l + i sin δ_l] * sin δ_l = sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l. So the imaginary part of each term would be (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, no. Wait, e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l = sin δ_l (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) = sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l.

So the imaginary part of each (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l term is (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So the imaginary part of f(θ=0) is [sum over l (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k).

But wait, I've read somewhere that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is (1/(2k)) multiplied by the sum over l of (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l), but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) / (2k) multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps I should refer back to the standard expression for the scattering amplitude. The scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) ]

Because the optical theorem says that the imaginary part of f at θ=0 is related to the total cross-section, but maybe that's complicating things.

Wait, but I'm only interested in the imaginary part of f at θ=0. So let's plug θ=0 into f(θ). Then P_l(1) = 1 for all l. So,

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) ]

So f(0) is a sum over l of terms (2l+1)(e^{2i δ_l} -1)/(2ik).

To find the imaginary part of f(0), let's compute Im(f(0)).

Each term is (2l+1)(e^{2i δ_l} -1)/(2ik). Let's compute the numerator:

e^{2i δ_l} -1 = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) -1.

So (e^{2i δ_l} -1) = [cos(2δ_l) -1] + i sin(2δ_l).

Now multiply by 1/(2ik):

Each term becomes (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ_l)-1) + i sin(2δ_l) ] / (2ik).

Breaking this into real and imaginary parts:

The denominator is 2ik, so 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k) because 1/i = -i.

So each term is (2l+1)/ (2ik) [ (cos(2δ_l)-1) + i sin(2δ_l) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ] * (-i) / (2k)

= (2l+1) [ -i (cos(2δ_l) -1) + sin(2δ_l) ] / (2k )

Now, let's separate into real and imaginary parts:

The real part comes from the term with sin(2δ_l), because -i (cos...) is imaginary, and sin(...) is multiplied by 1.

So, for each term, the real part is (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) / (2k), and the imaginary part is -(2l+1) (cos(2 δ_l) -1) / (2k).

Wait, but the overall term is (2l+1) [ (cos(...) + i sin(...)) ] * (-i)/(2k). So let's compute:

Real part: (2l+1) * [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) * (i*(-i)) ) + sin(2δ_l) * (-i) ) ] / (2k)

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the imaginary part of each term in the sum.

Because f(0) is sum of terms, each of which is (2l+1)(e^{2i δ_l} -1)/(2ik).

Each such term contributes to the imaginary part of f(0) as the imaginary part of that term.

So for each term, Im[ (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1)/(2ik) ]

Let me compute this for each l.

Let me take a single term: (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1) / (2ik)

Let me write e^{2iδ_l} = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l)

So e^{2iδ_l} -1 = [cos(2δ_l) -1] + i sin(2δ_l)

Now, the term becomes (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ_l)-1) + i sin(2δ_l) ] / (2ik)

So the imaginary part of this term is (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k) because:

The denominator is 2ik, which is 2i k.

But when you divide by 2ik, you can write it as 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k) because 1/i = -i.

So the term becomes (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ_l)-1) + i sin(2δ_l) ] * (-i) / (2k)

Multiplying out:

= (2l+1) [ -i (cos(2δ_l) -1) - i^2 sin(2δ_l) ] / (2k)

= (2l+1) [ -i (cos(2δ_l) -1) + sin(2δ_l) ] / (2k)

So the imaginary part of each term is the coefficient of i, multiplied by i, but when we take the imaginary part of the entire term, it's the coefficient of i.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The term is [A + i B], where A is real (from the real parts) and B is real (the imaginary part).

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute the imaginary part as:

The entire term is (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ) -1) + i sin(2δ) ]
