Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is like how nearby stars shift their position in the sky relative to more distant ones as Earth orbits the Sun. The formula for distance using parallax is something like distance = 1 / parallax, but I think in parsecs. So parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So a star with a parallax of 1 pc is 1 parsec away, right? Wait, no, wait. Oh right, parallax p (in arcseconds) = 1 / d (in parsecs). So if d is large, p is small.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. But wait, what does that mean? Uniformly distributed usually implies that the number density is constant in space. So, the number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere. But here, we're talking about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax depends on parallax.

Wait, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) would be a function of plx. Let me think about this. Parallax is a measure of distance; lower parallax means farther away. So, as plx increases, the distance decreases.

Wait, but how does the number of stars per unit parallax interval depend on plx? Let's
