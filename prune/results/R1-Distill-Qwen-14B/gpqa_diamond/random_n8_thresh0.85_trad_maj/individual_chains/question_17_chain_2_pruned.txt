Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, which I think means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and in its active form, Y^4-. The temperature is 25°C, which I guess is room temperature, so not too far from standard conditions. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. 

Wait, what's the question again? Oh right, the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So I'm assuming that the Ca-EDTA complex is dissociating into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions in solution. But how?

I remember that for a complex ion like Ca-EDTA, the dissociation can be represented as CaY^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4-. The stability constant K is given by [Ca²+][Y^4-]/[CaY^2-]. Oh wait, but since the solution is at stoichiometric amounts, I think the concentration of CaY^2- is 0.02 M. But wait, the problem states that the solution is containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex itself is 0.02 M.

So let me write the equation again. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4-:

CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²+ + Y⁴⁻ 

The stability constant K is given as 5x10^10. The expression for K is [Ca²+][Y⁴⁻] / [CaY²⁻] = K.

In a stoichiometric solution, the concentration of the complex [CaY²⁻] is 0.02 M. But wait, wait. When the complex dissociates, each mole of CaY²⁻ produces one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of Y⁴⁻. So if the complex is 0.02 M, then if it dissociates completely, [Ca²+] would be 0.02 M and [Y⁴⁻] would be 0.02 M. But since K is very large, the dissociation is minimal. Wait, no, wait. No, K is the stability constant, which is a large number indicating that the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of the dissociated ions Ca²+ and Y⁴⁻ would be very low.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The stability constant K is large, meaning that the reaction favors the formation of the complex. So the reverse reaction (dissociation) is not favored. So the concentration of Ca²+ and Y⁴⁻ should be very low.

Wait, but in this case, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ and Y⁴⁻ that dissociate from the complex.

So, the initial concentration of CaY²⁻ is 0.02 M. When it dissociates, each mole produces one mole of Ca²+ and Y⁴⁻. So the equilibrium concentrations are:

[CaY²⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is small)
[Ca²+] = x
[Y⁴⁻] = x

So substituting into the K expression:

K = (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02 = 5e10.

Wait, that seems right? So solving for x:

x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9 → x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4? Wait, that can't be right because 3.16e4 is way larger than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. That would mean that the complex is dissociating almost completely, which contradicts the high K value, which suggests it's very stable.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because if K is very large (5e10), that means that the concentration of the complex [CaY²⁻] is very small compared to the product of [Ca²+][Y⁴⁻]. Wait no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait no, the stability constant is K = [Ca²+][Y⁴⁻]/[CaY²⁻]. A large K means that the numerator is much larger than the denominator. So [Ca²+][Y⁴⁻] is much larger than [CaY²⁻]. Wait, but that can't be because if the complex is stable, it shouldn't dissociate much. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the complex is CaY^2−, and the K is the formation constant. So the K is for the formation of the complex from Ca²+ and Y⁴−.

Wait, the formation constant Kf is given by [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y⁴−]) ) = 5e10. Oh wait, no, isn't K the formation constant, so Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y⁴−]) ) = 5e10. So that's the same as K as given in the problem.

Wait, so Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y⁴−]) ) = 5e10.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given as K_Ca-EDTA =5e10. So I think I need to correct the setup. So K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y⁴−])
