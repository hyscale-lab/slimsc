Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I need to find the energy.

Let me think, first, I should figure out what the nucleus is. Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the total number of nucleons is protons plus neutrons. Wait, lithium usually has 3 protons. So 3 protons + 3 neutrons makes it lithium-6, I think. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

Next, I need to find the energy required for this ion to reach a speed of 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic. But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider, which would be the kinetic energy imparted to the nucleus. Or is it the total energy? Hmm, sometimes in these problems, the energy refers to the kinetic. Wait, wait. Collider experiments often deal with total energy, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the formulas.

The energy of a particle is given by gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. Since the speed is given as 0.96c, I can calculate gamma first.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Plugging in v = 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². Let's compute that.

0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me verify: 1 / 0.28 is the same as 100/28, which is 25/7, which is approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has an average mass of about 1 atomic mass unit (u). Let me find the mass of Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.016 u. Because the atomic weight is about 6.941 for Li, but Li-6 is one of its isotopes. Wait, but wait—atomic mass is usually given for atoms, which include electrons. But since we're talking about the nucleus, I need to subtract the electrons. Wait, no, wait. I think the mass of the nucleus is approximately the atomic mass in u, because the electrons' mass is negligible compared to the nucleus for heavy ions. Or maybe not? Wait, for a nucleus, the mass is approximately the sum of the pro
