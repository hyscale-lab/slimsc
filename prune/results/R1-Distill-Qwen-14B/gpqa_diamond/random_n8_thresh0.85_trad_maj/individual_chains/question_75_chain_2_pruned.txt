Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. So, the question is about a genetics experiment where someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model for overexpressing the GADD45G protein. They've introduced a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus, which is a common way to tag proteins for purification. But when they try to express it, they can't get the protein to overexpress as expected.

Looking at the construct's sequence they provided, I need to spot what's wrong. Let me think about the steps they took. They used Lipofectamine to transfect Chinese hamster ovary cells. Then they selected antibiotic-resistant colonies and tested the expression. The problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So, what could be causing this?

The options are A-D. Let's go through each one.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. I'm not sure about that. A missense mutation would change an amino acid, but the construct is supposed to have the HA tag. Looking at the sequence, the first part is ATG, which is the start codon. Then the next few codons would be the HA tag. If there's a mutation in HA, maybe the tag isn't right, but does that prevent expression? Maybe not directly, unless the mutation causes a frame shift, but I don't see that here. The sequence after the initial ATG seems continuous.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. Let's look for stop codons in the sequence. The sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. Wait, the end of the provided plus strand sequence is ...GCGGCCGGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, let me parse that. The sequence ends with TGA at the very end. So the last part is ...CCCCGAGTGA. So TGA is a stop codon. So the reading frame ends with TGA, meaning the protein would terminate there. But wait, the start is ATG, so the sequence is from ATG to TGA. So the protein would be correctly sized if it ends at TGA. So why isn't it expressed? Maybe the construct is correct but something else is wrong.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the stop codon is not properly placed. Let me think about the coding sequence. The HA tag is added to the N-terminus, then followed by GADD45G. If the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon, that would cause truncation. But the HA tag is probably a short peptide, like YPYDVPDYD. So if the HA sequence introduces a stop codon, that would be a problem. But the provided DNA sequence starts with ATG, then the HA coding. Let me check the initial part.

The sequence starts with 5' ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GCT TCC GGA AAG CAA GCG CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGG CTG GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAA TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTG CGA GA... Hmm, wait, the first 20 or so codons would be the HA tag. Let's translate the first part.

ATG is Methionine. TAC is Tyr. CCC is Pro. ATA is Ile. CGA is Arg. TGT is Cys. TCC is Ser. AGA is Arg. TTA is Leu. CGC is Arg. CAA is Gln. ATG is Met again. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I'm missing something. If the HA tag is introduced, perhaps the sequence starts with the HA coding. But the first few codons after ATG are TAC (Tyr), which is part of HA. So perhaps the HA tag is correctly added. But then why is the expression not working?

Wait, looking again at the end of the DNA sequence. The last few codons before the TGA are CGG CGA G... Let me count. The last part is ...CGGCGGCCGGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the last few codons before TGA are ...GCGAGTGA. Let me break that into triplets. Let's see, ...GCG AGT GA. Oh, wait, wait. The triplet before TGA is CGA. So the last triplet is TGA, a stop codon. So the DNA ends with TGA, which is a stop. So the mRNA would have UAG as the stop codon.

Wait, but when the mRNA is produced, it's the complementary sequence. So the DNA is plus strand 5' to 3', the mRNA is complementary, so the mRNA would have the same sequence as the DNA, but T becomes U. So the mRNA would have ...AUG (start) and end with UAG (stop). Wait, no. The DNA is plus strand, so the mRNA is complementary to the template (negative) strand, so mRNA is same as plus strand except Tâ†’U. So the mRNA would end with ...AUG (start) and end with UAG as the stop?

Wait, no, the stop codon in mRNA is UAG, which is the same as the DNA's TGA on the plus strand. So the coding sequence starts with ATG and ends with TGA. So the protein would be correctly processed, right?

But why isn't the protein being expressed? The construct is in a plasmid, and when transfected into cells, it should be expressed. But in this case, the expression level is low. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the stop codon is causing the ribosome to terminate prematurely, but why? Because the stop codon is at the end, which is correct.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the coding sequence doesn't have a proper poly-A signal, but that's usually part of the construct, not the coding sequence. But in this case, the problem is in the coding sequence.

Wait, another possibility is the presence of a premature stop codon. Let's see if any stop codons appear before the end. Let me scan the DNA sequence for TGA, TAG, or TAA. The sequence ends with TGA, but are there any others before that?

Looking through the sequence: I see a part that's CGA GGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GCT TCC GGA AAG CAA GCG CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGG CTG GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAA TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTG CGAGA... Hmm. Let's look for triplet matches.

Another part: AGATTACGCG. Wait, ATG is start, then TAC (tyr), then CCG, etc. Let me look for TGA in the middle.

Looking again: The sequence ends with ...CGAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA. But in the middle, is there another TGA or TAG or TAA?

Looking through:

- The first part after ATG: TAC, CCC, ATA, CGA, TGT, TCC, AGA, TTA, CGC, CAA, ATG... Wait, ATG is Met again. So that would insert another start codon in the middle of the HA tag. Oh! That's a problem. So the coding sequence has an ATG in the middle, which is another start codon.

Wait, the HA tag is probably a short peptide, say 10 amino acids. If their construct inserted an ATG in the middle, that would create a new start codon, leading to a shorter protein because the ribosome would start at the first ATG, then when it hits the second ATG, it might reset? Or perhaps the second ATG is within the reading frame, causing the protein to be longer, but including extra amino acids. Alternatively, the second ATG could be in a different frame, but that's unlikely since it's the same frame.

Wait, looking at the DNA sequence: the initial part after ATG is TAC (Tyr), then CCC (Pro), ATA (Ile), CGA (Arg), TGT (Cys), TCC (Ser), AGA (Arg), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), CAA (Gln), ATG (Met). So that's the 11th codon. So the HA tag would be the first 10 amino acids (if
