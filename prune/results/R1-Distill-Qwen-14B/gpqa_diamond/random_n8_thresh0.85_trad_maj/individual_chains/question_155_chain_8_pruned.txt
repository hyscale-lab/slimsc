Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. 

Wait, the setup: there are these operators P_x, P_y, P_z. Each has a matrix form given in a 3x3 matrix. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, right? So the state of the system is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And this state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ.

I remember that the uncertainty in an operator, like ΔP_z, is calculated using the formula sqrt(⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for the given state.

First, let me write down the state vector. It's a column vector: [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. Let me note that each component is ψ_1, ψ_2, ψ_3. So ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Wait, but I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. The operator P_z is given as a matrix whose first row is [ħ, 0, 0], second row [0,0,0], third row [0,0,-ħ]. Let me write that matrix explicitly.

P_z matrix:
[ [ ħ, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, -ħ ] ]

So when I apply P_z to the state vector, it's diagonal, so it's just multiplying each component by the corresponding diagonal element.

Now, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is ψ† P_z ψ. So let's compute that.

Breaking it down: each component of ψ is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z and then summed.

So, ψ_1 * (ħ) * ψ_1^* + ψ_2 * (0) * ψ_2^* + ψ_3 * (-ħ) * ψ_3^*.

Wait, but since all
