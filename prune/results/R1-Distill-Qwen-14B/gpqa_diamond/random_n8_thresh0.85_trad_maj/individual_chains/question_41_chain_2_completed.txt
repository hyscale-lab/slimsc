Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when a medium is moving, things get a bit tricky with how light behaves. The problem states that a glass with an index of refraction n is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. The observer is in the laboratory frame.

Wait, so the glass is moving. The light beam is going through this glass. I'm being asked about the speed of light relative to the observer. Oh, right, the speed of light in a vacuum is c, which is 1 here. But since it's inside the glass, its speed would normally be c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is the ratio of c to the speed in the medium. So without movement, the speed would be 1/n.

But now the glass is moving. So I think this is a case where I need to consider how velocities add up in different frames. Like, maybe using the velocity addition formula from special relativity? Wait, but wait, this is a problem involving both the medium's motion and light's speed. Oh, but wait, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, that's only in a vacuum, right? What about in a medium?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Special relativity tells us that the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But when a medium is involved, like glass, the speed can be different. But the medium itself is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed of light?

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the medium (glass) is non-relativistic, so we can use the Galilean transformation for velocities. Because if v is small compared to c, then Galilean might be an approximation. But wait, the options provided don't look like they come directly from Galilean addition. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says to take c=1. So maybe it's using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let's recall the formula. If you have a frame S' moving at velocity u relative to S, then the velocity of an object in S is given by (v' + u)/(1 + (v' u)/c²). 

Wait, but in this case, the medium is moving, so the light's speed in the medium is v_light = c/n = 1/n. But how does the medium's motion affect the observed speed?

Wait, perhaps I should think about it from the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. The light's speed inside the glass is 1/n. But how does that combine?

Wait, in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at 1/n. But the glass is moving at v relative to the lab. So in the lab frame, the speed of the light would be (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n) * v / c²). But since c=1, this becomes (1/n + v) / (1 + (v)/(n)). 

Wait, let me compute that. Let me write it down:

Let u be the speed of light in the glass's frame, which is u = 1/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So the observed speed in the lab frame, using the relativistic velocity addition, would be:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

Since c=1, it's (u + v)/(1 + u v).

Substituting u = 1/n, it becomes:

( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )

Hmm, let's factor that. Let's factor the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1 + n v) / n

Denominator: (n + v) / n

So the entire expression is ( (1 + n v)/n ) / ( (n + v)/n ) ) = (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, so the speed observed is (1 +n v)/(n + v). Let me look at the options.

Option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v). That's the same as what I got. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: The speed of light in a medium moving relative to the observer. Does the refractive index change due to motion? Oh, wait, in relativity, the refractive index can change when the medium is moving, but I think the problem assumes that the index remains n. Because the problem says "the glass with index of refraction n", so perhaps the medium's motion doesn't affect n in this question. So I think my initial approach is correct.

So the correct answer is option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the refractive index of the glass is \( n \). The speed of light in the glass, as measured in the glass's rest frame, is \( \frac{1}{n} \) (since \( c = 1 \)).

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

where \( u \) is the speed of light in the glass's frame (\( u = \frac{1}{n} \)) and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory. Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), the observed speed of light in the laboratory frame becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \)**.

Answer: A
