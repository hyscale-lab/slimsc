Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. And the K for the Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The formula for the complex is probably CaY^2- or something like that. So the reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. Right, or maybe the other way around. But in this case, the complex is already present, so the dissociation is what we're looking at.

The K for the complex is given as KCa-EDTA = 5e10. That's a really large K, which suggests that the complex is very stable. So the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and EDTA should be minimal because K is large; products are favored, but since the complex is already formed, maybe the reverse is happening? Wait, no, K is the formation constant, Kf. So Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So a high K means the complex doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low.

So the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaY^2-] as 0.02 M. Now, the dissociation would be:

CaY^2- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-

The formation constant Kf is given, so Kf = [Ca²+][Y^4-]/[CaY^2-]

Wait, but wait: in this case, the solution is just the complex, so I can model the dissociation. Let me think. Suppose the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. Then, the concentration of EDTA would also be x, because for each mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of each product is formed.

So [Ca²+] = x, [Y^4-] = x, and [CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so large (5e10), the dissociation x should be very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So Kf = (x)(x)/0.02 = x² / 0.02 = 5e10.

So solving for x: x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9.

Wait, 5e10 multiplied by 0.02 is 1e9? Let me check: 5e10 * 0.02 = 5e10 * 2e-2 = 1e9. Yes. So x squared is 1e9, so x is sqrt(1e9) = 31622.7766… approximately 3.16e4. Wait, wait, no, sqrt(1e9) is 3.16e4? Wait, 3
