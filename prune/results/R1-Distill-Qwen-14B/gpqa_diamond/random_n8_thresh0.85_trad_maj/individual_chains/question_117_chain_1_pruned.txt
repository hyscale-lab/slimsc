Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism, and I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me think it through. The question is asking which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism. The options are four compounds, and I need to figure out which ones have the possibility of having stereoisomers, specifically enantiomers or diastereomers, that are non-superimposable mirror images.

First, I should remember what optical isomerism is. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Such compounds can have enantiomers, which are mirror images, leading to different rotations of plane-polarized light.

Alternatively, another type of stereoisomerism is geometric isomerism, which arises from restricted rotation around a bond, such as in alkenes with substituents on either side. These are also called cis-trans or E/Z isomers, but I'm not sure if that's considered optical isomerism. Wait, optical isomerism typically refers to compounds that rotate plane-polarized light, which is due to chirality. So geometric isomers might not necessarily exhibit optical activity, but they are a form of stereoisomerism. Hmm, but the question specifically says "optical isomerism," which is about chirality leading to enantiomers. So I'll focus on that.

Now, let's go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
Wait, what's that structure
