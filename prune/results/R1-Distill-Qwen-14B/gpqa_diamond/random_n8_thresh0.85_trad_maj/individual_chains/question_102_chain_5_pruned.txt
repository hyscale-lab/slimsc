Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'm going to take it slowly.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The person is trying to study their interaction's developmental fate. So, they've probably created some kind of transgenic construct to track their expression or interaction.

The setup involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions, right? So, the vector has two ORFs (ligand and receptor), each with their own tags. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus.

Looking at the promoters and regulatory elements: the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is after an IRES element. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so it's for separate translation, meaning the two proteins can be expressed independently. So, the ligand and receptor are co-expressed but separately.

The stops between the ligand and mCherry are in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, the receptor and eGFP have a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I think loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. The stop cassettes prevent expression unless Cre is present to excise them.

So when Cre is introduced, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the fusion proteins to be expressed. If Cre isn't there, the ligand would be expressed as the ORF plus mCherry, but maybe not translated because the stop is in the way. Same for the receptor-eGFP.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them on Western blot. So they were checking whether the proteins are being expressed when the construct is transfected into primary astrocytes. The blot uses actin as a loading control, which is fine.

Then they made a mouse model that's homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. So I think the Cre is under the control of SOX10, which is expressed in neural crest cells. So the Cre would be active in neural crest derivatives, like the cells expressing SOX10.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them with a confocal microscope looking for green signal. But they don't see any green. So the eGFP isn't being expressed, or not in the right place, or not at all.

The possible answers are A to D. Let's think about each.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the issue here is about expression of the receptor-eGFP. If the ligand is expressed in a different cell, the receptor wouldn't be activated, but I'm not sure how this relates to the eGFP not being expressed. The problem seems more technical, like maybe the construct isn't working, not about the relationship between ligand and receptor.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. The eGFP is on the C-terminus of the receptor. The receptor is a transmembrane protein. If it's stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't get to the cell surface, so you wouldn't see the GFP signal. But why would that happen? Maybe because of a stop cassette. But wait, the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So if the stop is present, the receptor is expressed without eGFP. But when Cre is active, the stop is removed, so receptor and eGFP should be co-expressed.

But in their experiment, when they transfected into astrocytes, they probably used Cre, so the stops were removed, and they saw expression via Western blot. So the eGFP should be expressed when Cre is active. But in the mouse, the Cre is from SOX10-Cre, which is only active in certain cells. So in the mouse, the Cre is active in neural crest cells, so the stop cassettes are removed, and the receptor and eGFP should be expressed.

But when they looked, no green. So maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why? Maybe the frame isn't correct.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The construct uses the CBA promoter for the ligand, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is after IRES, which doesn't require a promoter because it uses internal ribosome entry. So maybe the IRES isn't working, but I think IRES is a way to have separate expression. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor might not be expressed. But in the Western blot, they probably saw both proteins expressed when transfected. So maybe the problem is elsewhere.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, wait, the stop is in a cassette. So the ORF is ligand followed by a stop, then mCherry. For the receptor, the ORF is receptor followed by a stop and eGFP. When Cre is active, the stop is removed. So the ligand is fused to mCherry (if the stop is removed?), and the receptor is fused to eGFP. But wait, the stop is between the ligand and mCherry. Oh wait, no: the ligand ORF is at the 5', fused to mCherry. So the stop is a separate cassette between them. I'm a bit confused. So the ligand's stop is in a loxP-stop-loxP between ligand and mCherry. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, so ligand and mCherry are co-expressed as a fusion. Same for the receptor and eGFP.

Wait, but in the question, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. The receptor is after an IRES, so they are two separate ORFs. So the vector is set up to express ligand and receptor independently, but with the stop cassettes preventing their expression unless Cre is present.

So when the Cre is active (like in the SOX10-Cre mice), the stops are removed, and the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry fusion, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP fusion.

But when they do the Western blot, they probably used a Cre-expressing cell line or induced Cre, which would remove the stops, allowing the fusion proteins to be expressed. But in the mouse, the Cre is only active in certain cells, like neural crest cells.

In the mouse model, they are homozygous for the construct. So in these mice, the construct is present, but without Cre, the stops are present, so the ligand and receptor are not expressed as fusions. But when crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is active in cells where SOX10 is expressed. So in those cells, the stops are removed, and the ligand and receptor are expressed as fusion proteins.

But in the experiment, when they looked under the confocal, there was no green signal. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Looking at the options again:

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So if the ORF was interrupted by a stop, but in this case, the stop is in a loxP cassette. So when Cre is active, the stop is removed, so the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF. But wait, the stop was between the receptor and eGFP. So if the stop is removed, the receptor is followed by eGFP, meaning it's a fusion. But if the reading frame is not correct, the eGFP might not be expressed or the receptor might be truncated.

Wait, but the construct had the ligand at 5' fused to mCherry, but that's a separate ORF. The receptor is at
