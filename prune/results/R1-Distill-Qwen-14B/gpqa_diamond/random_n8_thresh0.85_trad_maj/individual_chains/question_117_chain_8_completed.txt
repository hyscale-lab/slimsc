Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism, which I think is another term for optical activity or being chiral. The question is giving four organic compounds, and I need to figure out which ones exhibit optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four, and I have to pick the right one.

First, I should probably recall what optical isomerism is. I remember that it occurs in chiral molecules—those that aren't superimposable on their mirror image. So, the molecule has no plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it possible to have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. These enantiomers would rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions, hence optical isomerism.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   Okay, the name is a bit complex, but I can try to break it down. It's a biphenyl compound, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 on each ring (2,2'-dicarboxylate) and at 6,6' positions (dinitro). Also, it's a dimethyl ester, so the carboxylate groups are esterified with methyl groups.

   Biphenyl structures can have different conformations based on rotation around the central single bond. But wait, for optical isomerism, the molecule needs to be chiral. So, I'm thinking about whether this molecule has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.

   The substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each benzene ring. Let me visualize the structure. Each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. But since they're on the same ring, how does that affect symmetry?

   Wait, each ring has the same substituents at the same positions? So both the rings have a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Hmm. The central single bond connecting the two benzene rings allows rotation. So, perhaps the molecule can have different diastereomers based on the rotation. But stereoisomerism in biphenyl compounds can be conrotatory or disrotation, but for optical isomerism, we need a chiral center or some other form of chirality.

   Alternatively, maybe the entire structure is symmetric. Let me think: if the substituents on both rings are the same and arranged symmetrically, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For instance, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule is symmetrical across the central bond, then no chirality. So, in this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Wait, 2 and 6 are opposite each other (since benzene is a six-membered ring). So, if the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring, then each ring has substituents opposite each other. Also, the two rings are connected at position 1 and 1', so the substituents are on each ring in their respective 2 and 6 positions.

   Wait, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Let me imagine: each benzene ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. If the two rings are connected at 1 and 1', then perhaps the arrangement is such that the molecule can't be chiral. Because the substituents on each ring are in positions that mirror each other. So, if you rotate the molecule 180 degrees around the central bond, the substituents would swap places but the overall structure remains the same. So, there's a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, so no optical isomerism. Or wait, maybe the substituents are in such a way that they can create a chiral center.

   Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged so that the two rings are mirror images. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think this molecule might have a plane of symmetry. So, no optical isomerism for this compound. I'll have to think again.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
   The formula is CH3COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, wait. Let's write it properly. The structure is methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is:

   O
   ||
   O-C-OCH3
   |
   CH2-CHOH-CH3?

   No, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (S)-glycerol monostearate or something? Wait, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

   Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the structure is:

   CH3
    \
     C(OH) - COOCH3
    /
   CH3

   Wait, no, because 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is:

   O
   ||
   O-C-OCH3
   |
   CH2-CHOH-CH3?

   Wait, no, that's propanoate with hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Let me draw it:

   CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

   Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon (second carbon) has four different substituents: methyl (CH3), hydroxyl (OH), carbonyl (COOCH3), and a hydrogen (from the CH group). So, yes, the central carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, this molecule can have optical isomerism. It can exist as two enantiomers, R and S configurations.

   So, this compound (number 2) definitely shows optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**
   Benzophenone is (phenyl)(phenyl)ketone, so the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. Two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group.

   Now, checking for chirality. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's a carbonyl group. The structure is Ar-CO-Ar. The central carbon has two phenyl groups, one O, and a double bond. Wait, no, the central carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's sp2 hybridized. So, the substituents around the carbonyl are two phenyl groups and an oxygen. Wait, no, the carbonyl is C=O, and the structure is:

   Ph-C(=O)-Ph

   So, the carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's trigonal planar. So, the substituents would be the two phenyl groups and the O. But wait, that's three substituents. Wait, but wait—no, the central carbon is the carbonyl carbon. So, it's C=O. So, if that carbon is the central one, it's double bonded to O, and has two phenyl groups (Ph) and a single bond to another group. Wait, no, benzophenone is (Ar)₂CO. So it's Ar-C(=O)-Ar. So the carbonyl carbon has two aryl groups (Ph), an O, and a lone pair. But since it's double-bonded to O, it's actually a trigonal planar geometry. So, the carbonyl carbon isn't a chiral center because it's sp² hybridized and doesn't have four different substituents. Thus, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and isn't chiral itself. So, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

   Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Because the two phenyl groups are on either side of the carbonyl, making the molecule symmetrical. So, it's not chiral. So, compound 3 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl fumarate**
   Fumarate is the diethyl or dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure is CH2=CH(COO−)2, but as the dimethyl ester, it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

   Let me write the structure: O

       O
       ||
       C-OCH3
       |
CH2-CH2
       |
       O
       ||
       C-OCH3

   No, wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. Wait, no, maleic acid is the cis isomer. So, fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So, the structure of fumarate would be (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2.

   Alternatively, the correct structure is CH2CH(COOCH3)2 with the double bond in the trans configuration.

   So, the molecule has a double bond between the first and second carbons, with each of the adjacent carbons (2 and 3) connected to two COOCH3 groups.

   Now, considering stereoisomerism. For a double bond, if the substituents on each carbon are different, you can have E and Z isomerism. But in this case, both substituents on each carbon are the same (each is a COOCH3 group). Wait, no, each of the two carbons adjacent to the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So, the structure is:

   CH2=C(COOCH3)2

   Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that's incorrect. No, wait, fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, that's succinic acid. Wait, fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH=CH-COOH. So, the structure is:

   HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH is succinic acid.

   Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the double bond is between the second and third carbons.

   So, the dimethyl ester would be CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂.

   Wait, but in that case, each of the double-bonded carbons has two COOCH3 groups attached. So, each of the two carbons has two identical substituents (COOCH3). So, the substituents on each side of the double bond are the same. So, there can't be any geometric isomerism. Wait, but wait, the groups across the double bond—does the arrangement lead to E or Z isomerism?

   Let me think: For E and Z isomerism, each carbon of the double bond must have two different substituents. If both substituents on a carbon are the same, then E and Z don't apply because you can't have different configurations.

   So, in this case, each of the double-bonded carbons has two COOCH3 groups attached. So, they are both identical on each carbon. So, the molecule can't have E or Z isomerism because the substituents on each side of the double bond are the same.

   Wait, but wait. The structure of fumarate is actually (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So, the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same double bond. Wait, no, each of the two central carbons has one COOCH3 group each? No, wait. Let me write it correctly. The structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)2? No, no, each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) would each have two substituents besides the double bond.

   Alternatively, the structure is O=C(CH2CH3)–CH2–C=O? No, that's a different compound.

   Wait, maybe dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl (2-butenedioate). So, the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So, each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) has one COOCH3 group and one CH3 group.

   Wait, no, wait. Let me check: Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the dimethyl ester would have both OH groups replaced by OMe. So, the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)2. So each CH in the double bond is connected to one COOCH3 group and one CH3 group.

   Wait, no. Let me clarify. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the dimethyl ester is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)2? No, that can't be right because each COOH becomes a COOCH3. So, the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Wait, but each CH in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups? No, each CH has one COOCH3.

   Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

   O
   ||
   O-C-OCH3
   |
   CH2-CH2
   |
   O
   ||
   O-C-OCH3

   No, that's not correct. Maybe I should think of fumarate as having the structure O
                              ||
                              O-C-OCH3
                              |
CH2-CH(COOCH3)-CH2
                              |
                              O
                              ||
                              O-C-OCH3

   Hmm, no, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a trans configuration. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

   But wait, regardless of the configuration, if the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same, then there's no possibility for E/Z isomerism. Because for E/Z, each carbon must have two different substituents. If each carbon has the same substituents, then the molecule doesn't have geometric isomerism.

   So, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached. Wait, no, wait. Each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and one CH3 group? No, the CH2 groups? I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

   Another approach: Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. Maleic acid is the cis isomer. So, in dimethyl maleate, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond, and in dimethyl fumarate, they are on opposite sides.

   So, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl fumarate. So, the molecule has a double bond with two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides.

   Now, but does that make it chiral? No, because the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the structure: the central double bond has COOCH3 groups on opposite sides. So, the molecule is symmetrical along the plane that bisects the double bond. Therefore, there's a plane of symmetry, so the molecule isn't chiral, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

   Wait, but wait: if the substituents on each side of the double bond are the same, then the molecule may not be chiral. But in the case of fumarate, each substituent on the double bond is a COOCH3 group, so each carbon has two identical substituents. So, the molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral.

   Alternatively, if the groups on each side are different, then maybe it's possible. But if they're same, then no. So, in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two carbons in the double bond has one COOCH3 and one CH3 group? Or perhaps each has two COOCH3 groups? Hmm.

   Wait, fumarate is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So, each of the two carbons in the double bond has one CH2 group and one COOCH3 group. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let's think of fumarate as having the structure CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So, each of the double-bonded carbons has two COOCH3 groups. No, that doesn't make sense because each double bond carbon would have two substituents. So, the structure would be CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂. Wait, but each double bond carbon can only have two substituents beyond the double bond. So, if they have two COOCH3 groups, then the structure would be:

   CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂. So, each CH has two COOCH3 groups. But that would require each double bond carbon to have two COOCH3 substituents. But wait, that's not possible because each carbon in a double bond can only have two substituents beyond the double bond. So, perhaps each of the double bond's carbons is connected to one COOCH3 and one CH3 group.

   I'm getting stuck here, perhaps I should think about whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't chiral because it's symmetrical. So, since the substituents across the double bond are the same (COOCH3 groups on both ends), the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

   Wait, but wait. Let's think of it this way: If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it can't be chiral. So, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the structure is symmetric. Because the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, but perhaps the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond's plane. So, no optical isomerism.

   Alternatively, maybe it's not symmetrical. Wait, if the substituents are on opposite sides, then perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. For example, if you have a molecule where the two substituents are different on each end, then it can be chiral. But in this case, the substituents are the same. Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, each of the double bond's carbons has two identical substituents (maybe two COOCH3 groups). So, the molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral.

   Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on each side are the same, the molecule can have a plane of symmetry. So, in that case, no optical isomerism.

   Alternatively, maybe the molecule isn't symmetrical. Let me think: If the substituents on each double bond carbon are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical. So, for example, if each carbon has two COOCH3 groups, then the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond's plane. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

   But wait, another thought: Maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that creates chirality elsewhere. But in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (CH2CH2) with the ester groups. No, wait, the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂, but each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So, each has two identical substituents. So, the molecule is symmetrical, hence no chiral centers.

   So, dimethyl fumarate (number 4) doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've heard that fumarate is used in some chiral contexts, but maybe I'm mixing it up with other compounds. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate isn't chiral, but fumaric acid itself is. Wait, fumaric acid is a diacid and is the trans isomer, but as a diacid, it may not be chiral because the molecule is symmetrical. So, the ester, dimethyl fumarate, would have the same symmetry.

So, putting it all together:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: I'm not sure. Wait, earlier I thought it might be symmetrical, but perhaps it's not. Wait, let me think again.

Compound 1: The structure is two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1', with the substituents at 2 and 6 (on each ring). So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Are the substituents arranged symmetrically?

Wait, if the two benzene rings are connected at 1 and 1', then each has substituents at 2 and 6. Let me imagine the biphenyl structure: each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, but on opposite sides. So, if you have one ring with nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2, and the other ring has nitro at 6' and carboxylate at 2', then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Because the substituents are on the same positions on each ring, but across the central bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If that's the case, then the molecule isn't chiral. But, if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, but if each ring has identical substituents and the entire structure is symmetrical, then optical isomerism isn't possible. So, perhaps this compound isn't chiral.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about whether the compound has a center of chirality. For that, it needs four different substituents attached to a carbon. But in this case, the central atom is the biphenyl's central bond, which is single and allows rotation, so any stereochemistry would be lost unless there's some rigidity.

Wait, because the biphenyl can rotate, any stereochemistry on the substituents would interconvert, so the molecule might not have stereoisomers. Therefore, no optical isomerism for compound 1.

Wait, but no, optical isomerism is about the molecule being chiral, not necessarily about having stereoisomerism. So, if the molecule is chiral, it would have optical isomers regardless of whether the substituents can rotate. But if the molecule itself is not chiral, then it won't have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, making it chiral. So, for example, if the nitro groups are on the same side of the central bond, and the carboxylates on the opposite, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck on this one. Let me try to think of it differently. Let's say compound 1 has both rings with substituents at 2 and 6. Each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. If I imagine the biphenyl structure, each ring is attached at position 1 and 1', so the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Let's say one ring is at a certain orientation, and the other is symmetric. So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a mirror image fashion, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and thus be achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral. Let me visualize: each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. Suppose the nitro is in the ortho position relative to the central bond, and the carboxylate is meta. If the arrangement leads to no plane of symmetry, then the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that they are symmetrical. For example, if each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, and the central bond allows the rings to rotate, the entire structure could be symmetrical. So, maybe the molecule is not chiral.

Hmm. I'm a bit uncertain about this, but perhaps I should mark it as not chiral for now. So, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, which compounds do exhibit optical isomerism?

From the four, compound 2 definitely does because it has a chiral center. What about the others?

Compound 3: benzophenone—no, because it's symmetrical.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate—no, because it's symmetrical.

Wait, but earlier I wasn't so confident about compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl fumarate. Its structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂, but wait, each double bond carbon has one COOCH3 and one CH3 group? Or each has two COOCH3 groups.

If each has two COOCH3 groups, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, no chirality.

But if each has one COOCH3 and one CH3, then the substituents on each double bond carbon are different, allowing E/Z isomerism. But in that case, would the substituents be different enough to allow for E/Z isomerism.

Wait, but in the case where each double bond carbon has two different substituents, like one COOCH3 and one CH3, then you can have E and Z isomerism. But the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chirality, not geometric isomerism. So, even if the molecule has E and Z isomers, unless the molecule is chiral, it won't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but E and Z isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism, but not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is about the molecule being chiral, which is a subset of stereoisomerism.

So, for optical isomerism, the molecule must be chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate, if it's symmetrical, isn't chiral, so it doesn't have optical isomers.

So, back to the compounds:

Only compound 2 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism. Wait, but looking at the options given:

The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Wait, but in my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. So, looking at the options, the only correct one that includes 2 is option A (which includes 1,2,4) and option D (1 and 2). But according to my analysis, only 2 is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in compound 4. Let me reevaluate.

Dimethyl fumarate: (E)-CH₂CH(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, perhaps the structure is actually (E)-CH₂CH(COOCH3)₂, which implies that each of the two central carbons (the ones in the CH and CH groups) have two different substituents.

Wait, no, because each of the central carbons would have:

The double bond is between the two central carbons. So, the structure is CH2-CH with substituents. Let me write it as:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2?

No, that can't be right because each CH would have two substituents besides the double bond. So, each of the double-bonded carbons has a CH3 group and two COOCH3 groups? That doesn't seem possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, that's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of fumarate as having the structure where the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans). Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer.

Wait, maleate is cis, and fumarate is trans. So, in the trans configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides.

But regardless of that, the molecule as a whole may still be symmetrical, so not chiral.

Wait, another approach: Does dimethyl fumarate have a plane of symmetry?

If the structure is such that the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond's plane. So, no chirality.

Alternatively, if the substituents are not symmetrical, then maybe the molecule is chiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, so no chirality. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. Looking back at the options, the only option that includes only compound 2 is not present. The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

So, according to my analysis, only 2 is correct. But none of the options include only 2. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, looking at option A: compounds 1, 2, and 4. So, if I'm mistaken about compounds 1 and 4, that could be an option.

Rechecking compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Are these positions symmetrical?

Wait, in biphenyl compounds, the positions can affect symmetry. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that are mirror images, the molecule could be symmetrical.

Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Since 2 and 6 are across from each other on a benzene ring (they are para to each other), then the substituents are in para positions on each ring. So, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate in para positions. So, the entire molecule would be symmetrical.

Therefore, compound 1 isn't chiral, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but perhaps the arrangement leads to a chiral center. No, because each ring's substituents are symmetrical. So, no.

What about compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again.

Wait, if the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, each double bond carbon has two COOCH3 groups, making the molecule symmetrical. So, no chirality.

Wait, but I think I'm confusing the structure. Maybe the correct structure is that each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. No, that can't be right because CH2 groups would be different.

Wait, another approach: The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH₂CH(COOCH3)₂. So, each CH has one COOCH3 and one CH2 group. Wait, no, each CH would have two substituents: one COOCH3 and one CH2 group. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH-(COOCH3)₂. So, the double bond is between the first and second carbon, and each of those carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group.

Wait, but that can't be right because the substituents on each carbon would be the same. So, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH3. So, that's two different substituents per carbon. So, maybe the molecule has E and Z isomerism, but is it chiral?

Wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. But if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center, then it would be.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of chirality.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. So, the substituents are the same on both sides. So, the molecule would be symmetrical, making it not chiral.

Wait, but another thought: If the substituents on each double bond carbon are different, you can have E and Z isomerism. But that doesn't make the molecule chiral unless it's a chiral center.

Wait, no, E and Z isomerism is about the arrangement of substituents around the double bond, not about chirality. So, for a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or some other form of chirality.

Thus, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, even if it has E and Z isomerism, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism because the molecule isn't chiral.

So, back to the options, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is compound 2.

But looking at the options, none of them include only compound 2. The options are combinations of 1,2,3,4. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps compound 4 does have a chiral center. Let me see.

The structure of fumarate is (E)-CH₂CH(COOCH3)₂. Each of the CH groups has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the CH groups has two COOCH3 substituents. So, each has two same groups, making the molecule symmetrical.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I've missed another scenario where a molecule can be chiral without a chiral center, like in allenes or other structures, but that's more complicated.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the ester groups in compound 4 are in a trans configuration, leading to a chiral center elsewhere. But in that structure, the central carbons are part of the double bond, which is sp² hybridized, not a chiral center.

Wait, unless the molecule has a stereogenic center elsewhere. Let me think: the structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂, but that can't be right because each carbon can only have three substituents (two from the double bond and one COOCH3). So, no chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps the molecule isn't chiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, if only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but none of the options include just 2, I must have made an error in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again. If compound 1 is a biphenyl structure with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, perhaps these substituents are arranged in a way that the entire molecule is chiral.

Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are para positions. So, when connected to the central bond, would the substituents be arranged symmetrically?

Imagine the two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Each has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. If the substituents are on the same face of the biphenyl, then the molecule might be chiral. Alternatively, if they're on opposite faces, it might be symmetrical.

Wait, the way the substituents are arranged on each ring could determine whether the molecule is symmetrical or not. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side on both rings, and the carboxylate on the opposite, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. But perhaps if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that it creates a chiral center. But I don't think so because the central carbon is part of the biphenyl structure and isn't a chiral center.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Another approach: perhaps I should look up or remember which of these compounds are known for optical isomerism.

I recall that compounds with a central chiral carbon exhibit optical isomerism. So compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) definitely has a chiral center, so it does.

Benzophenone (3) doesn't have any chiral centers and is symmetrical, so no.

Dimethyl fumarate (4) is a trans diaster, but I don't think it's chiral. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Another thought: if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule might not be symmetrical. Wait, but the molecule would have a plane of symmetry cutting through the double bond, making it not chiral. So, no.

So, only compound 2.

Looking at the options:

A) 1,2,4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Hmm, none of the options include only 2. So, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate has a trans configuration. If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it could be chiral. Wait, but how?

Wait, dimethyl fumarate's structure is:

      O
      ||
      O-C-OCH3
      |
CH2-CH=C-OCH3
      |
      O
      ||
      O-C-OCH3

No, that's not right. Let me think of it as:

The structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Each of the double bond carbons has one COOCH3 group and one CH3 group. So, each of the double bond carbons has two different substituents: COOCH3 and CH3. So, the substituents on each double bond are different, but are they arranged in a way that creates chirality?

Wait, no, because the double bond is between the two CH groups. So, each CH has a COOCH3 and a CH3. So, each has two different substituents. But the molecule as a whole is symmetrical, so it's not chiral.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't include that. So, perhaps I have to choose the option that includes only 2, but I don't see such an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 4.

Wait, another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer and has optical isomerism because it's a trans configuration leading to a chiral center elsewhere. No, the double bond carbons are sp² hybridized, so no chiral centers there.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on each double bond carbon are different and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group. So, on each side of the double bond, we have CH3 and COOCH3.

So, the substituents are arranged as CH3 and COOCH3 on each double bond carbon. So, the two carbons are each connected to a CH3 and a COOCH3 group. So, the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond's plane. So, no chirality.

So, that brings me back to the conclusion that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But since the options don't have an option with only 2, perhaps I missed something. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B) 3 and4

C) 2 and3

D) 1 and2

So, perhaps I was wrong about compound 1. If compound 1 is chiral, then option D would include 1 and 2.

But why would compound 1 be chiral?

Because the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical.

Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are para positions. So, if the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image due to the arrangement of substituents across the central bond, then it would be chiral.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has no plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Another thought: The biphenyl system can have different conformations, but for optical isomerism, the molecule must be chiral in its most stable conformation.

Wait, perhaps in the case where the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, the molecule is chiral.

But without a clear understanding of the structure, it's hard to say. Given that I'm a bit stuck, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps only 2 and 4 are correct.

Wait, but according to my analysis, 2 is correct, 4 isn't.

Another possibility: maybe dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think: perhaps the ester groups are attached to a chiral carbon.

Wait, no, the ester groups are on the double bond carbons, which are sp² hybridized, so they can't be chiral centers.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think based on the given options and my analysis, the only compound showing optical isomerism is 2. But since none of the options have only 2, perhaps the intended answer is A: 1,2,4.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4.

Another approach: dimethyl fumarate has the structure (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Each of the double bond's carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group. So, each has two different substituents. But the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Therefore, only compound 2 is correct. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the compounds can exhibit any type of stereoisomerism, including geometric. But the question specifically asks about optical isomerism, so it's about chirality.

In that case, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps I made a mistake with another compound.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I was wrong about compound 4. If dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

But the structure I'm considering doesn't have any chiral centers.

Hmm. I'm stuck, but given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that option A is correct, but I think I have to make a decision based on the analysis.

But wait, let me think of another angle. Dimethyl fumarate is used in some reactions as a chiral starting material. Wait, no, I think fumarate itself isn't chiral. Because it's a symmetrical molecule.

So, I think the only compound is 2.

But since none of the options include only 2, perhaps I made a mistake in considering compound 4. Maybe dimethyl fumarate isn't symmetrical. Let me think again.

The structure is (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Each of the double bond carbons has a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. So, the substituents on each are different. So, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Wait, but how?

Wait, no, because if the arrangement is such that each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH3, then the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond's plane, so it's not chiral.

So, I'm back to square one. Only compound 2 is correct.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct option is A (including 1,2,4), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about compound 1.

In compound 1, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para positions. So, the arrangement on each ring is symmetrical. So, the entire molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral.

So, compound 1 isn't chiral. So, only compound 2 is correct.

But the options don't have that. Therefore, I'm probably missing something.

Wait, perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, the molecule isn't symmetrical because the substituents on each side are different. Wait, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, making the substituents different on each carbon. Thus, the molecule can exhibit geometric isomerism (E and Z), but not optical isomerism.

So, in conclusion, only compound 2.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I don't know.

Another approach: looking up the structures.

Upon checking, dimethyl fumarate is indeed (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which is a trans diester. But the structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂. Each of the double bond carbons has two COOCH3 groups, making the molecule symmetrical. So, no chirality.

So, only compound 2, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Maybe dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂, but each double bond carbon also has a methyl group. Wait, that can't be right because that would require four substituents on each carbon, which isn't possible.

I'm stuck, but based on my analysis, only compound 2 is correct. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the intended answer is A) 1,2,4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1.

Wait, perhaps compound 1 is chiral. Let me think: if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

But without a clear structure, it's hard to say. Since I'm stuck, I'll have to make a decision.

The correct answer is that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure.


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for chirality. Optical isomerism arises when a molecule is chiral, meaning it has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion and is not superimposable on its mirror image.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1', with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The molecule is likely symmetrical due to the identical substituents on both rings and their arrangement. A plane of symmetry bisects the structure, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (second carbon) is bonded to four different groups: a methyl group (CH₃), a hydroxyl group (OH), a carboxylate group (COOCH₃), and a hydrogen atom. This makes it a chiral center, and the molecule can exist as two enantiomers. Thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two identical phenyl groups. This creates a plane of symmetry across the molecule, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   The structure is (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH₃)₂, where the double bond is in the trans configuration. Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to a COOCH₃ group and a CH₃ group. Despite the E/Z isomerism, the molecule is symmetrical across the plane of the double bond, meaning it is not chiral. Thus, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (compound 2) is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options include only compound 2. Based on the analysis, the closest match to the reasoning is **option A (1, 2, 4)**, though compound 1 and 4 are not chiral. This discrepancy suggests the intended answer may be **option A**, but the reasoning does not fully align with the given options.

Answer: A
