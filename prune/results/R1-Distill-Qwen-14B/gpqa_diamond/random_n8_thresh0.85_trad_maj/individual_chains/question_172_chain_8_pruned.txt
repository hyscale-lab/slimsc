Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. 

The question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We need to find the correct equation relating their temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation is n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. Oh right, since the problem only compares two stars, maybe the statistical weights (g factors) are the same for both, which would simplify the ratio.

So if star_1 has twice as many atoms in the excited state compared to star_2, then n1/n2 = 2. Let me write that down. Using the Boltzmann equation for each star:

For star_1: n1 = (g_upper/g_lower) exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
For star_2: n2 = (g_upper/g_lower) exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

But since g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars (same element, same energy levels), their ratio would cancel out. So when we take the ratio n1/n2, it becomes exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

That simplifies to exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)). Because when you subtract exponents, you add the inverses. Wait, let me double-check that:

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b). So here, a is -ΔE/(k T1), and b is -ΔE/(k T2). So a - b = [-ΔE/(k T1)] - [-ΔE/(k T2)] = ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1]. 

So n1/n2 = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)).

Given that n1/n2 is 2, so 2 = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)).

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides: ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Wait, but I'm looking for an equation involving T1 and T2, so perhaps rearranging this equation.

Let me write that equation again:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that gives:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this structure. The options are about expressions equal to ln(2), so maybe I can manipulate the above equation.

Wait, but I have (ΔE/k) multiplied by (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). However, the problem gives the ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, but in the options, the equation is about ln(2) equaling some function of T1 and T2.

Wait, but the options are given without any constants, so perhaps the ΔE and k are incorporated into the equation in a way that cancels out. Or perhaps I'm supposed to rearrange the equation to get T1 and T2 in terms of each other.

Wait, but the question is asking which equation correctly relates T1 and T2, so perhaps the options are in terms of the ratio. Let me think about the equation again.

From the earlier step, ln(2) =
