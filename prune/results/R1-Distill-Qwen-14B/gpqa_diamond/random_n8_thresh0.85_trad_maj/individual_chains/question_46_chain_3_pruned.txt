Okay, so I have this problem about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming of double bonds, right? So, the catalyst helps the alkene swap parts.

The compound given is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's draw its structure. Pent-1-ene has five carbons with the double bond starting at C1. So, it's CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but wait, no, wait, 3-methyl would be a branch on the third carbon. Wait, wait, let me think. The formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, the structure is CH2=CH-C(H)(CH2CH3). Wait, maybe I should write it as CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, that's more carbons than pent. Wait, no, pent-1-ene has five carbons, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

So, for pent-1-ene: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would be a methyl group on carbon 3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Hmm, wait, that can't be right because the chain would be longer then. Wait, maybe I should number it correctly.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So, the double bond starts at C1. Now, 3-methyl on that would be a methyl group on C3. So, C1: CH2=, C2: CH-, C3: CH(CH2CH3), then C4 and C5: CH2 and CH3? Wait, wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me count. C1: CH2-, C2: CH-, C3: CH(CH3), C4: CH2, C5: CH3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

But wait, pentane has five carbons, so 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So, the molecule is CH2=CH-CH
