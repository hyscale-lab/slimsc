Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to understand the structure of the starting material. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, wait. Oh, right, that's 1-bromo-2,3-didehydrobenzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2,3-dihydrobenzene? Wait, wait, the 'd' probably stands for dehydro. Oh, right, the numbering might be a bit confusing. Let me think about the structure.

So, benzene is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds. If it's 1-bromo-2,3-didehydrobenzene, then positions 2 and 3 have double bonds, but not benzene's typical structure. Wait, no, maybe it's a different ring system. Alternatively, if it's 1-bromo-2,3-dihydrobenzene, that would imply a partially hydrogenated ring—like a cyclohexadiene or something. But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to draw it mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,3-didehydrobenzene, which would have two double bonds. Wait, benzene has three double bonds. So a 2,3-didehydro would remove two hydrogens, perhaps making it a diene. No, wait, that's not right. Maybe the structure is such that it's a cyclohexene derivative. Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the molecule is either a benzene ring with a substituent and some double bonds.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: NaNH2 is a strong base. In condensed ammonia, which is a solvent that's often used for elimination reactions. So NaNH2 is typically used for dehydrohalogenation, especially in aromatic systems.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,3-dihydrobenzene. So the benzene ring isn't fully unsaturated. Let me think: 2,3-dihydro would mean that there's a single bond between carbons 2 and 3, so the ring has a double bond between 1 and 2 maybe, and another double bond elsewhere? Or perhaps it's a partially saturated ring.

Wait, I think the structure is a benzene ring where positions 2 and 3 are dihydro, meaning there's a single bond there. So the ring has a single bond between 2 and 3, and perhaps another double bond elsewhere. Oh wait, no, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a naphthalene derivative? No, I think it's a benzene ring with a substituent and some hydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is similar to vinyl bromide. Wait, no. Let me think again about the possible reaction.

The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So perhaps the structure is benzene where the substituent is at position 1 (the bromine), and the ring is in a particular state. Wait, maybe it's benzene with a bromine at position 1 and a diene structure?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihydro structure. Wait, another approach: when benzene rings are dehydrohalogenated, you can get either a di-substituted or mono-substituted product, depending on the position. But in this case, the starting material may already have a dihydro structure, so the reaction could lead to some elimination.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a dihydrobenzene with a bromine. Let's say the structure is such that when you eliminate H and Br, you form a new double bond. So NaNH2 would abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to an elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, but if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,3-dihydrobenzene, that would mean that the ring has a single bond between C2 and C3, and perhaps another double bond elsewhere. So maybe the structure is a ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and single bonds elsewhere except for the C2-C3 single bond.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as a cyclohexene ring where positions 2 and 3 are single-bonded, and the bromine is at position 1.

But perhaps this is getting a bit too detailed. Let me think about the reaction itself. NaNH2 is a strong base, and in condensed ammonia, it often induces elimination reactions. So when you have a bromide near a ring, the base can abstract a hydrogen adjacent to the bromine, leading to elimination (like dehydrohalogenation) and forming a double bond.

So, in this case, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2,3-didehydro. Wait, if it's 2,3-didehydro, that would mean that the ring has two double bonds? Or perhaps it's a dihydro ring with a single bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a ring where the 1 position is brominated, and the 2 and 3 positions are dihydro, meaning they have single bonds, so the ring isn't fully aromatic.

Wait, so in such a structure, if you have an adjacent hydrogen (like at position 2 or 3), the base could abstract that, leading to the elimination of H and Br, forming a new double bond.

So the original structure might have single bonds at 2 and 3. Let me imagine the structure: benzene with a Br at position 1, and positions 2 and 3 are single bonds. So perhaps the ring would have double bonds at positions 3-4 and 4-5? Or another arrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexene ring with a bromine at position 1, and the dihydro part is at 2 and 3.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure as a benzene ring with two adjacent CH2 groups. Wait, no, that would be a different scenario.

Alternatively, considering that 2,3-dihydrobenzene would have a single bond between C2 and C3, and perhaps another double bond elsewhere. Let's say the ring has a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C4 and C5, for example. But wait, benzene has three double bonds. So 2,3-dihydro would mean that two of the bonds are single, perhaps?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a mono-substituted bromobenzene, but with some hydrogenation. But I'm not entirely clear on the structure. Maybe I should think about the possible products instead.

If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,3-dihydrobenzene, then the structure would be a ring where positions 2 and 3 are single bonds. So the ring might look like this: positions 1 is Br, 2 and 3 have single bonds, and the rest have double bonds as in benzene.

Wait, but benzene has three double bonds. So if positions 2 and 3 are single bonds, then maybe the double bonds are between 1-2 (which would be single here?), no, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring is more like cyclohexene with a substituent. Let me think: the ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond between, say, C1 and C2, and the bromine is at C1. But then, if positions 2 and 3 are dihydro, that would imply that C2 and C3 are single bonded. But in that case, the structure would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and a single bond between C2 and C3, and then another double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is similar to 1-bromo-1,2-dihydrobenzene. No, but the question says 2-d, so positions 2 and 3.

Hmm, perhaps I should move forward. The reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia, which is a dehydrohalogenation condition. So in such a case, the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond.

In the starting material, if the bromine is at position 1, then the β hydrogens would be at positions 2 and 6 (assuming benzene numbering). Wait, but if the starting material is a dihydrobenzene, the possible β hydrogens might be limited.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a dihydro structure such that when elimination occurs, the ring becomes more unsaturated. So in 1-bromo-2,3-dihydrobenzene, the base could abstract a hydrogen from C2 or C3, leading to the elimination of Br and H, forming a double bond between C1 and C2, or perhaps C2 and C3.

Wait, but in the starting material, the positions 2 and 3 are dihydro, so they have single bonds. So if H is abstracted from C2, the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2. Similarly, abstracting H from C3 would form a double bond between C3 and C4. But wait, is that possible?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material only has one possible hydrogen that can be abstracted, leading to one product. Or maybe there are two possible sites, leading to two products.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible organic products. So if there are two possible elimination sites, then perhaps two products.

Wait, but the starting material's structure is key. Let me try to imagine it as 1-bromo-2,3-dihydrobenzene. So the ring is such that between C2 and C3, there's a single bond, making it dihydro. So the ring would have double bonds elsewhere.

Wait, but in a benzene ring, each carbon is sp² hybridized. In a dihydro ring, two adjacent carbons are sp³. So the ring isn't fully aromatic.

In this structure, the bromine is at C1. The adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) would have hydrogens. But if the ring is 2,3-dihydro, then C2 and C3 are single-bonded. So the structure would have double bonds at C1-C2 (but wait, if C2 is single-bonded to C3, then perhaps the double bonds are elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a double bond between C4 and C5, and another between C6 and C1. Because if C2 and C3 are single-bonded, perhaps the ring has double bonds at C1-C6 (if that's possible) and C4-C5. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the ring has a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C4 and C5, with C2 and C3 being single-bonded.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexene ring. Let me think of it as a cyclohexene with substituents. Suppose the ring is a cyclohexene with a bromine at position 1, and the cyclohexene double bond is between positions 1 and 2. Then, the positions 2 and 3 are single-bonded.

In that case, the base could abstract a hydrogen from position 3, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a double bond between C2 and C3. But wait, the starting material already has a double bond between C1 and C2. Hmm, but then adding another double bond would make it a cumulene, which is possible but perhaps less favorable.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's ring is such that elimination can occur in two different positions, leading to two different products.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material has two different sites for elimination. For example, if the bromine is at position 1, and the possible β hydrogens are at positions 2 and 6. But wait, if the ring is 2,3-dihydro, then position 2 is single-bonded, so maybe the hydrogen at position 2 is not available for elimination. Because in a dihydro structure, perhaps the adjacent carbons are sp³ and have more hydrogens.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me think about possible products. When NaNH2 is used on a bromobenzene derivative, it typically dehydrohalogenates to form a more substituted double bond, following Zaitsev's rule.

So in the starting material, if there are two possible positions for elimination (say, leading to different double bond positions), the more substituted product would be the major one, but the question is about possible products, regardless of major or minor.

So if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,3-dihydrobenzene, and upon elimination, there's more than one site for the elimination.

Wait, perhaps the elimination can occur between C1 and C2, forming a double bond there, or between C1 and C6, but because of the dihydro structure, maybe only one position is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,3-dihydrobenzene, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from C2, leading to elimination and forming a double bond between C1 and C2. But since the dihydro is at C2 and C3, maybe there's another site, like C3, but perhaps the hydrogen isn't available.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a ring expansion or contraction, but that seems less likely.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a dihydro structure where the bromine is at position 1, and the ring has a single bond at positions 2-3. So, the ring would have a double bond at positions 3-4 and another at positions 5-6. So, the structure would have double bonds at positions 3-4 and 5-6, and a single bond between 2-3 and 6-1.

In that case, the elimination would abstract a hydrogen from either position 2 or position 3. Let me see: if the base takes a hydrogen from position 2, then elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2. That's one product.

If the base takes a hydrogen from position 3, then elimination would form a double bond between 3 and 4. But wait, position 3 is already part of a double bond (3-4), so maybe that's not possible.

Wait, no. If the starting material has a double bond at 3-4, then position 3 is sp² hybridized. But if the dihydro is at 2 and 3, then position 3 would be sp³, making it possible to have a hydrogen there. Hmm, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination can occur in two different positions, leading to two different products.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has two possible sites for elimination: one on the same side as the bromine, leading to one product, and another on the opposite side, leading to a different product. But that would imply stereoisomerism, but the question may not be considering that. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has symmetry, leading to fewer products.

Wait, perhaps I should look for similar reactions. I remember that when benzene rings have substituents adjacent to a dihydro structure, elimination can lead to different products based on where the hydrogen is abstracted.

Wait, another angle: if the starting material is o-bromo-1,2-dihydrobenzene, then elimination would form either a double bond between 1 and 2 or between 2 and 3. But in that case, perhaps two products are possible.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material only allows for one site of elimination, leading to a single product.

Wait, but the question gives options of 1, 2, 3, or 4 products. So if elimination is possible in two different ways, you get two products.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another way to approach this is to consider if the reaction leads to the formation of a more substituted double bond.

So, in the starting material, if elimination occurs to form a more substituted double bond, that would be favored. For example, if the double bond can be between C1 and C2 (which would lead to a more substituted structure) or between C3 and C4 (which would lead to a less substituted structure), the former would be the major product. But the question is about the number of possible products, not which is major.

So, perhaps two products are possible: one more substituted and one less substituted.

Alternatively, perhaps only one product is possible due to the structure of the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's structure doesn't allow for more than one site of elimination. For example, if only one hydrogen is available for abstraction, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination can occur in two different positions, leading to two products.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think of another approach. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, the dihydro is at positions 2 and 3, which are adjacent. So the molecule has a single bond between C2 and C3, and the ring is otherwise unsaturated.

So, the structure would have a double bond between C1 and C6, another between C4 and C5, and another between C3 and C4? No, wait, that would be three double bonds, but benzene only has three. Alternatively, perhaps the ring has double bonds between C1-C2 and C4-C5, and the rest are single, but that would make it a dihydro structure.

Wait, perhaps the ring is such that the double bonds are between C1-C2 and C4-C5, with a single bond between C2-C3 and C5-C6. Hmm, but that may not add up correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a single bond between C2 and C3, making it 2,3-dihydro. So the ring has double bonds elsewhere, like between C1-C2 (but that would be a single bond in this case) and other positions.

Wait, maybe I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me think of the possible products.

When you eliminate H and Br from 1-bromo-2,3-dihydrobenzene, you form a double bond. If the starting material has a single bond between C2 and C3, then elimination could form a double bond either between C1 and C2, or between C3 and C4.

Wait, if you eliminate H from C2, you form a double bond between C1 and C2. If you eliminate H from C3, you form a double bond between C3 and C4.

So, that would give two products. But wait, is C3 a possible site for elimination?

Alternatively, perhaps only one site is possible because of the structure. For example, if the H at C3 is not available because it's on the same side as the Br, maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's structure allows for only one elimination site, leading to one product. So the answer would be 1.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: since the starting material is 1-bromo-2,3-dihydrobenzene, the β hydrogens are on C2 and C6? No, because the dihydro is on C2 and C3, so perhaps the H on C2 is more accessible.

Wait, but if the dihydro is on C2 and C3, then the ring's structure is such that C2 is connected to C3 via a single bond. So the adjacent carbons to the bromine (C1) are C2 and C6. But if C2 is part of the dihydro, then the H on C2 might be available.

Wait, maybe elimination can occur in two different ways: from C2 and from C6. Let me think: if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,3-dihydrobenzene, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from C2, leading to a double bond between C1 and C2. Alternatively, if it abstracts a hydrogen from C6, leading to a double bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, but in benzene, the positions are arranged in a ring, so C1 is adjacent to C2 and C6. So, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from either C2 or C6, elimination would form two different double bonds: one between C1-C2 and another between C1-C6.

Wait, but that would imply two different products. So, the number of possible products would be two.

So the answer would be option C) 2.

Wait, but another consideration: the starting material's dihydro positions are 2 and 3. So, the H on C2 is available for elimination, but H on C6 might not be, depending on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihydro is only at C2 and C3, so the ring's other positions (like C6) are fully unsaturated. So, perhaps the H on C6 is available for elimination, leading to another product.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. But given that, I think the reaction could lead to two possible products, depending on which hydrogen is abstracted.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2,3-dihydro with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia, a strong base that promotes dehydrohalogenation. The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2,3-dihydro, is a partially saturated benzene ring with a bromine substituent at position 1 and single bonds (dihydro) at positions 2 and 3. The double bonds in the ring are located elsewhere, maintaining aromaticity.

Under the reaction conditions, NaNH₂ abstracts a β-hydrogen adjacent to the bromine, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a new double bond. The possible β-hydrogens are located at positions 2 and 6. 

1. **Elimination at position 2**: Abstraction of a hydrogen from position 2 results in the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2.
2. **Elimination at position 6**: Abstraction of a hydrogen from position 6 results in the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6.

Both elimination pathways are feasible, leading to two distinct products. The reaction does not produce more than two products because the starting material's structure limits the possible elimination sites. Therefore, the number of possible organic products is **2**.

Answer: C
