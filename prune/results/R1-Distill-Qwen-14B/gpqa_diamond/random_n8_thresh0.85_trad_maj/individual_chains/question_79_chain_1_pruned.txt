Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to identify compound X from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in elimination reactions. Oh wait, it's also known as DBU (1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene maybe?), but wait, no, DBU is [5.4.0], right? So this is a different base. Oh, okay, regardless, it's a strong, non-nucleophilic base, so likely it's causing an elimination reaction.

Compound X has molecular formula C11H12O. Let's check the options for their formulas, but wait, maybe the product is an epoxide, and the reaction is something else. Wait, no, the reaction is with a base, so perhaps it's an elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, but the product's NMR is given. So maybe the product is the result of a reaction, but perhaps the starting material is an epoxide. Oh wait, no. Because the options are possible structures for X, and the product is something else. Wait, no, maybe the reaction is forming an epoxide?

Wait, no. Let me think. The reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which I think is a base. So perhaps it's an epoxide ring-opening under basic conditions. Wait, but wait, noâ€”epoxide ring-opening would typically require acid or base. If X is an epoxide, then treating with a base might cause it to open. But then the product would have a diol or an elimination product.

Alternatively, maybe X is a diol, and the base is causing an elimination to form an epoxide. Wait, but that's less common. Or perhaps X is a different compound, and the reaction is forming an epoxide.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. Let's look at that.

The product's 1H-N
