Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. We're supposed to find the maximum speed, v_max, in terms of c, the speed of light.

Wait, so I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is converted into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. The formula for maximum speed in the classical case is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things are different. Relativistic effects must come into play here.

In relativity, when velocities approach the speed of light, the mass increases due to the Lorentz factor. So the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv², but the relativistic version, which is (gamma - 1)mc². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the setup is that the total energy of the oscillator comes from the potential energy. In the classical case, it's (1/2)kA², but in relativity, I think the potential energy is still (1/2)kA² because Hooke's law is F = -kx, which is a non-relativistic expression. But wait, maybe in the relativistic scenario, the potential energy expression changes. Hmm, I'm not sure, but let's proceed.

So the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy plus the kinetic energy. Wait, no. Wait, in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and at x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². When the oscillator is at the equilibrium (x=0), all that energy is converted into kinetic energy. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So equating the two:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1)mc².

Wait, but is this correct? Because the potential energy in the relativistic oscillator might not be the same as in the classical case. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. Hooke's law is given as F = -kx, which is non-relativistic, but the motion is relativistic. So perhaps the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², same as before.

So substituting gamma, we have:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me rearrange this equation.

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, 1/gamma² = [gamma/(gamma^2)] = 1/(gamma^2).

Wait, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So 1/gamma² is (1 - v²/c²).

So let's write that:

1/(gamma)^2 = (1 - (v^2/c^2)).

But from gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²), let's write this as:

gamma = [ (2 m c²) + k A² ] / (2 m c² )

Wait, let me compute (gamma)^2:

gamma^2 = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^2.

So 1/(gamma^2) = 1 / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 ].

But 1/(gamma^2) is also equal to 1 - (v^2/c^2).

So,

1 - (v²/c²) = 1 / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 ]

Hmm, let me rearrange that:

v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 ]

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 ] )

Wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Let me look at the options.

Option D says v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² )

That's exactly what I derived. So option D would seem to be the correct one.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the setup. Suppose I set the total energy E to be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. No, because in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², which is the total mechanical energy. So in relativity, the kinetic energy is E_kinetic = (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2)k A².

Yes, that's correct. So the setup is correct.

Another approach: perhaps using the relativistic equation of motion. The equation for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is more complex, but maybe we can derive it using momentum and energy.

In the relativistic case, momentum p is gamma m v. The force F is -k x. So F = d p/dt. Hmm, but differentiating p in terms of x might get tricky. Alternatively, perhaps using the virial theorem or energy conservation is easier.

Wait, another thought: the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So (1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²)]^2.

Then,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²)]^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 ].

So,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 ]).

Which matches option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking back, option D says: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Yes, that's correct.

Now, let me check the other options to see if any others match.

Option A: has 1 - kA²/(2m) in the denominator. But in our case, it's (2 m c²) in the denominator. So A is incorrect.

Option B: denominator is 1 - (kA²)/(2 m c^2), but our expression has 1 + in the denominator. So B looks wrong.

Option C is the classical non-relativistic case, which would be correct only if velocities are much less than c, but the question is relativistic, so C is out.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we use relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy, with the potential energy at maximum displacement \( x = A \) given by \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium point (\( x = 0 \)), all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. 

The relativistic kinetic energy is expressed as:

\[
E_{\text{kinetic}} = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the potential energy to the kinetic energy:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we substitute:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Finally, solving for \( v_{\text{max}} \):

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it uses \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m} \) in the denominator, which is dimensionally inconsistent.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it uses \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \) in the denominator, which does not match the derived expression.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it represents the classical non-relativistic case, which is not applicable here.
- **Option D**: Correct, as it matches the derived expression exactly.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
