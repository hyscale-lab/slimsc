Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian here: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Hmm, I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine whether the theory is renormalizable. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian has to have a mass dimension of 4 because the action is dimensionless. So each term's dimension must be 4.

Let me write down the components. The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. So, I can compute the mass dimension for each part.

The fields involved are ψ (a spinor), ψ̄ (another spinor), and F^{μν}, which is the field strength tensor for a gauge field. Let me recall the mass dimensions for these fields.

The Dirac spinor ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because I remember that in 4 dimensions, the spinor field has this dimension because the Lagrangian term i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ has to be dimension 4. So, ψ has [ψ]_M = 3/2, so ψ̄ also has 3/2.

Now, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is a field tensor, which is a derivative of the gauge field. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1 because the covariant derivative is ∂ + i e A, and ∂ has dimension 1. So A has [A] = 1. The field strength F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so its dimension is 2, because each derivative is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1. So [F]_M = 2.

Next, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Since γ matrices are dimensionless, σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So [σ]_M = 0.

Now, let's compute the dimensions of each part in the term:

κ is what we're trying to find. Let me compute the dimensions of ψ̄ σ ψ F.

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, σ has 0, ψ has 3/2, and F has 2. So multiplying them: 3/2 * 0 (σ) * 3/2 * 2. Wait, but σ is a tensor made of γ matrices, which are dimensionless, so the product would be ψ̄ * σ (which is dimensionless) * ψ. So ψ̄ * ψ is (3/2 + 3/2) = 3. Then, multiplied by F^{μν} which is 2, so 3 + 2 =5? Wait, but the entire term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F has to have dimension 4 because it's part of the Lagrangian.

Wait, let me re-express this. The term is κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F^{μν}. Wait, but actually, the term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So the indices are contracted, but that shouldn't affect the mass dimension. So each part's dimension adds up.

Wait, no. The term is a product of ψ̄, σ, ψ, and F. Let's compute:

[ψ̄] = 3/2

[σ_{μν}] = 0 (since it's made of γ matrices, which are dim 0)

[ψ] = 3/2

[F^{μν}] = 2

So the product (ψ̄ σ ψ F) has dimension: 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5.

So the term κ (ψ̄ σ ψ F) has dimension [κ] + 5. But since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me recheck.

Wait, the term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So the dimensions would be [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F], because σ is dimensionless. So 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 =5. So the whole term without κ is dimension 5. The Lagrangian term is κ times that, so the dimension is [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That matches option A or C.

Now, the second part: is the theory
