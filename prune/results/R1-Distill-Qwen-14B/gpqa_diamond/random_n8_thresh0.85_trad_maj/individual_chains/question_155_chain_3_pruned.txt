Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll do my best.

First, the problem says that we have an operator P which has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a matrix. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The question is asking for the uncertainty ΔPz.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the variance. The formula for uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared for the given state.

Wait, but wait a second. The state is an eigenstate of Px, not Pz. So Pz isn't diagonal in this basis. Oh right, because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. Oh wait, wait. The problem statement says that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the given state is expressed in the Pz eigenbasis? Or is it in the eigenbasis of Px? Hmm, maybe I should read that again.

The problem states, "The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z." So the basis is in terms of Pz's eigenvectors, which means the state vector provided is already expressed in the eigenbasis of Pz. So when I apply Pz to this state, it will just give the eigenvalue multiplied by the state. But wait, no. Because if the state is an eigenstate of Px, then it's not necessarily an eigenstate of Pz. So the state is expressed in the Pz basis, which is a convenient basis because Pz is diagonal there. But the state itself is not an eigenstate of Pz. So I can't assume that.

So, to find the expectation values, I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩. Let's start by writing down the state vector ψ.

The state ψ is given as a column vector: [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]^T. Let me denote this as:

ψ = [ a; b; c ] where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

Wait, but wait. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the matrix Pz is diagonal in this basis. Looking at the given Pz matrix:

Pz is:
[ ħ     0      0   ]
[ 0     0      0   ]
[ 0     0   -ħ ]

So the diagonal entries correspond to the eigenvalues of Pz. The first basis vector (eigenstate) has eigenvalue ħ, the second has 0, and the third has -ħ.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me check the matrix again. The Pz matrix's first row is [ ħ, 0, 0 ], so the (1,1) element is ħ. Second row is [0,0,0], and third row is [0,0,-ħ]. So yes, the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ respectively.

So the state ψ is a linear combination of these basis vectors. So when I compute ⟨Pz⟩, I take the inner product of ψ with Pz acting on ψ.

So the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ would be ψ† Pz ψ. Similarly, ⟨Pz²⟩ would be ψ† Pz² ψ.

But since Pz is diagonal, Pz^2 is just the square of the diagonal elements. So Pz² would be:

[ ħ², 0, 0;
 0, 0, 0;
 0, 0, (ħ)^2 ]

Wait, no. Because the third diagonal element is -ħ, so when squared, it
