Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z for a system in a given state. The system is in an eigenstate of the operator P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is provided as a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The operators P_x, P_y, and P_z are given in matrix form, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty of an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩², where A is the operator. So in this case, I need to compute ΔP_z, which means I have to find ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

Wait, but wait. The system's state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So the state is not an eigenstate of P_z, which means that when we measure P_z, we won't get a single value but a range of possible outcomes, and the uncertainty will be the standard deviation of those outcomes.

Okay, so first things first, I need to express the state vector in terms of the eigenbasis of P_z. But wait, the basis vectors are already the eigenvectors of P_z, right? Because the question says, "the basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z." So that means the columns of the matrix for P_z are its eigenvectors, each corresponding to eigenvalues.

Wait, looking at the matrix for P_z:

It's a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0, 0, 0), third row (0, 0, -ħ). Hmm, so that's a diagonal matrix. So the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors, right? Because a diagonal matrix's columns are the eigenvectors if it's diagonal.

So the eigenstates of P_z are |1⟩ = (1, 0, 0), |2⟩ = (0,1,0), |3⟩ = (0,0,1). Their corresponding eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ respectively.

Wait, no. Wait, for a diagonal matrix, each diagonal element is the eigenvalue for the corresponding basis vector. So P_z |1⟩ = ħ |1⟩, P_z |2⟩ = 0 |2⟩, and P_z |3⟩ = -ħ |3⟩.

So the given state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Wait, but that's a vector in the eigenbasis of P_z, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenstates of P_z. So the components of |ψ⟩ are already in the eigenbasis of P_z. So I can write |ψ⟩ as a linear combination of |1⟩, |2⟩, and |3⟩.

So to compute the expectation values, I don't need to change the basis. Because the state is already expressed in the basis of P_z's eigenstates, which are the same as the computational basis here.

So, computing ⟨P_z⟩ is straightforward. It's the sum of each component multiplied by its corresponding eigenvalue.

Wait, let's think: the expectation value of P_z is ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩.

But since P_z is diagonal in this basis, this becomes the sum of each |a_i|² times the eigenvalue for each state.

Wait, more precisely, |ψ⟩ is a column vector (a, b, c), then ⟨ψ| is (a*, b*, c*). So when you multiply ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩, each diagonal element is multiplied by the corresponding a², b², c².

So in this case, the components of |ψ⟩ are a=-1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

So |a|² is (1/2)^2 = 1/
