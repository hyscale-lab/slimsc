Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic mechanics can be a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The options are about their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, the question is about the relative speed between them. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "relative speed and the total energy of the system." So, wait, the relative speed is the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame of reference. Because when dealing with relativity, you can't just subtract speeds like in classical mechanics.

So for the relative speed, I probably need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, wait, wait. Which astronaut's frame are we considering? Because the problem states that both are moving in the positive x-direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So if I want the speed of B as seen from A's frame, it's u' = (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/c²).

Wait, let me get this right. Let me define astronaut 1 as the one with mass 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 as mass 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So in the lab frame, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, no. Wait, are they moving in the same direction? The problem says "positive x-direction," so yes, same direction. So astronaut 1 is faster than astronaut 2.

So from the perspective of astronaut 1, what's the speed of astronaut 2? Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be (v2 - v1) / [1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)]. Wait, no: wait, the formula for u' is (u - U) / (1 - uU/c²), where U is the velocity of the frame relative to the lab. Wait, no, better
