Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about electron microscopes and gas molecules. Hmm, let me read through it again.

So Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. But even with that, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detects them. He found the mean free path of these gas molecules is λ1, considering the volume, pressure, and temperature of the sample compartment.

But when he starts the electron beam, something interesting happens. The mean free path changes to λ2, and it's not the same as λ1. The temperature is the same, which is important. So why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on?

Wait, mean free path (MFP) is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, it's all about how often they collide. The formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the collision diameter, and P is pressure. Or wait, maybe another formula. Oh right, another way to write it is λ = 1/(sqrt(2) * n * σ), where n is the number density and σ is the cross-section. But more commonly, it's expressed in terms of pressure. I think the formula is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as λ = (1.38e-23 * T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P). 

Wait, but in this case, the pressure is already set. So initially, he measures λ1. But when the electron beam is on, the mean free path changes to λ2. So what's changing? Well, the presence of the electron beam could affect the gas in the chamber. 

Electron microscopes emit a high-energy electron beam. These electrons can interact with the gas molecules. One possibility is that the electrons cause the gas molecules to ionize. Ionized particles (ions) have different behavior. Since they're charged, they might be more easily accelerated or influenced by the electric fields in the microscope, which could cause them to move more rapidly or be pumped away more effectively.

Wait, but how does that affect the mean free path? If the gas molecules become charged, they could be more likely to be removed from the system. For example, the vacuum pumps might be more effective at removing charged particles because they can be captured more easily. Or, perhaps the ionized molecules have different collision properties. Alternatively, if the gas particles are ionized, maybe their cross-sectional area for collisions changes, affecting the mean free path.

Alternatively, the electrons could cause the gas to heat up. But the question says the temperature remains the same, so that's not it. So another angle: if the gas is ionized, perhaps the effective pressure changes. Because the ionized gas can have different behavior in terms of how it interacts with the vacuum system.

Wait, but the pressure in the chamber is already at ultra-high vacuum. The presence of the electron beam might cause some of the gas molecules to be ionized, which could affect the number of collisions. For example, if the gas is mostly neutral, collisions are based on neutral-neutral interactions. But if some become ions, perhaps these ions have different interaction cross-sections with each other and with the chamber walls or the electron beam.

Alternatively, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might become charged, so they can be more effectively pumped out by the vacuum system. That could reduce the number density of the gas in the chamber, which in turn would increase the mean free path. Because mean free path is inversely proportional to number density (n), so if n decreases, λ increases.

Wait, that makes sense. So initially, without the electron beam, the gas is neutral. But when the beam is on, some gas molecules get ionized. These ions might be more easily captured by the vacuum pumps or the chamber walls, thus reducing the number of gas particles in the compartment. 

So the number density (n) would decrease. Since λ is inversely proportional to n, λ would increase. So λ2 would be greater than λ1. So λ2 > λ1.

But wait, the question says Mike found λ2 instead of λ1 when the beam is on. So if the pressure was the same as before, why would the mean free path change? Because the pressure is the same, but the presence of the electron beam affects the gas, perhaps causing it to ionize and change the number of effective collisions.

Wait, perhaps the pressure is the same, but the gas has different properties. For example, if the gas is ionized, its mean free path could change because the dominant interactions are different. Alternatively, the presence of the beam might cause additional scattering, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: The mean free path could also be affected by the presence of the electron beam due to electron scattering. When
