Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, the formation constant (K) relates the concentration of the complex to the concentrations of the individual ions. Oh right, the formula is K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Since the solution is stoichiometric, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. I think that means the initial concentration before any dissociation. Oh wait, but when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. So, the complex is in equilibrium with these ions.

Let me set this up. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. Then, the dissociation would release x amount of Ca²+ and x amount of EDTA^4- because the stoichiometry is 1:1. So, [Ca²+] = x and [EDTA^4-] = x. But wait, wait. Wait, the EDTA is probably in excess or something? Or maybe the problem assumes that the solution is such that EDTA is in excess, so that the change is negligible. Hmm, but in this case, the problem doesn't specify any excess EDTA. So I can't assume that.

Wait, but the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. Oh, that probably means that the amount of Ca and EDTA are just enough to form the complex, so no excess of either. So when the complex dissociates, the amount of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would both be x, and the complex would be 0.02 - x. But wait, considering that the complex is 0.02 M, and x is small compared to 0.02, maybe I can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Hmm, but K is 5e10, which is a very large number, so the complex is very stable. That suggests that the dissociation is minimal, so x would be very small compared to 0.02.

So, the K expression is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10. Let me plug in what I have.

So [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M. [Ca²+] is x, [EDTA^4-] is x. So K = 0.02 / (x^2) = 5e10.

Wait, solving for x: 0.02/(x²) =5e10 → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → x² = 2e-12 → x = sqrt(2e-12) → sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so 1.414e-6, which is approx 1.4e-6 M. Wait, but that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are A) 0.02, B)5e-3, C)6.3e-7, D)0.01. Hmm, none of them match that. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, wait. Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake. Let me double-check the equation. The formation constant K is given by K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but in the solution, the total EDTA comes from two sources: the free EDTA^4- (x) and the EDTA bound in the complex (0.02 - x). But wait, if the solution is not in excess EDTA, then the free EDTA is x, and the complex is 0.02 - x. So the total EDTA is (0.02 -x) + x = 0.02. Hmm, but earlier I considered that [EDTA^4-] is x, but that's correct because only the free EDTA is x.

Wait, but in the K expression, it's [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-], which are x each. So the equation is 0.02/(x^2) =5e10 → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → x^2=4e-13, because 0.02 is 2e-2, and 2e-2/(5e10) is (2/(5e12)) → 4e-13? Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly.

0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. So x^2=4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → Wait, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7 M. Oh, that's option C)6.3e-7 M.

Wait, wait, so x is 6.3e-7 M. So the concentration of calcium ions is x, that's 6.3e-7 M. So the answer would be option C.

So why did I get confused earlier? Oh, because I thought x would be about 1e-6, but I must have miscalculated. Let me recheck the steps.

K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

Assuming that [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x.

So, 5e10 = 0.02/(x^2) → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2/(5e10) = (2/5) *1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6, so 6.3e-7 is approximately 6.3 *1e-7, which is 6.3e-7.

So yes, x is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given:
- \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \)
- \([\text{Ca-EDTA}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\)
- The dissociation of the complex releases equal concentrations of \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\), denoted as \(x\).

Substituting into the equation:
\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):
\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
