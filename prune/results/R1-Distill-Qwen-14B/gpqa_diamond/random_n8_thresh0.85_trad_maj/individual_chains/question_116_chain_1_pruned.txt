Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's take it slow.

Alright, the question is about a series of reactions leading to compound D, which we need to identify from the given options. Let's go through each part carefully.

First, we have compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that NMR signals give information about the environment of the protons. The triplet usually means each of these protons is next to two equivalent protons. The quartet suggests each proton is adjacent to three equivalent protons.

Wait, 6H as a triplet. That must be two sets of three equivalent protons each. Because a triplet comes from coupling with two neighboring protons. Oh, like maybe two sets of methyl groups next to another group. And the quartet (4H) suggests each proton is next to three others. So, maybe this is a CH2 group next to a CH3 or something.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the 6H triplet is from two -CH2CH3 groups adjacent to another group. Because each CH3 would be a triplet if next to a CH2. No, wait, each CH3 would be a triplet if each is next to a CH2 that's split into a quartet. Wait, no. Let's think again. If you have a CH2CH3 group, the CH3 would be a triplet because the CH2 has two protons. So each of the CH3 protons is split into a triplet. And the CH2's protons would be a quartet because each is next to three CH3 protons.

Wait, but in the NMR, there's a triplet (so 6H) and a quartet (4H). So if the triplet is from two equivalent CH3 groups (each with 3H) next to a CH2 group, that makes sense. So maybe structure A is diethyl something. Like diethyl ether? No, wait, diethyl ether's structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. But wait, the NMR would show the OCH2CH3 groups. Each CH3 would be a triplet, right? Because each is next to a CH2. So each CH3 would be a triplet, and the CH2 would be a quartet because each is
