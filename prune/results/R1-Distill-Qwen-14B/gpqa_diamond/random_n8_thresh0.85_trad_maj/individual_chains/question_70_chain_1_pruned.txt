Okay, let's try to solve this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question is about a series of reactions, and we need to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups, which I remember are related to the shapes of molecules. I think C2 is a two-fold rotation axis, D4h is a dihedral group with a four-fold axis and horizontal mirrors, D∞h is infinite symmetry like in carbon dioxide or something with linear symmetry, and C2v is a two-fold rotation and vertical mirror.

Let me read the reactions again carefully.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe A is something that can react in an 8:1 ratio? Wait, 8 equivalents of B, which is a gas. So, perhaps A is a metal reacting with a halogen? Like maybe A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2). Because sodium reacts with chlorine gas to form NaCl. Wait, but 8 equivalents would mean 4 moles of Na for each mole of Cl2, since each Cl2 gives two Cl- ions. So 4 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But the question says 8 equivalents of B. So maybe the formula is A8B. Or perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is aluminum. Aluminum reacts with chlorine gas, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, the product C is bright red—could it be something like copper(II) sulfate? No, not sure. Wait, another possibility: maybe A is an element that forms a +1 ion, and B is a diatomic gas like Cl2. Because 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of B per mole of A. Wait, but if A is a metal with a +1 charge, and B is Cl2, which provides Cl- ions. So each A would combine with 8 Cl atoms? That seems high because typically, for example, Na would only need one Cl. Wait, maybe A is a transition metal that forms a complex. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another angle: the product E is extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous chemicals? Maybe something like sarin gas or other nerve agents, but that's probably not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps E is something like phosgene or another toxic gas. Or maybe something like chlorine trifluoride? Hmm.

Wait, looking at the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E. So, C is reacting with D, which is another gas. Also, C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is dissolved in water, it produces A and two acids. Since F is strong and G is weak, maybe F is HCl and G is another acid, like H2SO4? Or maybe F is a strong acid like H2SO4 and G is a weaker one?

Wait, but when a salt reacts with water to produce acids, it's usually a hydrolysis reaction. So if C is a salt that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids, perhaps C is a metal chloride or something else. Wait, but it also produces A. So in the hydrolysis, C + H2O → A + F + G.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. A solid (A) reacts with gas B (8 equivalents) to form C. Let's think of the reaction as A + 8 B → C. So perhaps A is a metal, B is a diatomic gas like Cl2. So for example, 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. But that's 3 equivalents of Cl2 per 2 Al. But here, it's 8 equivalents of B. So if A is something that requires 8 Cl atoms per molecule. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: If A is sodium (Na), and B is Cl2 gas, then the reaction would be 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. That's 1 mole of Cl2 per 2 moles of Na, so 1 equivalent. But in our case, it's 8 equivalents of B. So maybe the formula is Na8Cl8? Or perhaps the reaction is more complex. Alternatively, maybe A is a transition metal that forms a complex ion.

Wait, but let's think about the product C. When C reacts with D (gas) in a 2:1 ratio, it produces E. Also, when C reacts with water, it gives A back plus two acids. Wait, perhaps C is a metal chloride, and when it reacts with another gas, maybe D is a diatomic gas like F2. Or perhaps D is something else.

Wait, the third reaction: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So, C is probably an anhydride or a salt. Let's think: if C is a metal chloride, then when it reacts with water, it would produce the corresponding hydroxide and HCl. But in our case, it produces F and G, which are two different acids. So maybe C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, gives two different acids. For example, perhaps C is a salt like sodium sulfite, which when hydrolyzed gives sodium hydroxide, sulfurous acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a salt like Na2SO3 (sodium sulfite), then upon hydrolysis, it might produce NaOH, H2SO3 (which is a weak acid), and perhaps something else. Wait, but in the reaction, it's C + H2O → A + F + G. So A is the metal, so perhaps it's Na. Then F and G are acids. So if C is Na2SO3, hydrolysis would produce 2 NaOH (but that's a base, not an acid). Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So B and D react to form H, a solvent. What solvents are formed from such reactions? Maybe H is something like H2O, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, H could be something like CH2Cl2, but I don't know. Or maybe H is HCl, but that's a gas. Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2, so they react to form HCl (but that would require H2 and Cl2 reacting upon light to form HCl, which isn't a solvent, I think). Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2 to form H2O. But I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, if B is Cl2 and D is H2, then H would be HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another thought: if B is Cl2 and D is NH3. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH2Cl (which is chloramine), but I'm not sure if that's a solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps H is H2O, but that would require B and D to form H2O. So maybe B is O2 and D is H2. But then that's the formation of H2O via combustion, but that's not a solvent per se. Wait, but H2O is a solvent, so maybe that's the case.

Wait, but let me think about the other reactions. Let me try to piece together the compounds.

In the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G.

If A is a metal, say Na, and F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So for example, if C is Na2CO3 (sodium carbonate), then upon hydrolysis, it would produce NaOH (which is a strong base, not acid), so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if C is Na2SO4, then hydrolysis would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and NaOH, but that's a base again. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite salt. Let's say C is Na2SO3. Then, when it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into 2 NaOH (so A would be Na?), but that's a base. But F and G are acids, so perhaps it's not that.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate salt. For instance, if C is Ca(NO3)2, then hydrolysis would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and Ca(OH)2, but again, that's a base, not an acid.

Wait, maybe C is a chloride of a metal that, when hydrolyzed, produces HCl (strong acid) and another acid. For example, if C is NaClO (sodium hypochlorite), then hydrolysis would produce NaOH (base) and HOCl (weak acid). Hmm, but that gives one acid and one base. Not matching F and G as both acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something like Na2S. Hydrolysis would give NaOH (strong base) and H2S (weak acid), but again, one base and one acid, which may not fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate of a metal that, when hydrolyzed, produces two acids. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate, but that also tends to produce base and CO2, which is a weak acid. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps C is a different kind of salt. Maybe it's a metal oxide. Let's say C is a metal oxide, like CaO. When CaO reacts with water, it produces Ca(OH)2, which is a base, but that doesn't produce two acids. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed salt. For example, something that upon hydrolysis gives two different acids. Wait, could it be something like a sulfite and something else?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitrate. Let's say C is Al(NO3)3. When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze into Al(OH)3 and HNO3. So F would be HNO3 (strong acid), and G would be another acid if there's another component. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product E is produced when C reacts with gas D in a 2:1 ratio. So C + 2 D → E. Also, E is extremely hazardous. Hmm, maybe E is something like HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous in small amounts. Or perhaps E is something like phosgene (COCl2), which is highly toxic. Or maybe it's a nerve agent, but I'm not sure about the reactions.

Wait, let's think about the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E. So the stoichiometry is C + 2 D → E. If D is a diatomic gas, like F2, then perhaps E is CF2 or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but let me try to figure out what C is. Let's go back to the first reaction. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C. If B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. So the formula of C would be ACl8. What elements have +1 charges and form such compounds? For example, CaCl2 is Ca^2+ and Cl^- each. So if A is a +2 ion, 8 Cl^- would give 4 A per Cl2 molecule. Hmm, but 8 Cl2 would give 16 Cl^-, so the formula would be ACl8. Wait, but that's a bit unusual. Alternatively, perhaps A is a +3 ion, and the formula would be ACl8? No, perhaps not. Wait, maybe A is something else.

Wait, another thought: if A is O (oxygen), but that's a gas. Not a solid. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a +2 ion. Let's say A is Ca. Then 8 equivalents of Cl2 would mean 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of Ca. So Ca + 8 Cl2 → CaCl8? But calcium typically forms CaCl2. So that's probably not it.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this from the wrong angle. Let's try to think of the possible structures.

Another approach: the product E is extremely hazardous. So what are some extremely hazardous chemicals? Phosgene (O=CCl2) is highly toxic. Mustard gas is another, but I'm not sure about the reactions. Or perhaps sarin gas, but that's an organophosphate. Alternatively, something like hydrogen cyanide is highly toxic, but that's a different structure.

Wait, if E is phosgene, then it's O=CCl2. Let's see: to make phosgene, maybe from CO2 and Cl2 in the presence of a catalyst. But I'm not sure if that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps E is ClF3, which is a highly reactive and dangerous gas. How would that form? Maybe from Cl2 and F2, but that's a direct reaction. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the reaction C + 2D → E. If D is F2, then E could be ClF3 if C is ClF. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is Cl2O and D is F2, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2, and E is HCl, but that's not extremely hazardous in the same way.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options for the symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

D∞h suggests a linear molecule with a center of inversion and multiple symmetry axes, like CO2 or HCN. D4h would have a four-fold axis and other symmetry elements, like square planar or octahedral molecules. C2 is a two-fold rotation. C2v has a two-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's likely a linear molecule with a center of symmetry, like O=C=S (thiocyanate) or something similar.

Wait, if E is phosgene (O=CCl2), what's its molecular structure? Phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. The molecule is linear, with the central carbon double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So its structure is O=C(Cl)2, which is linear. The symmetry group for a linear molecule with a center of inversion is D∞h. Because it has a principal axis (C∞), a center of inversion (i), and horizontal mirror planes (each containing the principal axis and a pair of Cl atoms), leading to D∞h symmetry.

So if E has D∞h symmetry, the correct answer would be option C) D∞h.

Wait, but let's go back to the reaction steps to see if this fits.

If E is phosgene (O=CCl2), then what would C and D be?

Phosgene is produced by the reaction of CO with Cl2 under certain conditions. Wait, but according to the reactions, C is reacting with D (gas) in a 2:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps C is ClCOCl (phosgene itself?), but that's the product. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something else. Let's think again.

Another possibility: E is ClF3. ClF3 is a trigonal pyramidal molecule. Its symmetry group is C3v, so that doesn't match the options. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another extremely dangerous chemical: sarin gas. Its structure is (OP)(OCH2CH3)3. But that's a more complex structure, probably not linear, so symmetry group would be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), which is linear. HCN has a structure of H-C≡N, which is linear. Its symmetry group is D∞h because it's linear with a center of inversion.

So if E is HCN, then what about the reactions?

Let's piece it together.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C. If E is HCN, then perhaps C is HCN, but that doesn't fit because C reacts with D to form E. Wait, no, the second reaction is C + 2 D → E.

Wait, if E is HCN, then perhaps C is NH3 and D is HCN? No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene as before. Let's think:

First reaction: A + 8 B → C. If B is Cl2 and A is something that combines with 8 Cl atoms, perhaps A is something like CH4 reacting with Cl2 in a substitution reaction. CH4 + 8 Cl2 → C (maybe CCl4? But that's a 1:1 ratio, not 8 equivalents). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a complex with Cl. For example, Na reacts with Cl2 to form NaCl, but that's 1:1. To get 8 Cl per A, maybe A is something with a higher valency, like Fe, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps A is sulfur (S), and B is oxygen (O2). Then, 8 equivalents of O2 would react with S to form SO4^2- or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal hydride. For example, LiAlH4 reacts with something to form a product, but I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think about the third reaction again.

C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

So, if C is a salt that upon hydrolysis produces a metal (A), a strong acid (F), and a weak acid (G), what could C be?

Wait, perhaps C is a metal nitrate. Let's say C is Al(NO3)3. When it hydrolyzes, it could produce Al(OH)3 (which is a weak base) and HNO3 (strong acid). But that would leave us with two products: Al(OH)3 and HNO3. But the reaction as per the problem produces A (Al?), F (HNO3, strong acid), and G (another acid). So where does the other acid come from?

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate salt. For example, if C is Na2SO4, hydrolysis would produce NaOH (strong base) and H2SO4 (strong acid). But that gives a base and an acid, but the problem states F and G are both acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonate. Let's say C is Na2CO3. Upon hydrolysis, it would produce NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (weak acid, since it's a gas but in solution forms H2CO3, which is a weak acid). So in this case, A would be Na, F would be NaOH (but that's a base, not an acid), which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Hydrolysis would give NaOH and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). So F would be NaOH (base) and G would be H2SO3 (acid), but again, one is base and one is acid, not both acids.

Wait, maybe C is a different salt. For example, if C is sodium hydrogen sulfate (NaHSO4), then hydrolysis would produce NaOH and H2SO4. But that's again a base and a strong acid.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate and another component. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt. Let's say C is a sodium salt of a diprotic acid. For example, if the acid is H2SO4, then the salt could be
