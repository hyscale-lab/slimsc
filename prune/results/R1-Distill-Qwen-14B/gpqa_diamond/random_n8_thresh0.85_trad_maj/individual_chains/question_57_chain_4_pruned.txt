Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, elastic scattering... right, that's when the particles don't lose any kinetic energy, so it's a collision where they just change direction, not speed. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, phase shifts and scattering amplitude... I remember from my studies that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using partial waves. Each partial wave is associated with a phase shift δ_l. The formula for f(θ) is a sum over all the angular momentum states, each contributing a term involving the phase shift δ_l.

The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} sinδ_l / (1 - e^{2iδ_l}) ) * ... wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh right, the general expression for the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^{∞} [ (2l + 1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) / (k * (1 - e^{2iδ_l}) ) ) * ( (sin δ_l) / (something) ) ]

Wait, maybe I should think differently. I remember that the scattering amplitude in the partial wave expansion is given by:

f(θ) = 4π/k² sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ sin(δ_l) / (1 - cos(δ_l)) ] * (Pl(cosθ))

Wait no, wait. Alternatively, the general expression involves e^{2iδ_l} in the numerator and denominator. Oh, right, here's the thing: each partial wave contributes a term:

(2l + 1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) e^{i l θ} / (k * (1 - e^{2iδ_l} )) )

Wait, no, probably the formula is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) / (1 - e^{2iδ_l}) ) ] * P_l(cosθ)

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the exact expression. Oh wait, I can't do that
