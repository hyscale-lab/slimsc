Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, I remember that [X/Y] notation represents the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of elements X and Y relative to the Sun. Right, so [X/Y] = log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) = log(n_X / n_Y) - (log_X/Y)_sun.

Wait, the problem says they use the EW method under LTE, so I guess that's about equivalent widths and local thermodynamic equilibrium, but maybe that's not super relevant here. The key is the given abundances.

Given data:

Star_1:
Mass = 1.5 solar masses
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
[Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

Star_2:
Mass = 1.2 solar masses
[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
[Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Sun's photosphere:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
Similarly, log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)
So, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, which is the base for the logarithmic scale.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. Wait, no, the question says the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. So I need to find (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) ?

Or maybe it's the ratio of their silicon to hydrogen? Wait, no, wait. The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, but how? Because each star's photosphere has its own composition. Wait, perhaps the ratio is [Si/Star_1 / Si/Star_2] in terms of number density. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question is, what's the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. So, n_Si1 / n_Si2.
