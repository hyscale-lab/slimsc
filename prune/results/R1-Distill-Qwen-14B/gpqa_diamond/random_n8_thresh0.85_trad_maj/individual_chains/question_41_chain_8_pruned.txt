Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving in a lab. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. I remember from my classes that the speed of light in a medium is related to the index of refraction, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, especially when the medium is moving.

The problem states that a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam, so the glass is moving towards the observer. Or is it the beam that's going towards the observer? Let me reread that. Oh, the glass is moving toward the observer in the lab, and the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass, which would mean the beam is moving towards the observer as well. Or wait, if the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, perhaps the beam's direction relative to the lab is a combination of the glass's motion and the light's motion inside the glass.

Wait, the light beam is in the glass, so its speed relative to the glass is c/n. But what about when the glass itself is moving? Hmm, I think this has to do with the addition of velocities, maybe using special relativity. Or perhaps it's non-relativistic, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1. So in the glass, the speed is 1/n. But when the glass is moving, does that affect the speed of the light as measured in the lab frame?

Oh right, this might involve the Doppler effect or velocity addition. The problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab, so maybe it's about how the velocity of the medium affects the observed speed.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light in a medium is independent of the motion of the medium. No, wait, isn't that only in the context of special relativity? Because in classical mechanics, adding velocities would be straightforward, but relativity changes things.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think in terms of frames. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light is moving at speed v_light = c/n (since in the glass, it's
