Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions when there's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The solution has 0.02 M of this complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to find the right answer.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. So when Ca²+ binds with EDTA, they form a complex. The formation constant, Kf, tells us how strong this complex is. A higher Kf means the complex is more stable. So in this case, the Kf is 5e10, which is pretty large, so the complex is tightly bound.

But the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Since the complex is formed, the free Ca²+ concentration should be really low because most of it is tied up in the complex.

The formula for the formation constant, as I recall, is Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]). Oh wait, but wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's call that [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M.

Assuming that the solution is at ideal pH, which probably means that EDTA is in its proper form (like fully deprotonated) so that it can effectively bind Ca²+. So, we don't have to worry about the protonation state of EDTA.

So, the equation is Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]). But wait, the problem states that the solution is stoichiometric. Does that mean that the molar amounts of Ca²+ and EDTA are equal? Or does it imply that the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio? Oh right, Ca-EDTA complexes are usually 1:1, so each Ca²+ binds one EDTA molecule. So the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1.

Assuming that, the total concentration of Ca and EDTA is the same as the complex concentration. Wait, no. Wait, if the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA, then the total concentration would be the sum of free Ca²+ and the complex. But in many problems, especially when Kf is very large, the free Ca²+ is negligible, so [CaEDTA] ≈ initial concentration of Ca²+.

But wait, in this problem, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, let's think. Let me denote [CaEDTA] as 0.02 M. Then, the total EDTA is [EDTA] = [EDTA_free] + [CaEDTA]. But if Kf is so large, then [EDTA_free] is very small compared to [CaEDTA]. So, [EDTA] ≈ [CaEDTA], which is 0.02 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The EDTA can come from either the complex or the free EDTA. So, in the solution, the total EDTA is [EDTA] = [EDTA_free] + [CaEDTA]. Similarly, the total Ca is [Ca_total] = [Ca²+ free] + [CaEDTA].

But in this case, the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex, so the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M. Therefore, the total EDTA concentration is approximately 0.02 M, assuming that the free EDTA is negligible. Similarly, the total Ca is 0.02 M, assuming that [Ca²+] is much smaller.

So, in the equation Kf = [CaEDTA]/( [Ca²+][EDTA] )

But wait, [EDTA] is approximately equal to [CaED
