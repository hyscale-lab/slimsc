Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. From what I remember, when dibromides react with KOH, especially in a situation like this, it's probably an elimination reaction. Wait, wait, KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of an alkene. Oh, right, because two adjacent bromines would eliminate to form a double bond.

So, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH would cause the two bromine atoms to leave, but since they are on adjacent carbons, it would form an alkene. Admantine is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane probably has bromines on two bridged positions. Eliminating both bromides would form an allene or a conjugated diene? Wait, no, probably a double bond in the adamantane structure.

Wait, but the product after reaction with KOH is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Because elimination would form an alkene, but a carbonyl would suggest maybe an oxidation or some kind of ketone formation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann elimination, but that's for cyclic ketones. Wait, perhaps the reaction is different. Oh, wait, another possibility: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, sometimes it can form an epoxide, but that's not the case here because the product has a carbonyl.

Wait, let me think again. If you have a dihalide, like 1,3-dibromide, and you heat it with a base like KOH, the typical reaction is elimination to form an alkene. But in this case, the product has a carbonyl. So maybe the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't just a simple dihalide but part of an adamantane structure that upon elimination forms a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a different kind of elimination, maybe a more complex one.

Wait, perhaps it's about an elimination that leads to a carbonyl. Oh! Maybe it's a pinacol-like elimination. Wait, pinacol elimination usually involves vicinal diols losing water to form a carbonyl. But here, it's a dihalide. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a double elimination leading to the formation of a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is not an alkene but a diketone. Wait, but how? Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on adjacent carbons in the structure. When heated with KOH, perhaps in a double elimination, each Br leaves, and the two adjacent carbons form double bonds. Wait, but that would give an alkene, not a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, unless the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but that's still not a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but something else. Another possibility is that KOH is acting as a base and causing a substitution reaction, but substitution of two bromides in one molecule? That would be a double substitution, which would give perhaps a dialkoxide, which on acid workup would give a diol. But the IR peak is at 1720, which is a carbonyl, so a diol wouldn't have that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more like a peroxide formation, but that doesn't fit either.

Wait, maybe it's a Hoffman elimination, but that's for amides. Hmm. Alternatively, could it be a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism? I'm not sure. Maybe another approach.

Looking at the NMR data of product 1: the 1H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a triplet. Then 2.41-2.23 (10H), which is a multiplet probably from the adamantane structure, and 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR peak is at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl (likely a ketone or ester). So product 1 probably has a ketone group.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a pinacol-like elimination, but for a dihalide. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes an elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, but under what conditions? Maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation, but how?

Alternatively, wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which could be a bridged dihalide. When treated with KOH, perhaps each bromide leaves, and the two adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. Hmm, but that would require each carbon losing a bromide and the formation of a double bond, but that doesn't immediately lead to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of a double elimination, where each Br leaves, but the two carbons each form a bond to an oxygen, leading to a ketone. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, and perhaps the mechanism forms an epoxide or something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the compound is being dehydrohalogenated twice, forming a conjugated diene, but that wouldn't give a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates, leading to a carbanion, which then eliminates.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond, with multiple bridgehead carbons. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two bridgehead carbons. When heated with KOH, perhaps each bromide leaves, and the structure rearranges to form a carbonyl group. But how?

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to a bridgehead double bond, but that's not possible due to Bredt's rule. So maybe instead, the two bridgehead carbons each form a bond to oxygen, leading to a ketone.

Wait, but bridgehead carbonyls are possible in some structures. For example, norbornene can form endo and exo ketones upon certain reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ketone. So, when the two bromines on the bridgehead positions are eliminated as Br
