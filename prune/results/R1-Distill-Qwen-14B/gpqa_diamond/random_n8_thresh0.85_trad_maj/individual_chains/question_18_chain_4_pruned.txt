Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stellar abundances. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

Alright, we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. Using LTE and the EW method, their elemental abundances are given. The values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. The task is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, n_Si1 / n_Si2? Or is it the other way around? Well, the ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, I think. Because the options are given, so I'll have to compute that.

The given solar photospheric composition is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5, which means log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5, so nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7, so log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5, so nMg/nH =10^(-5).

Wait, let me think about the notation. The [X/Y] notation is log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So [Fe/H] is log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means log10(nFe1/nH1) - (-4.5) = 0. So log10(nFe1/nH1) = -4.5. So nFe1/nH1 = 10^(-4.5).

Same for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So log10(nMg2/nH2) = log10(nMg_sun/nH_sun) = -5. So nMg2/nH2 = 10^(-5).

Now, the [X/Y] values: [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log10(nSi/nFe) - log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3. Wait, no. Wait, [X/Y] is log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 is log10(nSi1/nFe1) - log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3.

Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. So log10(nMg2/nSi2) - log10(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) =0.3.

I think I need to calculate nSi1 and nSi
