Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativity. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the problem again.

Two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I should tackle the relative speed part. I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities like in classical mechanics. You have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, what's the formula again? Oh right, the formula for the relative velocity u' is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). But wait, wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think. If one object is moving at speed u relative to another moving at speed v, then the relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c^2)), right? But wait, let me make sure. Because velocity is a vector, so the direction matters. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, but adjusted for relativity.

So in this case, the first astronaut (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c, and the second (3m) at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So the relative speed of the second astronaut as seen by the first would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me calculate that.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me make sure I get the order right. If the first astronaut is moving at u=0.6c, and the second at v=0.5c, and we're finding the relative speed of the second as seen by the first, then u is the speed of the first, and v is the speed of the second. So the relative speed would be (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)). Oh wait, no! Because if the first is moving at u relative to the lab frame, and the second at v, then from the
