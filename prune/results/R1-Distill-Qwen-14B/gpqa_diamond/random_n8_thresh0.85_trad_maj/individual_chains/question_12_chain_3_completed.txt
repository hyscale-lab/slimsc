Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let's see. The problem states that a Pi(+) particle at rest decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of MeV values.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very small (almost zero) rest mass. But in this case, since the Pi is at rest, energy and momentum must be conserved. Oh right, because the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum of the products must be zero. So the two particles must go in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. But wait, the neutrino is a lepton, so it's treated as massless in some approximations. Hmm, but the muon has a mass, so maybe I have to consider both.

Let me think. The decay is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. So, the initial energy is the rest mass of Pi+, which is 139.6 MeV. The energy of each product will be their rest mass plus kinetic energy. But since the Pi is at rest, the total energy is conserved, so the sum of the energies of mu+ and nu must equal the rest mass of Pi+.

Wait, but the neutrino's rest mass is negligible. So I can approximate its energy as equal to its momentum because for a massless particle, E = pc. The muon, on the other hand, has rest mass, so its energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). But since the momentum vectors are opposite, their magnitudes are equal. Let's denote the momentum magnitude as p. So for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p²c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ). For the neutrino, E_nu = p c.

The total energy is E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c^2. Let me write that equation:

sqrt( p²c^4 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6

Wait, units are in MeV, so I can ignore the c factors because everything is in units where c=1, I think. So the equation simplifies to:

sqrt( p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6

I need to solve for p. Let's denote m_mu as 105.7 MeV, m_pi as 139.6 MeV.

So sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi.

Let me rearrange. Let’s subtract p from both sides:

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = m_pi - p.

Now square both sides:

p² + m_mu² = (m_pi - p)^2.

Expand the right side: m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides:

m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p.

Rearranging:

2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu².

So p = ( m_pi² - m_mu² ) / ( 2 m_pi )

Let me compute that.

Compute m_pi squared: (139.6)^2. 139.6 * 139.6. Let's see, 140^2 is 19600. So 139.6 is 140 - 0.4. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

m_mu squared: (105.7)^2. 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49. 105.7^2 is (100 +5.7)^2 = 100² + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7² = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So m_pi squared minus m_mu squared is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Divided by (2 * m_pi) which is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me compute that.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2. Let me see, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8, because 279.2 *30=8376, which is a bit higher. 8096.8 is 29 times. So 29 *279.2 = 8096.8. The difference is 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87. So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783. So about 29.783. Wait, so p ≈ 29.783 MeV/c? Hmm.

Wait, but let me do it more accurately. 279.2 * x = 8315.67.

Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8. 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87. 218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.783. So p ≈ 29.783 MeV/c.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Now, the energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Calculate each term:

29.78^2 ≈ 886.7

105.7^2 = 11172.49.

Sum: 886.7 + 11172.49 = 12059.19.

Square root of 12059.19 is approx sqrt(12059) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, 109.81² is about 12060, yes. So E_mu ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Energy of neutrino is E_nu = p c ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but the initial energy was 139.6 MeV. Let me check: 109.81 + 29.78 = 139.59 MeV, which is close to 139.6, so that's correct.

Now, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy. So for the muon, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 ≈ 4.11 MeV.

For the neutrino, KE_nu = E_nu - m_nu. But neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so KE_nu ≈ E_nu ≈29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's the pair.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That matches.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 and 29.8 MeV. So the answer should be option D.


To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

we use conservation of energy and momentum. The initial energy of the stationary \(\pi^+\) is its rest mass energy, \(E_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). The rest mass of the \(\mu^+\) is \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), and the neutrino's rest mass is negligible.

### Step 1: Conservation of Energy
The total energy of the products is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu} = E_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

For the \(\mu^+\), its energy is given by:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2},
\]
where \(p\) is the magnitude of the momentum of the \(\mu^+\). For the neutrino, since its rest mass is negligible, \(E_{\nu} \approx p\).

Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = 139.6.
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \(p\)
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = 139.6 - p,
\]
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2,
\]
\[
m_{\mu^+}^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p.
\]

Rearranging for \(p\):
\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 139.6^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2,
\]
\[
p = \frac{139.6^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(p\)
\[
139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad m_{\mu^+}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \(E_{\mu^+}\) and \(E_{\nu}\)
The energy of the \(\mu^+\) is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]
\[
29.78^2 = 886.7, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{886.7 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.19} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The energy of the neutrino is:
\[
E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Step 5: Compute Kinetic Energies
The kinetic energy of the \(\mu^+\) is:
\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately equal to its energy:
\[
KE_{\nu} \approx E_{\nu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Step 6: Match with Options
The closest match is **Option D**: \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\).

Answer: D
