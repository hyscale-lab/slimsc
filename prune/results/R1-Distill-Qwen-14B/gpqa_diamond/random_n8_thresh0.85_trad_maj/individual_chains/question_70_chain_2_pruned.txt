Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a series of chemical reactions, and I have to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. 

Hmm, I think I remember that molecular symmetry groups are determined by the symmetry elements present in the molecule. Common groups include things like C2, D4h, etc. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact details, so I need to think carefully.

Let me break down the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak).
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I need to figure out what the substances A, B, C, D, etc., are. Because once I know what E is, I can determine its molecular symmetry.

Starting with reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). H is a solvent, which could be something like water or maybe ethanol. But wait, D and B are gases. Hmm. Solvents that are gases? Probably not. Or wait, maybe H is an aqueous solution, but the product is a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps H is another liquid. Alternatively, D and B could be gases that react to form a liquid solvent. 

Let me think of possible pairs. Maybe B is CO2 and D is H2O? But D is a gas, so if D is H2O, it's a gas under standard conditions. Or wait, H2O is a liquid under standard conditions, but maybe in this context, they're considering it as a gas? Or perhaps another combination.

Alternatively, considering that D reacts with B to form H, a solvent. Another possibility is that B is H2O and D is something else. Wait, but B is a gas, so maybe B is H2O in gaseous form. But H2O is a liquid under standard conditions unless it's steam. Hmm. Let me think of another approach.

Looking at reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. The products are A (solid) and two acids. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, etc. Weak acids include CH3COOH, HNO2, etc.

So when C reacts with H2O, it forms A, F, and G. That suggests that C is some kind of salt. Because when salts react with water, they can form acids or bases. For example, if C is a nitrate salt, maybe. Let me think: if C is a nitrate, say, Ca(NO3)2, when it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Ca^2+ and NO3^- ions. But NO3^- isn't an acid. Alternatively, if C is something like ammonium nitrate, NH4NO3. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into NH4+ and NO3^-; NH4+ can hydrolyze into NH3 and H3O+, which would make HNO3 (a strong acid) and maybe another acid if there's something else. Wait, but in that case, maybe F is HNO3 and G is something else? Or perhaps C is a different salt.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a metal nitrate. For example, if A is a metal, say, copper, then C could be copper(II) nitrate. When copper(II) nitrate reacts with water, it dissociates into Cu^2+ and nitrate ions. But nitrate isn't an acid. Hmm, maybe C is a nitride? Or perhaps a different kind of compound.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. But when sulfides react with water, they typically produce H2S gas, which isn't an acid. Hmm. Maybe C is a sulfate salt, but that might not lead to acids.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a nitride salt. Like sodium nitride, Na3N. When Na3N reacts with water, it might produce NaOH and NH3. But NaOH is a base, not an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, thinking about the products F and G being acids, perhaps C is a carbonate. For example, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) reacts with water but doesn't dissolve much, unless it's a different carbonate. Wait, but in the presence of water, some carbonates can produce bicarbonate or other ions. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite or something else.

Wait, maybe I should consider C being a sulfide. But I'm not sure. Let's think about the reactions again.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). So A is a solid, B is a gas, 8 equivalents. So 8
