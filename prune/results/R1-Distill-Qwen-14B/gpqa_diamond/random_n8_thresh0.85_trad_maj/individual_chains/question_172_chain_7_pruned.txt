Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, when they say "excited," they're talking about the number of atoms in a particular energy state. So star_1 has more atoms in that higher energy level.

Wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, I remember that the distribution of particles in energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp(-(E_i - E_j)/(kT)). Since the energy difference is given, and we're comparing two energy levels, I'll need to use that.

So in this case, the excited state is higher in energy than the lower state. Let's say the specific energy level is level i, and the lower is j. So the ratio n_i,j = (n_i)/(n_j) = exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is E_i - E_j.

Wait, but the problem says the excited level in star_1 is twice as much as star_2. Oh, wait, maybe I should think about each star separately. For each star, the ratio of excited atoms to lower would depend on their temperature.

For star_1, the ratio of n1_i to n1_j is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). Similarly, for star_2, it's exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the question states that the excited level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, wait. Let me read again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2."

So, for the same energy level, star_1 has twice as many atoms in that level compared to star_2. Hmm, wait no, perhaps it's the ratio of the excited state to another state. Or maybe it's the relative population of the excited state in each star.

Wait, the exact wording: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the number of excited atoms in star_1's photosphere is twice that of star_2's. Or, is it the ratio of excited to non-excited? Or perhaps the ratio between the two stars is 2:1 for the same energy level.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the ratio of the populations for each star. So, for each star, the population of the specific level is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Let me clarify. Let me denote the excited level as E2 and the lower level as E1, with E2 > E1. The energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J.

For star_1, the ratio (n2/n1) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). Similarly, for star_2, (n2’/n1’) = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the problem says that in star_1, the excited atoms are twice as much as in star_2. Wait, no, it says the atoms are twice as excited in a specific level. So perhaps it's the ratio for each star relative to their own lower level. So, in star_1, n2_1 / n1_1 = 2 times (n2_2 / n1_2). Or perhaps not. Wait, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level." Hmm, maybe it's that for each, the ratio between the excited level and the lower level is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

Wait, no, maybe the absolute number is twice. But LTE implies that the ratio depends on temperature. Let's think about the ratios.

Wait, perhaps it's like this: the number of atoms in the specific energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But that might not be directly useful because the total number of atoms could vary. Alternatively, it's the ratio between the number of atoms in the excited state and the number in the lower state that's twice as high in star_1 as in star_2.

So for star_1: (n_i)/(n_j) = 2 * [(n_i)_2/(n_j)_2], where (n_i)_2 is for star_2. Because the ratio is twice as much in star_1.

Wait, but let me think. The problem says the excited level in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So, perhaps (n_i)_1 = 2 * (n_i)_2.

But that might not directly relate to the temperatures, unless we have the same number of atoms in each star. But since the question doesn't specify that, perhaps it's the ratio of the populations in the energy level relative to another level.

I think the correct approach is to consider the ratios for each star and set up the equation.

So, for star_1, the ratio is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2, the same ratio is (n_i')/(n_j') = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem states that the number in the excited state for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, no, the problem says the atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps it's the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me write this equation down.

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k T1) = -ln(2) + ΔE/(k T2)

Rearrange:

ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) = -ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T1) - 1/(T2) ) ] = - ln(2)

Hmm, plugging in the numbers might not be necessary because the options don't involve ΔE. So perhaps we can manipulate the equation to express in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, let me re-arrange the equation:

ΔE/(k) [ (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) ] = - ln(2)

So,

(ΔE)/(k) * (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) = - ln(2)

Hmm, that's one equation. But I don't know ΔE or k, and the options don't have ΔE, so perhaps I can just manipulate it symbolically.

Wait, the equation I have is:

ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) = - ln(2)

Factor ΔE/k:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ] = - ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ] = - ln(2)

Wait, but I don't think any of the options have ΔE, so maybe I can get a relation between T1 and T2.

Let me think. Let me define x = T1 and y = T2.

So:

ΔE/(k x) - ΔE/(k y) = - ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/x - 1/y) ] = - ln(2)

Which is:

ΔE/(k) [ (y - x)/(x y) ) ] = - ln(2)

So,

ΔE/(k) * (y - x) / (x y) ) = - ln(2)

Wait, but I'm not sure how to proceed without more information. Maybe I can rearrange for (y - x)/(x y).

Let me divide both sides by (ΔE/(k)):

(y - x)/(x y) = [ - ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

Wait, but the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38e-23 J is roughly k (Boltzmann constant) multiplied by 1 eV, perhaps? Wait, k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, yes! Because 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J, but k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, let's compute ΔE/(k). ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Ah! So that's a crucial point. So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So plugging back into our equation:

(y - x)/(x y) ) = [ - ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

Wait, no, because earlier, I had:

(y - x)/(x y) ) = [ - ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

But wait, let me substitute ΔE = k * 1 K (since ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k * 1 K).

So,

(y - x)/(x y) ) = [ - ln(2) * k ] / (k * 1 )

So the k's cancel out:

(y
