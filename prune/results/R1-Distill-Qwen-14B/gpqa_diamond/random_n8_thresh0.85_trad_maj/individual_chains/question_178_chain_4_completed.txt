Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about a Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of a coupling constant, and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember from my studies that renormalizability has to do with the dimensions of the coupling constants. Let me think this through step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κψσ_{μν}ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, those are the antisymmetric products of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, which in electromagnetism is ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. But wait, this isn't electromagnetism because the field here is probably something else, maybe non-Abelian, but maybe not. But that might not matter for the dimension calculation.

So the question is about the mass dimension of κ. To find that, I need to find the dimension of each term in the Lagrangian and set them equal because the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (where ħ = c = 1). Wait, no, actually, the Lagrangian density has dimensions of [Mass]^4 because when you integrate it over four dimensions (dx^4), you get a dimensionless action (since the action is in units of ħ, which is dimensionless).

Wait, no, wait. The Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4, because when you integrate it (which has units [Mass]^4) over four dimensions, which each have units [Mass}^{-1}, the integral becomes dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian, like κψσ_{μν}ψ F^{μν}, must have mass dimension 4.

Let me compute the dimensions of each part. Let's break down the product: κ * ψ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}.

First, what's the dimension of ψ (the Dirac spinor)? I remember that for a Dirac spinor in 4 dimensions, the dimension is [Mass]^{3/2}. Because the action is dimensionless, and the kinetic term is ψ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must have dimension 4. Each ψ contributes [Mass]^{3/2}, ∂_μ is [Mass], so (iγ ∂ ψ) has dimensions [Mass]^{3/2} * [Mass] * [Mass]^{3/2} } = [Mass]^4. So yes, ψ has dimension 3/2.

Next, σ_{μν} is made from [γ matrices], which are dimensionless (they are just matrices), so σ_{μν} is dimensionless. Because it's a commutator, which is like a product of γ matrices multiplied by i, but since γ matrices are dimensionless, σ_{μν} has dimension 0.

What about F^{μν}? F is the field strength. Let's see, in electromagnetism, F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. Each A is a gauge field. The gauge field A has dimension 1 because the term (1/4) F^2 is part of the Lagrangian, so each A has [A] = 1. So F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν, which is [Mass] * [A], so [F] = [Mass] * 1 = [Mass]^1.

Now, putting all terms together.

The term is κ * ψ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}.

Let's compute the dimensions:

[κ] * [ψ]^2 * [σ] * [F] = [κ] * (3/2)^2 * [σ]^0 * [F]^1.

So [κ] * (9/4) * [F] = 4.

Wait wait wait, no. Wait, the entire term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the product κ ψ σ ψ F must have dimension 4.

So [κ] * [ψ]^2 * [F] = 4.

Because [σ] is dimensionless, I can ignore it. So [κ] * (3/2)^2 * [F] = 4.

Wait, [F] is [Mass]^1. So substituting:

[κ] * ( (3/2)^2 ) * [Mass]^1 = [Mass]^4.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the term itself is part of the Lagrangian, which has dimension [Mass]^4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So [κ] * [ψ]^2 * [F] = [Mass]^4.

Because [σ] is dimensionless. So [κ] is [Mass]^a, [ψ] is [Mass]^{3/2}, [F] is [Mass]^1.

So substituting:

a + 2*(3/2) + 1 = 4.

Simplify:

a + 3 + 1 = 4 → a +4=4 → a=0.

Wait, that gives [κ] = [Mass]^0 → dimensionless.

But wait, that's not matching any of the answer options. The options are either -1 or 1 for [κ].

Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me check each component again.

Wait, is the field F^{μν} dimension [Mass]^1? Let me think again. The field strength F is defined as ∂A, and A has dimension 1. So F is [A] * [Mass], so [Mass]^1 * [Mass]^1? Wait wait, no. Wait, ∂ is [Mass], so ∂ A is [Mass] * [A]. So [F] = [Mass] * [A], and [A] is 1 → [F] = [Mass]^1.

So that part is okay.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the term structure. Let's look again at the Lagrangian. It's L = κ ψ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Wait, no, it's written as bar{psi} sigma psi F.

Wait, wait, bar{psi} is the adjoint spinor, which has the same dimension as psi: [bar{ψ}] = [ψ] = [Mass]^{3/2}.

So the term is bar{ψ} σ ψ F.

So the term is [bar{ψ}] [σ] [ψ] [F].

Which is (3/2) * 0 * (3/2) * 1 = (3/2 * 3/2) * 1 = (9/4) [Mass]^1.

So the entire product is [κ] times (9/4) [Mass]^1, and that must equal [Mass]^4 because the Lagrangian has dimension 4.

So [κ] * (9/4) [Mass]^1 = [Mass]^4 → [κ] = [Mass]^3 * (4/9) → [Mass]^3 ? But that's not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me do it again.

The term in the Lagrangian is κ bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each part:

bar{ψ}: [3/2]

σ_{μν}: dimensionless (0)

ψ: [3/2]

F^{μν}: [1]

So the product bar{ψ} σ ψ F has dimension: (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) +1 = 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 1 is 4. So the product bar{ψ} sigma psi F has dimension 4.

Wait wait, that's it! Because the entire term is κ multiplied by that product. So [κ] times [bar{ψ} sigma psi F] must be [Mass]^4.

But [bar{psi} sigma psi F] is 4. So [κ]* [4] = [4] → [κ] = 0. So [kappa] is dimensionless.

But the answer options don't have [kappa] as dimensionless. The options are [k] = -1 or 1.

So something's wrong here. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the field is not a gauge field. Wait, in the original problem, F is F^{mu nu}, but what's F in this context? Because the Lagrangian could be that of a different field, not necessarily a gauge field. Wait, but without knowing, I have to think generally.

Wait, perhaps F is the field strength of a different kind of field. Let me think: If F^{μν} is from a spin-2 field, like the gravitational field, but that's not likely. Or maybe it's a tensor field like in Yang-Mills theory.

Wait, but regardless, F^{mu nu} is antisymmetric and has two derivatives acting on the gauge field. So for a non-Abelian field, the gauge field A has [A] = 1, so [F] = [∂ A] = [Mass][A] = [Mass]^1.

So my previous calculation stands: [F] = [Mass]^1.

Wait, but the product bar{psi} sigma psi F has dimension 3/2 + 3/2 +1 = 4? Because bar{psi} is 3/2, sigma is 0, psi is 3/2, F is 1. So sum is 3/2 +3/2=3, plus 1 is 4. So the product is [Mass]^4.

So the term is κ times [Mass]^4, and the Lagrangian must have [Mass]^4. So [κ] must be [Mass]^0.

But that's not any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with F^{mu nu}'s dimension. Let me think about another way. The field strength F is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So each A is a field, let's say [A] is x. Then ∂ has dimension [Mass], so [F] is [Mass] * [A]. So if the Lagrangian term is (F^2), which is part of the kinetic term for a field, then the term (F^2) has to have dimension 4. So [F]^2 = 4 → [F] = 2. So [F] is [Mass]^2.

Wait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier.

Wait, the kinetic term for the gauge field is (1/4) F^2. So [F]^2 must be [Mass]^4, because the term (1/4) F^2 is part of the Lagrangian which has dimension 4. So [F]^2 = 4 → [F] = 2.

Wait, so this changes things. So [F] = [Mass]^2.

Oops, I think I made a mistake earlier. So the dimension of F^{mu nu} is [Mass]^2, not 1.

So let's recalculate.

The term in the Lagrangian is bar{ψ} sigma mu nu psi F^{mu nu}.

Breaking down the dimensions:

bar{psi}: 3/2

sigma: 0

psi: 3/2

F: 2

So the product has:

3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 +2=5.

So [bar{psi} sigma psi F] = [Mass]^5.

The term is multiplied by kappa, so:

[kappa] * [Mass]^5 = [Mass]^4.

So [kappa] = [Mass]^{-1}.

Ah, that makes sense. So [kappa] is -1 in mass dimension.

Wait, wait no, because [kappa] * [Mass]^5 = [Mass]^4 → [kappa] = [Mass]^{-1}.

So [kappa]_M is -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≤ d/2, where d is the spacetime dimension. Here, d=4, so d/2=2.

Wait, no, wait. The renormalizability condition is that the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥ 0. No, no, wait, that's not right. The theory is renormalizable if the coupling has dimension ≤ d - (sum of fields' dimensions in the term).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to remember that in 4 dimensions, a coupling is renormalizable if its dimension is ≥0.

Because the coupling's dimension is [Mass]^Δ. For renormalizability, Δ ≥0.

In this case, [kappa] is [Mass}^{-1}, which is Δ = -1. So Δ <0, which implies the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. The general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if its dimension is less than or equal to 4 (since that's the dimension of the Lagrangian). But coupling dimensions are considered in their own right.

Wait, no, another approach: when you have a term in the Lagrangian, the dimension of the coupling is given by [g] = 4 - (sum of fields' dimensions).

In this case, the term is L = κ ψ σ ψ F.

The sum of the fields' dimensions: [ψ] + [ψ] + [F] = (3/2) + (3/2) + (2) )= 3 +2=5.

So [κ] = 4 -5 = -1.

So [κ] is -1. Now, for the theory to be renormalizable, the coupling must have non-negative mass dimension, i.e., [g] ≥0. Because if [g] is negative, the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies (since g ~ energy^Δ, Δ negative → grows with energy), leading to a non-renormalizable theory.

So since [κ]=-1 <0, the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting it together: [kappa] is -1, and the theory isn't renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option C says [kappa]=-1 and theory not renormalizable.

Option A: [kappa]=-1, renormalizable → no.

Option C is correct.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think about renormalizability: the interaction term must have a dimension ≤4. Because each term in the Lagrangian is of dimension 4. But the coupling's dimension is [g] =4 - (sum of fields). So if [g] is positive, the term is renormalizable because the coupling can be absorbed into a counterterm of the same dimension. If [g] is negative, the term is non-renormalizable.

So for this term, [g] = -1, so it's non-renormalizable.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields and operators
1. **Dirac spinor $\psi$**: In 4 spacetime dimensions, the Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
2. **Adjoint spinor $\bar{\psi}$**: The adjoint spinor $\bar{\psi}$ has the same dimension as $\psi$, $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
3. **Field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$**: Assuming $F^{\mu\nu}$ is derived from a gauge field $A_\mu$, the gauge field has dimension $[A_\mu] = 1$. Since $F^{\mu\nu} \sim \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu$, $F^{\mu\nu}$ has dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.
4. **$\sigma_{\mu\nu}$**: This operator is constructed from the commutator of $\gamma$-matrices, which are dimensionless. Thus, $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension $4$ in 4 spacetime dimensions. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must therefore satisfy:

\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = 4.
\]

Substituting the dimensions of the fields:
\[
[\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]

Simplify:
\[
[\kappa] + 4 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = 0 - 4 = -1.
\]

Thus, the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$.

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions, i.e., $[\kappa] \geq 0$. Here, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. This implies that the interaction term becomes increasingly significant at higher energies, making the theory non-renormalizable.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
