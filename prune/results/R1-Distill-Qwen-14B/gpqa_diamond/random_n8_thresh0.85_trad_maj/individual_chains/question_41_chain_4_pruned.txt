Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see. The setup is that there's a glass with index of refraction n, and it's moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The observer is in the laboratory, so we're considering their frame of reference.

Wait, the question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. Oh right, because when media are moving, sometimes you have to consider relativistic effects, but I'm not too sure about that. Maybe it's a simple relative velocity problem.

The speed of light in the glass when it's at rest is c/n, right? Because in vacuum c is 1, so in glass it's 1/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, I remember something about Galilean relativity. If you have a medium moving at velocity v, the speed of light in that medium as observed from the lab would be the vector sum of the medium's velocity and the light's speed in the medium. But wait, that's only in non-relativistic cases. Because in reality, according to special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, that's in a vacuum. What about in a medium?

Oh wait, the problem says the light is propagating through the glass. So in that case, the medium (glass) is moving. Hmm, but is the speed of light in the glass as measured in the lab frame simply the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass?

Wait, that can't be right because if the glass is moving, the light's speed shouldn't just be additive. Because, I mean, according to special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly when you switch frames. But wait, the glass is a medium, not an inertial frame. Or is it? No, the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so in the lab frame, it's an inertial frame.

Wait, but the speed of light in the glass is c/n in the rest frame of the glass. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed? Because the medium is moving, but the light is emitted within that medium.

Alternatively, maybe this is a problem that can be approached using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because the light's speed in the glass is measured in the glass's rest frame, and we need to find it
