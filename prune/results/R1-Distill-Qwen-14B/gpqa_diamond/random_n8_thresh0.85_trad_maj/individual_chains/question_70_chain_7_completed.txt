Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by parsing the information given.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and from that, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. 

First, let me list out all the information provided:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. 
2. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm. Let me try to deduce what these substances could be. 

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. So, A is a solid, B is a gas, and C is a bright red solid. What reactions form bright red products? I remember that when metals react with certain gases, they form compounds. For example, sulfur trioxide (SO3) is a gas, but maybe something else. Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas like chlorine (Cl2). If A is a transition metal and B is Cl2, then the product could be a chloride. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction like aluminum with chlorine? Not sure.

Wait, the reaction with water gives back A and two acids. So C + H2O → A + F + G. F is strong, G is weak. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc. Weak acids include things like acetic acid, H3PO4 (but that's a bit in the middle). So when C reacts with water, it produces A and two acids. That suggests that C could be a salt that, upon hydrolysis, produces these acids. 

Wait, another angle. If C is a salt, say a metal chloride, then when it reacts with water, it would produce a metal hydroxide and HCl. But then F would be HCl (strong acid) and G would be something else. But wait, the problem says two different acids. Maybe C is a more complex salt. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate or sulfate?

Wait, let me think about the reaction between D and B. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. H is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. But D and B are gases reacting 1:1. So, possible reactions: for example, B is Cl2, D is H2. Then H would be HCl, which is a gas, but used as a solvent? Not sure. Alternatively, B is O2 and D is H2, forming H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense. 

Wait, H is a solvent. Water is a common solvent. So if B is O2 and D is H2, then H is H2O. So that's a possibility. Let me think, if B is O2 and D is H2, then their reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But the problem states a 1:1 ratio. So 1 mole D and 1 mole B form H. So if D is H2 and B is O2, the reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So the mole ratio is 2:1, which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is NH3? I don't know. Or maybe B is F2 and D is something else. Wait, but F is a strong acid when C reacts with water. Maybe F is HCl, so if D is NH3, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2S? Not sure. Let's think about other possibilities.

Wait, another angle. The reaction between C and D gives E. C is bright red. I'm trying to recall compounds that are bright red. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but maybe not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal chloride. Oh, wait! I think copper(II) chloride is blue, but maybe something else. Wait, maybe C is a dichromate? No, dichromate is orange. Hmm. What about something like mercury(II) chloride, which is red? I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride or another compound. Wait, another approach: let me think about the overall reactions.

Looking at reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is strong acid, G is weak. So, for example, if C is a nitride, say Na3N, reacting with water would give NaOH, NH3, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if C is a sulfide, like FeS, water wouldn't produce strong acids. Wait, maybe C is a sulfate? No, not sure.

Wait, considering the first reaction: A + 8 equivalents of B → C. So, perhaps A is a metal that reacts with 8 moles of B per mole of A. Let's see, metals reacting with diatomic gases. For example, aluminum reacts with Cl2 in a 2:3 ratio, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur, and B is oxygen, but sulfur reacts with O2 in a 1:1 ratio (S + O2 → SO2). Wait, but 8 equivalents would be 8 moles of B. So if A is 1 mole, B is 8 moles. Hmm. That would imply a formula like A B8. 

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is a metal like magnesium, but 8 equivalents of B, which is a diatomic gas. Suppose B is Cl2. Mg + Cl2 → MgCl2. The stoichiometry for Mg and Cl2 is 1 Mg : 1 Cl2 → 1 MgCl2. So 1 equivalent each. But the problem states 8 equivalents of B, so perhaps 8 Cl2 molecules per A. So A would have a formula that requires 8 Cl per A. Maybe A is Ca (calcium), but 8 Cl would give CaCl8? That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps A is a transition metal that can form an octachloride. Wait, maybe it's a metal like iron forming FeCl4, but that's not 8 Cl. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps A is a non-metal. Maybe A is carbon. But carbon reacting with 8 Cl2? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: thinking about the product E. E is produced when C reacts with D. Let's say E is a hazardous product. Maybe it's a highly toxic gas, like HCN or something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure of E. The molecular symmetry group options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. D4h and D∞h are higher symmetry groups, like those found in octahedral or linear molecules. C2 is a two-fold rotation, and C2v has a two-fold rotation plus a vertical mirror plane.

Wait, if E is a molecule with a linear structure, like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry. But wait, CO2 is a linear molecule, so yes.

Alternatively, if E is something like HCN, which is also linear, that would have D∞h symmetry. But I'm not sure what E is yet.

Wait, let's try to reconstruct the possible compounds.

From reaction 1: A reacts with 8 B to form C. Let's hypothesize that B is Cl2. So A + 8 Cl2 → C. What solid reacts with 8 Cl2 to form a red product? Perhaps a transition metal. Let me think about possible metal chlorides. For example, if A is titanium, then TiCl4 is a possible product, but that's only 4 Cl. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal in a higher oxidation state. Wait, maybe A is a metal like Fe, and when oxidized by Cl2, forms FeCl3? But that's not 8 Cl per Fe. Not matching.

Another thought: maybe B is O2. If A is carbon, then 8 O2 would form CO, but that's not bright red. Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur (S8) reacting with O2 to form SO3? But wait, S8 + O2 → SO3? The stoichiometry would be S8 + 8 O2 → 8 SO3. That fits 8 equivalents of B (O2). So A is S8 (solid), B is O2 (gas), reacting to form SO3 (gaseous?), but wait, product C is a bright red solid. Hmm, SO3 is a liquid or gas, not a solid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if A is Fe and B is O2, then Fe + O2 → Fe3O4. But Fe3O4 is black, not red. Alternatively, maybe it's an oxide of another metal. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it produces A and two acids, F and G. F is strong, G is weak. Suppose C is a nitride, like sodium nitride (NaN3), but that's a stretch. Or perhaps C is a sulfide, but then water would produce H2S, which is a weak acid, but then F would be another acid. Not sure.

Alternatively, what if C is a sulfate? No, but then the reaction with water... Maybe C is a carbonate? No, because that would produce CO3^2- which would hydrolyze to CO2 and OH-.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite? No, I'm not getting anywhere.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the reaction of C with D. C + 2 D → E. If E is a hazardous product, maybe it's a gas like HCl, but that's not likely because HCl isn't extremely hazardous in that way. Alternatively, maybe E is something like H2SO4, but that's a liquid. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like phosgene or something else.

Another thought: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Earlier, I thought H might be H2O, so D and B would be H2 and O2. Their reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But the mole ratio in the problem is 1:1. So if D is H2 and B is O2, the ratio is 2:1, which doesn't match. So perhaps another pair.

If H is another solvent, like ethanol (but that's a liquid, and D and B are gases). Alternatively, H is NH3, but that's a gas or a liquid. Wait, maybe H is something like CH3OH (methanol), but that requires D and B to be what?

Wait, maybe B is H2 and D is O2. Then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. But the reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So the ratio is 2:1. But the problem states 1:1. Hmm, that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps D is a different gas. Let me think: if B is Cl2 and D is H2, then H would be HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if B is F2 and D is H2, H would be HF, which is a liquid, but not a common solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is C (solid?), but D is a gas. So maybe not.

Wait, another possibility: D is CO2 and B is H2. Then their reaction could form H as H2O or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and B is something else. Wait, but D is a gas, B is a gas. So maybe their reaction forms something like NH4Cl, but that's a solid. Doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try another angle. Let's assume that C is a compound that upon reacting with water gives two acids.

Wait, another common reaction: when a salt of a strong acid and weak base is hydrolyzed, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Wait, for example, if C is a nitrate salt. Wait, perhaps C is (NH4)2Cr2O7. When it reacts with water, it decomposes into Cr(OH)3, NH4OH (which is weak), and H2CrO4 (which is strong). But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate of a weak base.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sodium dichromate or something similar. Let me think: Na2Cr2O7 + H2O → 2 NaOH + Cr2O3 + H2CrO4? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitrate. For example, if C is Al(NO3)3, then when it reacts with water, it would produce Al(OH)3 and HNO3. But HNO3 is a strong acid, which would be F, and Al(OH)3 is an amphoteric hydroxide, but not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. Let's say C is FeS. Then FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 (which is a weak base, not an acid) and H2S (weak acid). But in the problem, F and G are both acids, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + CO2 (which is a weak acid, but more of a gas). But again, not two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a phosphate. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, what about a sulfite? SO3^2- would hydrolyze to form HSO3^- and OH-.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. For example, NH4NO3. Wait, but that's not a nitride. Alternatively, Ca3N2. Ca3N2 + H2O → 3 Ca(OH)2 + 2 NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a bisulfate or something else. Not sure. Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way.

Let me consider the reactions again.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red solid)
Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (hazardous)
Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
Reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio)

If I can figure out what C is, that might help.

Let's try to think of a compound C that when reacted with water gives a metal (A), a strong acid, and a weak acid.

Wait, maybe C is a double salt. Like, for example, ammonium dichromate: (NH4)2Cr2O7. When this reacts with water, it decomposes into Cr(OH)3, H2CrO4, and NH4OH (which is a weak acid). H2CrO4 is a strong acid, and NH4OH is weak. So F would be H2CrO4, G would be NH4OH. But then, what would A be? Cr(OH)3 is a hydroxide, not a metal. Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfate, like Al2(SO4)3. When it reacts with water, it would just dissociate into Al^3+ and SO4^2- ions, but that doesn't produce a metal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal nitrate which upon hydrolysis produces the metal hydroxide and nitric acid (strong acid). But then where does the weak acid come from? Unless another component is present.

Another thought: perhaps C is a mixed salt, like NaNO3 and another component. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate. For example, Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't change much, but when reacted with acid, it produces CO2. So that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe C is a metal oxalate. Let's see: if C is CaC2O4, reacting with water would not necessarily produce acids. Unless it's decomposing, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfite. Na2SO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). But then you have NaOH and H2SO3, but the problem states that A is reformed. So A would be NaOH? That doesn't fit because NaOH is a hydroxide, not a metal.

Wait, maybe A is Na, B is O2, and C is NaO2? Hmm, sodium peroxide. Sodium peroxide is a solid, and it's yellowish, not bright red. So that might not fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, if A is Fe, B is O2, then Fe + O2 → FeO (but FeO is not bright red). Alternatively, Fe3O4 is black. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green. Not bright red. Chromium(VI) compounds are usually orange or yellow. Hmm.

Another approach: the product E is formed when C reacts with D. If E is a highly hazardous substance, maybe it's a nerve agent, but that's more of a stretch. Alternatively, maybe E is something like phosgene (but I'm not certain).

Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule. Let's think about symmetry groups. The options given are symmetry groups. Let's consider which E would have which symmetry.

If E is a diatomic molecule like O2, it has D∞h symmetry. But O2 is a gas, not a product of a reaction that would be extremely hazardous. Alternatively, if E is something like I2 (iodine), which is a solid, but that's not matching. If E is a linear triatomic molecule like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry. Wait, CO2 is linear, so it has D∞h symmetry. So if E is CO2, the symmetry would be D∞h (option C). But wait, CO2 isn't extremely hazardous. Maybe E is something else.

Wait, another possibility: if E is HCN, which is a linear molecule (H–C≡N), it has D∞h symmetry. HCN is a highly toxic gas, which fits the description of product E.

So putting it together: C reacts with D to form HCN. So what is C and D?

HCN is formed when, for example, cyanide ions react with protons. So perhaps D is H+ (but H+ is part of an acid, which is a gas? Not sure). Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O, but that's a liquid. Wait, but D is a gas. Hmm.

Wait, HCN can also be formed from the reaction of a cyanide salt with an acid. For example, KCN + H2SO4 → K2SO4 + HCN↑ + H2O. But in this case, H2SO4 is the acid (D perhaps is H2S?), but I'm not matching up.

Wait, but in the problem, C reacts with D to form E. So if E is HCN, then C could be a cyanide salt, and D could be H+ (from a strong acid). But D is a gas, so maybe H2 is involved. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O, but D is a gas. So maybe in this case, D is H2S? If E is HCN, then maybe D is HCN, but that's the product.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of C as a compound that when reacted with D (a gas) gives E, which is HCN. So C could be a cyanide salt, and D could be H2O (but that's a liquid). Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal cyanide, and D is HCl (but HCl is a gas). Then, C + HCl → HCN + metal chloride.

But then, in reaction 3, C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). If C is a metal cyanide, say NaCN, then NaCN + H2O → NaOH + HCN. HCN is a weak acid (so G), and NaOH is a strong base, but the problem says F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So that doesn't fit because here we're getting a base (NaOH) and an acid (HCN).

Wait, but perhaps C is a different cyanide. Like, if C is KCN, then KCN + H2O → KOH + HCN. Again, KOH is a strong base, not a strong acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track with E being HCN. Let's think of another compound. What about SO2? It's a gas, pungent, and dangerous. SO2 has a bent structure, so its symmetry group would be D2h or something else. Wait, the symmetry groups in the options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. Let me check the symmetry of SO2. SO2 is a bent molecule, with a C2v symmetry. So if E is SO2, its symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

But wait, how would E be SO2? Let's see. If C reacts with D to form SO2. Let's think about what C could be. If C is sulfite or sulfate.

Wait, another angle: in reaction 1, A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. If B is O2, perhaps A is S (sulfur), and 8 equivalents of O2 would form SO4^2-? Wait, but sulfur typically forms SO2 or SO3.

Wait, S8 (solid) + 8 O2 → 8 SO2. That would form SO2, which is a gas, but the problem says C is a bright red solid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is FeO(OH)·nH2O, but again, not matching.

Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if A is Fe, B is O2, then Fe + O2 → FeO (but FeO isn't bright red). Alternatively, Fe3O4 is black.

Another thought: perhaps C is a permanganate compound. KMnO4 is purple, but not bright red. Alternatively, MnO2 is brownish.

Hmm. This is getting too tangled. Let me try to think about the symmetry groups again.

The options are:

A) C2 – a two-fold rotation axis.
B) D4h – a dihedral group with a four-fold axis and horizontal mirrors.
C) D∞h – infinite symmetry, like CO2 or HCN (linear molecules).
D) C2v – a two-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane.

If E is a linear molecule, it would have D∞h symmetry. So if E is something like CO2 or HCN, the symmetry would be D∞h.

But what if E is a molecule with C2v symmetry? SO2 has a bent structure, so its symmetry is C2v. Let me think about E being SO2.

If E is SO2, then C + 2 D → SO2. Let's see, maybe C is a sulfite, and D is H2O, but D is a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfur oxide, and D is another gas. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure and C2v symmetry. O3 is a hazardous gas. So if E is O3, its symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

How would E be O3? Then C + 2 D → O3.

Wait, but how would that fit with other reactions? Let me think. If D is O2, then C + 2 O2 → O3. But O3 is formed from O2 in the presence of UV light or other initiators, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O, but D is a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe D is H2O in gaseous form, but that's not common. Alternatively, D could be another gas like F2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should just make an educated guess based on the options and which E is likely.

Another possibility: E is ClF3. ClF3 is a highly hazardous gas, but I'm not sure about its structure. ClF3 has a trigonal pyramidal structure, which would have a C3v symmetry, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, E could be O2, which has D∞h symmetry. But O2 is a diatomic molecule, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is SeO2, but I don't know its structure. Alternatively, think of E as a linear molecule.

Wait, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, such as O2 or HCN. O2 is a gas, but I'm not sure if it's extremely hazardous. Alternatively, HCN is highly toxic and a gas, but I'm not certain.

If E is HCN, its molecular symmetry is D∞h (option C). So if that's the case, the answer would be C.

But how do the other reactions fit?

If E is HCN, then C could be a cyanide salt, and D would be an acid (like H2SO4), but D is a gas. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O (but that's a liquid, not a gas). Alternatively, perhaps D is H2S, but I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to reaction 4: B and D react in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. If H is H2O, then B and D would be H2 and O2. Their reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So H can't be water in that case.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2, but the ratio is 1:1, so perhaps the reaction is O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. So for 1 mole of O2, 2 moles of H2 are needed. But the problem states a 1:1 ratio, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps B is O2 and D is another gas, like C (carbon monoxide?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is F2 and D is H2, forming HF (H is HF, which is a liquid, not a solvent). Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: B is Cl2 and D is NH3. Their reaction would be Cl2 + NH3 → NH2Cl (which is a solid), but that's not a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps D is CH4 and B is Cl2, but their reaction forms CH3Cl, which is not a solvent.

Wait, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2O (but D is a gas). Hmm.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the possible structure of E again. If the symmetry group is D4h, which is option B. D4h is the symmetry of square planar molecules or octahedral with certain features. Alternatively, maybe E has a tetrahedral structure, but that's more Td symmetry, which is not in the options.

Alternatively, if E is SO2, which has a bent structure and C2v symmetry (option D), that could fit. But earlier I thought E might be HCN with D∞h symmetry. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: looking up common extremely hazardous products. For example, phosgene (COCl2) is highly toxic, but I'm not sure about its structure. Phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, which has a planar structure with D∞h symmetry. So its symmetry group would be D∞h (option C).

But how would E be phosgene? C + 2 D → phosgene (O=C(Cl)2).

So C would need to have Cl atoms. Maybe C is something like POCl3. But then D would have to be Cl2, but not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a chlorinated compound and D is Cl2, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another idea: maybe C is CCl4. Then, reacting with something to form phosgene? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a thiocyanate (SCN-) compound. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the symmetry groups again. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a diatomic molecule, like O2, Cl2, etc., it would have D∞h symmetry. If E is a triatomic molecule, like H2O (which is not fitting because E is a product of C and D, which are solid and gas?), or SO2 (which is bent, so C2v).

But the question says E is extremely hazardous. SO2 is toxic but not extremely so. Phosgene is highly toxic and has D∞h symmetry. So if E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), its symmetry is D∞h. So the answer would be option B? Wait, no, D∞h is option C. Wait, the options say:

Options:
A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

So phosgene has D∞h symmetry, which is option C. So the answer would be C.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if E is HCN, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry, then the answer is C.

Wait, another thought: let's consider reaction 3 again. C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So if F is HCl (strong acid), and G is HCN (weak acid), then C must be a cyanide chloride. For example, if C is NaClCN, then reacting with water might produce NaOH, HCl, and HCN. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal salt that when hydrolyzed produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is NH4NO3, then it would decompose into NH4OH (weak acid) and HNO3 (strong acid). But then A would be something else.

Wait, if C is (NH4)2Cr2O7, then upon reaction with water, it might produce Cr(OH)3, H2CrO4 (strong acid), and NH4OH (weak acid). So F would be H2CrO4, G would be NH4OH. Then A would be Cr(OH)3, but that's not a metal; it's a hydroxide. Hmm.

But the problem states that A is a solid, which suggests it's a metal. So perhaps A is a metal, and C is its oxide or another compound.

Wait, maybe A is Fe, B is O2, so C is FeO(OH). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, A is Fe, B is Cl2, so C is FeCl3. FeCl3 reacts with water to form Fe(OH)3 and HCl. So F is HCl (strong acid), and G would be something else, but Fe(OH)3 is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the symmetry.

If E has D∞h symmetry, which is option C, then the answer would be C. I'll go with that.


The problem involves deducing the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. This suggests a reaction where A is likely a metal or non-metal, and B is a diatomic gas like O₂ or Cl₂. The product C is a bright red solid, which narrows it down to compounds like certain metal oxides or sulfates.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. This indicates that E is likely a toxic gas or compound. Examples include SO₂, HCN, or phosgene (COCl₂), which are hazardous and have distinct molecular structures.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A, producing two acids: F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This suggests that C is a salt that hydrolyzes to yield these acids. For example, if C is a nitrate or sulfate salt, it could produce a strong acid like HNO₃ or H₂SO₄ and a weak acid like NH₄OH.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This implies that H is likely a common solvent like water (H₂O), but the reaction ratio must be consistent with a 1:1 mole ratio between D and B.

### Analysis of E's Molecular Symmetry:
- The options for molecular symmetry groups are **C₂**, **D₄h**, **D∞h**, and **C₂v**.
- If E is a linear molecule like HCN or phosgene (COCl₂), it would have **D∞h** symmetry, which is characteristic of linear molecules with an infinite axis of symmetry.
- If E is a bent molecule like SO₂, it would have **C₂v** symmetry due to its bent structure and a vertical mirror plane.
- If E is a diatomic molecule like O₂, it would have **D∞h** symmetry, but O₂ is not extremely hazardous in the context of the problem.
- Phosgene (COCl₂), a highly toxic gas, has a planar structure with **D∞h** symmetry, making it a strong candidate for E.

### Conclusion:
Based on the reactions and the nature of E as an extremely hazardous product, E is most likely phosgene (COCl₂), which has **D∞h** symmetry. This matches option **C**.
