Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the structure of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. That means there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The FTIR shows an ester group. I remember that esters have a strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹, which is the carbonyl stretch. So, the molecule has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Wait, I thought aromatic rings with substituents often show symmetry which can reduce the number of signals. Let me think. The aromatic-H part has two signals. That suggests maybe two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps due to substitution patterns. Di-substituted benzene rings can be either ortho, meta, or para. If the substituents are the same, the ring's symmetry can reduce the number of signals.

Then there are two vinyl-H signals—vinyl as in double bond. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on a double bond, like in an alkene or maybe part of an ester group. Wait, ester groups have an adjacent CH3 and an oxygen. Oh wait, but maybe the vinyl is part of another group.

Also, two signals for –CH3 groups. No signals for –CH2 groups. So the molecule has at least two methyl groups, but no methylene groups. That suggests that any CH2 groups are either not present or perhaps are part of a structure that doesn't show up as separate signals, but that's unlikely.

Let me think about the structure. Since there's an ester group, maybe the compound is something like phenyl acetate or another similar ester. Wait, but phenyl acetate is a mono-substituted benzene, right? Because it's just one ester substituent.

Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with two ester groups? No, that would probably have more oxygen and maybe more carbons, but the formula options have O2, so maybe one ester group. So perhaps the other substituent is something else.

Wait, but the aromatic substitution is di, so two substituents. Let me think: one substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is maybe a vinyl group or another group that contributes to the NMR signals we see.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. If it's a di-substituted benzene, maybe one substituent is an ester (like OAc, acetate group) and the other substituent is something else, perhaps a vinyl group attached to the ring.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and another group that includes a double bond, leading to the vinyl protons. Hmm.

Let me picture the possible structure. Let's say the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (like OOCR), and the other is a vinyl group (like CH2CH2, but that might not make sense. Or maybe a substituent that has a double bond, such as CH2CH3 with a double bond elsewhere? Wait, no, the vinyl group is a double bond adjacent to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with an ester group and a vinyl group attached as substituents. For example, maybe one substituent is an ester (OAc) and the other is a propenyl group or something similar.

Wait, but considering the NMR signals: two vinyl-H. Let's imagine the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the benzene. The vinyl would have two sets of protons, perhaps. For example, if the substituent is a trans double bond, the protons would be split into different signals. Or maybe it's a part of an ester group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group or something else with a double bond. Wait, but let's think about the ester group structure.

An ester group is typically O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, the structure is R-O-CO-R'. For example, methyl acetate is CH3COOCH3. So if the benzene has an ester substituent, it would be something like O-CO-O-R attached to the ring. Wait, no, more accurately, the substituent would be like O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. For example, the ester could be benzyl acetate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the substituent is an ester, so perhaps it's a methoxy group attached to a carbonyl, but that might be an ester. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an acetyloxy group, like OAc.

Wait, but the substituent on the benzene is an ester. So it would be something like Ar-O-CO-R, where Ar is the aryl group (benzene) and R is an alkyl group.

Now, considering the NMR: the two vinyl-H signals. If the substituent is an ester, perhaps the R group is an allyl group, which has a double bond. For example, the R could be CH2CH2CH3, but that's not a double bond. Alternatively, R could be CH2CH2, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps R is a vinyl group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, but that doesn't directly make sense because a vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. But that would give rise to vinyl protons.

Wait, another angle: the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Let's think about a trans double bond. In a trans configuration, the two protons are on opposite sides, so each would couple with the other, leading to a doublet. But that's for a simple double bond without any substituents on the adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group. For example, CH2=CHCH2-O-CO- attached to the benzene. But that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. Hmm, perhaps the ester is something like CH2=CHCOOR, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. Like Ar-O-CO-CH2CH2CH2... No, perhaps something else.

Alternatively, let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, DoU = (2C +2 - H)/2.

For each option:

A) C11H14O2: C=11, H=14. DoU=(2*11+2-14)/2=(24-14)/2=5. So 5 DoU. Benzene ring is 4 DoU (three double bonds in the ring), ester group has one DoU (the carbonyl). So 4 + 1 = 5. That fits.

B) C12H14O2: DoU=(2*12 +2 -14)/2=(26-14)/2=6. Benzene (4) + ester (1) + maybe a double bond elsewhere (1). So 4+1+1=6. Possible.

C) C12H12O2: DoU=(2*12+2-12)/2=(26-12)/2=7. Benzene (4) + ester (1) + maybe two double bonds or rings. Not sure, but possible.

D) C11H12O2: DoU=(2*11 +2 -12)/2=(24-12)/2=6. Benzene (4) + ester (1) + another double bond (e.g., vinyl group) → 4+1+1=6. That also fits.

So options A, B, C, D have varying DoU.

Now,
