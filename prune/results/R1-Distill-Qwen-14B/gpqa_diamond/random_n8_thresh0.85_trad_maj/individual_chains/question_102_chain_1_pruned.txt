Okay, let's try to tackle this question. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They're studying their developmental fate. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets for binding.

The construct they made is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So bicistronic means two genes in one vector. The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for the translation of the second gene without the need for a separate promoter. So the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter, and the receptor's expression is driven by the IRES, which is weaker than a promoter but allows for some expression.

Between ligand and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272. LoxP is a specific recombination site. When Cre is present, the lox sites are recognized, and the stop cassette is excised, allowing the downstream reporter (mCherry or eGFP) to be expressed.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression via Western blot. Actin loading is used as a control, which is fine. So the construct was transfected into primary astrocytes, and they checked if the proteins are expressed.

Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre would recombine the lox sites. 

After the offspring are born, they visualize under confocal. They expected to see green (from eGFP) but didn't. So why?

The options are A to D.

Let me think about the setup. The vector is a bicistronic construct for ligand and receptor. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, so it's expressed first. The receptor is after the IRES, so it's expressed at a lower level, but still.

In the vector, between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. So without Cre, the stop remains, meaning mCherry isn't expressed because the ORF is interrupted. Similarly, the receptor's ORF is followed by a stop with lox2272, so eGFP isn't expressed unless Cre removes the stops.

But when Cre is present, like in the mice that are homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should recombine the lox sites. So in the ligand's case, the loxP sites would be cut, removing the stop cassette and allowing mCherry to be expressed after the ligand. Similarly, the lox2272 sites would be cut, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but in this question, the problem is that when they look for eGFP, they don't see it. So why wouldn't eGFP be expressed?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But I'm not sure how this affects expression in the mouse. The question is about why eGFP isn't expressed. If the construct isn't working, maybe because the receptor isn't expressed. But this option seems unrelated, unless the expression isn't happening because the proteins are secreted and act on other cells. But the Western blot probably detected the proteins regardless of their localization. So maybe A isn't the issue.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. Stuck in Golgi would mean it's not transported to the cell surface. But why would that happen? Maybe a problem with signal peptides or something. But if the construct is correctly made, the receptor should have a signal sequence. But the question is about the expression in the mouse. If the construct is faulty, perhaps the protein isn't made. So maybe B isn't the primary issue here.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which doesn't require a promoter but requires the ribosome to translate. So maybe without an enhancer, the expression isn't sufficient. But since the mouse is homozygous, perhaps the expression is enough. Also, the Western blot would have shown it, but the question says they used the blot with antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. If the proteins weren't expressed, the blot wouldn't show signals. But the question states that the actin loading is proportional, implying the blot worked. So maybe the proteins are expressed but not detected due to other issues. So I'm not sure about C.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, wait! The construct for the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. If there's a stop cassette between receptor and eGFP, when Cre removes the stop, the eGFP should be in frame. But if the frame is wrong, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed properly. Alternatively, if the vector was designed incorrectly, perhaps the stop cassette wasn't correctly placed, so that when removed, the reading frame is wrong.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic. The ligand is first, then after a stop cassette, then the receptor. Hmm, wait, no, the ligand is at 5', then after a stop, then the receptor. So the ligand and receptor are separate. The ligand is under CBA, receptor under IRES.

Wait, the vector is ligand (with loxP-stop-loxP) followed by receptor (with lox2272-stop-lox2272). So the first ORF is ligand, then a stop, then receptor, then stop, then eGFP.

Wait, no, the description says: ligand ORF is 5', fused to mCherry. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me read again.

The ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. Wait, that suggests ligand is followed by mCherry. But then, after the stop cassette, the receptor is present, with eGFP.

So the construct is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop cassette (loxP) -> mCherry. Then, IRES -> receptor ORF -> stop cassette (lox2272) -> eGFP.

No, that can't be right because it's a bicistronic vector. Oh, I think it's more like:

The first cistron is ligand ORF under CBA promoter, followed by stop cassette (loxP), followed by mCherry. Then, an IRES, then the receptor ORF, followed by stop cassette (lox2272), then eGFP.

Wait, no, bicistronic vectors usually have two separate ORFs, each with their own control elements. So the first ORF is ligand under CBA promoter, followed by a stop cassette. The second ORF is receptor under IRES, but the IRES is after the ligand's ORF. So perhaps the arrangement is:

CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> loxP-stop-loxP -> mCherry ORF?

Wait, perhaps the vector is set up so that when Cre is present, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed, and the receptor's stop is also removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but the question says that after crossing with SOX10-Cre, which should activate the Cre, the eGFP is not seen. So the issue must be in the expression of the eGFP.

If the stop cassettes are correctly excised, the eGFP should be expressed as a fusion with the receptor. But perhaps the frame is wrong.

Wait, the lox2272 is a variant of loxP, which is recognized by Cre. So after Cre recombination, the stop is excised. But if the frame isn't correct, the eGFP might not be expressed. Let me think about how this works.

The vector for the receptor is: Receptor ORF followed by a stop cassette (lox2272), then eGFP. So when Cre removes the stop, the receptor is translated, and then eGFP should be in frame. But if the stop is removed and the eGFP is added, is the frame correct? Because the stop is in frame, removing it would allow the eGFP to be in frame with the receptor.

Wait, no. The stop cassette is probably in frame. So if the stop is in frame, when removed, the eGFP would be appended after the receptor in frame. So the eGFP would be a C-terminal tag on the receptor.

But what if, after recombination, the reading frame is not correct? Because, for example, the stop is in the same reading frame as the receptor, and when it's removed, the next codon is the start of eGFP. But that's only possible if the stop is in frame, and the eGFP starts right after, with the same reading frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop is not in frame, which would
