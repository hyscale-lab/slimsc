Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is. Hmm. The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on Grubbs catalyst. Oh right, Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming double bonds, swapping the ends. So, Grubbs would cause the alkene to undergo ring-closing metathesis if possible, or maybe just break and reform in a way to give different alkenes.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers, but I don't think that matters here because the product might not depend on the stereochemistry if the reaction doesn't affect it.

First, let's draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂? Wait, wait. Wait, pent has five carbons. Let me count:

1   2   3   4   5
CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait. Wait no, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3? But that's 1-pentene. But 3-methyl would be a branch on the third carbon. Wait, let me number correctly.

Wait, the formula for pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But that's without substituents. Now, 3-methyl means a methyl group is attached to carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, wait, the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait no. Let me think again.

Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So 3-methyl would have a CH(CH3) on the third carbon. So the structure should be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the formula for pentane is C5H12. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would
