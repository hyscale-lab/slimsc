Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two separate reactions, A and B, and I need to determine the major products for each. Then, I have to match the options given. There are four options, each providing possible products for A and B.

First, looking at Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so this is probably an aldol reaction or some kind of addition.

Wait, wait. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me sketch the structure. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 2, there's an ethyl group, and at position 6, a methyl group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me number the carbons. Okay, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So position 1 is the ketone. Then position 2 (the next carbon) has an ethyl group. Position 6 is the one opposite to position 1? Or maybe I'm getting the positions wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl, so perhaps two methyl groups at position 6. Wait, the compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group. Because the formula is 2,6-dimethyl, but that's not possible because the position is 2 and 6, each having a methyl? Oh wait, no. Wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at C1. At C2, there's an ethyl and a methyl substituent
