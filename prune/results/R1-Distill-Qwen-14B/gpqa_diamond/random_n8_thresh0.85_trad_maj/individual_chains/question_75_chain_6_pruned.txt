Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed as expected in these transgenic mice. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the setup: The researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model where they overexpress the GADD45G protein. To do this, they introduced a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, selected for antibiotic resistance, but the protein isn't overexpressing.

The provided DNA sequence is the plus strand of the construct. Let me look at it closely. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, as expected. Then follows the coding regions for the HA tag and the GADD45G.

Wait, looking at the sequence, I notice that it's quite long. Let me count the codons or see if there's any termination early. The sequence ends with ...GAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA. I see a stop codon at the end, which is TGA, right? Because TGA is a stop codon. So the sequence seems to have a normal stop at the end.

Hmm, but why isn't the protein being expressed? The options suggest possible issues. Let me look at each option.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. If the HA tag's sequence is incorrect, the protein might not be expressed, or the tag might not function. But the HA tag is at the N-terminus. If it's mutated, the protein would be expressed but perhaps not recognized by antibodies used for affinity purification. However, the question is about overexpression, not detection. So maybe this isn't the main issue. Plus, the problem is in the construct's sequence.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. But looking at the sequence, the stop codon is correct at the end. Unless there's an in-frame stop codon earlier. So I should check if any TAA, TAG, or TGA appears before the end.

Let me scan the sequence for TGA or TAA. Let me go through the sequence:

Looking for any TGA, TAA, or TAG. Let's see. I'll look through the sequence. Hmm. The sequence after ATG starts with TAC, which is Tyr. Then CCATACGATGTT... Wait, so for example, the first part is ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG T... I think I'm getting lost. Let me look for any occurrence of TGA.

Wait, looking at the sequence toward the end: I see ...GCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, in the middle, I see TGA here: ...GCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAAC
