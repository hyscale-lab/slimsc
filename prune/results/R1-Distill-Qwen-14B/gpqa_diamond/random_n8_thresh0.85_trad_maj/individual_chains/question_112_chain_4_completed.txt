Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about finding the probabilities of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and then calculating the average value of an operator. 

Wait, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I need to normalize this state. Because when the question says it's proportional, it means we have to find the normalization constant. 

So, the normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. Let me write the state as |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, no, actually, it's proportional, so |alpha> = c[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>], where c is a constant. Oh wait, no, the question says it's proportional, so I think the state is already normalized or maybe not. Wait, no, because the coefficients are complex, I need to compute the norm. Let me calculate the inner product.

The inner product is (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i). Wait, no. Wait, for |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal, the inner product of the state with itself is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2. Because |up> and |down> are orthogonal, so cross terms would be zero.

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. And |2 - i|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2 )=4 +1=5. So total is 2+5=7. So the state is sqrt(7) times longer than it should be. Therefore, the normalization constant c is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you have a state like a|up> + b|down>, the norm is |a|^2 + |b|^2. So for a = (1+i), |a|^2 is (1^2 +1^2)=2. For b= (2-i), |b|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2)=5. So the norm is sqrt(2+5)=sqrt(7). So to make it a unit vector, we divide by sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Alright, that's the state normalized.

Now, the operator in question has matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so for a 2x2 matrix? Because the state is two-dimensional (up and down). So the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal.

Wait, but what are the eigenstates of this operator? Because the question says, the eigenstates of the operator. Oh wait, the operator is given, and we're to compute the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. So I need to find the eigenstates of A, then express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates, and the square of the coefficients would be the probabilities.

Alternatively, maybe the operator is Hermitian, so it has real eigenvalues, and the states are orthogonal. Hmm.

Wait, let me check if A is Hermitian. Since A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. So the matrix is:

[0, ħ/2;
 ħ/2, 0]

Which is symmetric, so yes, Hermitian. So its eigenvalues are real.

The eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A - λI)=0.

So the matrix A-λI is:

[-λ, ħ/2;
 ħ/2, -λ]

The determinant is λ² - (ħ/2)^2 =0. So λ² = (ħ^2)/(4). So λ= ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Hmm, so the eigenstates are the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues.

Wait, but wait, for 2x2 matrices, when the matrix is symmetric, the eigenvectors are orthogonal. Let's find the eigenvectors.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[-ħ/2, ħ/2;
 ħ/2, -ħ/2]

Which gives the equation: (-ħ/2)v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0. Dividing both sides by ħ/2, we get -v1 +v2=0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvectors for λ=ħ/2 are of the form (1, 1), up to normalization. Similarly for λ=-ħ/2, (1,-1). Wait, let me check.

Wait, when λ = -ħ/2, the matrix becomes:

[ ħ/2, ħ/2;
 ħ/2, ħ/2 ]

So the equation is (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 +v2 =0 → v2 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors are (1, -1) and (1,1), respectively.

So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for λ= ħ/2, and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for λ= -ħ/2.

Wait, but let's make sure about the signs. Because sometimes the eigenvectors can be scaled differently, but I think the standard way is (1,1) and (1,-1), but normalized.

So the eigenstates are |+> and |->, as I wrote.

Now, the state |alpha> is given, so to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the components. Let me write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

I can write this as:

a |up> + b |down>, where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

The eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to express |alpha> in terms of |+>, |->, we can write:

|alpha> = c1 |+> + c2 |->.

So, let's solve for c1 and c2.

Substituting:

c1 (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c2 (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) = a |up> + b |down>

Which can be written as:

[ (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) ] |down> = a |up> + b |down>

This gives two equations:

(c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) = a
(c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) = b

We can write this as a system:

c1 + c2 = a sqrt(2)
c1 - c2 = b sqrt(2)

Adding the two equations: 2 c1 = (a + b) sqrt(2) → c1 = (a + b) sqrt(2)/2

Subtracting the equations: 2 c2 = (a - b) sqrt(2) → c2 = (a - b) sqrt(2)/2

Let me compute a + b and a - b.

a = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)
a + b = (1+2 + i -i)/sqrt(7) = 3/sqrt(7)
a - b = (1-2 + i +i)/sqrt(7) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7)

So c1 = (3/sqrt(7)) * sqrt(2)/2 = 3 sqrt(2)/( 2 sqrt(7) )

Similarly, c2 = [ (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7) ] * sqrt(2)/2 = (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2)/( 2 sqrt(7) )

So the coefficients are c1 and c2.

The probabilities are |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

Compute |c1|^2:

(3^2 * 2 ) / (4 * 7) ) → (9 *2 )/(28) )= 18/28 = 9/14 ≈0.642857.

Similarly, |c2|^2: [ (-1 + 2i) ] multiplied by its conjugate is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 )=1+4=5. So |c2|^2 = 5*(2)/(4*7) )= (5*2)/(28)= 10/28=5/14≈0.35714.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. Wait, |c2|^2 is [ (sqrt(2)/ (2 sqrt(7)) )^2 ] * | (-1 +2i) |^2.

Wait, |c2|^2 = ( [ sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ] )^2 * | (-1 + 2i) |² → (2/(4 *7)) * (1 +4) → (2/28)*5= (10/28)=5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357.

Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Because when I compute |c1|² and |c2|², they should add up to 1.

9/14 +5/14= 14/14=1. So yes, that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 → They match 9/14≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357, which is close. But let me check the exact values.

Wait, 9/14 is 0.6428... which is about 0.64. 5/14 is about 0.357, which is about 0.36. So option A's first two values match.

Now, the average value of the operator. The average is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But wait, because the operator A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, and the state |alpha> is in a superposition of the eigenstates, the average value is the sum of probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So, the average value = (|c1|^2)(ħ/2) + (|c2|^2)(-ħ/2).

So that's (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9 -5) / (14 *2) ] ħ → (4/28) ħ = (1/7) ħ.

Wait, so the average is ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A has average value ħ/7. So that would make option A correct.

Wait, but let me compute it the other way, directly.

Another method: to compute <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is a matrix, let's write A in terms of |up><down| and |down><up|.

Wait, A is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. So, A = (ħ/2) (|up><down| + |down><up| )

So, <alpha| A |alpha> = (ħ/2) [ <alpha| up><down |alpha> + <alpha| down><up |alpha> ].

But <alpha| up> is a*, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7).

Similarly, <alpha| down> is b*, where b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So:

<alpha| A |alpha> = (ħ/2) [ (a* b) + (b* a) ]

Because <alpha| up><down |alpha> = a* b, and <alpha| down><up |alpha> = b* a.

So compute a* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7), b= (2 -i)/sqrt(7). So a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7.

Similarly, b* a = (2 +i)(1 +i)/7.

Compute a* b:

(1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i + i² → 2 -3i -1 → (1) -3i.

Wait, wait, that's not right. Let me compute (1 -i)(2 -i):

=1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
=2 -i -2i + i²
=2 -3i + (-1) [since i²=-1]
= (2-1) -3i → 1 -3i.

Similarly, b* a is (2 +i)(1 +i):

=2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i
=2 +2i +i +i²
=2 +3i + (-1)
=1 +3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7, and b* a = (1 +3i)/7.

Adding these: (1-3i +1 +3i)/7 = 2/7.

Then, <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

So that confirms the average is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and average is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, ħ/7 → yes, that's correct.

Other options: Option D has average 2ħ/sqrt(7), which is about 2.66 * ħ. Our calculated average is much smaller.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. The state is normalized by dividing by the norm, which is calculated as √7. Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha⟩ = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}}|up⟩ + \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}}|down⟩.
\]

The operator in question has a matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator is Hermitian, and its eigenstates are the symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of |up⟩ and |down⟩:

\[
|+⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ + |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |−⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ - |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}},
\]

with eigenvalues \(+\frac{\hbar}{2}\) and \(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\), respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates |+⟩ and |−⟩, the state |α⟩ is expressed in terms of these eigenstates. Solving for the coefficients \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) in \(|\alpha⟩ = c_1|+⟩ + c_2|−⟩\), we find:

\[
c_1 = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_2 = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates |+⟩ and |−⟩ are approximately \(0.64\) and \(0.36\), respectively.

The average value of the operator \(A\) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \(\hbar/7\).**

Answer: A
