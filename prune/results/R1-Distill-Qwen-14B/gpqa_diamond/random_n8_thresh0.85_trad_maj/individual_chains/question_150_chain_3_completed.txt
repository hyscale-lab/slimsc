--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and think about how to approach it.

The question involves a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and we're supposed to figure out the structure based on that. Then, we have to see what happens when it reacts with a series of reagents.

First, the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, substituting the values: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees: maybe a ring and some double bonds or something like that.

Looking at the NMR data:
- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's a strong downfield shift. Probably an aldehyde proton (RCHO) because aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. Or maybe a phenolic OH, but that would be broader. Wait, but phenol OH is usually around 5 ppm in D2O wash, but in the NMR here, it's not specified if exchange is considered. Alternatively, an aldehyde makes sense here.

Then, 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. That could be aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. Like two protons in a para position, such as a benzene ring with substituents.

6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Another set of aromatic protons. Hmm, so maybe two doublets in the aromatic region. Possibly, the molecule has two benzene rings, each with substituents that lead to these doublets.

6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad suggests maybe something exchanging, like an -OH group. But 2H? So perhaps two -OH groups, but in the aromatic region that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe these are vinyl protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like in an enal or something. Or perhaps they're part of a conjugated system, like an alpha to a carbonyl group.

3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. This is around the area for CH2 groups. Maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2 or something. So maybe a CH2 group connected to an oxygen, like an ether or ester.

Putting this together: the NMR suggests an aldehyde proton at 9.72. So the structure likely has an aldehyde group. The aromatic protons could be from two benzene rings, perhaps each substituted with something. The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets could each be two aromatic protons in a para-substituted position.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a diphenyl compound. So the molecule has two benzene rings attached to a central chain.

The 3.66 ppm doublet is 2H. Could that be a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, maybe adjacent to another substituent. Like maybe a CH2-O- group, but where?

Hmm, the triplet at 9.72 with 1H: aldehyde. So the structure must have an aldehyde group.

So putting it together: Maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative with another substituent.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the atoms. Nitrogen is present, so perhaps an amine or an oxygen-containing group. Oh, wait, the NMR doesn't show a clear NH peak, but the molecular formula includes N. So maybe the structure has a nitro group or an amine. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an amide or something else.

Wait, looking at the options, they all have "but..." in the name, so maybe the main chain is a four-carbon chain. Let me look at the options.

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. Structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(Ph)-CHO.

Wait, but but-3-enal is CH2=CH-CH2-CHO? No, wait, but-3-enal would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but numbering might be different. Wait, but-3-enal would be aldehyde at C1, then double bond between C3 and C4. So structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond? No, wait, but butenals have four carbons. But-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO. But wait, that would make it pentanal with a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Wait, but-3-enal is actually: the aldehyde is the first carbon. So the chain is four carbons: 1 (CHO), 2, 3, 4. The double bond between 3 and 4? No, wait, but that's not possible in four carbons because the double bond would be between carbons 2 and 3. So but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO? No, that would be pent-4-enal, perhaps. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 3-enal in a four-carbon chain. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond in the middle. Maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has two benzene rings attached to a four-carbon chain with a double bond somewhere.

Looking at the NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 (probably aldehyde), and then the aromatic protons. The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets of two protons each. So perhaps two para-substituted benzene rings.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm doublet (2H) suggests maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. So perhaps an OCH2CH2 group. Or maybe a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an ether.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like:

Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CHO. But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO.

Wait, let me count: each benzene ring is 6 carbons, but the molecular formula is C8. So if it's diphenyl, that's 12 carbons, which contradicts the formula. So perhaps each benzene is not a simple ring but a substituent.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count: 8 carbons. So maybe it's a benzene ring attached to a four-carbon chain. Let's see.

Wait, if the structure is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal (option D), that would have one benzene ring. So the formula would be C7H6O (from benzene) plus the buten-al part: but-3-enal is C4H5O (CHO). Wait, but let me calculate.

Benzene ring (C6H5) attached to a buten-al group. So the buten-al would be -CH2-CH2-CHO, but with a double bond. Wait, but but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO? That would be five carbons (since the aldehyde is first). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (Ph)CH2-CH2-CHO, but that's three carbons, not four. Alternatively, (Ph)CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO would be four carbons. So that's C6 (benzene) + 4 carbons, total C10, but our formula is C8. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the structure is diphenyl but-3-enal. That would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond. Wait, but but-3-enal would have the double bond between C3 and C4, but that's four carbons. So perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that's a four-carbon chain with a benzene at the end. Wait, but then the molecular formula: benzene (6 C) + three more C (CH2-CH2-CHO) => 9 C? No, but the formula is C8. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Maybe the benzene rings are not directly attached but part of a substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. So the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(Ph)-CHO. Let me count the carbons: each Ph is 6 C, but wait, that would be 6 + 6 + 3 (but chain) = 15, which is way more than 8. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe the benzene rings are not each a benzene but perhaps phenyl groups attached to the chain. Wait, C8H9NO. Let me think about the possible structure.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has two phenyl groups attached to a buten-al chain. Let's see: but-3-enal would have the structure CH2=CH-CH2-CHO. But if two phenyl groups are attached at positions 2 and 4, the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-Ph-CHO? No, that's more carbons. Wait, maybe the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO with another substituent. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with some substituents. Let's think about the NMR.

The aldehyde proton is at 9.72 as a triplet. Wait, why a triplet? Aldehydes are usually singlets. So a triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Hmm. So maybe the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group, which in turn is adjacent to another CH2. So perhaps it's something like CH2-CHO, where the CH2 is next to another CH2.

Wait, but in that case, the aldehyde proton would be a triplet. So the structure might have CH2 adjacent to another CH group. Hmm, maybe a double bond nearby.

Wait, another idea: the triplet suggests that the aldehyde proton is next to a CH2 group that's part of a -CH2-CHO group. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2-CH2-CHO, but again, not sure.

Looking again at the NMR data, the triplet (1H) at 9.72, which is likely the aldehyde. Then, the next peak at 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) suggests two sets of aromatic protons. So the molecule has two aromatic rings, each with two protons as doublets. So perhaps the molecule has two para-substituted benzene rings.

Wait, the 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet (2H). Could that be an enol proton? Or maybe two phenolic -OH groups, but they would usually appear as broad singlets, but in the aromatic region, which is around 5 ppm. Wait, in the NMR provided, 6.27 is in the aromatic region but higher than typical phenol. But it's a broad singlet, which might suggest exchange, like -OH groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated system, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde, which can cause the protons to be deshielded and appear downfield.

Wait, let me think about the reagents. The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH, Heat.

These are typical conditions for hydrolysis of a nitro compound, but wait, wait. NaNO2 and HCl are used for diazotization, usually with aryl amines. Then H2O, maybe hydrolysis. Then aqueous KOH and heat, which could be for elimination or saponification.

Wait, but the initial compound has a molecular formula C8H9NO. So, if it's an aromatic amine, then reacting with NaNO2 and HCl under cold conditions would form a diazonium salt. Then, with H2O, perhaps a hydrolysis, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a nitro compound. Wait, NaNO2 and HCl are used in the formation of diazonium salts from aromatic amines, but they are also used in the reduction of nitro groups to amines under certain conditions. Hmm, but I think the first step is diazotization.

Wait, but the starting compound has an N in it. So perhaps the structure has an amino group. Let's see the options.

Looking at the options, all are aldehydes. So maybe the starting compound has an amino group that is converted into an aldehyde via these steps.

Wait, the reaction steps: first diazotization (if it's an aromatic amine), then H2O, which might be hydrolysis, then KOH and heat. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydroxy amine or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a nitro compound. Let me think. NaNO2 and HCl can be used in nitro compounds under acidic conditions to form nitrous acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the final product is an aldehyde, as all options are aldehydes. So perhaps the initial compound has a group that is oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but the first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl. That's more about diazotization. So perhaps the initial compound has an amino group attached to a benzene ring. Diazotization would convert the amino group into a diazonium salt, which under certain conditions can undergo hydrolysis.

Wait, so if the initial compound is a benzylamine derivative, upon diazotization, it becomes a diazonium chloride. Then, with water and heat, it might undergo hydrolysis to form a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but the second step is H2O. So maybe the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to form a phenol.

Hmm, but the third step is aqueous KOH and heat. That could be for elimination reactions, like removing a leaving group and forming a double bond.

Putting this together, perhaps the initial compound is a benzylamine derivative, which upon diazotization and hydrolysis forms a phenol. Then, under basic conditions, it undergoes elimination to form an aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the initial compound is a nitroso compound or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a methoxy group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again about the NMR data. The triplet at 9.72 could be an aldehyde, but if the starting compound is being reacted, perhaps the aldehyde is formed after the reaction. So the starting compound might not have the aldehyde group.

Wait, the initial compound has a molecular formula C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures.

If the NMR data corresponds to the starting material, then the triplet at 9.72 suggests an aldehyde. So the starting material has an aldehyde group.

So the initial structure has an aldehyde group, a benzene ring(s), and an oxygen and a nitrogen.

Wait, but the starting material has NO in the formula, so perhaps a nitro group or an amine.

Wait, the NMR data shows a peak at 3.66 ppm, which is a doublet, 2H. That might be a CH2 group connected to an oxygen. So perhaps an OCH2 group.

Hmm, the structure might be something like Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CHO. Wait, but that would have more than 8 carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde with an attached group.

Another thought: since the NMR shows two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps the compound has two benzene rings. But the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Each benzene is 6 carbons, so two would be 12, which exceeds 8. So that can't be right. Hmm, so perhaps it's a single benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me break it down. 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, one oxygen.

Possible structure: a benzene ring (6 C) with substituents adding two more C. So substituents could be -OCH2CH2CHO or something similar.

Wait, the substituent would add two carbons. So maybe the substituent is -O-CH2-CHO. But then the formula would be C8H7O2N? Not sure. Maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitro group attached to the benzene, along with an aldehyde and some other groups. But I'm not making progress.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with a nitro group and other substituents.

Wait, let's think about the NMR again. The 9.72 triplet (1H) is probably the aldehyde. The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets (each 2H) suggest two sets of aromatic protons. So, maybe the benzene has two substituents, each causing the two protons to be split into doublets.

Wait, if the benzene has two substituents in the para positions, then each substituent would cause the adjacent protons to be doublets. For example, a substituent at position 2 and another at position 6 (para), but that's the same as position 2 and 6, which are adjacent. Wait, perhaps it's a meta substitution.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with a substituent on the benzene ring, leading to the NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring attached to a chain that includes the aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is para-hydroxybenzaldehyde. But that would be C7H6O2, which doesn't match the formula here.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a benzene ring attached to a three-carbon chain with an aldehyde and some other groups.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows a triplet (1H) at 9.72, which is probably the aldehyde. The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. So perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CHO. Let's count the carbons: benzene (6 C) + 4 C (CH2-O-CH2-CHO) = 10, which is more than 8. So that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that would be C9H8O, which again is more than 8. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO. That would be C8H7O. But the formula is C8H9NO, which includes a nitrogen. So perhaps there's a nitro group attached.

Wait, if the structure is Ph-NO2-CH2-CHO, but that would be more than 8 carbons. Wait, no, benzene is 6 C, then NO2 is a substituent, CH2-CHO adds 3 C. So total would be 6 + 1 (NO2 is a substituent but doesn't add a carbon) + 3 = 10 C. No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene is connected to a chain that includes both an aldehyde and an amino group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO. Let's see: benzene (6 C) + CH2 + CH(NH2) + CHO (2 C) = 6 + 3 + 1 = 10 C. No, too many.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction steps again. The first step is NaNO2 and HCl. That's usually for diazotization of aromatic amines. So the starting compound probably has an -NH2 group attached to an aromatic ring.

Then, step two is H2O, which under acidic conditions might lead to hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol. So the product after step two is a phenol.

Then, step three is aqueous KOH and heat. That's basic conditions, which could cause elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation or the formation of an aldehyde from a ketone via elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but if the starting compound is an aromatic amine, after diazotization and hydrolysis, it becomes a phenol. Then, under basic conditions, perhaps the phenol is further reacted. But phenols are generally resistant to basic conditions unless there's a leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting structure has an adjacent group that can be eliminated. So, after forming the phenol, maybe the next step is elimination to form an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. Structure would be Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO. But the molecular formula would be C8H9NO: Ph (6 C), NH2 (1 N), CH2 (2 C), CHO (1 C) → total 6+2+1=9 C? Wait, no, that's 6 (Ph) + 3 (CH2-CHO) + 1 (NH2) → but molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate:

Ph = C6H5. The chain is CH2-CHO (which is CH2-CHO → 2 C). And the NH2 is on the benzene. So the molecule would be C6H5-CH2-CH(OH)-NH2? No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an aminophenylpropenal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure is benzaldehyde with an aminoethyl group. Structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2. But that would be C8H10N, not matching the formula C8H9NO. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with an ethyl group. So Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO. Let's count:

Ph is C6H5. NH2 is attached to the benzene. Then CH2-CHO adds 3 carbons (CH2 and CHO). So total C: 6 + 3 = 9. But the formula is C8. So maybe that's not right.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should focus on the reaction steps again.

If the first step is diazotization, forming a diazonium salt, then hydrolysis would convert that into a phenol group. Then, under basic conditions with heat, perhaps an elimination occurs to form an aldehyde.

So, maybe the initial compound has a structure where the amino group is attached to a benzene and adjacent to a CH2 group, which is next to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is 4-aminobenzyl aldehyde. Structure: Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO. Then, after diazotization and hydrolysis, the NH2 becomes OH, giving Ph-OH-CH2-CHO. Then, under basic conditions, maybe elimination occurs, removing a water molecule to form a double bond, leading to an aldehyde.

Wait, but that would create a double bond between the benzene and the CH2 group, forming a styryl group. But the options don't seem to include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure is Ph-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO. Then, upon diazotization, the NH2 is converted to a diazonium group, which upon hydrolysis would form a phenol. Then, under basic conditions, elimination could occur, removing the NH2 and forming a double bond, leading to an aldehyde.

But I'm not entirely sure about this.

Looking back at the options:

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Structure would be Ph-OH attached to a buten-al chain.

Wait, but where is the aldehyde located? But-3-enal would have the aldehyde at the end, with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure is 4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-enal. Then, upon reduction, the nitro group is converted to an amino group, but that's not what the reagents are doing.

Wait, the reaction steps:

1. NaNO2 + HCl → diazotization if it's an aromatic amine.

2. H2O → hydrolysis of diazonium salt to phenol.

3. aq. KOH, heat → perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

So, perhaps the initial structure is an aromatic amine attached to a chain that can eliminate to form an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2. Then, after diazotization and hydrolysis, it becomes Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. Then, under basic conditions, perhaps elimination occurs to form an aldehyde. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, maybe the initial structure is Ph-CH2-CH(NH2)-CH2-CHO. Then, after diazotization and hydrolysis, it becomes Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CHO. Then, under basic conditions, elimination could form an aldehyde and a double bond.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. Then, the product would be Ph-CH2-CH=CH-CHO, but that's more of a but-2-enal. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO. After diazotization and hydrolysis, it becomes Ph-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CHO. Then, under basic conditions, elimination would occur between the CH(OH) and CHO groups, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to look at the options and see which one makes sense after the reaction steps.

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

Structure: The aldehyde is at position 1, a double bond between 3 and 4, and a 4-hydroxyphenyl group attached at position 4.

Wait, but butenals have four carbons. So but-3-enal would have the structure CH2=CH-CH2-CHO. Then, attaching a 4-hydroxyphenyl group at position 4 would make it Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond. Wait, I'm not visualizing this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH=CH-CHO. No, that would be longer than four carbons.

Wait, but the options are getting a bit confusing. Let me think about what each step does.

Step 1: Diazotization → forms diazonium salt.

Step 2: Hydrolysis → converts diazonium to phenol.

Step 3: KOH and heat → perhaps elimination reaction, forming a double bond and generating an aldehyde.

So, the starting material has an amino group attached to a benzene, and a chain that can eliminate to form an aldehyde upon treatment with base.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. Structure: Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO.

After step 1, the NH2 becomes a diazonium group. Step 2, hydrolysis replaces the diazonium with OH, making Ph-OH-CH2-CHO. Then, step 3: KOH and heat. Maybe the -CH2-CHO group is adjacent to the OH, and under basic conditions, elimination occurs, forming a double bond and releasing water. So, the product would be Ph-OH-CH=CHO.

Wait, but that would be a propenal with a phenol group. Alternatively, perhaps the structure becomes Ph-CH=CH-CHO, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. So, the product after elimination would have the structure Ph-CH2-CH=CHO.

Wait, but the options don't seem to match this exactly. Let me look again.

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

Structure: The aldehyde is at position 1, the double bond between 3 and 4, and the hydroxyphenyl group at position 4. So the structure would be:

CHO - CH2 - CH2 - CH(Ph-OH)

Wait, but but-3-enal would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure would be CHO - CH2 - CH2 - CH=CH-Ph-OH? No, that's five carbons. I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Ph-OH
|
CH2-CH2-CH=CHO

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain with a double bond between 3 and 4, and the aldehyde at the end.

So, the product would be Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO. That would be but-3-enal with a phenol substituent at position 4.

Wait, I think I'm getting closer.

So, after the reaction steps, the product is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Which is option D.

But wait, let me make sure. The initial structure would be 4-aminophenylbut-3-enal? Then, upon diazotization, hydrolysis, and elimination, it would form the aldehyde with the phenol group.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure is 4-aminobenzyl but-3-enal. Hmm.

I think the correct answer is option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.


The compound has the molecular formula **C8H9NO**, and the NMR data provides key insights into its structure. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as 5, suggesting the presence of rings and/or double bonds. The NMR data includes:

- **9.72 ppm (t, 1H)**: This is a strong downfield shift, characteristic of an aldehyde proton (RCHO).
- **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)**: These are aromatic protons, likely from a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, possibly due to protons in a conjugated system or near an electron-withdrawing group.
- **3.66 ppm (d, 2H)**: A doublet, likely from a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen atom.

The molecular formula and NMR data suggest the compound contains an aldehyde group, a benzene ring, and a substituent with nitrogen and oxygen. The reaction sequence involves:

1. **NaNO2 + HCl**: This step typically diazotizes an aromatic amine, forming a diazonium salt.
2. **H2O**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group, forming a phenol.
3. **aq. KOH, Heat**: Basic conditions and heat likely promote elimination, forming a double bond and generating an aldehyde.

The final product must be an aldehyde with a phenol substituent and a conjugated system. Among the options, **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal** matches this description. It has an aldehyde group at position 1, a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, and a 4-hydroxyphenyl group at position 4, consistent with the reaction sequence and NMR data.

ANSWER: D
