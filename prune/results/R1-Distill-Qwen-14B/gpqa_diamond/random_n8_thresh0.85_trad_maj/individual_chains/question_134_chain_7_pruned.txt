Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So the question gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. And their volumes and concentrations. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they undergo a neutralization reaction. The general reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and the enthalpy change for that is usually around -57 kJ/mol, as that's the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases.

Wait, but wait, each acid or base contributes their own H+ or OH- ions. So I need to figure out the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, the neutralization will occur based on the limiting reagent.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate the moles for each solution.

For HCl: It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The formula is HCl → H+ + Cl-.

Molarity (M) = moles/volume(L). So moles = M * V(L).

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since each HCl gives one H+, that's 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4: It's a strong acid too. But each molecule dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

So for H2SO4, moles = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each gives 2 H+, the H+ is 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2: It's a strong base. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. So formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.2 moles.

So, the neutralization will depend on which is the limiting reactant. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So, the moles of H+ and OH- will determine how much neutralization occurs.

Total H+ available: 0.28 mol. OH- available: 0.2 mol. So, OH- is the limiting reagent here. All 0.2 mol OH- will react.

The amount of acid that will neutralize is the same as the OH- used, which is 0.2 mol H+.

Wait, but wait, in the H2SO4 case, each mole gives 2 H+. So I think I should think in terms of equivalents. Because H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives 2 equivalents of H+.

Similarly, Ba(OH)2 gives 2 equivalents of OH- per mole.

The equivalent method might be better here. Equivalents for acid = normality × volume (L). Same for base.

So for HCl: Normality is same as molarity because it's monoprotic. So 0.2 N × 0.5 L = 0.1 equivalents.

H2SO4 is diprotic, so normality is 0.3 M × 2 = 0.6 N. So 0.6 N × 0.3 L = 0.18 equivalents.

Ba(OH)2 is diprotic as well, so normality is 0.5 M × 2 = 1 N. So 1 N × 0.2 L = 0.2 equivalents.

Now, the equivalents of acid and base:

Total acid equivalents = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 eq.

Base equivalents = 0.2 eq.

So the reaction will proceed until the base is consumed. Thus, 0.2 equivalents of H+ will react with 0.2 equivalents of OH-.

Wait, but wait, when using equivalents, the acid is in excess, right? So the base will determine the extent of the reaction.

So the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 eq.

Each mole of H+ + OH- produces 1 mole of H2O, releasing 57 kJ (or is it per mole of reaction? Let me think about the units).

The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). Because each H+ and OH- combines to form one H2O, so per mole of reaction, it's 57 kJ released.

So for 0.2 moles (or equivalents) of H+ reacting, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57) kJ.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure: the standard value is for 1 mole of H+ reacting with 1 mole of OH- to form 1 mole of H2O. So yes, 0.2 moles would release 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ.

But wait, the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization for the entire mixture. So the total enthalpy change would be negative because it's exothermic. So it's -11.4 kJ.

Wait, looking at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal. Hmm, that's in kcal, not kJ.

B) -11.42 kcal.

C) -3.80 kcal.

D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, my calculation is 11.4 kJ, which would be -11.4 kJ. But none of the options have that except B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, maybe I should check if the standard enthalpy is given in kJ or kcal. Oh right, the standard is about 57 kJ per mole, which is 13.64 kcal (since 1 cal = 4.184 J, so 1 kcal is 4184 J). Wait, maybe I should compute using kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, but I thought it was approximately 57 kJ per mole. Let me compute 0.2 moles with that.

0.2 * 57,000 J = 11,400 J → 11.4 kJ. So that's 11.4 kJ, which is 2.7 kJ. Wait, no, wait: 57 kJ is 57,000 J. So 0.2 * 57,000 J is 11,400 J, which is 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is bigger. B is -11.42 kcal. Wait a minute, I think I might have mixed up the units.

Wait, 57 kJ is equal to how many kcal?

Since 1 kcal = 4184 J, so 57,000 J is 57,000 / 4184 ≈ 13.636 kcal.

Oh! So the standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ/mol, which is about -13.64 kcal/mol.

Wait, no, no, wait: wait, no, I think I got it wrong. Oh, no! Let me clarify: 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 57 kJ is 57,000 J. To convert to kcal, divide by 4184.

So 57,000 / 4184 ≈ 13.636 kcal.

So each mole of neutralization releases about 13.64 kcal. Therefore, 0.2 moles would release 0.2 * 13.64 ≈ 2.728 kcal. So the enthalpy would be -2.728 kcal.

Wait, that's approximately -2.73 kcal. But looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close. But wait, why would the question give the answer in kcal when most options are in kJ? Hmm.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalent calculation. Let me go through again.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is monoprotic, equivalents = 0.1.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 H+ → 0.18 equivalents.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH- → 0.2 equivalents.

So acid equivalents: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Base equivalents: 0.2.

So the base is limiting, 0.2 equivalents reacting.

So the neutralization reaction is 0.2 equivalents.

If each equivalent gives 57 kJ, then 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ.

But wait, if the question is asking for the total enthalpy of neutralization, perhaps it's considering the total H+ and OH-.

Wait, but the way, another approach: perhaps the problem is to assume that all the
