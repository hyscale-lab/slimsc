Okay, so I need to figure out how many possible products are formed when racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the question is asking.

First, what's Grubbs catalyst? Oh right, Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis means the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So, it breaks and reforms double bonds, swapping the ends.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene, let me draw its structure. The pentene has five carbons, with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3. But with a methyl branch on carbon 3. So that would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait no, wait: 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's count the carbons. The main chain is five carbons, with a double bond between 1 and 2. And a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene: yes.

Wait, the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. If it's 3-methyl, the methyl is on carbon 3. So yeah, that's how the structure is.

Since it's racemic, it has both the R and S configurations at the stereogenic center. Wait, is carbon 2 a stereogenic center? Let me see. The structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C3 has a CH(CH3), so the substituents on C3 are: CH2CH3, CH(CH3), CH2 from the double bond (wait, no, C3 is connected to C2 (from the double bond), and then CH(CH3), and two CH2 groups? Wait, maybe I should think again.

Wait, no. The structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, the double bond is between C1 and C2 (since it's pent-1-ene). Then, C3 has a methyl group. So the structure is:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

Wait, but wait: C3 is connected to C2 (from the double bond), and then has CH(CH3), then C4 (CH2) and C5 (CH3). So, the arrangement around C3 is CH₂ (from C2), two CH2 groups, and a CH(CH3). Wait, maybe C3 isn't a stereogenic center because maybe the substituents are not four different groups.

Wait, let's see. C3 has:

- One bond to C2 (which is double-bonded to C1, so C2 is CH-), so C3 is connected to C2 (which is CH2), but wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

So, at C3: the substituents are:

- One bond to C2 (which is part of the double bond, so C2 is CH₂=CH-), but wait, maybe C3 is connected to C2 via a single bond. So, C2 is CH₂ (since it's CH₂=CH-). So, C3 would have four substituents: CH₂ (from C2), CH(CH3), CH₂ (from C4), and another CH3 (from C4?).

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me number the carbons again. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

In 3-methylpent-1-ene, the methyl is on position 3. So structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

Looking at C3: it's connected to C2 (which is CH₂ from the double bond), and to C4 (CH₂). So the groups around C3 are:

- CH₂ (from C2, which is CH₂-CH(CH3)-).
Wait, perhaps it's easier to see that C3's structure is CH(CH3) connected to C2 (which is CH2-) and C4 (which is CH2-). So the bonds are:

C3: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think of the molecule as:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

So, C3 is CH(CH3), and is connected to the double bond (C2) and to C4.

Wait, let's think of each substituent on C3. So, C3 is attached to:

- The double bond (so C2 is CH2-CH(CH3)-), but perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that C3 is bonded to C2 (which is CH2-), C4 (CH2-), a methyl group (CH3), and another CH2-CH3? No, wait, maybe not. Let me try to write the structure clearly.

The correct structure for 3-methylpent-1-ene is as follows:

Carbon chain: 1 2 3 4 5

Structure: CH₂=CH–CH(CH3)–CH₂–CH3.

So, looking at C3 (
