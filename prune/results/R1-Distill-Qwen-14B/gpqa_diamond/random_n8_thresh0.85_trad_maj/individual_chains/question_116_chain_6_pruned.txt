Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with compound A. Let's look at the information given. 

First, compound A has a proton NMR with two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet suggests three neighbors. The chemical shifts can indicate the type of environment. 0.9 ppm is usually for methyl groups attached to something like a CH2. Quartet at 1.3 might be from CH2 groups adjacent to a CH, maybe ethyl groups.

So, thinking about the integration: 6H as a triplet and 4H as a quartet. Maybe it's two ethyl groups. Let's see: an ethyl group has two CH2 groups. If there are two ethyl groups, that would give 4H in the CH2 and 4H in the adjacent CH2. Wait, no. Wait, each CH2 would be split into a quartet perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the compound is neopentane or something else.

Wait, if the triplet is 6H, that could be three methyl groups. Because each methyl has 3H, so three would be 9H, but that's not matching. Oh wait, maybe two methyl groups, each with 3H, but that would only be 6H. But why would two methyl groups be split as a triplet? Or wait, another possibility: maybe the two methyl groups are adjacent to a CH2 group. Like in a structure where each CH2 is next to another CH2, leading to more splitting.

Wait, maybe the structure is cumene, which is isopropylbenzene. Isopropyl groups have a CH(CH3)2, so the CH would split into a quartet from the adjacent CH3 groups, but wait that's maybe not matching the NMR here. Alternatively, maybe it's 2,2-dimethylbutane? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's neopentane, but neopentane's NMR would have different signals.

Wait, another approach: let's think of the splitting. The triplet (0.9 ppm) is for 6H. So 6H in a triplet. Maybe three methyl groups attached to a single CH2? No, because each methyl is CH3. Wait, perhaps two CH2 groups each attached to a CH3? Like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3. No, that's 2-methylpentane or something. Let me think about the splitting. Each CH2 would split into a quartet if next to another CH2. Let's try to imagine the structure.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) suggests that those 6H are on CH3 groups. Each of those CH3's is attached to a CH2 group. Because the triplet splitting comes from two neighboring protons. So each CH3 is adjacent to a CH2 that has two H's. Wait, no: the triplet implies that each proton is adjacent to two equivalent protons. So a CH2 adjacent to a CH3 would split into a quartet. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the triplet is from a CH2 group that's next to another CH2 group. For example, in an ethyl group, the CH3 would split into a quartet if next to a CH2 with two H's. But wait, the quartet is for 4H. Oh, wait, the quartet is at 1.3 ppm for 4H. So, perhaps two CH2 groups. Let me try to draw this.

Compound A: the NMR shows a triplet (6H, 0.9 ppm) and a quartet (4H, 1.3 ppm). So maybe the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? No, that's hexane, and the NMR wouldn't look like that. Alternatively, think of a structure where two CH3 groups are attached to a central CH2, which is next to another CH2 group. Let's see:

Suppose the structure is (CH2CH3)C(CH3)2. Hmm, that would be 2-methylpropane, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane derivative? No, probably not because the signals are for aliphatic protons.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the splitting patterns. The triplet (0.9 ppm) is 6H, perhaps two CH3 groups that are equivalent. Each CH3 is next to a CH2 that has two H's, so each CH3 would split into a quartet. But wait, the quartet is 4H. So maybe the 4H are from two CH2 groups. Let me think: perhaps the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH2
