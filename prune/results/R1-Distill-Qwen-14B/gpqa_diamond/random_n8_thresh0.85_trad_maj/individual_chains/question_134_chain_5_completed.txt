Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical value I learned is about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But wait, in this problem, there are multiple acids and one base, so I need to figure out the limiting reagent. Oh right, because whichever runs out first will determine how much neutralization happens.

Let me list out the given solutions:

- HCl: 500 mL of 0.2 M. So moles of HCl are volume (in liters) times molarity. 0.5 L * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so 0.1 moles H+.

- H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and it dissociates into 2 H+ ions per molecule. So the moles of H2SO4 are 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles. That means 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, H2SO4 is diprotic. The first dissociation is complete, giving 2 H+ per molecule. Or wait, does it fully dissociate both H+? I think for strong acids like H2SO4, the first dissociation is complete, but the second (HSO4- → SO4^2- + H+) isn't as complete. But in the context of neutralization with a strong base, maybe we can assume full dissociation of both H+? Or do I need to consider that? Hmm, maybe in the context of enthalpy of neutralization, each H+ contributes the same, so for H2SO4, it's two H+ per mole. So 0.3 L * 0.3 = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2: 200 mL of 0.5 M. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 moles. Which gives 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, wait, wait. Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH⁻. So for each mole of Ba(OH)2, 2 moles OH⁻. So 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

Now, looking at the acids and the base: the acids are HCl and H2SO4. Let's calculate the total H+ ions.

HCl: 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

So total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

OH- is 0.2 moles.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and each mole releases about 57 kJ (or maybe 57.8 or something, but the problem uses kcal in some options, so I need to be careful with units).

Wait, but wait. Let's get the limiting reactant. We have 0.28 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-.

Which is the limiting? OH- is less, so OH- will be consumed completely, and some H+ will remain.

So the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles. So the moles of water formed is 0.2.

So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 mol * 57 kJ/mol. But wait, I should check whether H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in the first dissociation, it gives 2 H+? Or maybe I should treat each H+ as a separate thing.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate moles of H+ and OH- separately and see the neutralization.

Wait, another approach: when mixing all these solutions, the total H+ and OH- will neutralize each other.

So the total H+ is from HCl and H2SO4.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So when they mix, H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the OH- will react with H+.

So moles of H+ after reaction: 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 mol.

Moles of OH- after reaction: 0.2 - 0.2 = 0.

So the reaction consumes 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 moles * ΔH per mole.

Assuming ΔH is -57 kJ/mol (since it's exothermic), so 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options.

Options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, the calculation gives -11.4 kJ, which is close to option D (-16 kJ) or option B (-11.42 kcal). Wait, but wait, units matter.

Wait, the question says "enthalpy of neutralization", which is usually in kJ/mol. But the options have both kcal and kJ. So I need to check which units to use.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses different units, perhaps calories instead of kilojoules.

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So let me see: 57 kJ/mol is approximately 13.6 kcal/mol (since 57 / 4.184 ≈ 13.6).

So if the reaction is 0.2 moles of H+ neutralized, then the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ. So option D is -16.0 kJ, which is more than that. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the H+ and OH-.

Wait, another thing: H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. Wait, but in solution, does it dissociate both H+ ions completely? Or is the second H+ only partially dissociated? Because if the second H+ doesn't dissociate as much, then the actual H+ from H2SO4 would be less.

Wait, but in the context of enthalpy of neutralization, perhaps the problem considers all H+ available. For example, when H2SO4 is a strong acid, it's considered to completely dissociate both H+ ions. So for each mole of H2SO4, 2 moles of H+.

Wait, but wait, I think that for concentrated solutions, the first dissociation is complete, but the second is not. So in a 0.3 M H2SO4 solution, the first H+ is fully dissociated, so 0.3 M H+ from H2SO4, and the second H+ is less. But wait, no, H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait: H2SO4 is a strong acid for the first H+. So it dissociates completely into 2H+ and SO4^2-?

Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Wait, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or is it H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- ?

Wait, no, I'm mixing it up. Let me think. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no. Wait, no, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, that's incorrect. The first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, no, no. Wait, no, wait, correction: H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation, so it dissociates completely to H+ and HSO4^-.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing with HCl. H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation (it's a strong acid, so H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, that's not correct. Wait, no, wait. Let me correct this. H2SO4 is a strong acid, but it's diprotic. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, no, wait. No, for sulfuric acid, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, actually, when H2SO4 is dissolved in water, it dissociates completely into H+ and HSO4^-.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, wait: sulfuric acid is a strong acid in its first dissociation. So the first H+ is completely ionized, but the second is a weak acid. So H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- is only partially correct. Wait, no, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, that's not right. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The first dissociation of H2SO4 is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, that can't be right because that would imply complete dissociation of both H+ from H2SO4, which isn't the case. Wait, no, no. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- only in concentrated solutions? No, wait, no. Wait, for dilute solutions, the first H+ is completely ionized. So H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^-.

Wait, but HSO4^- is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. So in dilute solutions, the second H+ isn't fully ionized. So in the problem, when we're mixing H2SO4 (0.3 M) with the base, perhaps not all the H+ from H2SO4 is available.

Hmm, this complicates things. So if the solution is 0.3 M H2SO4, then the first dissociation is complete, giving 0.3 mol/L of H+ and 0.3 mol/L of HSO4^-.

But the HSO4^- doesn't dissociate completely, so the second H+ is not all available. So the total H+ would be 0.3 M from H2SO4, and the second H+ is only partially available. But how much?

Wait, but in the context of neutralization with a strong base, perhaps we can assume that all the H+ from H2SO4 is available. Or does the problem consider that H2SO4 contributes 2 H+ per mole, regardless of the strength of the second dissociation?

If the problem expects us to treat H2SO4 as a strong acid, then each mole gives 2 H+. So, in that case, H2SO4 contributes 0.18 moles of H+. But if the second H+ isn't fully dissociated, then the actual H+ would be less. So this could affect the limiting reagent.

But I think for the purpose of this problem, we're expected to treat H2SO4 as providing 2 H+ per mole, regardless of its actual dissociation. Because in the context of neutralization, the H+ is what reacts with OH-.

So, let's proceed with that.

So, H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol. H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18 mol. Total H+ is 0.28 mol.

OH- is 0.2 mol.

So the OH- will neutralize 0.2 mol of H+. So 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH- react, producing 0.2 moles of water. The remaining H+ is 0.08 mol.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 moles * 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ, but since it's exothermic, it's -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, wait, maybe the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Because sometimes it's given as approximately -57.8 kJ/mol.

Wait, let's recalculate with 57.8 kJ/mol.

0.2 * 57.8 = 11.56 kJ → -11.56 kJ.

Which is close to option B, but option B is in kcal. So option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, but 11.56 kJ is about 2.766 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ, so 11.56 /4.184 ≈ 2.766). Wait, no, wait, 11.56 kJ is 11.56 /4.184 ≈ 2.76 kcal. So that's about -2.76 kcal, which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal). But wait, that can't be right.

Wait, wait, no. Because the enthalpy per mole is -57.8 kJ per mole, so 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57.8) = -11.56 kJ.

So -11.56 kJ is approximately -11.6 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is further from it. So none of the options exactly match.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the moles.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, that's 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 2 OH- per mole, so 0.2 mol OH-.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

OH- = 0.2 mol.

So the reaction between H+ and OH- will consume 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-, producing 0.2 mol H2O.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.8) ≈ -11.56 kJ.

So none of the options exactly match this. Looking at the options again:

Option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm. Let's convert -11.56 kJ to kcal.

11.56 kJ = 11.56 /4.184 ≈ 2.76 kcal. So -2.76 kcal.

Option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close. But that would be the case if the amount was around 2.72 kcal. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, maybe the H2SO4 isn't fully contributing both H+ because the second H+ isn't dissociated. So perhaps the H+ from H2SO4 is only 0.09 mol (since first H+ is 0.09 mol, and second is negligible). Then, total H+ would be 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.09 (from H2SO4) = 0.19.

Then, OH- is 0.2 mol.

So H+ would be 0.19, OH- 0.2. So H+ is limiting. So 0.19 mol H+ reacts with 0.19 mol OH-.

So enthalpy change is 0.19 * (-57.8) ≈ -10.98 kJ → approximately -11.0 kJ.

Wait, but 0.19 * 57.8 = 10.982 → -10.982 kJ → about -11.0 kJ.

Hmm, but again, this isn't matching any of the options. Let me think differently.

Wait, maybe the problem wants the total H+ from all sources, but considering that Ba(OH)2 provides Ba^2+ and OH-.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to calculate the total equivalents of H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 equivalents (since it's monoprotic).

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 equivalents for the first H+ (since each H2SO4 gives 1 equivalent H+ in the first dissociation, and the second is weak). So if we're considering only the first H+ as fully dissociated, then H2SO4 contributes 0.09 equivalents. The second H+ isn't considered here.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → each provides 2 OH- → 0.2 equivalents of OH-.

So total H+ equivalents: 0.1 (HCl) + 0.09 (H2SO4) = 0.19.

OH- equivalents: 0.2.

So the limiting reagent is H+, so all 0.19 H+ will react with 0.19 OH-, producing 0.19 H2O.

Enthalpy change: 0.19 * (-57.8) ≈ -10.98 kJ → approximately -11.0 kJ.

Again, not matching any of the options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) -2.72 kcal → which is about -11.43 kJ.

Because 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 2.72 kcal is 2.72 *4.184 ≈ 11.43 kJ. So option A is -2.72 kcal = -11.43 kJ.

Wait, that's close to our previous calculation of 0.2 *57.8 =11.56 kJ.

Wait, but earlier calculation with H+ from H2SO4 as 0.18 (assuming both H+ dissociate) gave 0.28 H+ → 0.2 reacts, leading to 0.2*57.8=11.56 kJ, which is 11.56 kJ or approximately -11.56 kJ.

But option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.43 kJ.

So, perhaps the intended approach is to assume that all H+ from H2SO4 are available, leading to 0.28 H+, and 0.2 OH-.

So the reaction is 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 OH- reacting, giving 0.2 H2O.

Assuming the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57.8) = -11.56 kJ.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps the problem is using a different ΔH per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps it's using 57 kJ per mole, not 57.8.

0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ.

Which is option B as -11.42 kcal.

Wait, no, because 11.4 kJ is 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72 kcal. So -11.4 kJ is about -2.72 kcal.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.2 moles ×57 kJ/mol =11.4 kJ. So that's -11.4 kJ.

But option D is -16.0 kJ, which is different.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the total volume and then the concentration, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the heat released per mole of reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula for enthalpy change as:

q = n × ΔH

Where ΔH is per mole of reaction.

So the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases 57.8 kJ per mole.

So if 0.2 moles of H+ react, then q = 0.2 × (-57.8) = -11.56 kJ.

But that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem expects the answer in kcal.

So 57.8 kJ is approximately 13.83 kcal (57.8 /4.184 ≈13.83).

So 0.2 moles ×13.83 kcal/mol =2.766 kcal → approximately -2.77 kcal.

Which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal). So perhaps that's the intended answer.

But why? Because the question is asking for enthalpy of neutralization, which is typically in kJ per mole. But the option A is in kcal.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recalculate the moles again to be sure.

HCl: 0.5 L *0.2 M =0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 M= 0.09 mol → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2:0.2 L *0.5 M= 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ is 0.28 mol. OH- is 0.2 mol.

So OH- is limiting. So 0.2 mol H+ reacts with 0.2 mol OH-.

Enthalpy change: 0.2 ×57.8 =11.56 kJ → -11.56 kJ.

But none of the options have that. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, providing 2 OH- per mole, but the reaction may involve more than just H+ and OH-.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the calculation involves the total volume, but I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the Ba^2+ ions as part of the salt, which affects the calculation. But I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, such as -57 kcal/mol.

Wait, 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal. So 57 kJ is about 13.683 kcal.

So 0.2 mol ×57 kJ/mol =11.4 kJ → 2.72 kcal.

So option A is -2.72 kcal, which would correspond to that.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy per mole is taken as -57.8 kJ/mol, and the correct calculation is -11.56 kJ, which is about -2.76 kcal, approximately option A.

So, the answer would be option A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that H2SO4 contributes only one H+ per mole, and the second H+ isn't considered. So H+ from HCl is 0.1, and from H2SO4 is 0.09 (only first H+).

Total H+ = 0.19.

OH- is 0.2.

So H+ is limiting, 0.19 reacting.

Enthalpy change:0.19 ×57.8 =10.98 kJ → 10.98 /4.184 ≈ 2.623 kcal → approximately -2.62 kcal.

Which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal).

Hmm. So perhaps the problem expects us to treat H2SO4 as contributing only one H+ per mole. But that doesn't make much sense because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and the first H+ is completely dissociated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that only one H+ per H2SO4 is available.

In that case, the total H+ would be 0.1 (HCl) +0.09 (H2SO4) =0.19 mol.

OH- is 0.2 mol, so H+ is limiting, 0.19 reacts.

Enthalpy change: 0.19 ×57.8 kJ =10.982 kJ → approximately 10.98 kJ, which is about 2.62 kcal.

But option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about 11.56 kJ (if 2.72 *4.184≈11.43 kJ).

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that 1 mole of H2SO4 provides 1 mole of H+.

But that would be incorrect because H2SO4 in first dissociation gives 2 H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4 as follows:

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.09 mol H+ (assuming only first dissociation).

Total H+: 0.19.

OH-: 0.2 mol.

So, H+ is 0.19, less than OH-.

So all H+ is neutralized, leaving 0.01 mol OH-.

Enthalpy change: 0.19 ×57.8 =10.982 kJ → approximately 10.98 kJ.

Which is about 2.62 kcal → option A is -2.72, which is close.

But why would the problem assume that H2SO4 only contributes one H+?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula where the enthalpy is calculated per mole of H+.

Wait, but I think the key is that the correct approach is to consider both H+ from H2SO4, assuming the first dissociation is complete and the second is not significant, so only 0.09 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

In that case, the total H+ is 0.19, and the OH- is 0.2, so H+ is limiting.

So the enthalpy change is 0.19 ×57.8 ≈10.98 kJ → approximately -11.0 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, -11.42 kcal is approximately -48.0 kJ (11.42 ×4.184≈47.99 kJ). Which doesn't fit with our calculation.

Wait, perhaps another approach: could the problem be considering the total volume and finding the concentration?

Wait, perhaps the total volume after mixing is 500 +300 +200 =1000 mL=1 L.

So concentration of H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol /1 L =0.1 M.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol /1 L =0.09 M H2SO4 → 0.18 M H+.

Total H+ is 0.28 M.

But OH- is 0.2 mol in 1 L → 0.2 M.

So, same as before.

But no, that doesn't change the mole count.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all the H+ from H2SO4, but using a different ΔH per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total enthalpy, not per mole.

Wait, but the options don't align with that.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting the total enthalpy in kilocalories.

So, 0.2 moles ×57.8 kJ/mol =11.56 kJ =11.56 /4.184 ≈2.76 kcal → so the answer would be approximately -2.76 kcal, which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal).

So the correct answer would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that H2SO4 contributes 2 H+ per mole, but the second H+ isn't available, so only 0.09 mol of H+ from H2SO4.

Then total H+ is 0.19, OH- is 0.2.

So 0.19 mol H+ reacts, producing 0.19 mol H2O.

So q =0.19 ×57.8=10.982 kJ → 10.982 /4.184 ≈2.623 kcal → approximately -2.62 kcal.

Which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal).

But option A is more negative.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for ΔH, such as -56.8 kJ/mol.

0.2 ×56.8 =11.36 kJ → 11.36 /4.184 ≈2.714 kcal → -2.714 kcal → which is approximately -2.71 kcal, which is very close to option A (-2.72 kcal).

So that must be the intended answer.

So the correct option is A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl dissociates completely, so moles of H⁺ = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is diprotic, and the first dissociation is complete, contributing 2 H⁺ per molecule.  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, contributing 2 OH⁻ per molecule.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

4. **Determine limiting reagent**:  
   Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, as it will neutralize 0.2 moles of H⁺.

5. **Calculate enthalpy change**:  
   The enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57.8 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   For 0.2 moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ reacting:  
   \( q = 0.2 \times (-57.8) = -11.56 \, \text{kJ} \).

6. **Convert to kcal (if required)**:  
   \( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ} \), so:  
   \( -11.56 \, \text{kJ} = \frac{-11.56}{4.184} \approx -2.76 \, \text{kcal} \).

7. **Match with options**:  
   The closest option to \( -2.76 \, \text{kcal} \) is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

**Critical analysis of options**:  
- **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**: Matches the calculated value when converted to kcal.  
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal)**: Incorrect, as it does not align with the calculated enthalpy in kcal.  
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal)**: Incorrect, as it is far from the calculated value.  
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ)**: Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated \( -11.56 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.  

Answer: A
