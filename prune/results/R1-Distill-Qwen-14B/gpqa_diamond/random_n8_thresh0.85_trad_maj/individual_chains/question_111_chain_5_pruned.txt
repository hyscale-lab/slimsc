Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The problem has two parts, A and B, and I need to figure out the major products for each. The options are given as A and B pairs, so I'll tackle them one at a time.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so maybe it's involved in an elimination reaction or some kind of enolate formation.

Wait, the starting material is a cyclohexanone derivative. The structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw this out mentally. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Then, at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group? Or wait, 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl would mean that carbon 2 has an ethyl and two methyl groups? No, wait, no—the substituents are on 2 and 6. Let me clarify the structure.

So the molecule is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexanone has a substituent on carbon 2 (an ethyl group) and methyl groups on carbons 2 and 6. Wait, no—2,6-dimethyl would mean methyl groups on carbons 2 and 6, and also an ethyl group on 2? So carbon 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl group? Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? No, the formula says 2,6-dimethyl. Wait, maybe the structure is such that the cyclohexanone has a substituent at position 2 (ethyl) and another substituent at position 6 (methyl), and also another methyl at position 2. Hmm, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl, meaning the substituents are on positions 2 (ethyl) and 6 (methyl), with another methyl on position 2? Wait, perhaps the correct structure is that the 2 position has both an ethyl and a methyl group, and the 6 position has another methyl group. So the substituents are on carbons 2 (ethyl and methyl) and 6 (methyl), and the ketone is at position 1.

So the molecule is cyclohexanone with substituents as follows: at position 2, ethyl and methyl; at position 6, methyl. So the ring looks a bit bulky, especially around position 2.

Now, the reaction is with ethyl acrylate and t-BuOK. Ethyl acrylate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, so it's a Michael acceptor. Wait, but t-BuOK is a strong base, so maybe it's deprotonating the ketone to form an enolate.

Wait, but 2-ethyl-2
