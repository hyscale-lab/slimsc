Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C. We're given the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-.

Wait, orthophosphate—I remember that's the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-. So, in solution, phosphoric acid (H3PO4) can donate protons in three steps. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1=7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8), and the third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12). 

So, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about what these salts dissociate into.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate (with some water of crystallization), which dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. 

Wait, but the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That makes me think of the buffer system. Since H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donate a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (gain a proton to become H3PO4). Similarly, HPO4^2- can act as an acid (donate to become PO4^3-) or a base (gain to become H2PO4^-).

But the question is about orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-. So, how much of that is present? Let me think about the equilibrium.

In the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the phosphate species can interconvert. But because PO4^3- is the third dissociation, its concentration will be very low because Ka3 is very small (1.8e-12). But considering that both salts contribute, maybe some PO4^3- is formed.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the moles of each salt first.

Calculating moles:

Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / Mw = 1
