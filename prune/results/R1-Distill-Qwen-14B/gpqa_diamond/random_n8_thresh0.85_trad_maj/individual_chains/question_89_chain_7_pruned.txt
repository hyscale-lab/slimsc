Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then, it goes through several steps, and we need to determine the coupling pattern of a hydrogen in the final product.

Breaking it down:

1. **First Reaction:** Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid. The NMR and IR data are given. So, what's happening here?

I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, an elimination reaction occurs, typically forming an alkene via an E2 mechanism. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the bromines on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. Oh, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure. So, the structure of adamantane is like a diamond crystal structure, with each carbon connected in a way that it's quite rigid.

So, heating with KOH (a strong base) likely leads to an elimination. But wait, since the bromines are on 1 and 3, which are two carbons apart, that would require a dehydrohalogenation across two carbons. Hmm, but usually, E2 requires adjacent leaving groups because the base abstracts a proton that's antiperiplanar to the leaving group, leading to a double bond between the two adjacent carbons. If the bromines are on 1 and 3, maybe some rearrangement happens?

Wait, but if the structure is 1,3-dibromo, perhaps the base can abstract a β-hydrogen from one of the brominated carbons, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, or C2 and C3? Or maybe even a different position?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't an elimination but an SN2 substitution, but with two bromines, maybe both are eliminated. Wait, but KOH is a base, so elimination is more likely.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. I recall that when KOH is used with dihalides, especially if they're on adjacent carbons, you get alkenes. But in this case, since the dihalide is 1,3, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a carbon that's not directly adjacent but allows the formation of a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination leading to the formation of an alkyne? Wait, no, I don't think so because that would require two dehydrohalogenation steps, and that's less common.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to a Br, leading to a double bond. For example, if a hydrogen is abstracted from C2, which is next to C1 (which has Br), then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, releasing HBr. But then what happens to the other Br on C3? Maybe another elimination occurs, but that might require a more specific structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond between C1 and C2, and the other Br on C3 might stay, but that would lead to a mono-brominated product. But since KOH is in excess, perhaps both Brs are eliminated.

Wait, but the product after KOH has an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong peak which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). So, the product is probably an epoxide, ketone, ester, or something with a carbonyl.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it's a double elimination to form an alkyne? Because forming a triple bond would release two equivalents of HBr. Alternatively, forming a ketone via a different process.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a Hofmann elimination, but that typically applies to amines. Alternatively, maybe it's a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that requires a ketone and an oxidizing agent, which isn't present here.

Wait, perhaps it's an alkyne formation. So, if both Brs are removed, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C3. But wait, in the structure of adamantane, the positions are such that C1 and C3 are not adjacent. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about the adamantane structure. Adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond, with each carbon bonded to four others in a cubic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms an epoxide. But that's more when you have an adjacent dihalide. Wait, no, epoxides are usually formed from alcohols via oxidation, but maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl. So, the product is likely a ketone or an ester.

Wait,
