Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and converting sequential algorithms into parallel ones. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one when using higher order finite differences and parallel splitting. The options are A to D. 

I remember from my studies that when solving partial differential equations, especially with methods like finite differences, the approach can be sequential or parallel. For sequential algorithms, you usually process each step one after another. But for parallel processing, you need a way to split the problem into parts that can be computed simultaneously.

Matrix exponential functions are involved in solving these equations because the solutions can often be written in terms of exponentials of matrices, which represent the system's evolution over time. But directly computing the matrix exponential can be computationally intensive, especially for large matrices. So, approximations are used. The question mentions a fractional approximation, which I'm not exactly sure about, but I think it refers to using a fraction of the full matrix or some decomposition method.

The key factor for converting from sequential to parallel probably relates to how the algorithm can be split. Stability analysis (Option A) is important for ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up or become inaccurate, but I'm not sure if it's the key factor for parallelism. Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions (Option B) might affect the setup, but I don't see the direct link to parallel processing.

Options C and D involve fractional approximations. Complex roots and linear partial fractions. Wait, when you approximate the matrix exponential, you might use methods like the Padé approximation, which is a rational function approximation. Padé approximants can sometimes be factored into simpler terms, which might allow for parallel computation because each factor could be computed independently or on different processors.

Alternatively, the term 'parallel splitting' might refer to methods like the splitting of the matrix into submatrices that can be exponentiated separately and then combined. This would require the approximation to allow such a splitting, perhaps through partial fraction decomposition (Option D). Or maybe it's about handling complex roots, which would affect how the approximation is done.

Wait, another thought: when you have a matrix exponential, if the matrix can be diagonalized or decomposed, the computation can be done more efficiently. For example, if the approximation leads to a form that can be split into smaller matrices, each handled by a different processor. This might relate to the roots of the approximation method, like if the approximation has certain properties that make it easy to split.

But I'm a bit confused. Another angle: parallel algorithms often rely on decomposing the problem into independent tasks. If the matrix exponential approximation can be expressed as a sum or product of terms that can be computed in parallel, that would enable parallel processing. So, the existence of such a decomposition would be key.

Looking at the options again, Option D is 'Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation'. Partial fractions decomposition is a method where you break down a complex rational function into simpler fractions. If the approximation of the matrix exponential uses such a decomposition, each fraction could be computed separately in parallel.

Alternatively, Option C says 'Complex roots of fractional approximation'. Complex roots could imply that the approximation is based on a polynomial with complex roots, but how does that relate to parallel processing?
