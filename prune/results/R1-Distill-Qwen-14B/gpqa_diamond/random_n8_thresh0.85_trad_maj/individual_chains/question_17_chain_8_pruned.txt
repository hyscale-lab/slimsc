Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also give the formation constant, K_ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²+], and choose the correct option from A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The reaction is probably something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- or something similar. The formation constant, Kf, is given, which tells me how strong the complex is.

Wait, the formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would typically be written as:
Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-
And Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, in the question, the concentration is given for the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote that as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex will be 0.02 M minus any that dissociates. But wait, since Kf is very large (5x10^10), the complex is very stable. That means it won't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- will be very low.

So, the dissociation reaction would be:
CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-
But the formation constant Kf is the reverse of this, so Kf = 1/(Kd), where Kd is the dissociation constant. So Kf is 5e10, meaning Kd is 2e-11.

Wait, no. Wait, Kf is the formation constant, so the formation equation is the forward reaction. So the dissociation would have a K equal to 1/Kf. So Kd = 1/Kf = 1/(5e10) = 2e-
