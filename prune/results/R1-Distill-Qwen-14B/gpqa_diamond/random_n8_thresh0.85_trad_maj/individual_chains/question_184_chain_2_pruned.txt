Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but let's break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the structure. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (t-Bu), and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). So, numbering the benzene ring: the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. That makes the substituents meta to each other, but wait, no, ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2 (so adjacent to ethoxy), and nitro at 3 (next to tert-butyl). So, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, which are all adjacent, forming a sort of "meta" arrangement but actually adjacent in a way that they're all next to each other. Wait, no, benzene is a ring so positions 1, 2, 3 are consecutive. So the substituents are in 1 (OEt), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (NO2).

So the task is to determine the correct sequence of reactions from the given options that can lead to this structure starting from benzene.

I remember that when substituting on aromatic rings, the order of substitution is important because directing groups influence where new substituents will attach. Benzene is initially activated, but once you add substituents, the ring's reactivity changes depending on the group added.

Let me think about each substituent and their directing effects.

1. tert-butyl group is an alkyl group, which is an activating group. It is a strong activating group because it's a strong electron donor through the inductive effect. Since it's a bulky group, it's a ortho/para director. Wait, wait, no. Alkyl groups are ortho/para directors because they activate the ring, but they are "strong" activating, but in terms of directing, they direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions relative to themselves.

2. Ethoxy group (OEt) is an activating group as well. It's an electron-donating group, so it's also an ortho/para director. However, since it's an ether, it's a strong activating group.

3. Nitro group (NO2) is a deactivating group. It's a meta director because it withdraws electrons through resonance, making the ring less reactive but directing incoming groups to the meta position relative to itself.

But wait, the sequence of adding these groups matters because each new substituent affects where the next one will go.

The target molecule has three substituents: OEt, t-Bu, and NO2. So, I need to figure out the order in which these groups are introduced.

Let me think about the order. Because nitro is deactivating, I probably want to add it last. Because once you add a nitro group, the ring becomes deactivated, making further substitutions harder. Alternatively, maybe not, because sometimes nitration can be done after certain steps. Hmm.

Wait, no. Nitration is a strong deactivating step. So, if you nitrate early, the ring becomes less reactive, making subsequent reactions (like alkylation) harder because they require activating groups. So maybe it's better to nitrate after adding some activating groups.

Wait, but in this target molecule, the nitro is in position 3. So, perhaps the order is adding t-Bu first, then OEt, then nitro? Or another order.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added first, but that would deactive the ring, making it harder to add the other groups. Because benzene is more reactive, maybe it's better to add activating groups first to activate the ring, making it easier to add deactivating groups later.

Wait, but nitration is a powerful reaction. Let me think step by step.

Option D, for example, starts with HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration). So if benzene is nitrated first, then the substituent is in a certain position.

Wait, but benzene on nitration gives nitrobenzene. Then, the next step in option D is Fe/HCl, which is a reduction? Wait, no, Fe/HCl is for something else. Oh, wait, Fe in HCl is probably used for some kind of substitution reaction. Wait, maybe it's a Birch reduction? Or perhaps a catalyst for some reaction. Hmm, not sure.

But thinking back, if you nitrate benzene first, you get nitrobenzene. Then, nitro is a meta director. If you try to add another group, say, tert-butyl, where would it go? Let's say nitro is at position 1. Then adding t-Bu would go to position 3 (meta) or 5 (para?), but wait, benzene is symmetric.

Wait, maybe I should consider each step.

Wait, let's consider the target structure. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, numbering from 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (nitro). So, let me imagine the ring:

Positions 1: OEt,

2: t-Bu,

3: NO2.

So, in the ring, they are in the order 1, 2, 3: OEt is adjacent to t-Bu, which is adjacent to NO2, which is meta to OEt.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this mentally. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's place OEt at position 1. Then, moving clockwise, position 2 is t-Bu, position 3 is NO2.

So, OEt (1), t-Bu (2), NO2 (3). So, OEt is next to t-Bu, and t-Bu is next to NO2. So, substituents are in positions 1,2,3.

But how do these groups influence each other during substitution?

Since the nitro group is deactivating and meta-directing, if I were to add nitro last, the other substituents would have to be already on the ring when adding nitro.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the activating groups first, then the deactivating group.

So, steps:

1. Add tert-butyl group.

2. Add ethoxy group.

3. Nitrate.

But let's see. Alternatively, the order could be: first ethoxy, then t-Bu, then nitro.

Wait, but adding nitro last would make sense because nitration is a strong deactivating step, which could make subsequent reactions difficult. But in our target, we have three substituents, so the nitro is one of them, so maybe it's added last.

Alternatively, perhaps nitro is added at the end, but I need to make sure that during nitration, the ring has activating groups to direct the nitro group to the correct position.

Wait, perhaps the order is: tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitration.

Wait, let's think about each step.

Starting with benzene.

Step 1: Alkylation with tert-butyl chloride using AlCl3 as a catalyst. This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The benzene would react
