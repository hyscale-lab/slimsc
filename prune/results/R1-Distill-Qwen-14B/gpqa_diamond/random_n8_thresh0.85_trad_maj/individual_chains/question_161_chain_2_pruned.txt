Okay, so Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. That's a pretty advanced piece of equipment, right? I remember from my studies that these microscopes use electrons to create images with much higher resolution than optical microscopes because electrons have shorter wavelengths. But wait, the question is about the vacuum in the sample compartment and how it affects the mean free path of gas molecules.

Mike used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. But even with that, some gas particles were still present, detected by a mass spectrometer. He calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules.

Now, when he started the electron beam, he noticed that the mean free path changed to λ2. But the temperature remained the same, so temperature isn't a variable here. So why would λ2 be different from λ1?

Hmm, I think the mean free path formula is important here. The mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(√2 * n * d), where n is the number density of the gas, and d is the average diameter of the molecules. Alternatively, another formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where P is pressure, T is temperature, and d is the diameter. Or wait, another version: λ = (1) / (n * σ), where σ is the collision cross-section. But I might be mixing some terms here.

Wait, the mean free path can also be expressed in terms of pressure and temperature. Oh right, the formula: λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d² * P). Since pressure P is involved here, and Mike's setup is under vacuum, but some gas remains.

But when the electron beam is on, does that affect the gas? Oh, because the electron beam might cause the gas molecules to ionize or get excited. Or maybe it heats the gas? Wait, but the temperature is the same according to the problem, so maybe it's not about thermal expansion or change in temperature affecting the mean free path.

Another angle: the electron beam might cause scattering of the gas molecules. Wait, but the question says that the mean free path based on electron scattering changed. So in the presence of the electron beam, the gas molecules are now interacting more or less with the electrons, which could mean that the effective collisions change.

Wait, but the mean free path is generally calculated considering collisions between gas molecules. But here, the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to lose electrons (ionization), which would make them charged. Charged particles interact more strongly with each other and with the microscope's components. So, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might become ions, increasing their cross-sectional area for collisions, or perhaps causing them to stick to surfaces, or be removed from the system.

Wait, but if the gas becomes ionized, their mean free path would change. Oh, but wait, the presence of an electron beam would likely cause the gas to ionize, creating plasma. In a plasma, the mean free path might be longer or shorter? Hmm.

Wait, in a plasma, the ions and electrons are free to move. But if the electron beam is causing
