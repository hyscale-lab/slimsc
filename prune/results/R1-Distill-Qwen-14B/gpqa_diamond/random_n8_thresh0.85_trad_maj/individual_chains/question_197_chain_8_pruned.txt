Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out what product it forms when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D, which are all different benzene derivatives with substituents.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch or maybe an N-H. But given that there's a 1720 cm-1 peak, I'm more thinking it's an O-H in a carbonyl group. Wait, 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that could be a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or acid.

Looking at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating to 1H. That's a strong indicator of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Also, a broad singlet might suggest something else, like a phenolic OH, but that's usually lower, like around 5 ppm. Hmm, but wait, another possibility is a carboxylic acid proton, which can be around 10-12 ppm. But wait, carboxylic acids also have broad peaks because of the exchange with water. But in the IR, there's a peak at 3400–2500, which could be the O-H from a carboxylic acid. So maybe that's the case.

But let me not jump to conclusions yet. Looking at the other NMR peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The protons adjacent to the substituent would be as a doublet. For example, if there's an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl attached, the ring protons would split into doublets. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring with a substituent at the para position that's a carbonyl group, like a ketone or acid.

The other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's parse this. The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 3H suggests a methyl group at the end of a chain, like a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group or something. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) suggests a CH(CH3) group, maybe as a branch. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to branching. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) might be a CH group next to branching.

Putting this together, the substituent on the benzene is probably a carbonyl group connected to a branched chain. Let's think: the substituent on the benzene might be a ketone (like an acetyl group), but wait, the 2.9 ppm peak is a multiplet integrating for 1H, which might be a CH group adjacent to branching. Wait, perhaps it's a propionyl group. Let's see: if the substituent is a ketone R-CO- attached to the benzene, then the R group would be a branched chain.

Looking at the H NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak could be an aldehyde proton (if it's an aldehyde group attached to the benzene), but the IR at 1720 would fit a carbonyl, like an aldehyde (which has higher C=O frequencies, around 1720-1710 typically). Alternatively, a
