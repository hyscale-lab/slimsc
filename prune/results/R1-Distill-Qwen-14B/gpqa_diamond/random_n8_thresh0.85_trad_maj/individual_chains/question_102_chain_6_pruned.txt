Okay, so I've got this science question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The experiment involves a bicistronic vector with specific constructs and then looking at mouse models. The main issue is that after some crosses and testing, they didn't see a green signal under the confocal microscope. So, why didn't the eGFP show up?

First, I'll try to understand the setup. They created a bicistronic vector, which means it has two ORFs (open reading frames) in one construct. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. 

Stop cassettes are in place. The ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP between it and mCherry. The receptor has lox2272-stop-lox2272 before eGFP. So, these stop signals are in place, but they can be removed using Cre recombinase, which recognizes the loxP sites. 

They used lox-Cre vectors, so I think when Cre is expressed, it would excise the stop cassettes, allowing the ORFs to be expressed. The antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, so presumably, they can detect the ligand and receptor on Western blot.

In the experiment, they transfected primary astrocyte cultures. If the construct is working, the ligand (with mCherry) and receptor (with eGFP) should be expressed. On Western blot, actin is used as a loading control, and the signals are proportional, so I think that part is fine.

Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct, on a wild-type background. They crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre would be active in neural crest cells, I think. The idea is that Cre would excise the stop cassettes in those cells, leading to expression of ligand and receptor.

But when they looked under the confocal, they didn't see green. The eGFP didn't light up. So, what went wrong?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But that doesn't directly explain why eGFP isn't expressed. The question is about expression, not function. So maybe not A.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. If the protein wasn't properly trafficked, maybe it didn't get to the cell surface. But wait, the expression was tested in primary astrocytes. If it's transfected, maybe the expression is transient? Or maybe in the mouse model, the expression wasn't happening due to the construct. Also, the issue here is the expression in the mice. But the Western blot was done after transfection, so maybe that's not the problem here. The question is about the mouse model, so perhaps in the mouse, the construct isn't working.

Option C: Enhancer for expression is missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter. The CBA promoter is a strong, constitutive promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which is a weaker promoter, maybe. Wait, the question says the ligand is under CBA, and upstream of the receptor is IRES. So the ligand's expression is driven by CBA, and the receptor's expression is under IRES. But if the enhancer is missing, that would affect expression. Wait, the setup uses a bicistronic vector, so with IRES. IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so they allow for the expression of the second gene after the first, without requiring a polyA signal. So the receptor should be expressed after the ligand. But if the enhancer is missing, maybe neither is being expressed. But the question says that after transfection, they had antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So during transfection, they probably expressed both. But in the mouse model, perhaps the expression isn't happening because the regulatory elements are not present in the germline context. Maybe the CBA promoter isn't active in the tissues they're looking at. But the question says the mice are homozygous for the construct in the wt background. So perhaps the CBA promoter isn't active in the neural crest cells, so the ligand and receptor aren't expressed. That could explain why eGFP isn't detected.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the OR
