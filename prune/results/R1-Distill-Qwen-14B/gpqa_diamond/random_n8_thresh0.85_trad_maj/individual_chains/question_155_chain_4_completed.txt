Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the uncertainty in P_z, which is ΔP_z. Hmm, let me see. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z are provided, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. 

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩, then find the square root of their difference.

But first, I should probably represent the state vector correctly. The state is a column vector (I'll denote it as |ψ⟩) given by ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me double-check if this vector is normalized. The sum of the squares: ( (-1/2)^2 ) + ( (1/√2)^2 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 ) → 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 is 1/2, plus 1/2 makes 1. Oh, right, so it's normalized. Good.

Next, I need to find the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, the matrix is diagonal. So, the matrix P_z is diagonal with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ). So, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, wait. The state vector is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, right? So, the components of |ψ⟩ directly give the coefficients in that basis. So, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of each component squared multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

So each component of the state |ψ⟩ is [a, b, c], where a = -1/2, b=1/√2, c= -1/2. The probabilities are |a|^2, |b|^2, |c|^2.

Calculating |a|^2: (1/2)^2 = 1/4. |b|^2: (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. |c|^2: 1/4.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) → (1/4 - 1/4) * ħ → 0. Because 1/4 ħ minus 1/4 ħ equals zero. So ⟨P_z⟩ = 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. Now, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is also diagonal, with each element squared. So the eigenvalues of P_z² would be (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2 → ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of |a|^2*(ħ^2) + |b|^2*(0) + |c|^2*(ħ^2).

Calculating:

(1/4)* (ħ²) + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(ħ²) → (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² → (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). We already have ⟨P_z⟩ as 0, so ΔP_z = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ² / 2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So that's the answer.

Wait, just to make sure. Another way to get the expectation value is to compute ψ† P_z ψ. Let me compute that.

P_z is a diagonal matrix:

[ [ħ, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -ħ] ]

So when I multiply ψ† (which is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]) times P_z, I get [ -1/2 * ħ, 0, 1/2 * ħ ]

Then, multiply by ψ (which is the same as ψ† transposed, [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T ):

Wait, no, perhaps matrix multiplication would be better. Alternatively, since the basis is diagonal, the expectation value is the sum of probabilities times eigenvalues.

Wait, I think I already did that correctly. So, I'm confident that the uncertainty is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Normalize the state vector
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The components of $|\psi\rangle$ are already normalized, as the sum of the squares of the components is:

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ are the probabilities (squares of the components of $|\psi\rangle$), and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. The components of $|\psi\rangle$ are:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\lambda_1 = \hbar$, $\lambda_2 = 0$, and $\lambda_3 = -\hbar$. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 4: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
