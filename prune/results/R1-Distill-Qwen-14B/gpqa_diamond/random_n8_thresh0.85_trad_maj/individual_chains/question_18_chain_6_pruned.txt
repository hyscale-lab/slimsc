Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on stellar abundances, but let's see what I can remember.

The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Both stars have masses greater than our Sun, but that might not directly affect the calculation. The key data given are their elemental abundances using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. But I'm not too sure about thatâ€”maybe it's just a method to determine abundances. Anyway, the main points are the abundance ratios and then figuring out the silicon ratio.

Let me jot down the given data:

Star_1:
- Mass: 1.5 solar masses
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

Star_2:
- Mass: 1.2 solar masses
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, wait. I need to calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of these two stars. So, [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], or vice versa? Or maybe the ratio of silicon to hydrogen in each and then take the ratio of those.

Wait, the question says the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres. So I think that would be n_Si,1 / n_Si,2, where n is number density.

But to get that, I might need to find the silicon abundance in each star relative to hydrogen, and then compute their ratio.

But how do I get [Si/H] for each star?

Wait, [X/Fe] is the logarithm of (X/Fe) relative to the Sun. Similarly, [Fe/H] is [Fe/H]_sun. Wait, no. The notation in stellar abundances is that [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So, when [X/Y] is given, it's the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y compared to the solar ratio.

Wait, no, the way I remember it, [X/Y] = log (n_X / n_Y) - log (n_X,sun / n_Y,sun) ). So [X/Y] = log( (n_X / n
