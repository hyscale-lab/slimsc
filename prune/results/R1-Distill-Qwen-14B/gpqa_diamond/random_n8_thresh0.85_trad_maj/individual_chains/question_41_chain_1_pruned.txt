Okay, so I'm trying to answer this physics question about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me think. The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. I'm supposed to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that in physics, when dealing with objects moving relative to each other, you have to consider reference frames. Oh right, the glass is moving, so maybe I need to combine the velocities somehow.

So the speed of light in the glass when the glass is stationary is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in that medium. So normally, when the glass isn't moving, the speed is v_light = c/n.

But in this case, the glass is moving. So how does that affect the speed as measured by someone in the lab? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think it's related to the addition of velocities in special relativity, but wait, is this situation within the non-relativistic realm or not? Hmm, the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v, which is presumably much less than the speed of light, because otherwise relativistic effects would complicate things. But maybe the approach is similar regardless.

Wait, in classical mechanics, when objects move relative to each other, their velocities add up. Like, if a car is moving at speed u and you're on the ground, then someone on the car sees things differently. But for light, that's different because of relativity. Wait, but light's speed is always c in a vacuum regardless of the observer's motion. So how does that apply here?

Wait, the glass is moving, and light is inside the glass. So the medium itself is moving. Hmm. I think this is a case where we have to consider the velocity of the medium relative to the observer and how it affects the light's speed.

Wait, let me think from the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass. So the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving.

But the speed of light in the glass when it's stationary is c/n, which is less than c. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v, but the light is moving through it. So how does that affect the observed speed of the light?

Wait,
