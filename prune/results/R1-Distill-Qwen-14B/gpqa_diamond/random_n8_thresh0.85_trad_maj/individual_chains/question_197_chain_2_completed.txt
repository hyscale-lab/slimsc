Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what we've got. The question is about identifying a final product after a reaction. The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups. Oh right, maybe it's related to the hydrolysis of an ester or a nitrile? Or wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe it's about the dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions?

Wait, I think red phosphorus and HI is typically used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, particularly in the formation of alkenes via the elimination mechanism. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe it's about the hydrolysis of a nitrile group. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI is often used for the dehydration of alcohols, but that might not fit here.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the IR and NMR data of compound X first to figure out what it is before it reacts. The IR data has peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But then there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be from aromatic C=C stretching. So putting that together, maybe compound X is an aromatic ester or a ketone with an O-H group?

Wait, but the NMR data. Let me look at that. The 1H NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton? Or maybe an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but then in the IR, we don't see a broad peak around 2500-3000 for a carboxylic acid O-H. Oh wait, the IR range given is 3400–2500, which is a broad region. Carboxylic acid O-H would show up around 2500-3300, maybe a broad peak. But the IR data here includes 3400–2500, so perhaps there's an O-H stretch in there. But the problem is, the IR data also has 1720, which could be a carbonyl group, like an ester, ketone, or maybe an acid.

Wait, but if the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is very downfield. For a proton, that's really high. Aldehydes are around 9-10. Maybe that's an aldehyde. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, but a singlet. If it's a broad singlet, maybe it's an acidic proton, like an aldehyde or a phenolic OH. Wait, but phenolic OHs are usually broader and maybe around 5-8 ppm, but that might vary with substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but then the IR would show a broad O-H around 2500-3000, right?

Wait, the IR spectrum here includes 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad area. So perhaps there's a strong absorption in that region, maybe an O-H stretch. So, the compound could have a hydroxyl group. If the 1H NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, that's a bit high for a simple aldehyde, but maybe it's an aldehyde in an aromatic compound. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl group? Or perhaps a conjugated system?

Looking at the other NMR peaks. There's 8.0 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm as another doublet (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, maybe para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Because the two doublets are each integrating to two protons, perhaps it's a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, each substituent causing the neighboring protons to split into doublets.

Then, looking at the other peaks. 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Hmm. Let's think about these. The 0.9 ppm triplet (t, 3H) is probably a methyl group attached to something with two neighboring protons, like a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, no, a triplet at 0.9 could be a terminal CH3, like in an ethyl group. The 1.4 ppm doublet with 3H is a methyl group attached to something. Maybe like a CH(CH3) group. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (m, 2H) could be two adjacent CH2 groups, perhaps in a chain. And the 2.9 ppm multiplet (m, 1H) might be a CH group adjacent to some branching or maybe part of an ester or amide group.

Putting all of this together, the structure might be something like an aromatic ring with two substituents in the para positions. One substituent could be a methyl group, and the other might be a longer chain. The chain would perhaps be a -CH2CH(CH3)2 or something. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a CH3 group attached to a CH that's split into a doublet. So, maybe it's a CH(CH3) group where the CH is connected to another CH2. For example, if we have a propyl group with branching, like -CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be that CH group. Let's see: the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of one proton. So perhaps it's a CH attached to another group. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

So, the aromatic part is para-substituted, maybe with a methyl group and another group that's a longer chain. Let's say it's 4-(something) toluene. The substituent on the benzene is a group that has a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 structure? Wait, but the NMR doesn't show all that.

Wait, let's think about the substituent chain. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2 group adjacent to something. If the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, perhaps a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So, the substituent would be -CH(CH2CH2CH3) or something else.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a butyl group with a branch. Let's think: the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group. So, that's like a CH2CH2CH2CH3, but wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9, which is a CH3 attached to a CH2. So, that's likely part of an ethyl or longer chain. Then the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a -CH2- group adjacent to a branch. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. So, putting it together: we have a CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, but the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of one proton. So, perhaps we have a structure like -CH(CH2CH2CH3) attached to the benzene ring? Or maybe -CH(CH(CH3)2)?

Wait, let me map the substituent. Let me imagine the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene. Then, the CH2 group (the one closer to benzene) would have two protons, which would appear as a triplet or quartet. But in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, perhaps a CH2 next to a CH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the benzene has a substituent at the para position which is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But then, the NMR peaks would be:

The CH(CH2CH2CH3) would have the CH (the 2.9 ppm, m, 1H)
Then, the adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
The terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)
Wait, but then the branching would be such that the CH group has a CH2CH2CH3.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the integration. Let's see: the aromatic protons are 2H each, so the substituent is a single group on the benzene ring. So, if the benzene has a methyl group and another substituent, perhaps a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the NMR data. The 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which could be an aldehyde proton. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10. If it's an aldehyde, perhaps the compound is an aromatic aldehyde. But then, the IR would have a strong C=O peak at around 1720, which would fit an aldehyde as well, but aldehydes typically have lower C=O wavenumbers, around 1710-1740 cm-1. So that fits.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which is more like an aldehyde. So maybe the compound has a benzaldehyde group. Wait, but then the other substituent would be where?

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 is a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, but I thought carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12, but more like 10-12. But in the NMR, the 10.5 is a singlet and it's broad. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the IR would show a broad O-H around 2500-3000, which is in the given IR data (3400–2500). So maybe this is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the IR also has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, so 1720 would fit. So perhaps compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

So, putting this together: the compound is a para-substituted benzoic acid. The substituent on the benzene ring is a group that has a branching. Let me see the substituent's NMR.

The substituent has:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH group connected to a CH2 and another group.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): likely a CH2 group connected to the CH and another group.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to the CH group.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a CH3 at the end of a chain, like an ethyl group.

So, the substituent structure could be -CH(CH2CH2CH3). Wait, but that would be a pentyl group? Or perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH3)2 group. Wait, let's think about it.

Wait, the substituent would be a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the CH is at 2.9 ppm, the adjacent CH2 is at 1.7, and the end CH3 is at 0.9 ppm (t). But wait, that would require the substituent to be a four-carbon group: benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3). But then, the structure would have:

Benzene ring with a substituent at the para position, which is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Let me draw that.

So, the benzene has a COOH group (if that's the case) and a substituent at the opposite position. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the substituent as a butyl group with a branch. For example, a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, a sec-butyl is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, wait. The structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. Wait, no, that's isobutyl. Let me clarify:

- n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH2-
- iso-butyl (or 2-butyl): -CH(CH2CH3)-
Wait, no, iso-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, no. Wait, no, iso-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)-, but attached where?

Wait, it's getting a bit confusing. Let me think again about the substituent. The substituent has a CH group (2.9 ppm), which is connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm), which is connected to a CH3 (0.9 ppm, triplet). Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm suggests that the CH3 is attached to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2 group. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group? But that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. But then, the CH(CH3) would have the CH3 attached. The CH2 would be next to that. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the CH at 2.9 ppm is attached to a CH2 group (1.7 ppm) and a CH2CH2CH3 group (0.9 ppm, triplet). That would make sense because the CH2CH2CH3 would have the terminal CH3 as a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH2). So the substituent would be a propyl group attached to a CH group, which is attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but let's structure it as benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3). So, the substituent is a propyl group attached to a CH, which is on the benzene.

Now, considering the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is the CH group, which is attached to the benzene and the CH2CH2CH3. The adjacent CH2 (from CH2CH2CH3) would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), and the terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

So, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent is a 3-propyl group attached via a CH.

Wait, but then the substituent would be a butyl group? No, wait, it's a propyl group attached to a CH.

So, the substituent would be -CH2CH2CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to the benzene. But then, how does that fit with the other substituent on the benzene?

Wait, the aromatic part has two substituents. Wait, earlier I thought it was para-substituted, so maybe the benzene has two groups: one is a substituent (like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)) and another group, perhaps a COOH or something else.

Wait, but looking back at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet of one proton. If that's a carboxylic acid, then the structure would be a para-substituted benzene with a COOH group and another substituent, which is the -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, but then the IR would have the O-H from the COOH in the 3400–2500 region, which matches the data. The 1720 cm-1 would be the C=O of the COOH.

So, putting it all together, the structure of compound X is 4-(propyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituents are COOH at position 1 and a propyl group at position 4 (para). But wait, the substituent is actually a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, not a straight propyl. So, the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to a longer chain?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent on the benzene is a pentyl group? No, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3) group. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH2CH3 group, but that would be a straight n-butyl, but the NMR doesn't show all the CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, another approach: let's count the number of protons. The substituent has 1H (2.9 ppm), 2H (1.7 ppm), 3H (1.4 ppm), and 3H (0.9 ppm). So that's 1+2+3+3=9 H in the substituent. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the substituent is likely a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent is a propyl group attached to a CH, making a four-carbon group. Wait, but the substituent is attached as a single group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-. But then, the NMR would show the CH(CH3) as the 2.9 ppm proton, the adjacent CH2 as 1.7 ppm, and the CH3 as 1.4 ppm. But what about the 0.9 ppm peak? Hmm, that's a problem because that would require another CH3 group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent is a propyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to the benzene. Then, the substituent has:

CH (2.9 ppm, 1H)
CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H)
CH2CH2CH3 (but wait, the CH2CH2CH3 would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm for the end CH3, and the adjacent CH2 would be split into a quartet. But in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, and the 0.9 is triplet.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Let me see. Then, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. The benzene ring is attached to a CH2, then a CH which is attached to another CH2CH3 group.

In that case, the NMR would show:

The CH (attached to benzene) at around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
The adjacent CH2 (from benzene-CH2-CH(...)) at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
The CH2CH3 group would have the CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), and the adjacent CH2 would be split into a quartet. Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which is 3H. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the structure is benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH. But wait, the substituent would be at para position, so the benzene would have a COOH and a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group in para positions.

But wait, the NMR has a peak at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). So, a doublet for 3H, which suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. So, that would fit a -CH(CH3) group. But wait, if the substituent is CH(CH3), then the CH3 would be at 1.4 ppm as a doublet, and the CH would be at 2.9 ppm.

But wait, in that case, the substituent would be a -CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Wait, no, that's getting confusing. Maybe it's better to think that the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, where the CH2CH2CH3 is a propyl group. So, the substituent is a propyl group attached via a CH. Then, the NMR would have:

- CH (2.9 ppm, 1H)
- CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H)
- CH2CH2CH3: the terminal CH3 would appear as a triplet at 0.9 ppm, and the adjacent CH2 would be a quartet. But in the NMR, there's no quartet, only a triplet and a doublet.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to think of the substituent as a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. That would make the substituent a butyl group with a branch. So, the substituent is a pentyl group? No, it's a four-carbon substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, which is a propyl group attached to a CH. So, the substituent is a pentyl group, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, that would be a neopentyl group. Let me see: -CH2-C(CH3)2. So, the substituent is attached as a CH2-C(CH3)2 group. But the NMR doesn't show a triplet at around 1.4 ppm for a methyl group attached to a CH.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d, 3H), which suggests a CH3 attached to a CH group. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)- group, but that would require another part. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the options given to see if any match the structure we're thinking of.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, let's look at each option.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The structure would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position. The benzoic acid would have a COOH group, and the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

What's a sec-butyl group? It's -CH2-CH(CH3)-. So, the substituent is a four-carbon group attached via the second carbon. So, the structure is:

Ph-COOH (para to) -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, no, the substituent is a sec-butyl, which is -CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-, but attached to the benzene where? The substituent would be attached to the benzene at the second carbon of the butyl group. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-. Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-? No, wait.

Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is actually CH2CH(CH3)-. So, it's a three-carbon group where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group? No, butyl is four carbons. So, the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-? No, that's a pentyl group. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the terminology.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a four-carbon group in which the point of attachment is the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it.

Butyl groups:

- n-butyl: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- (attached at the first carbon)
- iso-butyl (or 2-butyl): CH2-CH(CH3)- (attached at the second carbon)
- tert-butyl: C(CH3)3 (attached at the third carbon)

So, a sec-butyl group is the iso-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is a three-carbon group where the middle carbon is attached to the benzene and has a methyl group.

So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene ring. So, when this group is attached to the benzene, the structure is:

Benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group at position 4 (para).

Now, what would the NMR look like for this structure?

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. So, the CH(CH3) would be the CH group at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). The CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). And the CH2 group (from the substituent) would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) due to the adjacent CH(CH3) group? Wait, no, because the CH2 is attached to the benzene, which is not a CH2 group. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. So, the benzene is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH group (with a CH3), which is attached to another CH2? Or wait, no, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-, meaning it's a two-carbon chain attached to the benzene. Wait, that can't be right because butyl is four carbons. Hmm, I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. So, the substituent is a propyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is a four-carbon group: benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. In this case, the NMR would show:

- The CH group at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
- The adjacent CH2 group (from CH2CH2CH3) at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
- The CH3 at the end of the chain at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)
- And the CH3 attached to the CH (1.4 ppm, d, 3H). Wait, but that doesn't fit because the substituent is a propyl group, so the CH3 would be at the end, not as a doublet.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think of the substituent as a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene. Then, the CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). The adjacent CH2 (from the CH2-CH(CH3)- group) would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). The CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). And the CH2 group attached to the benzene would have another CH3? No, because it's a CH2-CH(CH3)-, so the CH2 is between the benzene and the CH(CH3). Wait, but the CH2 would be a triplet or quartet, but in the NMR, we don't have that.

Wait, perhaps in the substituent, the CH2 is connected to the benzene and to the CH(CH3) group. So, the CH2 group (the one attached to the benzene) would be a quartet because it's next to a CH(CH3) group with a CH. But in the NMR, there's a peak at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which is perhaps the CH2 group next to the CH.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure would have a benzoic acid group (COOH) at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene.

In this structure, the COOH would give the 10.5 ppm peak (singlet, 1H). The aromatic protons would be two doublets (d, 2H each) at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, indicating a para-substituted benzene.

The substituent (sec-butyl) would have:

- The CH group (from CH(CH3)) at around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
- The adjacent CH2 (from CH2-CH(CH3)) at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
- The CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)
- The CH2 attached to the benzene would have another group, but in this case, it's connected to the benzene, so it wouldn't have a CH3 attached. Wait, but in the NMR, there's a 0.9 ppm triplet (3H), which suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2. So, perhaps the substituent is longer than I thought.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent is a propyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to the benzene. Then, the NMR would have:

- CH at 2.9 ppm (1H)
- CH2 (from CH2CH2CH3) at 1.7 ppm (2H)
- CH2CH2CH3: the terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)
- The CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)

So that fits. So, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene. And the benzene also has a COOH group in the para position.

So, the structure of compound X is 4-(3-propyl)benzoic acid, or more accurately, 4-(propan-2-yl)benzoic acid. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact IUPAC name.

Now, the reaction: compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What does that reaction do? I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to form amines, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, they are used for the elimination of HX from an alcohol to form an alkene. Wait, but here, compound X doesn't seem to be an alcohol.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydrolysis of esters. Esters can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using aqueous acid or base. But I don't think that's the case here because the product would still be a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another possibility: if compound X is a nitrile, then red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze it to an amine. But in this case, the starting compound doesn't seem to have a nitrile group because the IR doesn't show a strong peak around 2200 cm-1, which is typical for nitriles.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration. If compound X has an alcohol group, then red phosphorus and HI could dehydrate it to form an alkene. But in this case, the IR doesn't show a broad peak for an OH stretch, except perhaps the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the reaction wrong. Let me think again.

Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides to form alkenes via an elimination reaction. Wait, that's the formation of alkenes from vicinal dihalides, perhaps. Alternatively, in the presence of an alcohol and HI, it can lead to the formation of an alkene.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting compound X is an ester. Because the IR shows a strong carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which fits an ester. Esters typically have a carbonyl around 1720-1740 cm-1. So, if compound X is an ester, reacting it with red phosphorus and HI could lead to its hydrolysis. But under what conditions? Usually, hydrolysis of esters can be acidic or basic. But red phosphorus and HI is more of a HX addition or elimination scenario.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a substitution. For example, if compound X has a good leaving group, like a tosylate or a bromide, then HI could perform an SN2 substitution. But I don't see any indication of that in the IR or NMR data.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound X is a benzoyl chloride or another acid chloride. But the IR at 1720 would fit, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would correspond to a chloride.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution, but that's more typical of esters or amides.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the conversion of an ester to a carboxylic acid. But that would require aqueous acid or base, not necessarily red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction or some kind of elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something similar, but that usually involves amines.

I'm getting stuck on the reaction part. Let me think again. The starting material has a COOH group and a substituent which is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the HI acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl group of the ester (if it were an ester) but in this case, it's a carboxylic acid. So, perhaps the reaction isn't hydrolysis.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the substituent is a good leaving group? Like a bromide. Then, HI could perform an alkylation. But I don't see any indication of a leaving group in the NMR, as there's no peak that would suggest a Br or I substitution.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. But red phosphorus isn't typically used for reductions. Maybe it's part of a Clemmensen reduction, but that usually involves Zn(Hg) and HCl, not HI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the hydroxyl group is replaced. For example, if the COOH group were an ester, then HI could perform an acid-catalyzed substitution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid to an acid chloride, but that would require something like SOCl2, not red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm, I'm not making progress on the reaction part. Let me think about the options again. The options are all aromatic compounds with substituents, some being acids, some being alkyl groups.

The reaction is between compound X and red phosphorus and HI. Let's think about what the reaction would do to a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, if compound X is a benzoic acid, reacting with HI in the presence of red phosphorus might not do much. But perhaps it's a substitution on the substituent.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester. For example, if the substituent is a propyl ester, then HI might hydrolyze it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it to an amine. But again, I don't see nitrile peaks in the IR.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an elimination reaction. If the substituent has a hydroxyl group, then elimination with HI would form an alkene. But in the NMR, there's a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a singlet, perhaps a carboxylic acid, not an alcohol.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the substituent has an alcohol group, and the reaction converts it into a leaving group, leading to elimination. For example, if the substituent is a -CH(CH2OH) group, then treatment with HI could lead to the formation of a double bond.

But in the NMR, there's no broad peak around 1-2 ppm that would indicate an alcohol. The 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which I thought was a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a bromoalkyl group, and the reaction is a substitution where the bromide is replaced by something else. But I don't see any peaks in the NMR that would suggest a bromine.

Hmm, perhaps I should step back. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Another possibility: red phosphorus and HI can be used to convert alcohols to alkenes via the elimination reaction (like the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction, but that's more about using phosphonates). Alternatively, in the presence of an alcohol, red phosphorus and HI can dehydrate it to form an alkene.

So, if compound X has an alcohol group in the substituent, the reaction would form an alkene. So, the product would have a double bond in the substituent.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group.

Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which is similar to option D but perhaps a different substituent.

Option C is a benzoic acid, which would have a COOH group, which doesn't fit if the reaction is elimination.

Option A is a propanoic acid with a substituent, which would require a different reaction.

Wait, but the starting material has a COOH group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group. So, if the substituent is a bromoalkyl group, elimination would form an alkene.

But I'm not seeing a bromine in the starting data. So maybe the substituent is something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a bromide at the end. Then, elimination with HI would form a double bond.

Alternatively, if the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH2-X group, where X is a leaving group, then elimination would form a double bond.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Let me try to think about the options again.

If compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? Well, benzoic acid doesn't react under those conditions, I think. Unless the substituent has a leaving group. But if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH3)-, then there's no leaving group. So, maybe the reaction doesn't affect the substituent but does something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the benzoic acid into something else. For example, maybe it's an acid chloride formation, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl. But benzoic acid is not very reactive towards nucleophiles unless activated, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation. Benzoic acid can undergo decarboxylation under certain conditions, but I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI would do that. Decarboxylation usually requires heat and a base or acid catalyst.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the conversion of the COOH group into something else, like a methyl ester, but that would require a different reagent.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI: another use is in the hydroboration of alkynes, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, I've found a possible reaction: red phosphorus and HI can be used to dehydrate alcohols to form alkenes. For example, if the starting material has an alcohol group, the reaction would eliminate water, forming a double bond.

So, if compound X has an alcohol group in the substituent, the reaction would form an alkene. Looking back at the NMR, the starting material has a 10.5 ppm peak, which I thought was a carboxylic acid. But if it's an alcohol, maybe the 10.5 ppm is a hydroxyl proton. Wait, but hydroxyl protons in alcohols are usually around 1-5 ppm, broad singlets. So the 10.5 ppm is more likely a carbonyl group, like an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a secondary alcohol. For example, the substituent is a -CH(CH2OH) group. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would eliminate the hydroxyl group and form a double bond.

In that case, the product would have a double bond in the substituent, making it an alkene.

But looking at the options, only option C is a benzoic acid, which doesn't fit if the reaction is elimination. So perhaps the starting material isn't a benzoic acid.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in identifying the starting material. Let's re-examine the IR and NMR.

IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That could be an ester or a ketone. The NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be an aldehyde. So, perhaps the starting material is a para-substituted benzaldehyde with an ester group.

Wait, if the starting material is a benzaldehyde with an ester substituent, then the IR would have the aldehyde's C=O around 1720, and the aldehyde proton at 10.5 ppm. The ester's carbonyl would also be around 1720, but perhaps the aldehyde's is a bit lower.

But I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If that's the starting material, what would the reaction do? If the reaction is elimination, perhaps it would form a double bond. But benzoic acid doesn't have a leaving group in the substituent.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the reaction. If the substituent is a secondary alcohol, reacting with HI and red phosphorus would eliminate to form an alkene. So, the product would be an alkene.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a xylene derivative with a sec-butyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the substituent in the product is an alkyl group. So, if the reaction converts a hydroxyl group into a double bond, the product would have an alkene in the substituent. But none of the options seem to have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. For example, if the substituent is a bromoalkyl group, HI could substitute it with a hydrogen, but that would just remove the bromine.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an ether. But I don't see any indication of that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing the point entirely. Let me try to think of the reaction from a different angle.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines. The reaction is:

R-C≡N + H3PO3 → R-CH2-NH2

But in this case, the starting material doesn't have a nitrile group, so that's not it.

Wait, another use: red phosphorus and HI can be used to dehalogenate vicinal dihalides to form alkenes. For example, if the substituent has two adjacent halogen atoms, the reaction would eliminate them to form a double bond.

But in the starting material's NMR, there's no indication of halogen peaks, so that might not apply.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another way. Let's think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the reaction is hydrolysis, but the starting material is already a carboxylic acid, perhaps nothing happens. So, the product might still be benzoic acid, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride, but that's usually done with SOCl2 or POCl3, not red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid anhydride, but again, not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material is an ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to a carboxylic acid. But option C is a carboxylic acid, so that might be the case.

Wait, if the starting material is an ester, then reacting it with HI and red phosphorus might hydrolyze it. But usually, esters hydrolyze with acid or base, not with red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of an ester to a carboxylic acid. If the starting material is an ester, the product would be the acid. But again, option C is a carboxylic acid, so that might fit.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it to an amine, but that doesn't fit the IR and NMR data.

Wait, going back, the NMR's 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde. So, if the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus might be something else.

Wait, benzaldehyde with HI and red phosphorus might undergo addition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that would require a metal like Mg, which isn't present here.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that compound X is a methyl ester of benzoic acid. Then, reacting it with HI might lead to hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid. But that would mean the product is benzoic acid, which is option C. But then, what about the substituent?

Wait, but in the NMR, the substituent seems to be a longer chain with branching. So, perhaps the ester group is part of that substituent.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a substituted benzoyl chloride, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would suggest chlorine.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options and the reaction conditions.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which is often used to eliminate HX and form alkenes from alcohols. So, if the substituent in compound X is a secondary alcohol, the reaction would form an alkene.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is an alkylbenzene with a sec-butyl substituent. So, if the substituent in compound X was a secondary alcohol, elimination would form a double bond, making the substituent an alkene. But option D doesn't have a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: if the substituent in compound X is a tertiary alcohol, elimination might not occur because there's no adjacent H to form a double bond. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in compound X is a bromoalkyl group, and the reaction is a substitution to introduce a hydroxyl group. But that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced. But I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a methyl ester from the carboxylic acid, but that would require a different reagent.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material is a benzyl bromide, and the reaction is a substitution with HI, but that doesn't fit the IR and NMR data.

Hmm. I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should look for the answer based on the reaction conditions and the options.

Given that the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which is often used for elimination, the product is likely an alkene. Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a branched alkylbenzene. But that's a single bond, not a double bond. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but maybe the reaction doesn't form an alkene but instead performs an alkylation. If the substituent is a bromide, then substitution with HI would replace the bromide with a hydrogen, but that doesn't change the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard-like compound, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkyne, but I don't see any indication of that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzyl chloride, but that's not relevant here.

Hmm. I'm going in circles. Let's try to think differently. Let's imagine the substituent in compound X is a bromoalkyl group. For example, benzene-CH2-CH(Br)-CH2-CH3. Then, treatment with HI would substitute the Br with I, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, elimination would form a double bond, making benzene-CH2-CH=CH-CH3.

But none of the options fit that.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which has a COOH group and a sec-butyl group. If the reaction doesn't change the substituent, perhaps the product is benzoic acid itself, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction converts the COOH group into something else. For example, if it's an ester, the reaction might saponify it to the acid.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride to a carboxylic acid. But again, the starting material doesn't seem to have an acyl chloride.

Another angle: perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-O-R group, and the reaction is an elimination to form an alkene. For example, if the substituent is a -CH2-OH group, elimination would form a double bond.

But in the NMR, the substituent's peaks don't support an alcohol group. The 10.5 ppm is more likely a carbonyl.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the IR and NMR data, the starting material is likely 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not change the substituent but could affect the COOH group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction, but that's unclear.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction converts the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride, but that's not any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into a methyl ester, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid anhydride, but that's not in the options.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't see how that would fit.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But wait, the reaction would have to do something to it. Unless the reaction doesn't affect the substituent but something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, converting the benzoic acid into benzene. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a condensation, but that's unclear.

I'm really stuck, but based on the initial analysis, the starting material is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent that's a branched alkyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI might eliminate a molecule, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH2-OH group. Then, treatment with red phosphorus and HI would eliminate water, forming a double bond. The product would be a benzene with a double bond in the substituent. But none of the options show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(Br)-CH2- group, and elimination would form a double bond.

But without seeing the options, it's hard to say.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But I'm not entirely confident.


The problem involves identifying the final product when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data of compound X to deduce its structure.

### IR and NMR Analysis of Compound X:
1. **IR Data**:
   - Peaks at **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of an O-H or N-H group.
   - A strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), likely from a carboxylic acid or ester.
   - Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** suggest aromatic C=C stretching.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, likely from a carboxylic acid proton.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group.
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group.
   - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for 3H, likely a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for 3H, likely a terminal CH₃ group in an alkyl chain.

From this data, compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The structure consists of a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 and a sec-butyl group (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-) at position 4.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for elimination reactions, where a leaving group is removed, and a double bond is formed. However, in this case, the reaction does not appear to alter the substituents on the benzene ring. The carboxylic acid group remains unaffected, and the sec-butyl group does not have a leaving group to facilitate elimination. Thus, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: Incorrect, as the substituents and positions do not match the given data.
- **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: Incorrect, as this structure does not include a carboxylic acid group.
- **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: Correct, as it matches the IR, NMR data, and reaction conditions.
- **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: Incorrect, as it lacks a carboxylic acid group.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, which corresponds to **Option C**.

**Answer: C**
