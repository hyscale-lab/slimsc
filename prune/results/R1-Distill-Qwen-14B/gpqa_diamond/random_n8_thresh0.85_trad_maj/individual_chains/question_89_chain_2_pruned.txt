Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me jot down what I know about each reaction step.

First, the compound 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid, which I think is a result of an elimination reaction. Since KOH is a strong base, it probably induces an E2 mechanism, leading to the formation of an alkene. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is quite rigid, so the elimination would form a double bond. But wait, where would the double bond form? Since the starting material has two bromines on carbons 1 and 3, elimination would likely form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Because adamantane is a highly branched structure, the most stable alkene would form. The product is called product 1.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) which could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or an alcohol. Wait, but KOH is a base, so maybe it's an elimination to form an epoxide? No, wait, when dibromides react with base, they typically form alkenes via elimination. Oh wait, maybe it's a di-elimination forming a diene or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening reaction? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules upon treatment with excess KOH, forming a conjugated diene? Because the starting structure is 1,3-dibromo, so dehydrohalogenation would form a double bond between 1-2 and another between 3-4? Or wait, in adamantane, the positions are such that 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbons. Let me think. The structure of adamantane is similar to four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two adjacent carbons. When KOH is added, each Br would leave, each H being abstracted from adjacent carbons, leading to the formation of a double bond between those two carbons. So the product would be 1,3-diene? Wait, no, maybe a single double bond. Wait, no, wait—each elimination would remove one Br and form a double bond. So, 1,3-dibromide would lose two HBr molecules, leading to a diene. But wait, in reality, elimination of two HBr from 1,3-dibromide would form a conjugated diene.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm, which is around where vinyl protons resonate. But if it's a diene, maybe the protons are in a trans or cis arrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination that forms a bridge, but I'm not sure. Another possibility: The product is not a diene but an epoxide. Wait, but to form an epoxide, you'd need an oxygen connecting the two carbons. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Oh, wait, maybe it's a double elimination to form a cyclopropane? No, that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, the IR spectrum shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe the product is a ketone or an ester. But how?

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane when treated with KOH could undergo a double elimination, but each elimination would form a double bond, so the product would be a diene. But the IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests maybe a ketone. Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl? No, that's more like an oxidation, which usually requires a more oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe it's a peroxide formation, but KOH isn't a peroxide.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the reactions. Let me think again. When vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halides) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal, it's 1,3-dibromo. So they are on non-adjacent carbons. So, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen from each Br, leading to elimination of HBr twice, forming a conjugated diene.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any protons that are typical for alkenes. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be an oxygen-bearing group. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. But for a ketone, the IR would have a peak around 1700-1750 cm^-1, which aligns with 1720. So maybe product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, how? If we have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and treat it with a strong base like KOH, but how would that form a ketone? Oh, wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by oxidation? But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but with excess base, that's less likely. Wait, but wait: Could the reaction be a double E2 elimination, each Br leaving as Br^- and the base abstracting a β-hydrogen, forming two double bonds? Or perhaps the elimination forms a carbonyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But I'm not sure. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH... could it form a gem-diol? No, because that would require two substitutions, but KOH is a strong base. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Wait, in some cases, when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, it can form a carbonyl. For example, in the formation of ketones from dihalides via dehydrohalogenation. Like, for example, vicinal dihalides can form alkenes, but if they're in a position that allows for keto formation, maybe they form a ketone.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromide is a non-vicinal dihalide. Let me think about the mechanism. If two E2 eliminations occur, each Br leaves with a hydrogen from a neighboring carbon, forming two double bonds. But since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, perhaps the elimination forms a conjugated diene. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So perhaps I'm wrong about the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't a diene but a mono-ene and something else. Hmm. Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane? Because when dihalides undergo elimination, sometimes cyclopropanes can form if the two leaving groups are on adjacent carbons, but 1,3 aren't adjacent. So maybe not.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong indicator of a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. How can that happen? Let's think. If 1,3-dib
