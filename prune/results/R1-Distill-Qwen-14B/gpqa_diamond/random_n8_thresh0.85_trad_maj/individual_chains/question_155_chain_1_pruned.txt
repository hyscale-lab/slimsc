Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about uncertainty in the Pz operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of Px corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty in Pz, which is ΔPz.

Wait, uncertainty... Oh right, the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(<A²> - <A>²). So I need to find the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared, then compute this.

But wait, the state is given in the basis of Pz's eigenvectors. That probably means we're already in the correct basis, so the expectation value calculations might be straightforward.

Wait, the basis vectors are eigenvectors of Pz. So the state vector is expressed in terms of these eigenvectors. So each component corresponds to the eigenvalue of Pz. Let me look at the given state vector. The components are (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So each component corresponds to an eigenstate of Pz.

Hmm, but wait: the state is in the eigenbasis of Pz, so the components represent the amplitude of each eigenstate. Therefore, the expectation value of Pz is just the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, weighted by the square of the amplitudes.

So to calculate <Pz>, I can compute the sum of |c_i|^2 * λ_i, where c_i are the components of the state vector, and λ_i are the eigenvalues of Pz.

Wait, but what are the eigenvalues of Pz? Let me look at the matrix given for Pz. The matrix is diagonal, right?

Pz matrix:
[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. Because the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues when the matrix is diagonal.

So the state vector has components (a, b, c) = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2).

So the probabilities are |a|^2, |b|^2, |c|^2.

Compute |a|^2
