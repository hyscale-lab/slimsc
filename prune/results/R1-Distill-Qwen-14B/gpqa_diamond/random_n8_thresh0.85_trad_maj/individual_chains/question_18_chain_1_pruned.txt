Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Both have different masses and different elemental abundances. The data given includes their masses, some abundance ratios, and some solar photosphere compositions.

Wait, let me parse the data. Star_1 has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, and Star_2 is 1.2 solar masses. The abundance data: [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Oh, right, the brackets denote logarithmic abundances relative to hydrogen. And [Fe/H] is the iron abundance relative to hydrogen in Star_1, which is 0, meaning it's the same as the Sun for Fe and H. Same for Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0, so Mg is solar.

The solar photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5-12 = -4.5. Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7, so log(nMg/nH) = -5. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The formula is 12 + log(nX/nH) = value. So for Fe, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Same for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH=10^-5.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the ratio of Si atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, which is log(Si/Fe) =0.3. But wait, in Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so Fe is the same as H, so [Fe/H]=0 → [Fe
