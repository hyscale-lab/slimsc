Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's go through each step.

First step: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The ¹H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The IR has a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. 

Hmm, I remember that when alkanes react with KOH under heating, especially with vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons), they can undergo elimination to form alkenes, a process called dehydrohalogenation. Since 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons (since adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four carbons in a row, I think), heating with a strong base like KOH would likely cause elimination of HBr twice, forming a double bond. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide? Or is it a dihalide with two bromines on the same carbon? No, wait, 1 and 3 positions on adamantane. Oh, wait, no. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four bridgehead carbons. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two bridgehead positions, but not adjacent. Wait, no.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: Adamantane has four equivalent bridgehead carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two non-adjacent bridgeheads. But wait, for elimination, we need adjacent bromines. Oh wait, maybe I'm wrong. Because if it's 1,2-dibromo, then elimination would form a double bond. But the question says 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe in adamantane, the positions 1 and 3 are adjacent? Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide. Oh, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me think: Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons, each connected to two others. So 1 and 3 would be across from each other, perhaps? Or maybe in a structure where they're adjacent. Wait, perhaps I should visualize the structure. Adamantane is a diamond-like molecule with four bridgehead carbons arranged in a square, each connected to two others. So 1 and 3 would be diagonally opposite, not adjacent. So, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, then the bromines are on opposite bridgeheads, so not adjacent. But then, how would KOH eliminate? Hmm. If the bromines are on the same carbon, but the problem
