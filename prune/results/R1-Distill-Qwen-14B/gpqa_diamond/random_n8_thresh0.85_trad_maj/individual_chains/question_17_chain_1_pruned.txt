Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says we have a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C. Also, the given K is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct concentration.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. So Ca-EDTA forms a complex. The K here is probably the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is. K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA form the complex.

So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant K is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem says the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So at equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is still approximately 0.02 M because the K is so large. Because K is 5e10, which is a very big number, meaning the complex is very stable. So the reaction tends to go to completion, right?

So if the complex dissociates a little, the changes would be small. Let me set up the ICE table.

Let me denote:
Let x = [Ca²+] at equilibrium.

The EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex. So initially, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA] are both 0.

Change:
CaEDTA^2- dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA. So each unit produces 1 mole of each. So the change is +x for Ca²+ and +x for EDTA.

So the equilibrium concentrations would be:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x will be very small compared to 0.02 because K is large)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

Wait no, wait. Wait, the EDTA is H4Y, but in solution, it can have various protonations, but the problem
