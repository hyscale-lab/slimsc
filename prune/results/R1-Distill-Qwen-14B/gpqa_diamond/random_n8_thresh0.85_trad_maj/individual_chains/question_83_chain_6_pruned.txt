Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but let me try to think this through.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. So the first thing I should probably do is figure out the new concentration of the acetic acid after dilution.

Wait, right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The total volume after adding 20 cm³ of water is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40. Let's calculate that. 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next step is titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. We're supposed to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

So first, let's think about the equivalence point. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid initially.

Wait, wait. The initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. So, volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), concentration 0.025 M. Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

When we titrate, the NaOH will neutralize the acetic acid: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 moles.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydroly
