Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. They added 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12.

Hmm, orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-, right? But wait, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The problem mentions orthophosphate, which is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.

I remember that when you have a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, you can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. But this is a buffer solution, right? Because we have KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which is HPO4^2-). So they're adjacent species in the phosphate ionization steps.

Wait, let me think about the phosphate system. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. The first deprotonation gives H2PO4^- (with Ka1=7.5e-3). The second deprotonation gives HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8), and the third gives PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12). 

So in the solution, we have KH2PO4, which is H2PO4^- (since K+ is a spectator ion), and Na2HPO4, which is HPO4^2-. So these are the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- forms. So the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-. Hmm, but in the solution, we don't have PO4^3- because that's a further deprotonation. So maybe I'm misunderstanding. Or perhaps the solution is such that some HPO4^2- will deprotonate to form PO4^3-.

Wait, but in the buffer solution, the pH is determined by the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- concentrations. Once we find the pH, we can see if PO4^3- is present.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider all the species present. Wait, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me calculate the moles of each.

For KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007335 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005606 mol.

So the solution has 0.007335 moles of H2PO4^- and 0.005606 moles of HPO4^2-.

The total volume is 0.2 L, so concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036675 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005606 / 0.2 ≈ 0.02803 M

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is about 7.209.

So, pH = 7.209 + log(0.02803 / 0.036675)

Calculating the ratio: 0.02803 / 0.036675 ≈ 0.765.

Log(0.765) is approximately -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.209 - 0.115 ≈ 7.094.

Now, knowing the pH, I can determine the distribution of phosphate species. Since the pH is around 7.09, which is lower than pKa2 (7.209), the solution is slightly acidic relative to the second ionization.

Wait, but the question is about PO4^3- concentration. PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-:

HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+

The Ka3 for this reaction is 1.8e-12, so the pH is around 7.09. Let's see if PO4^3- is significant.

Alternatively, we can compute the concentration of PO4^3- using the third ionization.

The equilibrium for the third step:

[HPO4^2-] → [PO4^3-] + H+

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] ) / [H+]

But [H+] is 1e-pH. So since pH is 7.09, [H+] is about 8.41e-8.

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.02803 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) / 8.41e-8

Let me compute that:

1.8e-12 * 0.02803 = approx 5.045e-14

Divide by 8.41e-8: 5.045e-14 / 8.41e-8 ≈ 5.99e-7 M.

Wait, but that's 5.99e-7 M. Looking at the options, option B is 5.48e-7, option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm, not matching exactly. Did I make a mistake?

Wait wait, let me check the steps again.

First, calculating moles:

KH2PO4: 1g / 136.09 g/mol = approx 0.007335 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g / 177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005606 mol.

Concentration in 0.2 L:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005606 / 0.2 = 0.02803 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) = about 7.209.

The ratio is 0.02803 / 0.036675 ≈ 0.765.

Log(0.765) is approx -0.115.

So pH is 7.209 - 0.115 = 7.094.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, for PO4^3-:

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02803 M.

[H+] = 10^-pH = 10^-7.094 ≈ 8.41e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) / (8.41e-8)

Multiply numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02803 ≈ 5.045e-14.

Divide by denominator: 5.045e-14 / 8.41e-8 ≈ 5.99e-7 M.

But none of the options exactly match. Let me see the options again:

A) 6.24e-7

B)5.48e-7 

C)2.81e-7 

D)3.97e-7 

Hmm, 5.99 is close to option A, but maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me recheck the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02803 / 0.036675.

Let me compute that exactly.

0.02803 / 0.036675 = approximately 0.7653.

Log(0.7653) = ?

I know that log(0.7) is about -0.1549, log(0.75)= approx -0.1249, and log(0.7653) is somewhere between these.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach: 10^x = 0.7653.

Approximating, x is about -0.115.

So pH is 7.209 - 0.115 = 7.094.

So [H+] = 1e-7.094 = 10^(-7.094) = 8.41e-8 M.

So back to the calculation:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02803) = ?

0.02803 = 2.803e-2.

1.8e-12 * 2.803e-2 = (1.8 * 2.803) * 1e-14 = 5.0454e-14.

Divided by 8.41e-8:

5.0454e-14 / 8.41e-8 = (5.0454 / 8.41) * 1e-6.

5.0454 / 8.41 ≈ 0.5997.

So 0.5997e-6 = 5.997e-7 M.

Wait, but the options don't have that. The closest option is A) 6.24e-7, but that's a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that only the third ionization contributes to PO4^3-. Alternatively, maybe the phosphate can come from both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, H2PO4^- can deprotonate to HPO4^2- (with Ka2), but that's already in the buffer. Then, HPO4^2- can deprotonate to PO4^3- (Ka3). So perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- comes from the third ionization step.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the contributions from both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the third ionization.

Wait, wait, H2PO4^- can lose two protons to become PO4^3-:

H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- (Ka1), then HPO4^2- → PO4^3- (Ka2 for this step is Ka3 overall, which is 1.8e-12).

Wait, no, I think the steps are correct as I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to consider all the equilibria together, but that's complicated.

Wait, another approach: The total concentration of phosphate species is [H3PO4] + [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-]. But in solution, the dominant species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because the pH is around 7, which is between pKa2 and pKa3.

Wait, but in our case, the pH is 7.09, which is just below pKa2 (7.209). So the buffer is around the second ionization.

Wait, but maybe I should compute the concentration of PO4^3- using the exact expression.

The formula is:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But perhaps I made a mistake in the Ka3 expression.

Wait, no, because the third ionization is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+. So Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]

So [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]

So with [H+] = 8.41e-8, that's correct.

Wait, but maybe the pH is a bit more precise. Let me compute it more accurately.

Calculating pH:

pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA])

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.209.

Ratio is 0.02803 / 0.036675 ≈ 0.7653.

Log(0.7653) = ?

Let me compute it more accurately.

We can write 0.7653 as 7.653e-1.

Log(7.653e-1) = log(7.653) + log(1e-1) = 0.8845 -1 = -0.1155.

So pH = 7.209 - 0.1155 = 7.0935.

So [H+] = 10^-7.0935 = about 8.38e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute 10^-7.0935.

Since 10^0.0935 is about 1.24 (since 10^0.09 ≈ 1.23, 10^0.0935 is approx 1.24).

So 10^-7.0935 = 10^-(7 + 0.0935) = 1e-7 / 1.24 ≈ 8.06e-8.

Wait, more accurately, 10^0.0935:

Using logarithm tables or calculator-like approach.

We know that log(1.24) is about 0.0935 because log(1.24) ≈ 0.0935.

So yes, 10^0.0935 ≈ 1.24.

So 10^-7.0935 = 1e-7 / 1.24 = approx 8.0645e-8.

So [H+] is approximately 8.0645e-8.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) / (8.0645e-8)

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02803 = 5.0454e-14.

Divide by 8.0645e-8:

5.0454e-14 / 8.0645e-8 = (5.0454 / 8.0645) * 1e-6.

5.0454 / 8.0645 ≈ 0.626.

So 0.626e-6 M = 6.26e-7 M.

Now, that's about 6.26e-7 M, which is close to option A) 6.24e-7. Hmm, A is 6.24e-7, which is very close to this value.

But wait, let me check if I should use the exact values.

Wait, the moles might not be exactly what I calculated because I approximated the division.

Let me recalculate the moles with more precision.

KH2PO4: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol.

136.09 g/mol is exact? Let me compute 1.00 / 136.09.

1 / 136.09 = approx 0.0073343 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.0056060 mol.

So more accurate concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.0073343 / 0.2 = 0.0366715 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.0056060 / 0.2 = 0.02803 M.

Ratio: 0.02803 /0.0366715 ≈ 0.7645.

Log(0.7645) = ?

Using a calculator would help, but without it, perhaps a more precise approach.

Using natural logarithm and then converting to log.

ln(0.7645) ≈ ln(0.75) + (0.7645-0.75)/(0.75) * derivative.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use a calculator function here, but since I don't have one, perhaps I can use the Taylor series or another approximation.

Alternatively, I can accept that the ratio is 0.7645, log is approx -0.115.

So pH is 7.209 - 0.115 = 7.094.

Wait, but [H+] is 1e-7.094 = 8.408e-8 M.

Ah, perhaps more accurately:

pH = 7.094.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.094) = 10^(-7 - 0.094) = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.094).

10^(-0.094) ≈ 0.841. So [H+] ≈ 8.41e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) / (8.41e-8)

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02803 = 5.0454e-14.

Divide by 8.41e-8: 5.0454e-14 / 8.41e-8 = (5.0454 / 8.41) * 1e-6.

5.0454 /8.41 ≈ 0.5997.

So 0.5997e-6 ≈ 5.997e-7 M.

Wait, but that's approximately 6.0e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7) but also close to another option if I made a miscalculation elsewhere.

Wait another thought: Maybe the problem is that the solution's volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters, correct. So when I calculated the concentrations, that's correct.

But wait, maybe when both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O are dissolved, they might release other ions that affect the pH? Or perhaps the solution includes some H+ from the dissociation of water, but that's negligible compared to the buffer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not only about PO4^3- from HPO4^2- but also considers any PO4^3- from H2PO4^-.

Wait, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, but that's already accounted for in the buffer. HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3-.

So, the [PO4^3-] comes only from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

So, the calculation seems correct.

Hmm, but none of the options match exactly. Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the exact pH using more precise methods, but I think I've done that.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the concentration of orthophosphate, which is the sum of all phosphate species except H3PO4. But in this case, I think H3PO4 is negligible because the pH is around 7, which is higher than pKa1 (approx 7.209), wait no, pKa1 is 7.5e-3, which is 2.12 in pH, so pKa2 is 7.209, which is about the same as the pH we have.

Wait, pH is 7.094. So for H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+.

At pH just below pKa2, so the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is less than 1. So the buffer is as calculated.

But perhaps I should consider the exact Ka expressions for all steps.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the total concentration of phosphate species and the different K_a values.

Wait, another approach: The solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The total phosphate concentration is [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] + [H3PO4].

But given the pH, H3PO4 is negligible because pH is much higher than pKa1, which is around 2.12, so [H3PO4] is very small.

Similarly, [PO4^3-] is very small because pH is below pKa3 (11.95, since pKa3 = -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74). So PO4^3- is very low.

Wait, but the solution is in the range where HPO4^2- can deprotonate to form PO4^3-. So the calculation I did earlier should be correct.

Hmm, maybe I should reevaluate the options.

The options are:

A)6.24e-7 M

B)5.48e-7

C)2.81e-7

D)3.97e-7

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [PO4^3-], considering that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02803 M.

Let me recompute [PO4^3-]:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02803 M.

[H+] is 8.41e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

= (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) / 8.41e-8

= (5.0454e-14) / 8.41e-8

= (5.0454 / 8.41) * 1e-6

= approx 0.5997e-6 = 5.997e-7 M.

Hmm. 6e-7 M is what I get, but the options don't have that. The closest is option A (6.24e-7) and option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that orthophosphate is the sum of all PO4^3- species, but perhaps another source comes into play.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, and perhaps there's an effect of the K and Na ions on the activity coefficients, but I think in this problem, we can ignore activity coefficients and assume ideal behavior.

Alternatively, perhaps the volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters, which I used correctly.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is not about PO4^3- but about the sum of HPO4^2- and PO4^3-, but I think the question specifically asks for orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of [HPO4^2-].

Wait, let me recompute the moles.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: the molar mass is 177.99 g/mol.

Molar mass is Na: 22.99 * 2 =45.98, HPO4: 30.97 + 15.999 + 4*16 = 30.97 + 15.999=46.969 + 64 = 110.969? Wait, wait, HPO4: H is 1, P is 30.97, O4 is 4*16=64. So 1 + 30.97 +64 =95.97 g/mol.

Wait, but Na2HPO4·2H2O: so Na2 is 22.99 * 2 =45.98 g/mol.

HPO4 is 95.97 g/mol.

2 H2O: 2*(2*1 + 16) =2*(18)=36 g/mol.

So total molar mass is 45.98 +95.97 +36 = 177.95 g/mol, which matches the given 177.99. So correct.

So 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005606 mol.

So that's correct.

Another thought: maybe I should consider the exact Ka expression for PO4^3-.

Wait, in the third deprotonation step:

HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]

Therefore, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Which is what I did.

So, substituting the numbers:

Ka3 =1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] =0.02803 M.

[H+] = 8.41e-8.

So,

(1.8e-12 * 0.02803) = 5.0454e-14.

Divide by 8.41e-8 gives 5.0454e-14 /8.41e-8 = 5.997e-7 M.

But the options don't have this. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is more complex. For example, the presence of other ions or activities, but I think for this problem, it's assumed to be ideal.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the concentration using the exact pH and see if any of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, the equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So, correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the actual pH is a bit higher, which would increase [PO4^3-].

Wait, if pH is 7.2, then [H+] is 6.3e-8.

Then [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) /6.3e-8.

Which is (5.0454e-14)/6.3e-8 = approx 8.01e-7 M.

But that's higher than my previous calculation.

Wait, but earlier I found pH 7.094, which is lower than 7.2.

Wait, but in that case, with pH 7.094, [H+] is 8.41e-8.

Wait, perhaps if I use a more precise calculation for log(0.7653), which is approximately -0.115.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Let me consider that log(0.7653) = x.

We can write 0.7653 = 10^x.

We know that 10^(-0.115) ≈ 0.775, which is higher than 0.7653.

Wait, 10^(-0.115) = 10^(-0.1) *10^(-0.015) = 0.794 * 0.965 ≈ 0.766.

So x = -0.115 gives 0.766, which is close to 0.7653. So pH is approximately 7.094.

So, given that, the [PO4^3-] is 5.997e-7 M.

But none of the options match. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)6.24e-7

B)5.48e-7

C)2.81e-7

D)3.97e-7

Hmm, none of them is 6.0e-7. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution's volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L, correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is not about PO4^3- but HPO4^2-.

But the question clearly says orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-.

Another thought: perhaps the solution is considering all the possible phosphate species except HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Wait, no, that's not right because PO4^3- and H3PO4 are negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the exact expression.

Wait, let me write down all the relevant equilibria:

1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- ; Ka1 =7.5e-3

2. H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2=6.2e-8

3. HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3=1.8e-12

In the solution, the predominant species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, forming a buffer.

The pH is determined by the buffer solution.

Once pH is known, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but another approach: considering the total amount of phosphate.

Total concentration of phosphate (sum of all species) is (0.007335 +0.005606) mol /0.2 L = (0.012941 mol) /0.2 L = 0.064705 M.

But how does this help? Well, the sum of all phosphate species is 0.064705 M.

So,

[H3PO4] + [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] = 0.064705 M.

But, [H3PO4] is negligible because pH is much higher than pKa1 (~2.12). So [H3PO4] ≈0.

Similarly, [PO4^3-] is much lower than [HPO4^2-], but not negligible compared to 1e-6 M.

So,

[H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] ≈0.064705.

But I know [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-] from the buffer.

Wait, [H2PO4^-] ≈0.03667 M, [HPO4^2-] ≈0.02803 M.

So their sum is 0.0647 M, which is the total phosphate concentration. So [PO4^3-] must be zero.

Wait, that can't be right because HPO4^2- can deprotonate to form PO4^3-.

Wait, but if the sum of [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-] is 0.0647, which is equal to the total phosphate concentration, then [PO4^3-] must be zero.

But that's a contradiction because HPO4^2- can lose a proton to form PO4^3-.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the assumption. Wait, the total phosphate concentration includes all species, including PO4^3-.

Wait, the sum [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] ≈ 0.0647 M.

So, if [H2PO4^-] is 0.03667 and [HPO4^2-] is 0.02803, their sum is 0.0647, so [PO4^3-] is zero.

But that's impossible because some HPO4^2- must deprotonate to form PO4^3-.

Ah, that's a problem. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the buffer equation should include all the equilibria.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is that the concentration of PO4^3- is zero because all of the phosphate is in the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- forms.

But that can't be true because some of the HPO4^2- will deprotonate to form PO4^3-.

Wait, perhaps, given that pH is near pKa2, the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible compared to the other species, but not zero.

Hmm, perhaps I should use the charge balance equation.

The solution must satisfy charge balance.

The cations present are K+ from KH2PO4 and Na+ from Na2HPO4·2H2O.

The anions are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-, and OH^-.

So, charge balance:

sum cations = sum anions.

Cations:

KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-.

So, moles of K+ = moles of KH2PO4 =0.007335 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O.

So, moles of Na+ = 2 * moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 2 *0.005606=0.011212 mol.

Other cations: H+.

Anions:

H2PO4^-: 0.007335 mol.

HPO4^2-: 0.005606 mol.

PO4^3-: x mol.

OH^-: y mol.

So,

sum cations = [K+] + [Na+] + [H+] = 0.007335 + 0.011212 + [H+].

sum anions = [H2PO4^-] + 2*[HPO4^2-] +3*[PO4^3-] + [OH^-].

Wait, but the charge balance is:

[K+] + [Na+] + [H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2*[HPO4^2-] + 3*[PO4^3-] + [OH^-]

But since the solution is in water, [H+][OH^-]=1e-14.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I can ignore [OH^-] because the pH is 7.09, which is neutral, so [OH^-] is about 9e-9 M, negligible.

So,

0.007335 + 0.011212 + [H+] ≈ [H2PO4^-] + 2*[HPO4^2-] +3*[PO4^3-]

But [H2PO4^-] =0.03667 M,

[HPO4^2-] =0.02803 M,

[PO4^3-] = x,

[H+] =8.41e-8.

So,

0.007335 +0.011212 +8.41e-8 ≈ 0.03667 + 2*(0.02803) +3x.

Summing the left side:

0.007335 +0.011212 =0.018547, plus 8.41e-8 is approx 0.018547841.

Right side:

0.03667 + 2*0.02803 =0.03667 +0.05606=0.09273 +3x.

So,

0.018547841 ≈ 0.09273 +3x.

Wait, that can't be right. 0.0185 is much smaller than 0.09273.

This suggests that 3x ≈ 0.018547841 -0.09273 = negative, which is impossible.

So that can't be correct. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the charge balance.

Wait, another approach: the charge balance is [K+] + 2*[Na+] + [H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2*[HPO4^2-] + 3*[PO4^3-] + [OH^-].

So,

[K+] = 0.007335 mol /0.2 L = 0.036675 M.

[Na+] = 2 *0.005606 /0.2 = 0.05606 M.

[H+] =8.41e-8 M.

So left side: 0.036675 + 0.05606 +8.41e-8 ≈ 0.092735 M.

Right side: [H2PO4^-] =0.03667 M, [HPO4^2-] =0.02803 M, [PO4^3-] =x, [OH^-] = y.

So,

0.03667 + 2*(0.02803) +3x + y =0.092735.

0.03667 + 0.05606 =0.09273. So,

0.09273 +3x + y =0.092735.

So,

3x + y ≈ 5e-8.

But since [H+][OH^-]=1e-14,

y =1e-14 / [H+] ≈ 1e-14 /8.41e-8 ≈ 1.189e-7 M.

So,

3x +1.189e-7 ≈5e-8.

3x ≈5e-8 -1.189e-7 = -6.89e-8.

Which is impossible because x can't be negative.

Hmm, this suggests an error in my approach because this can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm not considering the H+ from the phosphate equilibria.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible, so 3x ≈0.

Then,

3x + y ≈5e-8.

But y=1.189e-7,

So,

3x ≈5e-8 -1.189e-7 = -6.89e-8.

Which is impossible, so perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not consider the charge balance and proceed with the earlier method.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe the correct approach is to proceed with the initial calculation, which gave me 6.0e-7 M, but the closest option is A)6.24e-7.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate with more precise numbers.

Let me compute [PO4^3-] again.

[HPO4^2-] =0.02803 M.

Ka3 =1.8e-12.

[H+] =8.41e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) /8.41e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02803 =5.0454e-14.

Denominator:8.41e-8.

So,

5.0454e-14 /8.41e-8 = (5.0454 /8.41) * 1e-6.

5.0454 /8.41 = 0.5997.

So,

0.5997e-6 =5.997e-7 M.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option A.

Wait, maybe I should check if the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2-.

No, the question specifically asks for orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the ratio in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, the ratio is [base]/[acid] = [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] =0.02803 /0.036675.

0.02803 /0.036675 = approximately 0.7645.

log(0.7645)= -0.115.

So, pH=7.209-0.115=7.094.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is calculated as 7.094, but let's compute [H+] as 10^-7.094.

Compute 10^-7.094:

log(8)=0.9031, log(8.4)=0.9243.

Wait, 10^0.094 is approximately 1.24.

So, 10^-7.094 = 8.4e-8.

Which we used.

Hmm, I think the calculation is correct. So the concentration is approximately 6.0e-7 M, but the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the initial calculation of moles.

Wait, for KH2PO4:

Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol.

1.00g /136.09 = approx 0.007335 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O:

Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol.

1.00g /177.99 = 0.005606 mol.

That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the pH calculation is more precise, leading to a slightly different [H+].

Wait, let me compute [H+] more accurately.

pH =7.094, so [H+] =10^-7.094.

Compute 10^-7.094:

It's equal to 10^(-7) * 10^-0.094.

10^-0.094 = about 0.840.

So [H+] =8.40e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02803) /8.40e-8.

= (5.0454e-14) /8.40e-8.

=5.0454e-14 /8.40e-8 = (5.0454/8.40) *1e-6.

5.0454/8.40 ≈0.5997.

0.5997e-6 =5.997e-7.

Hmm.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps the correct answer is A)6.24e-7, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the calculation using exact values without approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute [PO4^3-] using more precise expressions.

[HPO4^2-] =0.02803 M.

Ka3=1.8e-12.

[H+]=8.408e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02803) /8.408e-8.

Compute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02803 =5.0454e-14.

Denominator:8.408e-8.

So,

5.0454e-14 /8.408e-8 = (5.0454 /8.408) *1e-6.

5.0454 /8.408 = approx 0.599.

So, 0.599e-6 =5.99e-7.

Again, same result.

I think perhaps the intended answer is option A)6.24e-7, but perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the assumption that the concentration comes from both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- deprotonating, but I think that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that the orthophosphate comes from both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, H2PO4^- can lose two protons to become PO4^3-:

H2PO4^- ↔ PO4^3- + 2H+.

The Ka for this would be Ka1 * Ka2 = (7.5e-3)(6.2e-8)=4.65e-10.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- from H2PO4^- would be:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka1*Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]^2.

So, let's compute that.

Ka1*Ka2 =7.5e-3 *6.2e-8=4.65e-10.

So,

[PO4^3-]_from_H2PO4 = (4.65e-10 * 0.03667) / (8.408e-8)^2.

Compute denominator: (8.408e-8)^2 =7.069e-15.

Numerator:4.65e-10 *0.03667=1.706e-11.

So,

1.706e-11 /7.069e-15 ≈241.3.

So,

[PO4^3-]_from_H2PO4 ≈241.3e-15 M =2.413e-13 M.

This is negligible compared to the contribution from HPO4^2-.

So, the major contribution to PO4^3- is from HPO4^2-.

Thus, the initial calculation stands, and the concentration is approximately 6.0e-7 M, which is not exactly an option. But looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the exact pH and then compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH more accurately.

pH = pKa2 + log ([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 =7.209.

Ratio =0.7645.

Log(0.7645)=?

Using a calculator:

Log(0.7645) = log(7.645e-1) = log(7.645) + log(1e-1) =0.8843 -1 =-0.1157.

So, pH=7.209 -0.1157=7.0933.

So,

[H+]=10^-7.0933 ≈8.38e-8.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02803)/8.38e-8.

Calculate numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02803=5.0454e-14.

Divide by 8.38e-8:

5.0454e-14 /8.38e-8 = (5.0454/8.38)*1e-6.

5.0454 /8.38≈0.599.

So, 0.599e-6=5.99e-7 M.

Hmm, again the same result.

I think the intended answer must be option A)6.24e-7, but perhaps the correct calculation leads to option D)3.97e-7.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the Ka3 expression.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression where [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But perhaps the solution considers that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02803 M, and [H+] is 8.41e-8.

Wait,

1.8e-12 *0.02803 =5.0454e-14.

Divide by 8.41e-8.

5.0454e-14 /8.41e-8 =5.0454/(8.41e6) → no, it's 5.0454e-14 /8.41e-8 = (5.0454 /8.41) * 1e-6 = 0.5997e-6 =5.997e-7.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option D)3.97e-7 M.

But why?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moles.

Wait, let me check:

KH2PO4: 1g /136.09 g/mol = 0.007335 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O:1g /177.99 g/mol=0.005606 mol.

So, correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the molarity of the solution as 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L. So, the concentrations are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use a different approach, such as using the third ionization without considering the buffer.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the third ionization.

But that doesn't make sense because the buffer solution is from H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct approach is to proceed with the calculation I did, which leads to approximately 6.0e-7 M. But since this option isn't present, perhaps the intended answer is option A)6.24e-7.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should use more precise values for log(0.7645).

Wait, perhaps a more precise calculation of log(0.7645).

Using a calculator, log(0.7645) = approximately -0.1153.

So, pH =7.209 -0.1153=7.0937.

So, [H+] =10^-7.0937 ≈8.38e-8.

Then,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02803) /8.38e-8 =5.0454e-14 /8.38e-8=5.0454e-14 /8.38e-8.

5.0454e-14 /8.38e-8 = (5.0454 /8.38) * 1e-6.

5.0454 /8.38 ≈0.5997.

So, [PO4^3-]=5.997e-7 M.

But again, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1.8e-12 *0.02803.

1.8e-12 *0.02803=5.0454e-14.

Divide by 8.38e-8: 5.0454e-14 /8.38e-8 = 5.0454 /8.38 * 1e-6.

5.0454 /8.38=0.5997.

So, 0.5997e-6=5.997e-7.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the concentration as 6.24e-7.

But I don't see a clear path to that. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more precisely.

[H+] =10^-7.094.

Compute 10^-7.094.

The exact value can be computed using a calculator.

But without a calculator, perhaps I can write it as:

7.094 =7 +0.094.

10^-7.094 =1e-7 *10^-0.094.

10^-0.094 is about 0.840.

So, 8.40e-8.

Thus, [H+]=8.40e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02803) /8.40e-8.

= (5.0454e-14)/(8.40e-8) = 5.0454e-14 /8.40e-8 = (5.0454/8.40) * 1e-6.

5.0454 /8.40 =0.5997.

So, 0.5997e-6=5.997e-7.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the exact value of pH, leading to a slightly different [H+].

But I'm not sure.

In the end, perhaps the intended answer is option A)6.24e-7, and I'm supposed to choose that.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ (H₂PO₄⁻) and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (HPO₄²⁻). The solution contains 1.00 g of each compound, and the volume is 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The molecular weights are 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The relevant equilibrium constants are Ka₁ = 7.5 × 10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of H₂PO₄⁻} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007335 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of HPO₄²⁻} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005606 \, \text{mol}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations in the solution
- \([H₂PO₄⁻]\):  
  \[
  [H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.007335}{0.2} \approx 0.036675 \, \text{M}
  \]
- \([HPO₄²⁻]\):  
  \[
  [HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.005606}{0.2} \approx 0.02803 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸. The pKa₂ is:  
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.209
\]
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]}\right)
\]
Substitute the values:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.209 + \log\left(\frac{0.02803}{0.036675}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.209 + \log(0.7645) \approx 7.209 - 0.115 = 7.094
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻
The third ionization of phosphate is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{PO₄³⁻} + \text{H⁺}, \quad K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}
\]
Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{PO₄³⁻}][\text{H⁺}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]
The \([\text{H⁺}]\) is calculated from the pH:  
\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.094} \approx 8.41 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]
Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02803)}{8.41 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0454 \times 10^{-14}}{8.41 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.997 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \(6.0 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\). Among the given options, the closest value is **A) \(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)**.

ANSWER: A
