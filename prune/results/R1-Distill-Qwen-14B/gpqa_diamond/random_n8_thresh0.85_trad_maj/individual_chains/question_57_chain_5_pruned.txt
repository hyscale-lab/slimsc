Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electron scattering, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me start by reading the question again.

The question gives me phase shifts δ0 = 90°, δ1 = 67°, δ2 = 55°, δ3 = 30°, and δ4 = 13°. The electrons are 50 MeV and are elastically scattered from a nuclear target. I'm supposed to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, which I think means we'll only consider these given ones. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A, B, C, D, with some numbers in fm. 

Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using partial waves. The formula I think is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδl} sinδl ) * Pl(cosθ), where δl is the phase shift for each angular momentum l, Pl is the Legendre polynomial, and k is the wave number.

Wait, but the question is specifically asking for the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh right, the incident direction would correspond to θ=0°, which is the direction of the incoming electrons. So when θ=0, cosθ=1, and each Pl(1) is 1 for all l because Pl(1)=1 for any l. So the expression simplifies a lot in that case.

So the formula becomes f(0) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδl} sinδl ). But since we're only looking for the imaginary part, I can compute Im(f(0)).

Wait, let me think about that. Each term in the sum will contribute to both real and imaginary parts. But when we take the imaginary part of the whole sum, it's the sum of the imaginary parts of each term.

So for each l, the term is (2l+1) e^{iδl} sinδl. Let's break this down. e^{iδl} is cosδl + i sinδl. So when multiplied by sinδl, each term becomes (2l+1)( sinδl * cosδl + i sin²δl ). 

The imaginary part of each term is (2l + 1) sin² δl. So the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) times the sum over l of (2l + 1) sin² δl.

Ah, right. Because the imaginary part of each term is the coefficient of i, which is (2l + 1) sin² δl. So Im(f(0)) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) sin² δl.

But wait, what about the phase shifts given? The phase shifts are given for different l values, I assume. So δ0 corresponds to l=0, δ1 to l=1, δ2 to l=2, etc. So for l=0 to l=4, we have the given phase shifts, and beyond that, we ignore.

So l=0: δ0=90°. Let's compute sin²(90°)=1.

l=1: δ1=67°, sin²(67) ≈ (0.9205)^2 ≈ 0.8473.

l=2: δ2=55°, sin²(55) ≈ (0.8192)^2 ≈ 0.6710.

l=3: δ3=30°, sin²(30)= (0.5)^2=0.25.

l=4: δ4=13°, sin²(13) ≈ (0.22495)^2 ≈ 0.0506.

Now compute each (2l + 1) * sin² δl:

l=0: (1) * 1 = 1.

l=1: 3 * 0.8473 ≈ 2.5419.

l=2: 5 * 0.6710 ≈ 3.355.

l=3:7 * 0.25 = 1.75.

l=4:9 * 0.0506 ≈ 0.4554.

Sum these up: 1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419; +3.355 → 6.8969; +1.75 → 8.6469; +0.4554 → 9.1023.

So the total sum is approximately 9.1023.

Now, the imaginary part is Im(f(0))= (1/k) * 9.1023.

But wait, what's k? k is the wave number, which is given by (2π/λ), and the electrons have 50 MeV energy. Hmm, we need to compute k in terms of the electron's momentum.

The energy of the electrons is 50 MeV. Since it's much higher than their rest mass (which is about 0.511 MeV), we can approximate them as relativistic, so kinetic energy ≈ total energy. The rest mass of the electron is m_e c² ≈ 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is much bigger. So we can approximate the momentum p using the relativistic relation: E ≈ pc → p ≈ E/c.

Wait, but E is the total energy. So E = γ m_e c². For high energies, γ is approximately E/(m_e c²). So E ≈ pc → p ≈ E/(c). So p ≈ 50 MeV / c.

But wait, let me make sure. The relation between energy and momentum for a relativistic particle is E² = (pc)² + (m_e c²)². But when E is much larger than m_e c², we can approximate E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/(c).

So p = 50 MeV/c.

But wave number k is given by p/ħ. Since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm (that's a common constant used in particle physics). So k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ) = (50 MeV/c) * (c * ħ)^-1 ) = 50/(ħ c) * (MeV/c) * (c/ħ)^-1 ?? Hmm, maybe I should compute it more carefully.

Let me compute k:

k = p / ħ

p = 50 MeV / c

So k = (50 MeV / c) / ħ

But ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV fm) = (1/197.33) (MeV fm)^-1.

So k = (50 MeV/c) / ħ = (50) * (1/(ħ c)) * (c) ) → let me think.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute k in terms of MeV⁻¹.

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) * (1 / ħ) ), since p = E/c for high energy.

Wait, I think I'm getting a bit tangled. Let's compute k in units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, so 1/(ħ) = (c) (197.33 MeV fm)^-1.

Wait, maybe another way. Let me compute k as (p c) / (ħ c^2).

Wait, because p = E/c → E = pc.

So k = p/ħ = (E/c)/(ħ) → E in MeV, c in units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in atomic units or something. Alternatively, perhaps I can find k in terms of inverse femtometers.

Wait, let me express everything in terms of known constants. The wave number k is given by (2π p)/ħ, but wait, no. Wait, no, k = p/(ħ). Because ħ is Planck's constant over 2π. So k is p divided by ħ.

So p = 50 MeV/c. So k = (50 MeV/c) / ħ.

But I need to express this in units that will give me 1/fm.

The value of ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm. So ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

Wait, so:

k = (50 MeV/c) / [ (197.33 MeV fm) / (c) ) ] 

= (50 MeV/c ) * ( c ) / (197.33 MeV fm )

The c's cancel, MeV cancels.

So k = 50 / 197.33 fm^-1.

Compute that:

50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 (approx 0.253 fm⁻¹).

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the units. Let me double-check.

Wait, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm. So, ħ has units of MeV fm / c.

Wait, because ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So p is 50 MeV / c.

So k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / [ (197.33 MeV fm ) / c ) ] 

= (50 / 197.33) (MeV/c) * (c)/(MeV fm) ) 

The MeV and c cancel, so 50/197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹. So k is approximately 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that's the wave number k. Now, Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum ( (2l+1) sin² δl )

Which is (1/0.253 fm⁻¹) * 9.1023 → which is (9.1023 / 0.253 ) fm.

Calculate 9.1023 / 0.253.

Let me compute that: 0.253 * 36 = 9.108, which is very close to 9.1023. So 36. So approximately 36 fm.

Wait, wait! Wait, no, 0.253 multiplied by 36 is 9.108, yes. So 9.1023 / 0.253 ≈ 36.

So Im(f(0)) is approximately 36 fm.

But wait, looking at the options, they are A) 87163 fm, B) 355, C) 177, D) 251. Hmm, none of these are 36.

Wait, that can't be. Did I make a mistake in calculating k?

Hmm. Let's recheck the calculation of k.

Wait, ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm. So 1/(ħ c) = 1/(197.33 MeV fm) ≈ 5.056e-3 fm⁻¹ MeV⁻¹.

Wait, but p is 50 MeV/c. So k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / ħ.

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

So substituting into k:

k = (50 MeV/c) / [ (197.33 MeV fm ) / c ) ] 

The c's cancel, and MeV cancels.

So k = (50) / (197.33 fm) ) → 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So that part seems correct.

Then, sum is approx 9.1023, so (9.1023) / 0.253 ≈ 36. So the imaginary part is about 36 fm. But none of the options is near that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) e^{2iδl} -1 ) Pl(cosθ).

Wait, another version I've seen is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδl} sinδl ) Pl(cosθ).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me confirm the correct expression for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts.

I think the correct expression is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l +1) e^{2iδl} (sin δl) ) Pl(cosθ) ).

Wait, no, maybe it's f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [(2l +1)(e^{2iδl} -1) Pl(cosθ)].

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the expression. From scattering theory, the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is given as:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{2iδl} (e^{iδl} - e^{-iδl}) ) Pl(cosθ) )

Wait, that would be (2l+1) e^{2iδl} (2i sin δl) Pl(cosθ) ) multiplied by 1/(2ik), because (e^{iδ} - e^{-iδ}) = 2i sin δ.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to find the correct expression.

Another source says that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) (e^{2iδl} -1) ) Pl(cosθ) )

So, that's f(θ) = [1/(2ik)] * sum [ (2l+1)(e^{2iδl} - 1) Pl(cosθ) ]

So when θ=0, Pl(1)=1 for all l. So f(0) = [1/(2ik)] sum [ (2l+1)(e^{2iδl} -1) ]

Now, let's compute the imaginary part of f(0).

So f(0) = [1/(2ik)] sum (2l+1)(e^{2iδl} - 1 )

Expand that sum:

Each term is (2l+1)(e^{2iδl} - 1) = (2l+1)(cos(2δl) + i sin(2δl) - 1 )

= (2l+1) [ (cos(2δl) - 1) + i sin(2δl) ]

So the sum is a sum over real and imaginary parts.

So f(0) = [1/(2ik)] [ sum_real + i sum_imag ]

But wait, f(0) is a complex quantity. We're interested in the imaginary part.

Let me compute each part. Let me denote S_real = sum (2l+1)(cos(2δl) - 1) and S_imag = sum (2l+1)(sin(2δl)).

So f(0) = [1/(2ik)] ( S_real + i S_imag )

= [ (S_real + i S_imag) ] / (2ik )

= [ S_real/(2ik) ) ] + [ i S_imag/(2ik) ] 

= S_real/(2ik) + S_imag/(2k )

Because i/(2ik) = 1/(2k).

So f(0) = [ S_real/(2ik) ) ] + ( S_imag )/(2k )

But wait, the imaginary part of f(0) would come from both terms.

Wait, let me think about this. The first term is S_real/(2i k ), which is a purely imaginary term because 1/i is -i. So S_real/(2i k ) = -i S_real/(2k )

The second term is S_imag/(2k ), which is real.

So the imaginary part of f(0) is Im( f(0) ) = ( - S_real/(2k) ) + 0.

Wait, because the second term is real, so its imaginary part is zero. The first term contributes -S_real/(2k ) as the imaginary part.

Wait, that's opposite to what I thought earlier. So the formula for the imaginary part is - S_real/(2k )

Hmm, that's a bit different from what I thought before. So I need to calculate S_real, which is sum (2l+1)(cos(2δl) -1 )

Let me compute S_real for each l from 0 to 4.

Compute each term:

l=0: delta=90°, 2delta=180°.

cos(180) = -1.

So (cos(2δl) -1 )= (-1 -1 )= -2.

Multiply by (2l+1)=1: term is 1*(-2)= -2.

l=1: delta=67°, 2delta=134°.

cos(134° ) ≈ cos(180-4
