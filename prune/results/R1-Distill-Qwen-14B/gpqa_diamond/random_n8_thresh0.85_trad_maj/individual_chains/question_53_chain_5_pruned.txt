Okay, so I've got this question about an organic compound, and I need to figure out its molecular formula. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that's like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen in the ester linkage. So the molecule must have an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Two are aromatic Hs. Two are vinyl Hs, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets. Two are –CH3 groups. No –CH2 signals. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the structure probably doesn't have any methylene (CH2) groups. So maybe it's all CH3 and CH groups?

Wait, the substituents on the benzene ring are probably an ester and another group. Let me think. Esters are typically R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, the structure is more like R-O-CO-R'. So, the benzene ring would have, for example, an ester group like OCOOR attached. But wait, the benzene is di-substituted, so maybe the two substituents are ester groups, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is something else.

Wait, the NMR has two –CH3 signals. So, maybe there are two different methyl groups. Also, the vinyl Hs suggest double bonds elsewhere. So perhaps one substituent is an ester, which would have a carbonyl group and an oxygen. The other substituent could be a vinyl group, like a substituent with a double bond, such as a substituted ethylene group.

But another possibility is that the substituents are an ester and a methoxy group or something else, but I'm not sure yet.

Let me think about the structure. Di-substituted benzene with an ester group. So, maybe the benzene is connected to an ester group, like OCOOR, where R is some substituent. And the other substituent could be something with a vinyl group (like an ethenyl group) or perhaps a methyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two –CH3 signals. So two different methyl groups. Hmm. Maybe one is part of the ester group (like R being a methyl in OCOOCH3?), but that's a methyl ester. Then, perhaps the other substituent has another methyl group.

Wait, but in the NMR, the –CH3 groups are separate. So maybe the substituents are an ester (like OCOOR) and another group that has a methyl, like a methyl group attached to the ring, but that might not explain the absence of CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent is an allyl group or something else.

Wait, let's think about the vinyl Hs. Two signals, one a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl Hs are typically in regions around 4-7 ppm. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, and a doublet of quartets would imply coupling with two different sets. Hmm, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the benzene, like a styrene group. But if it's styrene, the vinyl protons would be two, as in CH2=CH-, but wait, that's a vinyl group with two Hs. Wait, but in the NMR, two signals for vinyl Hs. So maybe the substituent is a group like CH2CH2, but that's not quite right. Or perhaps a substituent like a vinyl group attached to another group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group, but that might have more than two Hs. Hmm, perhaps it's a substituent where the vinyl Hs are part of an ester's structure. Wait, no, esters typically have R-O-CO-O-R', but the ester group doesn't have Hs on the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, and another substituent is a vinyl group, which is attached to another group. Like, maybe the structure is something like benzene with an ester group (O-CO-O-) and a vinyl ether or something else.

Wait, but the NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So, perhaps the ester is something like O-CO-O-R, where R is a methyl group. So the ester would be methyl ester, which would have a methyl group attached to the oxygen. Then, the other substituent might be a methyl group attached directly to the benzene ring. But wait, if that's the case, the NMR would show a singlet for the methyl attached to the ring, and another for the ester's methyl. But in the NMR, the two –CH3 are separate; perhaps they are in different environments, so they would split into different signals. That could explain the two signals for –CH3.

Wait, but the aromatic protons
