Okay, so I've got this question about Grubbs catalyst and a racemic compound. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products are formed. Let me start by recalling what I know about Grubbs catalyst and the reactions it's involved in.

Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. It's a transition metal catalyst, specifically based on ruthenium, right? Metathesis means the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So, it's like breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. Oh wait, Grubbs is good for ring-closing metathesis too, but I think in this case, it's about cross metathesis or maybe ring-opening if there's a ring.

The compound given is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's an equal mixture of enantiomers. So the structure must be a stereocenter somewhere. Let me write out the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would mean the substituents are on the third carbon. So, wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would imply a branch on the third carbon of the chain. Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, no. The structure of pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think. For pent-1-ene, numbering starts with the double bond at position 1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Hmm, but 3-methyl would be a methyl group on the third carbon. So, the third carbon is CH2 in that structure. So adding a methyl would make it CH(CH3). So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, but wait, that's four carbons. Oh wait, no, the molecule is pent-1-ene, so five carbons in total.

Wait, maybe I should write it as CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right because pent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon, which
