Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Oh wait, the parallax formula is plx = 1/distance (distance in parsecs), so a larger parallax means the star is closer. 

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in what sense? If they're uniformly distributed in space, that probably means the number density is constant. So the number of stars in a volume doesn't depend on where you look, just the volume. But how does parallax come into play here?

Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So as plx increases, the distance decreases. Let's think about a thin spherical shell at a distance d. The volume of a shell is 4πd² times the thickness of the shell, right? If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume. So N_shell = n * 4πd² * thickness, where n is the number density.

But in terms of parallax, since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So substituting, N_shell = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * thickness. Hmm, wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax, not per unit volume. So I need to relate the number of stars to a change in parallax, dplx.

What's the thickness in terms of dplx? Well, d = 1/plx, so if plx changes by dplx, then the distance changes by dd = -d² dplx (because d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx). Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of how the volume element relates to parallax.

Alternatively, considering a change in parallax dplx, what's the corresponding change in distance? Since d = 1/plx, dd = -d² dplx. But the shell's volume is 4π d² dd. Substituting, Volume = 4π d² (-d² dplx) ) = -4π (d^4) dplx. Wait, but d = 1/plx, so d^4 = (1/plx)^4. So Volume = -4π (1/pl
