Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is usually measured in kilojoules per mole, but the options here are in kcal and kJ, so I'll have to keep track of units.

First, I need to figure out the moles of each acid and base. Because when they mix, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

Wait, but wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic. The first dissociation is complete, but the second might not be, but in neutralization reactions, especially with strong bases, I think both protons are donated. So H2SO4 will give 2 H+ ions per molecule. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; it dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

So, the reaction would be between H+ (from acids) and OH- (from base) to form water. The enthalpy change for neutralization is usually given as around -57 kJ per mole of H+ (like for a strong acid and strong base), but wait, wait, no. Oh wait, no, the enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) is typically around -57 kJ per mole of H+ reacting. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Or is it per mole of acid? Let me think. No, neutralization is per mole of H+ reacting with OH-.

So, I need to calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, the limiting reagent will determine how much of the reaction occurs.

Let's break it down:

1. Calculate moles of HCl:
Molarity = moles / volume(L)
Volume of HCl is 500 mL = 0.5 L.
Moles HCl = 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is H+ per mole, so 0.1 moles H+.

2. Calculate moles of H2SO4:
Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L.
Molarity 0.3 M → moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.
Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, so moles H+ = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

3. Calculate moles of Ba(OH)2:
Volume is 200 mL = 0.2
