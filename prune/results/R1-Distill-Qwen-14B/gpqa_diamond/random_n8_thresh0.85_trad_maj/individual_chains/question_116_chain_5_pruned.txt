Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

So, starting with compound A. The proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. NMR signals can tell me about the structure. I remember that triplets and quartets usually come from neighboring groups with a certain number of hydrogens. 

Wait, 0.9 ppm is typically a region where methyl groups appear, especially if they're attached to something like an oxygen or adjacent to another group. The triplet for 6H suggests that each of these groups is next to a CH2 group. Because each H in a triplet is split by two adjacent H's, maybe from a neighboring CH2. So, for 6H as a triplet, perhaps two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2. Because two CH3 groups (total 6H) would each be next to a CH2, which has 2H, leading to a triplet each. So that would account for the 0.9 triplet.

Then, the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet arises from coupling with a group that has three neighboring H's. Wait, no, wait. The splitting is based on neighboring groups. A quartet (which is a quartet, so four peaks) implies each H is next to a group with three H's. Wait, no, the number of neighbors is n+1 for the splitting. So a quartet comes from a neighboring group with n=3 H's, because 3+1=4. So 4H as a quartet must be a group of CH2CH2CH3 or something? Or maybe a CH2CH3 where each H is adjacent to a CH2 with 2 H's. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is due to two neighboring groups. Wait, maybe the quartet is from a CH2 group next to another CH2. Let me think: if a CH2 is next to another CH2, each H in the first CH2 would be split by the two H's in the adjacent CH2. So each would be a triplet? Wait, no, that's when the coupling is between two CH2 groups. Or wait, maybe it's a CH2 next to a CH3. So, a CH2 adjacent to a CH3 (which has three H's) would cause the CH2 to be a quartet. Because each H in CH2 is next to three H's in the CH3, so each splits into four peaks. So quartet. But then the CH2 would have 2H, so the quartet would be for 2H. But the given quartet is 4H. So perhaps two CH2 groups each adjacent to a CH3. So each CH2 is a quartet, and two CH2 groups would give 4H as a quartet.

Putting this together, maybe the structure of compound A is diethyl ether. Wait, diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. Let me check the NMR. Each CH3 in diethyl ether would be a triplet because each is adjacent to a CH2. The CH2 groups would be quartets because each is adjacent to the O and another CH2. Wait,
