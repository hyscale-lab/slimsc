Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativity concepts. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: one at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory. Also, energy calculations in relativity involve the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy, but wait, wait—do I use the total energy or just the rest mass energy?

Wait, the question says "total energy of the system." Oh, so each astronaut's energy contributes. So for each, I need to calculate their relativistic energies and add them together.

Let me break it down into parts.

First, the relative speed. So the problem is, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. From A's frame, what's B's speed? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the relative speed would depend on which frame you're considering. But in relativity, it's a bit more involved. Oh, right, the relative speed formula is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/c²). Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up the formula. Let me get it right.

The correct formula for the relative speed between two objects moving at v and u (both in the same direction) as observed from one of them is (v - u) / (1 - (vu)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you have two velocities, v and u, both in the same direction, according to special relativity, the relative speed is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/c²). So in this case, since both are moving in the positive x-direction, if I'm looking for the relative speed of one from the other's frame.

Wait, but which one is moving faster? The astronaut moving at 0.6c is faster than the one at 0.5c. So from the astronaut at 0.6c's frame, what is the speed of the 0.5c astronaut? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, the problem says "relative speed"—so perhaps it's the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. Which one? Well, maybe the problem is ambiguous, but looking at the options, perhaps it's one specific case.

But wait, the question says "relative speed." In relativity, the relative speed isn't symmetric. So perhaps the relative speed of the slower astronaut from the faster one's frame is different than the other way around. Let's get the exact formula.

The velocity of an object moving at u in the frame of another object moving at v (same direction) is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, no, I think it's (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), but wait, wait. Let me think again.

No, wait, the formula for the relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). But wait, let's get the correct formula.

The correct formula from Einstein's velocity addition is that if one frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then the velocity u' of an object in S' is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). So in this case, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c in S, and astronaut B at 0.5c in S, then from A's frame (S'), what's B's speed?

Wait, no, S is the rest frame. Let me clarify: the two astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction as observed from the Earth frame (let's say S). So in the Earth frame, A is moving at v =
