Okay, let's try to solve this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution that contains two different phosphates. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the problem states that we have a solution volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 grams of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water.

I remember that when you have a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, you can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. But wait, in this case, I'm looking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO₄^2- or maybe PO₄^3-? No, wait, orthophosphate is H₃PO₄. But in solution, it dissociates into H₂PO₄⁻, HPO₄^2-, and PO₄^3- based on the pH.

Wait, the solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. Let me think about what each of those dissociates into. KH₂PO₄ is potassium hydrogen phosphate. It should dissociate into K+ and H₂PO₄⁻. On the other hand, Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is sodium hydrogen phosphate with two water molecules. That would dissociate into 2Na+ and HPO₄^2- (since Na is +1, so two Na+ for each HPO₄^2-).

So, in the solution, we have H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄^2- ions. These are conjugate acid-base pairs, right? H₂PO₄⁻ is the acid (since it can donate a proton to become HPO₄^2-), and HPO₄^2- is the conjugate base.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, which pKa to use here? The problem gives us the three Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. 

Wait, the first dissociation is H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+. The second is H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+. The third is HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+. So, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are related by the second Ka, which is Ka2. So, the relevant pKa here would be pKa2. Let's calculate that: pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8). Let me approximate that. Log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 6.2e-8 would be 7.9, so pKa2 is 7.9? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8. So log(6.2) is 0.792, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.792 - 8 = -7.208. So pKa2 is 7.208.

Wait, wait, wait, no, wait. Oh no, wait. I think I messed up. Because pKa is -log(Ka), so for Ka2 = 6.2e-8, pKa is about 7.207. Because 1e-7 is pH 7, 1e-8 is 8; 6.2e-8 is a little less than 1e-7. So 1e-7 is 7, 6.2e-8 is 7.207. So yes, pKa2 is around 7.2.

So, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]). But wait, do I know the pH of the solution? No, not directly. Hmm, so I might need to find the pH first using the concentrations of these salts, and then use that to find the concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Wait, but another approach: the solution is a buffer because it has a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). So, the pH of the solution can be determined using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, once I know the ratio of the concentrations of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^-.

So, first, I need to calculate the moles of each component.

Let's compute the moles of KH2PO4. Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00735 moles. Because 1/136 is approximately 0.00735.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O: molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005608 moles.

Now, since each mole of KH2PO4 gives 1 mole of H2PO4^-, and each mole of Na2HPO4 gives 1 mole of HPO4^2-.

So, moles of H2PO4^- = 0.00735 mol.

Moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005608 mol.

The solution volume is 0.2 liters, so concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00735 / 0.2 = 0.03675 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005608 / 0.2 = 0.02804 M.

So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02804 / 0.03675 ≈ 0.7629.

So applying Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa2 + log(0.7629) 

pKa2 is around 7.207.

log(0.7629) is about -0.117 (since 10^-0.117 ≈ 0.76).

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.117 ≈ 7.09.

Wait, but wait, if the pH is around 7.09, which is close to the pKa2 of 7.207. Hmm, that's a slightly acidic solution.

Wait, but I'm actually looking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's going to dissociate. At pH around 7, which species is predominant?

Wait, the pKa1 is around 2.12 (since Ka1 is 7.5e-3; pKa1 ≈ 2.12), pKa2 is 7.207, pKa3 is 11.21 (since Ka3 is 1.8e-12; pKa3 ≈ 11.74). So at pH 7.09, which is just below pKa2, the solution is in the vicinity where H2PO4^- is the major species and HPO4^2- is the minor.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which is H3PO4. Wait, but H3PO4 is a weak acid and in solution, it dissociates. At pH 7, I don't think there's much H3PO4 left. Because H3PO4 has a pKa1 of ~2.12. So in neutral solution, it's mostly deprotonated to H2PO4^-.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the different phosphate species. The solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's in various forms. So, orthophosphate ion would be H3PO4 as the molecular form. But in water, it's mainly in the form of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- depending on pH.

Wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to the total concentration of PO4^3- or HPO4^2- or H2PO4^-? Or maybe it's specifically PO4^3-? No, I think orthophosphate refers to H3PO4, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for [HPO4^2-] or [H2PO4^-], but the options are around 1e-7, which is less than what we calculated earlier for [HPO4^2-], which is about 0.028 M. Hmm, so perhaps I missed something.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. These are salt forms of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which when dissolved in water, will dissociate into their respective ions. But in aqueous solution, these can act as acid and base, leading to the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, which is a triprotic acid. The various ions are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-.

Wait, but the term 'orthophosphate' could refer to any of these, but perhaps the question is about the concentration of the undissociated H3PO4, which is orthophosphoric acid. But in solution, especially at pH around 7, H3PO4 is not present in significant amounts because it's deprotonated.

Wait, but maybe the question is actually about the concentration of HPO4^2- or H2PO4^-.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the phosphate buffer system here. The solution is a buffer solution because it contains a weak acid and its conjugate base. The buffer resists changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. The pH of the solution is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base (HPO4^2-) to the acid (H2PO4^-).

But the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Maybe orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-? Or perhaps it's the sum of all phosphate species.

Wait, the options are in the range of 1e-7 M, which is much lower than the concentrations I calculated for H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- (which were around 0.036 and 0.028 M). So that suggests that I'm misunderstanding the question. Because those concentrations are way higher than any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the concentration of PO4^3- ions? Because in that case, PO4^3- would be present at a low concentration due to the third dissociation of HPO4^2-.

Hmm, but the solution's pH is around 7.09, which is below the pKa3 of ~11.74. So, at pH 7, HPO4^2- would not deprotonate much to form PO4^3-.

Wait, but why would the concentration of PO4^3- be so low? Because the solution is at pH 7, which is far below pKa3. So, HPO4^2- won't lose a proton
