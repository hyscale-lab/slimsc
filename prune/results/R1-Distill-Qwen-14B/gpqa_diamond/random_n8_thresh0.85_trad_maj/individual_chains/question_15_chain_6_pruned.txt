Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet's orbit and the size of the star.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their host stars have the same radius but different masses. The host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as that of Planet_2.

Wait, I think the transit probability depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star. Specifically, it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Oh right, the formula for the probability is (R_planet + R_star) / a_planet, but I think R_planet is much smaller, so it's approximately (R_star) / a_planet, but wait, no, the formula is actually (R_star / a_planet)^2 multiplied by something else? Or wait, I think the probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet). Because the probability depends on the area: the chance that the planet's path intersects our line of sight. So the probability P is roughly (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (something else?)).

Wait, no, I think it's (R_star / a_planet) squared? Or maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Let me think. The probability is the area of the circle (the star's disk) divided by the area of the planet's orbit. So the area of the star is π(R_star)^2, and the area of the orbit is π(a_planet)^2. So the ratio would be (R_star / a_planet)^2. But wait, that's the area ratio, which would be the probability if the planet's orbital plane is edge-on. But in reality, the probability also depends on the inclination. Oh wait, the transit probability also factors in whether the planet's orbit is aligned with our line of sight. But since the RV method already detected them, that means their orbits are close to edge-on. Because RV detects via Doppler shift, which requires some inclination, but not necessarily edge-on.

Wait, but the question says they have already been detected via RV, so they have known minimum masses
