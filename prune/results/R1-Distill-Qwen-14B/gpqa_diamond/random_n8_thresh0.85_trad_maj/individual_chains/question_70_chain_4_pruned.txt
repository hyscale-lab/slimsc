Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The problem describes a series of reactions and provides some clues about the substances involved. The key is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.

First, let's break down each reaction.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, the reaction is A + 8B → C. I'm thinking about compounds that are bright red. Maybe something like sulfur trioxide (SO3) isn't red, but wait, maybe it's a metal sulfide? Or perhaps it's a transition metal compound. Another thought: the reaction of a metal with a gas maybe. Like, if A is a metal and B is sulfur vapor? Or maybe B is a halogen? Wait, 8 equivalents is a lot. Let me think about common reactions.

Wait, 8 equivalents of B. Hmm. That makes me think of a reaction where B is O2. If A is a metal, say sodium, and B is O2, then maybe the product is NaO2? But I'm not sure. Or perhaps A is a metal oxide reacting with another oxide? Not sure yet.

2. Next, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C + 2D → E. The fact that E is extremely hazardous makes me think of something like sarin gas or another nerve agent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like chlorine or phosgene, but I'm not certain.

3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. So, C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, if the reaction of C with water gives two acids, perhaps C is a sulfite or sulfite-related compound. Wait, for example, if C is SO3, then reacting with water would give H2SO4 (strong acid) and maybe something else? Not exactly. Or perhaps C is a metal sulfide. Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a metal oxide. Let's think. Suppose C is Na2O2. Then, when it reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base, but F and G are acids. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, another approach: if C is Ag2O, but reacting with water would give AgNO3 and perhaps another product? Not sure.

Wait, when C reacts with water, it gives back A and two acids. So, perhaps C is a salt that breaks down into a metal (which is A) and two acids. For example, think about a metal nitrate. Wait, but if C is a nitrate salt, maybe. Let's think: suppose C is NaNO3. Then, reacting with water would just dissolve it, but not produce acids. Hmm, not right.

Alternatively, maybe C is something like a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. Reacting with water wouldn't change much. Or perhaps a sulfite, like CaSO3? If C is CaSO3, then reacting with water would give Ca(OH)2? No, that's a base. Wait, maybe C is a sulfide, like FeS. Then, FeS reacts with water (but FeS is a solid, and water might not react unless it's acidic). Hmm.

Wait, another angle: since C reacts with water to form two acids, perhaps C is a sulfite or sulfite-related compound. For example, if C is SO2Cl2, but when it reacts with water, it would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and HCl (which is strong as well). But the problem states that F is strong and G is weak. So if two acids, one strong, one weak, maybe they are sulfuric acid and another. Alternatively, maybe the acid is something like HNO3 and another.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride? Let's think: if C is Na3N, reacting with water would produce NaOH (strong base) and NH3 (weak base), but that's not giving acids. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite salt. For example, if C is CaSO3. Then, when it reacts with H2O, it would decompose into Ca(OH)2 (which is a base) and SO2 gas. Hmm, but SO2 is an acid gas. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate, but that seems not directly relevant.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. Let me think: if C is FeO, reacting with H2O would just form Fe(OH)2, which is a base. Not acids. Hmm.

Let me think again. The product of C and water is A plus two acids. So, C must be a salt that can split into a metal (A) and two acid components. One strong, one weak.

Wait, what about if C is a metal bicarbonate? No, bicarbonates decompose into carbon dioxide and a base. Not acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonate ester? Not sure.
