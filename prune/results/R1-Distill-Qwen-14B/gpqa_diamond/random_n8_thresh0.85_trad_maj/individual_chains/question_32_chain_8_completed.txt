Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, let's break it down. The question says that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c, and I need to calculate the energy. The options are given, so maybe after calculating, I can pick the right one.

Wait, first, what's nucleus X? The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, lithium usually has 3 protons. Li-6 has 3 neutrons, so its atomic number is 3 and mass number 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, which is a charged particle. But I'm not sure if the charge affects the calculation here. Maybe it doesn't because the energy is per nucleus, regardless of charge.

Now, the speed is 0.96 times the speed of light, so v = 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle is given by the total energy formula, which is gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? Gamma equals 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²) or 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus (v squared over c squared)).

So I need to compute gamma first. Let's plug in v = 0.96c. Then, v² is (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let me calculate that. Hmm, square of 0.28 is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.57142857... Wait, that's approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, the next step is to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m c squared. But I don't remember the exact mass of Li-6 off the top of my head. Oh wait, I think the atomic mass unit (u) can help here. Because 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So if I can find the mass of Li-6 in u, multiply by 931.5 MeV/u, I'll get the rest energy in MeV.

Li-6 has a mass of about 6.015 atomic mass units. Wait, I'm not certain about the exact value. Let me think. Lithium-6 has a mass of approximately 6.015 u. So m = 6.015 u. So m c² is 6.015 u * 931.5 MeV/u. Let me compute that. 6 * 931.5 = 5589, and 0.015 *931.5 is about 13.9725. So total is 5589 + 13.9725 = 5602.9725 MeV. Wait, but that's 5.6029725 GeV. Wait, because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 5602.9725 MeV is about 5.6029725 GeV.

Wait a second, but let me double-check the exact mass of Li-6. I think the exact value might be a bit different. Let me think: Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. The mass is the sum of the masses of the nucleons minus the binding energy (but for an approximate calculation, using the table mass is okay). Alternatively, maybe I should use standard values. I've read before that the mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units. So I think that's correct.

So m c² is 6.015 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute that more accurately. 6 * 931.5 is 5589. Then 0.015 *931.5 is 13.9725. Adding them gives 5602.9725 MeV, which is 5.6029725 GeV.

So the rest energy is 5.6029725 GeV. Now, the total energy is gamma times m c squared. So gamma is approximately 3.5714, as I found earlier. So 3.5714 * 5.6029725 GeV.

Let me compute that. Let's multiply 3.5714 by 5.6029725. Let me break it down:

3 *5.6029725 = 16.8089175
0.5714 *5.6029725: Let's compute 0.5 *5.6029725 = 2.80148625, and 0.0714 *5.6029725 ≈ 0.401358. So adding those gives approximately 3.20284425.

Adding to the previous 16.8089175: 16.8089175 +3.20284425 = 20.01176175 GeV.

Wait, but wait, let me compute more accurately. Because 3.5714 is actually 3 + 0.5714. So perhaps a better way is:

3.5714 ×5.6029725 = (3 ×5.6029725) + (0.5714 ×5.6029725)

3 ×5.6029725 = 16.8089175.

Now 0.5714 ×5.6029725: Let's compute 0.5 ×5.6029725 = 2.80148625. Then 0.0714 ×5.6029725. Let's see, 5.6029725 ×0.07 is 0.392208075. 5.6029725 ×0.0014 = approximately 0.0078441615. So total is about 0.392208075 + 0.0078441615 = 0.4000522365. So 0.0714 times 5.6029725 is approximately 0.40005.

So 0.5714 ×5.6029725 is 2.80148625 + 0.40005 = 3.20153625.

Adding that to 16.8089175 gives 16.8089175 +3.20153625=20.01045375 GeV.

But wait, the options given are in GeV, and the precision is 1e-4. Let me see the options: option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419 GeV, but wait, the calculation I did gave around 20.010 GeV. Hmm, none of the options match that. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the gamma calculation. Let me double-check that. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). v is 0.96c, so v² is 0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, that's correct. So the gamma is right.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of the rest mass energy is wrong. Let's see, 6.015 u ×931.5 MeV/u = 6.015 ×931.5 = let me compute that. 6 *931.5 = 5589. 0.015 *931.5=13.9725. So total is 5602.9725 MeV, which is 5.6029725 GeV. That seems correct.

So the energy would be gamma times that, which is 3.57142857 ×5.6029725 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 ×5.6029725:

We can compute 3.57142857 *5.6029725.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it using exact decimal places.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.6029725.

Let me write it as 3.57142857 *5.6029725.

Let me multiply 3.57142857 by 5.6029725.

First, 3 *5.6029725 = 16.8089175.

0.57142857 *5.6029725.

Wait, 0.57142857 is approximately 4/7, because 4/7 is about 0.57142857. So 4/7 *5.6029725.

Compute 5.6029725 *4 = 22.41189. Divide by 7: 22.41189 /7 = approximately 3.2016986.

So the total would be 16.8089175 +3.2016986 = 20.0106161 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.0106 GeV. But none of the options are close to that. The options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Wait, the closest is option C) 20.132 GeV. But my calculation gave 20.0106 GeV. Hmm, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of Li-6. Maybe the exact mass is higher. Let me check another source. Oh wait, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. For example, the standard value is about 6.015049 u. So maybe I should use 6.015049 u ×931.5 MeV/u.

Let me compute that: 6.015049 *931.5.

Wait, 6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.015049 *931.5 = let's compute that.

0.015 *931.5 =13.9725.

0.00049 *931.5 = approximately 0.456435.

So 13.9725 +0.456435 = 14.428935 MeV.

Adding to 5589: 5589 +14.428935 = 5603.428935 MeV =5.603428935 GeV.

So m c² is about 5.60343 GeV.

Now, gamma is approximately 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.60343 = ?

Let me compute that:

3.57142857 *5.60343.

Let me break it down:

3 *5.60343 = 16.81029.

0.57142857 *5.60343.

Again, 0.57142857 is 4/7.

So 5.60343 *4 =22.41372. Divide by 7: 22.41372 /7 =3.20196.

So adding 3.20196 to 16.81029 gives 20.01225 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.01225 GeV, which is approximately 20.012 GeV. But none of the options match this. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, which is higher. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me check that again.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2).

0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1-0.9216=0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So 1/0.28 = 3.57142857. That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Because 0.96c might not be exactly 0.96, but perhaps a more precise value would change the gamma slightly. Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation with more precise numbers.

Wait, let's compute gamma with more precision. Let's compute (v/c) as 0.96, so v²/c² is 0.96^2 =0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 =0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28 *0.28=0.0784. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714...

Wait, that's correct. So gamma is 3.57142857.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the rest mass. Let me check another source. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is different. Wait, the actual mass might be a bit different. Let me see, for example, the exact mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015049 u. So perhaps that's correct.

Wait, another thing: maybe the question is considering the ion as a deuteron or another isotope. No, the problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons, so that's Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I should use exact calculation without approximations.

Let me compute the exact gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute sqrt(1 -0.96^2) = sqrt(1 -0.9216)=sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714.

So gamma is 3.5714285714.

Now, the rest mass energy is 6.015049 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Compute that: 6.015049 ×931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 ×931.5 =5589.

0.015049 ×931.5 = ?

0.015×931.5=13.9725.

0.00049×931.5=0.456435.

13.9725 +0.456435 =14.428935.

So 5589 +14.428935=5603.428935 MeV, which is 5.603428935 GeV.

So now, gamma * m c^2 =3.5714285714 ×5.603428935.

Compute this.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×5.603428935.

I can approach this as 3.5714285714 ×5.603428935.

Let me compute using a calculator approach:

3.5714285714 ×5.603428935.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×5 = 17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.603428935 = ?

Wait, 0.603428935 is approximately 0.6 + 0.003428935.

So 3.5714285714 ×0.6 =2.14285714284.

3.5714285714 ×0.003428935 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×0.003428935.

0.003428935 ×3.5714285714 ≈ 0.012222222 approximately.

So adding 2.14285714284 +0.012222222 =2.1550793648.

So now, 3.5714285714 ×5.603428935 = 17.857142857 +2.1550793648 = 20.012222222 GeV.

So the energy is approximately 20.0122 GeV.

Looking at the options again:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, 20.0122 is closest to option C, which is 20.132 GeV, but it's about 0.12 GeV lower. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the mass of Li-6 and for gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic energy formula correctly, but maybe I should double-check the formula.

The total energy is gamma * m c².

Wait, but sometimes people calculate kinetic energy, but the question says 'energy of the collider', which is typically the total energy per particle.

Wait, the question says, "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

Assuming that's the kinetic energy? Or is it the total energy?

Wait, no, the collider's energy is usually given as the total energy, because it's the sum of the rest mass and kinetic energy. So I think I'm correct in using gamma m c².

Hmm, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is different. Let me check a more accurate value. Maybe the exact mass is 6.015049 u, but perhaps I should use more decimals. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is 6.015049 u × 931.5 MeV/u = let me recompute.

6.015049 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.015049 *931.5 = let's compute this accurately.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.000049 *931.5=0.0456435.

So 9.315 +4.6575 =13.9725 +0.0456435=14.0181435.

So total is 5589 +14.0181435=5603.0181435 MeV=5.6030181435 GeV.

So m c² is 5.6030181435 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.5714285714.

So 3.5714285714 ×5.6030181435.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.5714285714 *5.6030181435.

Let me write it as 3.5714285714 ×5.6030181435.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach. Let's compute:

=3.5714285714 * (5 + 0.6030181435)

=3.5714285714 *5 + 3.5714285714 *0.6030181435

=17.857142857 + (3.5714285714 *0.6030181435)

Compute 3.5714285714 *0.6030181435.

Let me compute this as:

0.6030181435 = 0.6 + 0.0030181435.

3.5714285714 *0.6 = 2.1428571428.

3.5714285714 *0.0030181435 ≈ ?

Compute 3.5714285714 ×0.0030181435.

0.003 ×3.5714285714 =0.01071428571.

0.0000181435 ×3.5714285714 ≈ approximately 0.00006494.

So total is approximately 0.01071428571 +0.00006494 ≈0.0107792257.

So 3.5714285714 ×0.6030181435 ≈2.1428571428 + 0.0107792257 ≈2.1536363685.

Adding to 17.857142857:

17.857142857 +2.1536363685 =20.010779225 GeV.

So approximately 20.010779 GeV. Still, the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. But that's 0.121 GeV higher than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me compute gamma again. Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the square root.

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, so no issue there.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should consider that the problem expects the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Let's see what the kinetic energy would be.

The kinetic energy is (gamma -1 ) m c².

In that case, (3.5714285714 -1) =2.5714285714.

Multiply by 5.6030181435 GeV:

2.5714285714 *5.6030181435.

Compute this:

2 *5.6030181435 =11.206036287.

0.5714285714 *5.6030181435.

Again, 0.5714285714 is 4/7.

4/7 *5.6030181435 = (5.6030181435 *4)/7 =22.412072574 /7 ≈3.201724653.

So 11.206036287 +3.201724653 ≈14.40776094 GeV.

But the options don't include this either, so I think the problem is asking for the total energy, not the kinetic.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me check another source. The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.015049 atomic mass units. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of the atomic mass unit. 1 u = 931.494065 MeV/c².

So, 6.015049 u ×931.494065 MeV/u.

Compute that:

6 *931.494065 =5588.96439 MeV.

0.015049 u ×931.494065 MeV/u.

0.015049 ×931.494065 = let's calculate.

0.01 *931.494065 =9.31494065.

0.005 *931.494065=4.657470325.

0.000049 ×931.494065≈0.045643209.

Adding these:9.31494065 +4.657470325=13.972410975 +0.045643209=14.018054184 MeV.

So total m c² is 5588.96439 +14.018054184 =5602.982444 MeV =5.602982444 GeV.

So gamma is 3.5714285714, so total energy is 3.5714285714 *5.602982444 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714285714 ×5.602982444.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3 ×5.602982444 =16.808947332.

0.5714285714 ×5.602982444.

Again, 0.5714285714 is 4/7.

(5.602982444 ×4) =22.411929776.

Divide by 7: 22.411929776 /7=3.201704254.

So total is 16.808947332 +3.201704254=20.010651586 GeV.

Hmm, 20.01065 GeV. The options don't have this. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Because perhaps the exact value of 0.96 is being considered as a fraction, leading to a more precise gamma.

Wait, 0.96 is 24/25. So v =24c/25. So v² = (24^2 c²)/(25^2) )= 576 c² /625.

So 1 - v²/c² =1-576/625= (625-576)/625=49/625.

So sqrt(49/625)=7/25=0.28, as before. So gamma is 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So no change, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the mass is being considered differently. Maybe the problem expects the mass number A to be used, but that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be done using the exact values without rounding, leading to a more precise result.

Wait, let me compute 3.5714285714 ×5.602982444.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×5.602982444.

Breakdown:

3 ×5.602982444 =16.808947332.

0.5714285714 ×5.602982444 = ?

0.5714285714 is 4/7, so:

5.602982444 ×4 =22.411929776.

22.411929776 ÷7 =3.2017042537.

So total is 16.808947332 +3.2017042537=20.010651586 GeV.

Hmm, still about 20.01065 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects considering the rest mass as 6 u exactly. Let's see what happens.

If I take m =6 u, then m c²=6 ×931.5 MeV =5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714285714.

So 3.5714285714 ×5.589 = ?

3 ×5.589=16.767.

0.5714285714 ×5.589.

0.5 ×5.589=2.7945.

0.0714285714 ×5.589≈0.4001.

Adding 2.7945 +0.4001=3.1946.

Total energy=16.767+3.1946=20. (exactly 20.0 GeV? Wait, 16.767+3.1946=20. (16.767 +3.1946=20.0?) Wait, 16.767 +3.1946=19.9616 GeV, approximately 19.9616 GeV.

Hmm, but that's even further from the options.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of the speed. The problem says 0.96c, but perhaps in precise terms, 0.96 is 96/100 =24/25, which we used earlier. So maybe that's not the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic energy formula with the correct units, but I think I've done that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the energy per nucleon or per ion, but I think I used the correct mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of the proton and neutron separately, but I think that's not necessary here.

Wait, another thought: the nucleus has Z protons and A-Z neutrons. For Li-6, Z=3, A=6, so 3 protons and 3 neutrons. But perhaps the mass is calculated as sum of individual nucleons minus binding energy. But using the atomic mass is simpler and more precise.

So unless I made a mistake in the initial calculation, none of the options match. But perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, and the slight discrepancy is due to rounding.

Wait, perhaps using more precise values for the atomic mass unit.

1 u =931.494065 MeV/c².

So, 6.015049 u =6.015049 ×931.494065 MeV.

Compute 6 ×931.494065=5588.96439 MeV.

0.015049 ×931.494065= let me compute that.

0.01 ×931.494065=9.31494065.

0.005 ×931.494065=4.657470325.

0.000049 ×931.494065=0.045643209.

Adding these:9.31494065+4.657470325=13.972410975 +0.045643209=14.018054184 MeV.

So total m c²=5588.96439 +14.018054184=5602.982444 MeV=5.602982444 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714285714.

So, 3.5714285714 ×5.602982444 GeV.

Let me compute it precisely.

3.5714285714 ×5.602982444 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×5.602982444.

Another approach: 3.5714285714 ×5.602982444 = (let me use exact decimals for both numbers.)

3.5714285714 ×5.602982444.

Let me calculate this using the long multiplication method.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that 3.5714285714 is 25/7.

So 25/7 ×5.602982444 = (25 ×5.602982444)/7.

Compute numerator:25 ×5.602982444= 140.0745611.

Divide by 7: 140.0745611 /7 =20.0106516 GeV.

Hmm, exactly as before.

So the calculation keeps giving me approximately 20.01065 GeV, but the options don't have that. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. The problem says to choose from the given options, but perhaps I've made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, looking back at the problem statement, it says 'the precision of the energy is at 1e-4.' So the answer should be precise to four decimal places. Let's see what the options are.

Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 20.1320 GeV when considering four decimal places.

But my calculation is about 20.0106 GeV. So there's a discrepancy of about 0.12 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me check online for the exact mass of Li-6.

Upon checking, the exact mass is approximately 6.015049 atomic mass units. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the mass of the deuteron, but no, deuteron is H-2 with one proton and one neutron. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the kinetic energy to be calculated as (gamma -1) m c^2.

In that case, (3.5714285714 -1 )=2.5714285714.

Multiply by 5.602982444 GeV:

2.5714285714 ×5.602982444 ≈14.40776 GeV. But that's not any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the total energy of the collider, which is sometimes given as the sum of the two beams. Wait, no, RHIC collides two beams, but the energy per beam would be half of the total. But the question says 'the energy of the RHIC', which I think refers to the total center-of-mass energy. But the way the question is phrased, perhaps it's considering the energy per nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the energy per nucleus, which is what I've calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma again.

v =0.96c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. All my calculations lead me to approximately 20.01065 GeV, but the options don't have this. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher. Could I have made a mistake in the rest mass calculation? Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mass is 6.015049 u, and 1 u is 931.494065 MeV/c².

So, 6.015049 ×931.494065 = ?

Let me compute this exactly.

6 *931.494065 =5588.96439 MeV.

0.015049 ×931.494065 = ?

Let me compute 0.015 ×931.494065 =13.972410975.

0.000049 ×931.494065 =0.045643209.

So total is 13.972410975 +0.045643209=14.018054184 MeV.

So total m c²=5588.96439 +14.018054184=5602.982444 MeV=5.602982444 GeV.

Yes, that's correct.

So, perhaps the problem expects a different approach or there's a typo in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass energy in a different way. Let me recheck the relativistic energy formula.

Total energy E = gamma m c².

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m c².

But the question specifically asks for the energy of the RHIC, which is the total energy. So I think I'm correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed as 0.96c, but perhaps it's considering beta as 0.96, which is correct. So no issue.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise decimal places in gamma.

Gamma is 3.5714285714285714... So perhaps I should use more precise decimals in the calculation.

But using more precise decimals:

3.5714285714 ×5.602982444.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator with precise decimals:

3.5714285714 ×5.602982444.

Let me compute it step by step.

3.5714285714 ×5.602982444.

Let me multiply 3.5714285714 by 5.602982444.

Compute:

3.5714285714 ×5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.602982444 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×0.602982444.

0.6 ×3.5714285714 =2.1428571428.

0.002982444 ×3.5714285714 ≈0.01065154.

So 0.602982444 ×3.5714285714 ≈2.1428571428 +0.01065154=2.1535086828.

So total E=17.857142857 +2.1535086828=20.01065154 GeV.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm missing a factor. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the speed as 0.96 times c, but I didn't account for anything else. Could it be that the nucleus has a charge, and that affects the energy in some way? No, the charge affects the magnetic fields in the collider but not the energy of the nucleus itself.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of a single nucleon, but that doesn't make sense because the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, which is a heavier nucleus.

Hmm, perhaps I should choose the closest option, which is option C)20.132 GeV. But my calculation says 20.0106 GeV. That's a difference of about 0.12 GeV, which is about 120 MeV. That's significant and probably not due to rounding.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the atomic mass unit.

Wait, 1 u =931.494065 MeV/c².

Let me compute m c² again.

6.015049 u ×931.494065 MeV/u.

Compute 6 ×931.494065 =5588.96439 MeV.

0.015049 ×931.494065.

Compute 0.01 ×931.494065=9.31494065 MeV.

0.005 ×931.494065=4.657470325 MeV.

0.000049 ×931.494065=0.045643209 MeV.

So sum:9.31494065 +4.657470325=13.972410975 MeV +0.045643209=14.018054184 MeV.

Total m c²:5588.96439 +14.018054184=5602.982444 MeV=5.602982444 GeV.

Same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.5714285714 ×5.602982444 more precisely.

3.5714285714 ×5.602982444 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×5.602982444.

Breaking it down:

(3 + 0.5714285714) × (5 + 0.602982444) = 3×5 +3×0.602982444 +0.5714285714×5 +0.5714285714 ×0.602982444.

Compute each term:

3×5=15.

3×0.602982444=1.808947332.

0.5714285714×5=2.857142857.

0.5714285714 ×0.602982444.

Compute 0.5714285714 ×0.6 =0.3428571428.

0.5714285714 ×0.002982444 ≈0.00170327.

So 0.5714285714 ×0.602982444 ≈0.3428571428 +0.00170327=0.3445604128.

Now, sum all terms:

15 +1.808947332 =16.808947332.

16.808947332 +2.857142857=19.666090189.

19.666090189 +0.3445604128=20.010650602 GeV.

So approximately 20.01065 GeV.

Hmm, so none of the options match. But the options given don't include this value. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Because 0.96 is a high speed, gamma is about 3.5714. But perhaps using a more precise value for 0.96 gives a slightly different gamma.

Wait, perhaps 0.96 is a decimal approximation, and the exact value might lead to a different gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator for precise gamma calculation.

Wait, let me compute gamma precisely.

v =0.96c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

No, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to include the binding energy more accurately, but I think the atomic mass already accounts for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the kinetic energy, which would be approximately 14.40776 GeV, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express all the steps with the exact numbers.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the approximation of the mass. Let me compute the exact value:

Li-6 has a mass of 6.015049 u.

1 u =931.494065 MeV/c².

So m c²=6.015049 ×931.494065 =5602.982444 MeV=5.602982444 GeV.

Gamma=3.5714285714.

E=3.5714285714 ×5.602982444 =20.01065 GeV.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The options don't have this. Perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I can't see where I went wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using a different approach, like using the rest mass energy of a single proton, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as a collection of protons and neutrons, but I think I was correct to use the atomic mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try each option and see which one gives a speed of 0.96c.

Let's try option C)20.132 GeV.

E =20.132 GeV.

m c² =5.602982444 GeV.

gamma = E/(m c²) =20.132 /5.602982444 ≈3.595.

Compute beta from gamma.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/gamma.

1 - beta^2 =1/(gamma^2).

Beta^2 =1 - 1/(gamma^2).

With gamma=3.595.

Compute gamma^2= (3.595)^2= approx 12.923.

1/(gamma^2)=1/12.923≈0.07736.

So beta^2=1-0.07736=0.92264.

Beta= sqrt(0.92264)=0.96055.

Which is approximately 0.96055c, which is close to 0.96c.

So option C)20.132 GeV would correspond to beta≈0.96055c, which is a bit higher than 0.96c.

But the problem states the speed is exactly 0.96c, so perhaps option C is the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation expects using gamma=3.5714 and getting E=20.0106 GeV, but that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV, despite the slight discrepancy. Because when I compute E=20.132 GeV, the beta comes out to be approximately 0.96055c, which is very close to 0.96c.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation with more precise gamma would yield option C.

Wait, perhaps I should compute with a more precise gamma.

Given that E=20.132 GeV, and m c²=5.602982444 GeV,

gamma =20.132 /5.602982444 =3.5952.

Compute beta from gamma=3.5952.

gamma =3.5952=1/sqrt(1-beta^2).

So, sqrt(1-beta^2)=1/3.5952≈0.27806.

1-beta^2= (0.27806)^2=0.07731.

Beta^2=1-0.07731=0.92269.

Beta= sqrt(0.92269)=0.96058.

So beta=0.96058c, which is approximately 0.96c.

So, for E=20.132 GeV, the speed is approximately 0.96058c, which is close to 0.96c. So option C is the closest match.

Therefore, the answer should be option C)20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), \( v = 0.96c \), and \( m \) is the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed \( v = 0.96c \), so:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the rest mass energy of Li-6
The rest mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.015049 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494065 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
m c^2 = 6.015049 \times 931.494065 \, \text{MeV}
\]

Breaking this down:

\[
6 \times 931.494065 = 5588.96439 \, \text{MeV}
\]

\[
0.015049 \times 931.494065 = 14.018054184 \, \text{MeV}
\]

\[
m c^2 = 5588.96439 + 14.018054184 = 5602.982444 \, \text{MeV} = 5.602982444 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.602982444 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this down:

\[
3 \times 5.602982444 = 16.808947332 \, \text{GeV}
\]

\[
0.5714 \times 5.602982444 = 3.201704253 \, \text{GeV}
\]

\[
E = 16.808947332 + 3.201704253 = 20.010651585 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.0107 \, \text{GeV} \). However, none of the options match this value exactly. The closest option is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which corresponds to a speed slightly higher than \( 0.96c \) (approximately \( 0.96055c \)).

### Conclusion
Given the precision of the problem and the options provided, the best match is:

**Answer: C**
