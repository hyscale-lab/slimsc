Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that compound X, which has the molecular formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given. We need to figure out what Compound X is based on the options provided.

Wait, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides. Oh right, it's a base that can open epoxides, but wait no, wait. Wait, no—the reaction with an epoxide and a base usually leads to ring-opening. Hmm, but wait, no. Actually, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is often used in the Sharpless epoxidation, but wait, that's for epoxidizing double bonds. Oh wait, no, Sharpless epoxidation uses a different setup. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed epoxide opening? Or perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation itself.

Wait, wait, the compound X is reacting with this reagent. So if X is an alkene, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide. So X would have a double bond, and the product would be an epoxide. Because the options are all epoxides, actually. Let me check the options.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So that's an oxirane ring (epoxide) attached to a styryl group at position 4-methyl. So the styryl is a benzene ring with a CH2 group attached to the oxirane.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Hmm, that's a bit more complex. The substituent is a propenyl group with a phenyl on the first carbon. So like, the oxirane is attached to a CH2-CH2-Ph group? Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me visualize: the substituent is at position 2 of the oxirane. So the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which would be CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2? Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached at C2. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2 but that's not right. Wait, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2- where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So the structure would be: the oxirane is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a double bond (CH2-CH2-CH2?), no, perhaps that's not right. Maybe it's -CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? I'm getting a bit confused.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So oxirane is a three-membered ring with an oxygen. The substituents would be a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. So it's an epoxide where one oxygen is attached to a methyl, the other to a styryl group.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. That's an oxirane with a styryl group attached to position 2. So the epoxide is connected directly to the styryl group.

Wait, but the product is formed by reacting X with the reagent. So if X is an epoxide, then reacting it with a base would open the epoxide. But the product's NMR suggests that it's another epoxide, perhaps? Or maybe X is an epoxide that is being modified.

Wait, no. Wait, the reaction is done in a nonpolar solvent at high temperature (403 K, which is about 130°C). So when an epoxide is treated with a base like 1,4-diazabicyclooctane, it typically undergoes ring-opening. But the product here is being given as the result of that reaction, so perhaps the product is the ring-opened product, but looking at the NMR, I don't see any obvious signs of that.

Wait, but looking at the options, all of them are epoxides. So perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation. Wait, but 1,4-diazabicyclooctane is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's involved in some other kind of reaction, like a rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the reagent is used in some other way. Wait, I think I might be mixing up reactions here. Another thought: perhaps this is a ring-opening of an epoxide followed by some reaction. Or maybe the reaction isn't about epoxide at all. Wait, maybe the starting material X is an alkene and the reagent is an epoxidizing agent. Wait, but 1,4-diazabicyclooctane is not an oxidizing agent. Oh wait, perhaps it's part of the epoxidation conditions. Wait, in the presence of an acid, perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide. Let me think: suppose X is an epoxide, and upon treatment with a base, it opens to form a diol
