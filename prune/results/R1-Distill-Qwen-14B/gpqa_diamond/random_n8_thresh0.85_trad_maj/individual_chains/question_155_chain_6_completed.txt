Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm. Let's try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

So the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. The uncertainty is ΔP_z, right? I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). But wait, first I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write that down. So the state |ψ> is:

|ψ> = [ -1/2,
         1/sqrt(2),
         -1/2 ]

And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Since P_z is diagonal in its own basis, that should make things easier. So the basis states are |z+>, |z_middles>, |z->? Wait, no, P_z matrix is given as:

P_z matrix is:
[ hbar, 0, 0;
  0, 0, 0;
  0, 0, -hbar ]

So the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which are along the z-axis. Each basis vector corresponds to a diagonal element. So |1> is [1,0,0], which gives eigenvalue hbar. |2> is [0,1,0], eigenvalue 0. |3> is [0,0,1], eigenvalue -hbar.

Wait, but the state vector is given in this basis. So to compute expectation values, I can just take the components and multiply by the eigenvalues.

Wait, no. I think I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the matrix elements are easy to compute.

Let me write P_z as a diagonal matrix:

P_z = diag( hbar, 0, -hbar )

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of |a_i|^2 * P_z_ii, where a_i are the components of the state vector.

Wait, the state is given as a column vector with three components: a, b, c. So a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(2), c = -1/2.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = |a|^2 * hbar + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-hbar).

Let me calculate each term:

|a|^2 = ( (-1/2)^2 ) = 1/4
|b|^2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2
|c|^2 = ( (-1/2)^2 ) = 1/4

So putting it together:

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*hbar + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-hbar) = (1/4 - 1/4) hbar = 0.

Wait, that's zero? Interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now, for ⟨P_z²⟩, since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the squares of the diagonal elements. So P_z² = diag( (hbar)^2, 0^2, (-hbar)^2 ) = diag( hbar², 0, hbar² ).

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of |a|^2 * (hbar²) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * hbar².

Calculating each term:

|a|^2 * hbar² = (1/4) hbar²
|b|^2 * 0 = 0
|c|^2 * hbar² = (1/4) hbar²

So summing them up: (1/4 + 1/4) hbar² = (1/2) hbar².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2) hbar².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this simplifies to sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ ) = sqrt( (1/2) hbar² ) = (hbar) * sqrt(1/2) = hbar / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me double-check the state vector. The given state is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]. Let me check if this is normalized. The sum of squares is (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25) = 1. So yes, it is normalized.

Hmm, so the uncertainty is hbar over sqrt(2). Looking at the options:

Option B is hbar/sqrt(2), which is what I got. So the answer should be B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The given state vector is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the given basis, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c = -\frac{1}{2}$. The squared magnitudes are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4}\hbar - \frac{1}{4}\hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the squared magnitudes:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
