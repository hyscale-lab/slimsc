Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me outline each step and see what's happening.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, to form an alkene. So, the product here is probably a diene or something similar. The product is a light yellow solid, which makes me think it's an alkene, maybe a more substituted one because they're usually more stable and form as major products (Zaitsev's rule). 

The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But wait, elimination reactions of dihalides usually form alkenes, not ketones. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait, unless it's not a simple elimination. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, so when KOH is used, maybe it's dehydrohalogenation but for a different structure. Or perhaps it's more like a neighboring group elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihalide undergoing a double elimination to form a diketone? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait. I think I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the reaction is heating with KOH. So for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on adjacent carbons? No, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1 and 3 positions are not adjacent. Oh wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure. Let me imagine the structure. Adamantane has a structure similar to four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, 1 and 3 would be on adjacent bridgeheads. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two bridgehead carbons.

Wait, when KOH is heated with a vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromoalkane), it forms an alkene via elimination. But in this case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide. So maybe it's a 1,3-dibromide undergoing a different kind of elimination or substitution.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the formation of a ketone. Wait, but how would that happen? Wait, when a geminal dihalide (two halogens on the same carbon) reacts with a base, it can form a ketone via the haloform reaction. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not geminal; the Brs are on different carbons. Hmm. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing an elimination to form an alkene or maybe a cyclopropane? No, cyclopropane would require adjacent bromines, I think. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen from each Br, leading to the formation of two double bonds. But that would require a dihalide that's vicinal. Oh wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal, so maybe it's a different structure.

Wait, maybe after elimination, it's forming a ketone through some other mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but I don't see how that would involve KOH. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking at a Hofmann elimination or something else, but I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That suggests the product has a ketone group. So, how can 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH form a ketone? Maybe the base is causing some kind of elimination that produces a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: 1,3-dibromoadamantane may lose two molecules of HBr, but how? Let me think. The structure of adamantane is such that the 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. So, each has two adjacent bridgehead carbons. Wait, perhaps each bridgehead carbon has a Br.

If there are two Br atoms on adjacent bridgehead carbons, then elimination could form a double bond between those bridgeheads. But bridgehead double bonds are possible but not common due to Bredt's rule. However, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which can sometimes have bridgehead double bonds because of the structure's stability.

Wait, if the base (KOH) abstracts a β-hydrogen from each Br, leading to the formation of a double bond between the two bridgeheads. So the product would be a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond between the 1 and 3 positions. But then, what about the IR peak? If it's an alkene, the IR would show C=C absorption around 1650 cm⁻¹, not a carbonyl. Hmm, but the IR here is at 1720, which is more in line with a ketone.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the reaction wrong. Maybe it's not elimination but substitution. If KOH is a base, perhaps it's doing an E2 elimination, but if it's a strong base, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Alternatively, perhaps the two bromines are on adjacent positions, allowing for the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, if two Brs are on adjacent carbons, perhaps the elimination leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: when you have a 1,2-dibromide, elimination can form an alkene. But what about a 1,3-dibromide? Maybe it's a di-elimination leading to a conjugated diene. But that wouldn't explain the IR peak of 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. Let me think of how that could happen. If each Br is on a bridgehead, and perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to each Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Oh wait, wait. If the two adjacent bridgehead carbons each lose a Br and a hydrogen, perhaps the two carbons become double-bonded and each would have a carbonyl group? That doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps each bridgehead carbons loses a Br and a hydrogen, forming a ring with a carbonyl. Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the structure differently. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings. So, 1 and 3 are probably on adjacent positions. If each has a Br, maybe elimination would cause the formation of a bridgehead double bond. However, that would produce an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps after elimination, the product is a ketone because of some ring opening. Alternatively, maybe it's an oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the NMR data given for product 1. The 1H NMR shows: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So, what could that structure be?

The singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom
