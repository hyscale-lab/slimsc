Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Okay, the problem describes a series of reactions, and based on these reactions, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. 

Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that these relate to the molecular shapes and their symmetries in chemistry. For example, something like CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. But wait, let me think about each reaction and figure out what the compounds are.

First, the reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
   - 8 equivalents suggests a 1:8 molar ratio. So, the reaction might be something like A + 8B → C.

2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous.
   - So, C + 2D → E.

3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak.
   - So, C + H2O → A + F + G.

4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.
   - So, D + B → H.

Let me try to deduce what these compounds are. 

Starting with reaction 4: D + B → H, which is a solvent. Common solvents are like water (H2O), ethanol, acetone, etc. Wait, but D and B are gases. Let's think. If D and B combine in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent, maybe H is something like H2O. But wait, H2O is not formed from two gases in a 1:1 ratio unless the gases are H2 and O2. But H2 and O2 in 1:1 would form H2O, but that's not a gas; it's a liquid. Alternatively, maybe B and D are something else.

Wait another thought: D + B → H, and H is a solvent. What if B is HCl and D is something else? No, because HCl is a gas, but I'm not sure. Let me think differently.

Wait, maybe B is H2O (but it's a gas?), but water is a liquid. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps H is something like ethanol, but that's made from reacting something like CO2 with H2, but that would require more specific reactions.

Another approach: looking at reaction 3, C reacts with water to produce A (a solid), F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, when C is treated with H2O, it breaks down into a solid and two acids.

Let me think about possible compounds. Maybe C is a metal sulfide? For example, when a metal sulfide reacts with water, it could produce the metal hydroxide (solid) and H2S gas, but H2S is a weak acid. Wait, but in reaction 3, C gives two different acids. So perhaps C is a sulfite or something else.

Wait another thought: if C is a nitride, like AlN, but reacting with H2O would produce NH3 and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But NH3 is a base, not an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate? No, reacting with water would just dissolve it, but maybe not produce acids.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a metal chloride. But how would that produce two acids? Hmm.

Wait, let's think about reaction 1: A + 8B → C (bright red). Bright red product... what chemical reactions form bright red products? Maybe something involving silver or sulfur. Oh, wait! Maybe A is Ag (solid silver), and B is S (sulfur gas). Silver reacting with sulfur forms Ag2S, but I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe and B is S, forming FeS? No, FeS is black. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is Cu (solid copper) and B is S (sulfur). Copper and sulfur react to form CuS, but I'm not sure about the product's color. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where a metal reacts with sulfur to form a sulfide. Another thought: perhaps A is Fe (iron) and B is S. Fe + S might form FeS, which is black, but maybe in certain conditions, it can form something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another angle: the product C is used in reaction 2 with D to form E. Let's think about reaction 2. C + 2D → E, and E is extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous chemicals? Like sarin gas, or other nerve agents, but perhaps more likely, something like HCl gas? Not sure. Another thought: maybe E is something like phosgene, which is highly toxic, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide, and D is something like H2O or H2. Wait, but D is a gas reacting with B.

Wait, let's go back to reaction 4: D + B → H, a solvent. Let's think about what solvents are made from the reaction of two gases. For example, H2O is made from H2 and O2. But then H2 and O2 are gases, and their reaction (with spark) gives H2O, which is a liquid. So perhaps H is H2O, which is a solvent. So D and B must be H2 and O2. But that would make H as H2O.

Wait, but in reaction 1, A reacts with 8 equivalents of B (O2?) to form C. So, A + 8 O2 → C. What solid reacts with O2 in a 8:1 ratio? Hmm, thinking about metal oxidation. For example, maybe A is Fe (iron), and it reacts with O2 to form Fe3O4. Let me see: Fe3O4 has the formula FeO·Fe2O3, which can be written as Fe3O4. The reaction for forming Fe3O4 is 3 Fe + 2 O2 → Fe3O4 (but I think the stoichiometry is 3 Fe + 2 O2 → Fe3O4). Wait, but in reaction 1, 8 equivalents of B (O2) would mean 8 moles of O2 per mole of A. So if A is Fe, and reaction is Fe + 8 O2 → FeO4? But FeO4 isn't a common compound. Alternatively, maybe A is Fe and reacts to form FeO4^2- or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2, a gas. So reaction 1 would be A + 8 Cl2 → C. What solid reacts with excess Cl2 to form a product? For example, maybe A is P (phosphorus). P reacts with Cl2 to form PCl5. Let's see: P (solid) + Cl2 → PCl5. The reaction is 2 P + 5 Cl2 → 2 PCl5. So 2 P would require 5 Cl2. But in reaction 1, it's 8 equivalents of B (Cl2) per A. So if the stoichiometry is 1 A : 8 B, then perhaps A is something else.

Wait, another idea: if B is H2, a gas, and D is O2. Then, reaction 4 would be H2 + O2 → H2O (H is H2
