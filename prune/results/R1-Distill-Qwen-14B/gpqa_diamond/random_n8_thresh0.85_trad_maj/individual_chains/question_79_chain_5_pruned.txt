Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think it through. The question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction and the resulting NMR spectra. Hmm.

Alright, the reaction involved is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? I think it's often used in elimination reactions. Oh, right, it's a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So maybe Compound X undergoes an elimination reaction here.

The product's NMR data is given. Let me look at the 1H NMR first.

The 1H NMR has the following signals:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

So, there are two singlets around 2.28 and 2.31 for 3H each. That suggests two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Maybe attached to an electronegative atom or in a symmetric environment. Maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like in an epoxide?

Looking at the aromatic region: the signals are around 6.75 to 7.71. The splitting is all doublets and a doublet of doublets perhaps? Wait, the integration shows 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. So maybe an aromatic ring with substituents causing this splitting.

In 13C NMR, the signals are:
- 21.3 (1C, s)
- 28.4 (1C, s)
- 126.9 (2C, s)
- 127.1 (1C, s)
- 129.1 (2C, s)
- 130.3 (1C, s)
- 141.5 (1C, s)
- 144.1 (1C, s)
- 197.7 (1C, s)

Wait, 197.7 ppm is really high. That's probably a carbonyl group. Wait, but in epoxides, the carbons are around 50-60 ppm. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, 197.7 is more like a ketone or an aldehyde. Or maybe an ester? Wait no, maybe a carboxylic acid? No, those are lower. Wait, or maybe a carbonyl in something else. Or wait, perhaps an epoxide where the ring has opened? Wait, but the reaction used a base, so maybe an elimination happened leading to a carbonyl?

Wait, but if the product has a carbonyl, then the starting material must have had a structure that could form a carbonyl upon elimination. Like, perhaps an alcohol or an ether that dehydrated. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide opening.

Wait, if the reaction is elimination, maybe the starting compound is an epoxide and it's undergoing ring-opening. But wait, the problem says that the product is formed by treating Compound X with that base. So, maybe X is an epoxide and the base caused it to open, perhaps leading to a diene or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the base caused an elimination from a structure with a leaving group. So, if X is an epoxide, and under basic conditions, it could open to form a carbonyl. Or wait, maybe X is a diol that forms an epoxide upon reaction. No, wait, the reaction conditions are for elimination.

Wait, let me think again. The starting material is X, after treatment with the base, gives a product with a carbonyl. So perhaps X is an epoxide, and the base caused ring-opening via a nucleophilic attack, but with a nonpolar solvent, perhaps it's more about elimination.

Hmm, alternatively, perhaps the base is causing an E2 elimination, forming a double bond. So X must have a structure that can lose a small molecule (like water or something) to form a double bond. For example, if X is an epoxide with adjacent hydroxyl groups, but that's not likely. Alternatively, if X is a cyclic ether with substituents that can eliminate.

Wait, another approach. Let's analyze the product's structure based on NMR.

Looking at the 1H NMR:
- Two singlet methyl groups at δ ~2.3. Maybe attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. So perhaps they're on adjacent carbons, like in a structure where each is attached to an oxygen (like an epoxide with two methyl groups on adjacent carbons).

The aromatic signals are interesting. Let's see:

For the aromatic, the doublets: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Hmm, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents causing splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group attached to a benzene, like styrene.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows a triplet of doublets perhaps? Or maybe a pair of doublets. If the aromatic region has a doublet of doublets, maybe it's a trans coupling. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diene or has conjugated double bonds.

Wait, looking at the 13C NMR: 197.7 is a carbonyl, so maybe it's an ketone. But wait, how does that fit with the H-NMR? There's no strong indication of a carbonyl in the H-NMR. Or wait, maybe it's an aldehyde, but the H would show a singlet around 9-10 ppm, which isn't present here. So maybe a ketone.

But the 13C NMR also shows a carbon at 144.1 and 141.5. Those are likely carbons attached to oxygen, maybe carbonyls or ethers. Also, the 126-130 region suggests aromatic carbons.

Wait, let me count the carbons. The 13C NMR has 9 signals. The molecular formula of the product is given? Wait, no, the initial compound X is C11H12O. Wait, but the product's formula would depend on the reaction. Wait, the question doesn't give the product's formula. Hmm.

Wait, the reaction is between X and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Diazabicyclo is a base, so maybe it's deprotonating and causing elimination. So X might have a structure that can eliminate a molecule (like water or something) to form a more conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps X is an epoxide, and upon treatment with the base, it opens to form a carbonyl. For example, if X has an epoxide adjacent to a carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a diol that forms an epoxide upon elimination. But no, the opposite: X is an epoxide, and upon treatment, it opens.

Wait, perhaps the product is a styrene oxide. No, wait, styrene oxide is an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe the product is a carbonyl compound.

Wait, looking at the 1H NMR, the aromatic signals. Let's see:

δ 6.75 (1H, d): Maybe a proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group.
δ 7.08 (2H, d): Possibly two protons next to each other in a para position.
δ 7.68 (1H, d): Maybe another proton in a meta position.
δ 7.71 (2H, d): Two protons perhaps in another para position.

Wait, that might indicate a structure with a benzene ring substituted with groups that cause this splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group attached to a benzene, like a styryl group.

Wait, the 13C NMR has a carbon at 197.7, which is probably a ketone. So maybe the product is a ketone with a styryl group attached. Let's think.

Wait, the initial compound X is C11H12O. If the product's formula is different, but the product's formula isn't given. Wait, X is C11H12O. Let's see. If the reaction is an elimination, like the loss of H2O, then X would be C11H12O, product would have C11H10O or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the product's 1H NMR has two singlet methyl groups. So two CH3 groups. Let me count the carbons. The 13C NMR has 9 signals, so maybe the molecule has 9 unique carbons. Let's see.

If the product has a structure like a benzene ring with substituents, including two methyl groups and a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane

B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane

C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane

D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, so all the options are epoxides with styryl groups or substituents. So the product is an epoxide. Wait, but the 13C NMR shows a carbonyl at 197.7. Wait, unless the carbonyl is part of a ring-opening product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide, but the conditions here are basic. So in basic conditions, the epoxide would open via a nucleophilic attack.

Wait, but in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the epoxide ring opens to form a diol, but that would require something like an SN2 attack. Or maybe it's more about elimination.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material is an epoxide, and under basic conditions, it undergoes a ring-opening to form a carbonyl. How? Well, for example, if the epoxide is adjacent to a carbonyl group. Wait, but if it's an epoxide, maybe it's an oxirane.

Wait, but the product NMR has a carbonyl at 197.7. So perhaps the starting material is an epoxide where, upon opening, a carbonyl is formed. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diene with a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone with a benzene ring attached. Let's think about the 1H NMR again.

The aromatic region: four doublets. Could that be from a para-disubstituted benzene ring? Let me think.

In a para-substituted benzene, the protons are split into two doublets. So perhaps the 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d) could be from a para-substituted benzene. The 6.75 and 7.68 could be from another substituent, perhaps a vinyl group.

So, the structure might have a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond to another carbon, which has substituents.

Wait, the two singlet methyl groups at δ ~2.3 could be on adjacent carbons. Like, for example, a structure where each methyl is attached to a carbon that's part of a ring, such as an epoxide. So, perhaps the product is an epoxide with two methyl groups and a styryl group attached.

Wait, but the 13C NMR has a carbonyl. That complicates things. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone, but that doesn't seem to fit with the aromatic signals. Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclohexenone derivative.

Wait, let me think about the options again. All options are epoxides, except maybe the product isn't an epoxide. Wait, but the options are the possible starting materials. The question is to find Compound X, which is the starting material. So, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the epoxide in X to form a carbonyl in the product.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows a carbonyl carbon. So if X is an epoxide, and upon reaction, the ring opens to form a carbonyl.

Wait, for example, if X is a propylene oxide derivative, and the base opens the ring to form a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but that's more about carbocation shifts.

Wait, another angle: the 13C NMR has a carbon at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product has a ketone group. Let me think about the structure that would produce the given NMR.

So, the product might be something like a methyl vinyl ketone attached to a benzene ring. Or perhaps a benzophenone derivative.

But considering the NMR, the aromatic protons suggest a styryl group. So maybe it's a structure with a benzene ring connected by a double bond to a carbonyl group.

Wait, for example, something like cinnamaldehyde? No, that's an aldehyde. Or cinnamyl ketone.

Alternatively, if the product is a ketone with a styryl group, like (E)-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to sketch this.

Suppose the product is a compound with a benzene ring connected via a double bond to a carbonyl group. So the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-C(O)-R, but that might not fit.

Wait, looking at the 1H NMR, the doublets in the aromatic region
