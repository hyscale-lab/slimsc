Okay, so I've got this question here about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about a transgenic mouse model where they're trying to overexpress the GADD45G protein. They introduced a coding sequence with a single influenza hemagglutinin determinant at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells, but they can't overexpress the protein. They looked at the plus strand sequence and found a problem.

The options are A to D. Let me think about each possibility.

So, the problem is why they can't overexpress the protein. They thought of adding a HA tag at the N-terminus. Let's look at the sequence given.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then it goes TAC. Wait, TAC is the codon for tyrosine. So the first codon is ATG (start) followed by TAC (tyrosine). So the HA tag would be at the N-terminus, so the first amino acid should be the HA sequence. But wait, HA is a specific peptide, maybe derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. The HA tag is usually added as a short peptide, maybe something like YPYDVPDYA or similar. But in the DNA, the coding sequence for the HA tag would be right after the start codon.

Wait, the construct is modified to include the HA determinant at the N-terminus. So in the coding sequence, the beginning should be ATG followed by the HA tag coding sequence, then the GADD45G coding sequence.

Looking at the given sequence, it starts with ATG, then TAC. TAC is Tyr. So does the HA tag start with Tyr? Or is that a problem?

Wait, the HA tag's DNA sequence would be the coding sequence for the HA epitope. Let me think, the HA tag is a short peptide, maybe like YPYDVPDYA. The DNA coding for that would be TAC TTT CTC TAT GGC TAT GAA. So in the DNA, the coding strand would have TAC TTT CTC TAT GGC TAT GAA.

Wait, but looking at the given sequence, it starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Wait, that's the coding strand. So the first few codons are:

ATG (start), TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), etc.

Wait, but if they were adding the HA tag at the N-terminus, the sequence right after ATG should code for the HA tag. But in this case, the first codon after ATG is TAC, which is Tyr. That's the start of the HA tag? Or is the HA tag missing?

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence is wrong. Let me think: the HA epitope is something like YPYDVPDYA. Let me see the DNA sequence for that. Each amino acid corresponds to a codon.

YP is Tyr-Phe: TAC TTT.

Then Y would be TAC again. So the first three codons would be TAC TTT TAC.

But looking at the given sequence, it's ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT... So after ATG, it's TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), which isn't part of the HA tag. So that would mean that the HA tag's sequence is incorrect. Because after the ATG, the sequence is TAC (Tyr) but then it's CCA (Pro) instead of TTT (Phe) next. So the HA tag is not properly included. So the HA tag's coding sequence is wrong. So that's a problem.

Wait, but the question says that the construct was modified by introducing the HA determinant. So the plus strand sequence should have the HA coding right after the ATG. But in the given sequence, the HA may not be present, or perhaps it's only TAC and then it's wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the HA sequence is somewhere else. But looking at the plus strand, the beginning is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G..., which suggests that the HA determinant isn't correctly inserted.

So the problem here is that the HA determinant's coding sequence is incorrect. For example, the intended HA might have been TAC TTT TAC, but here it's TAC CCA TAC. That would be a mistake in the sequence, leading to a wrong amino acid, maybe a missense mutation. So option A says the HA determinant has a missense mutation. That would make sense.

Alternatively, think about option B: the ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a stop codon upstream. Looking at the sequence, does it have any in-frame stop codons before the intended stop?

The given sequence starts with ATG, then TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, etc. Let me check for any TAA, TAG, or TGA codons before the intended end.

Looking through the sequence: I see GAT, GTT, CCA, etc. The first part doesn't have any stop codons. So the ribosome shouldn't terminate early. So option B is less likely.

Option C: lack of linker causing proteolysis. The HA tag is usually a small peptide that doesn't interfere. But if the HA sequence is wrong, maybe the protein isn't expressed or is degraded. But the problem is that the overexpression isn't happening. If the HA sequence is wrong, perhaps the protein isn't being expressed at all, but the question says they couldn't overexpress as expected. So maybe the construct isn't expressed because the HA tag is messed up.

Wait, the construct includes the HA determinant. If the HA determinant's sequence is wrong, the protein might not be expressed because the start codon is fine, but the resulting protein is not correct. Or maybe the HA tag is required for detection, so if the tag is wrong, the antibodies won't recognize it, leading to not seeing the protein.

Wait, but in this case, the question says the plus strand's sequence is as given. So perhaps the HA isn't present. Let me see: the first codon after ATG is TAC (Tyr), which is part of the HA epitope. Then the next codon is CCA (Pro). So the HA sequence would be TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), etc., which doesn't match the HA epitope. So the HA determinant is not correctly inserted. So the HA is messed up, which would make the antibody not recognize the protein. But the question is about overexpression, perhaps the protein is expressed but not detected. But the question says they couldn't overexpress, implying the protein isn't made.

Wait another thought: maybe the HA determinant was supposed to be at the N-terminus, and if the sequence after the start is correct, but the HA is missing, then the protein might actually be expressed but without the HA tag. But the problem is that the overexpression isn't happening. Alternatively, perhaps the HA insertion caused a frame shift, but looking at the sequence, it doesn't seem like it's in a frame shift. So perhaps the issue is that the HA determinant's coding sequence is wrong, leading to a missense mutation in the HA sequence, making the tag ineffective. So when they try to purify the protein using HA antibodies, it doesn't bind because the HA isn't correct.

Wait, but the question states that they are unable to overexpress the protein. So maybe the issue is with the construct not being expressed because of a mutation in the HA sequence. If the HA sequence is wrong, maybe the ribosome is terminating early because of a stop codon introduced. But looking at the sequence, I don't see any stop codons until maybe later.

Wait, let me check the sequence for any in-frame stop codons. Let's look for TAA, TAG, or TGA. The sequence provided is quite long. Let me scan through:

Looking at the sequence, after the initial part:

...TGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Hmm, I don't see any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the coding sequence. So the ribosome doesn't terminate early, so option B is not the issue.

Option C: lack of linker causing proteolysis. HA tags are usually short and don't require a linker. If the HA sequence is wrong, perhaps the protein is not properly folded or is recognized as a misfolded protein and degraded via proteasomes. But I'm not sure if that would prevent overexpression. Alternatively, if the HA tag is missing, perhaps the construct isn't expressed because the promoter isn't correct, but that's probably not the case.

Option D: tRNA for UAA doesn't exist. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. But mRNA is read as codons, and the presence of a stop codon would cause termination. However, the given sequence doesn't have a UAA in the coding strand. Wait, the coding strand is the plus strand, which is the same as mRNA except T instead of U. So looking for the presence of a stop codon in the coding sequence would be looking for TAG, TGA, or TAA in the mRNA. So in the DNA coding strand, it would be TGA, TAA, or TAG. Wait, but I don't see any of these in the sequence. So option D is not applicable.

So, going back. The main issue is that the HA determinant's coding sequence is incorrect. Let me look again. The HA tag's amino acid sequence is, for example, YPYDVPDYA. The DNA coding sequence would be TAC TTT TAC GAT GTA GCT ATA GAA. So the first few codons after ATG should be TAC TTT TAC GAT GTA GCT ATA GAA.

But in the given sequence, after ATG (start) comes TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), etc. So the HA sequence is messed up. Instead of TAC TTT TAC, it's TAC CCA TAC. So the HA is incorrect, leading to a missense mutation in the HA determinant. So the HA tag isn't properly formed, which would make the antibody-based detection (like using HA tag antibodies) ineffective. But more importantly, the construct might not be expressed properly if the HA tag is part of the expression vector's selection or because of some issues with the expression cassette.

Wait, but the HA tag is just an epitope tag for detection. The lack of HA wouldn't prevent the protein from being expressed. So why can't the protein be overexpressed? Hmm. Perhaps the HA determinant is part of the expression construct, such as in a way that it's required for the expression. Or maybe the construct has a frame shift or other issues.

Wait, let me check the reading frame. The HA tag is in frame, I think. The first codon after ATG is TAC, which is correct for the N-terminus. Then CCA, which is Pro. Wait, but that's not part of the HA sequence. So perhaps the HA sequence was not correctly inserted. So the sequence for the HA tag is missing or wrong.

So, the correct HA sequence would be, say, TAC TTT TAC GAT GTA GCT ATA GAA. But in the given sequence, after ATG, it's TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the HA is incorrect. So the HA determinant has a missense mutation, meaning the HA sequence is wrong. So the protein is being expressed, but the HA tag is not correct, making it undetectable. But the question is why overexpression isn't happening. Alternatively, perhaps the HA insertion caused a problem in the expression vector, such as disrupting a promoter or adding a premature stop codon. But looking at the sequence, I don't see any TGA, TAA, or TAG in the coding sequence.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the HA tag insertion introduced a stop codon in the mRNA. Because if the HA tag is in the wrong reading frame, it could cause a frameshift leading to a stop codon. But in this case, the HA is added at the N-terminus, so it's in the same frame as the GADD45G. So the HA is part of the same ORF. So if the HA sequence is wrong, the rest of the protein is wrong, but the ribosome should continue until the end. Unless there's a stop codon introduced.

But the given sequence doesn't show any stop codons until the very end. Wait, looking at the end of the sequence: ...AGTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. Wait, wait a second. The sequence ends with ...CAGTGA. So the last part is CAG (Gln), TGA (stop). So the stop codon is present at the end. That's correct because every protein-coding sequence should end with a stop codon.

Wait, but looking at the entire sequence, does it have any internal stop codons? Let me check again. The sequence is quite long; perhaps I should look for TGA, TAG, TAA.

Looking for TGA: I see "ATGCTGAGTGA" somewhere? Let me look through:

Looking for TGA... Let's see:

...GGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

I see a TGA towards the end: ...GGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the last part is ...GAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the stop is correctly at the end.

So the issue is not a premature stop codon. So why can't the protein be overexpressed?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HA tag is inserted in the wrong orientation. But the question states that it's at the N-terminus. So the HA should be at the beginning.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag's coding sequence is inserted but in the wrong reading frame, causing a frameshift. But the given sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G..., which is in the same frame as the original GADD45G. So perhaps the HA sequence isn't correct, leading to a nonfunctional tag, but the protein is expressed. But the question is why overexpression isn't happening.

Alternatively, maybe the lack of the HA tag isn't the issue. Maybe the problem is with the way the plasmid was constructed. For example, the promoter might not be correctly placed, or the terminator is in the wrong spot.

Wait, but the question says that the plasmid was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells using Lipofectamine and that they selected for antibiotic resistance. So perhaps the antibiotic resistance is working, meaning the plasmid is present, but the GADD45G isn't being expressed.

Wait, perhaps the ATG is not the correct start codon. Let me check the beginning.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is correct. So no issue there.

Another possibility: the construct is missing the RBS (ribosome binding site). Without a functional RBS, the mRNA can't be translated efficiently. But the question doesn't mention anything about the RBS.

Wait, but the given sequence just shows the coding strand. Perhaps the issue is with the presence of a stop codon introduced by the HA insertion.

Wait, but earlier I didn't see any premature stop codons. So the only other possibility is that the HA determinant's coding sequence is incorrect, leading to a missense mutation in the HA epitope. So the HA isn't functional, which might affect the detection or the expression.

Wait, but the inability to overexpress could be due to the protein not being detected, leading the researchers to think it's not expressed. But the question states that they are unable to overexpress. That suggests that the protein isn't being made in sufficient quantities. So perhaps the HA insertion is causing a problem in the construct's expression.

Alternatively, maybe the HA sequence has a mutation that causes the protein to not fold correctly, leading to degradation. But that's speculative.

Wait, another thought: the HA tag is being added, but if it's at the N-terminus, perhaps the construct uses a viral 2A peptide or other sequences to separate the tag from the main protein. But that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag introduces a premature stop codon in the coding sequence, but earlier analysis didn't find any.

Wait, looking again: the sequence starts with ATG, then TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, etc. Let's write out the amino acids.

ATG is start (Methionine).
TAC is Tyr.
CCA is Pro.
TAC is Tyr.
GAT is Asp.
GTT is Val.
CCG is Ala.
AAG is Lys.
TCC is Ser.
GCG is Ala.
GCC is Ala.
AGA is Arg.
GAC is Asp.
ACAG is ... wait, maybe I should write each codon:

ATG (M)
TAC (Y)
CCA (P)
TAC (Y)
GAT (D)
GTT (V)
CCG (A)
AAG (K)
TCC (S)
GCG (A)
GCC (A)
AGA (R)
GAC (D)
ACA (T)
GTT (V)
CCG (A)
GAA (E)
...

Hmm, this seems like a normal start without any stop codons until the end. So the protein is being expressed but perhaps not being detected because the HA tag is wrong.

Wait, but the problem is that the overexpression isn't happening, not that the detection is failing. So perhaps the HA insertion is causing a problem in the construct's expression, like a frame shift. But I don't see any frame shift in the given sequence.

Wait, perhaps the HA determinant wasn't inserted correctly, and the GADD45G coding sequence is messed up. For example, if the HA was inserted in the wrong place, causing a frameshift and leading to a different sequence downstream.

But in the given sequence, the initial part after ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG, which looks like it's in the same frame as the original GADD45G.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted but the rest of the GADD45G sequence is missing. But looking at the sequence, it's a long stretch, so probably not.

Wait, another angle: the HA determinant's coding sequence might have a stop codon. For example, if the HA's DNA sequence introduced a TAA, TAG, or TGA in the mRNA, causing a premature stop. But in the given sequence, the HA part is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT..., which doesn't include a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag was supposed to be in a particular reading frame, but the inserted sequence caused a frameshift. But the sequence doesn't show a frameshift; it's continuous.

Hmm. Maybe the HA tag's sequence is wrong, like a point mutation leading to a missense in the HA epitope. So the HA determinant has a mutation, making the tag ineffective. So when they try to detect the protein via the HA tag, they can't, but the protein is actually expressed. But why would that prevent overexpression? Unless the HA tag is part of the expression construct's regulation, which I don't think is the case.

Wait, the question says they modified the construct by adding the HA sequence. If the HA is at the N-terminus, then the coding sequence starts with HA, then GADD45G. But if the HA sequence is incorrect, perhaps the ribosome can't properly translate it, leading to the mRNA being unstable or the ribosome terminating early. But I don't see any stop codons in the HA part.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence contains a cryptic splice site or a premature termination codon that the cell's machinery recognizes, leading to truncated proteins.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: HA determinant has a missense mutation. This would mean the HA is altered, but the rest of the protein is fine. If the HA is part of the expression vector for detection, then the protein would be present but not detected. But the question says they can't overexpress, implying the protein isn't made.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the HA sequence insertion caused a frameshift mutation, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence from the start, including a premature stop codon. But looking at the given sequence, the frame doesn't shift because all codons are read in triplets without any gaps.

Wait, perhaps the HA was inserted in the wrong reading frame. For example, if the HA sequence was added in a different frame, but that's unlikely because the question says it's at the N-terminus, so same frame.

Hmm. Let me think of other possible issues. The plasmid may have a strong promoter, but perhaps the presence of internal ribosome entry sites or other elements are causing issues. But that's probably beyond the scope of the question.

Wait, the plasmid was transfected into CHO cells. Maybe the HA determinant is not recognized in CHO cells, but that's more about detection than expression.

Alternatively, maybe the HA sequence has a mutation leading to a stop codon when read by the ribosome. Let me check: the HA's codons in the DNA are TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG..., which in mRNA would be UAC CCA UAC GAA GUU CCG... Wait, that's not a stop codon. So no.

Another thought: maybe the addition of the HA tag introduced a new start codon upstream, causing the ribosome to start translating at the wrong place. But in the given sequence, the only start codon is the first ATG. So that shouldn't be the issue.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag was added, but the reading frame is such that the start codon is followed by a stop codon. Let me see: the first few codons after ATG are TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), etc. None of these are stop codons. So that's not the problem.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's sequence is missing, leading to the entire construct not being expressed. But the given sequence includes the HA part, so that's probably not it.

Wait, another angle: the HA determinant is at the N-terminus, but the construct was designed to have the HA followed by GADD45G. If the HA is missing, the GADD45G would be expressed without the HA, but the question states that the HA is supposed to be present. So the given sequence includes the HA as part of the coding sequence.

But the HA's coding sequence is wrong. Let me think: the correct HA tag would have the specific amino acid sequence, but in the given sequence, the HA part is incorrect. So when the protein is expressed, the HA epitope is wrong, leading to no detection, but the protein itself is expressed. However, the question states that overexpression isn't happening, which suggests the protein isn't being made.

Wait, perhaps the HA insertion caused a frame shift, leading to a stop codon somewhere. But I don't see any in the given sequence.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the HA insertion didn't correctly include the start codon, leading to a frameshift. Wait, the start is correct, so that's not likely.

Let me think about the options again.

Option A: HA determinant has a missense mutation. So the HA epitope is not correct, leading to the protein not being detected via HA antibodies. But why would that prevent overexpression? Unless the HA is part of the expression vector's selection marker, but that's not the case here. So the protein would be expressed, but not detected.

But the question says they can't overexpress. So perhaps the issue is that the HA determinant's presence is causing the protein to not be expressed because of a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon. But I don't see any stop codons until the end.

Wait, another possibility: the HA determinant's sequence includes a stop codon. Let me see. The HA tag's DNA would be for the amino acid sequence, so for YPYDVPDYA, the DNA would be TAC TTT TAC GAT GTA GCT ATA GAA. So the first three codons are TAC (Y), TTT (P), TAC (Y), etc.

In the given sequence, after ATG, it's TAC, then CCA, which is Pro, not Phe. So that's a change. So the HA tag is incorrect. So the first amino acid after Met is Tyr, but the next should be Phe. Instead, it's Pro.

So that's a missense mutation in the HA determinant. That would mean the HA epitope is not correct, making the tag ineffective. So when they try to detect the protein with HA antibodies, it won't show up. So the researchers think the protein isn't being expressed because they can't detect it with the HA antibodies, but the protein is actually expressed.

But the question says they couldn't overexpress. So perhaps the problem is that the HA determinant's mutation caused the construct to not function properly, leading to lower expression. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the HA determinant's sequence is wrong, leading to the construct being non-functional, perhaps causing the mRNA to be degraded.

Wait, but adding a few amino acids shouldn't cause the mRNA to be degraded. Unless the incorrect sequence introduces a premature stop codon, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA determinant's incorrect sequence introduces a cryptic splice site or a ribosome binding site that causes the mRNA to be translated incorrectly, leading to a truncated protein. But the given sequence doesn't show any stop codons until the end.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but the most likely option seems to be option A: the HA determinant has a missense mutation. That would explain why the protein isn't detected, and perhaps the researchers think it's not expressed. But the question says they couldn't overexpress, which is slightly different. Alternatively, maybe the mutation in the HA is causing the protein not to be expressed because the HA is part of a necessary element, but that's a stretch.

Another angle: perhaps the HA tag is causing the protein to misfold, leading to it being degraded in the cell. But without the correct HA, the protein would still be expressed, just maybe not correctly folded. But the question is about overexpression, not proper folding.

So, putting it all together, the most likely reason is that the HA determinant's sequence has a missense mutation, leading to the HA epitope being incorrect. This would prevent detection, making it seem like the protein isn't expressed, but the protein might still be made. However, if the HA insertion caused a frame shift leading to a stop codon, that would prevent expression. But in the given sequence, no frame shift is present, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag was inserted, but the reading frame is such that the correct sequence is shifted. Let me count the nucleotides. The HA should be, say, 11 amino acids, so 33 nucleotides. Let's see the given sequence after ATG:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCG AAG TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A...

Wait, that's more than 11 codons. So perhaps the HA tag is longer than it should be, or the insertion is incorrect. So the HA determinant is longer than intended, leading to a longer tag that may cause issues.

But I'm not entirely sure. Given the options, the most probable answer is option A: the HA determinant has a missense mutation. So the correct answer is A.


The question revolves around the failure to overexpress the GADD45G protein in a transgenic mouse model, where the coding sequence was modified to include a hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. The provided sequence of the plus strand shows that the HA determinant's coding sequence is incorrect. Specifically, the first few codons after the start codon (ATG) are TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), and GTT (Val), which do not match the expected sequence for the HA tag. For example, the HA tag typically corresponds to the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA, whose DNA coding sequence would be TAC TTT TAC GAT GTA GCT ATA GAA. The observed sequence deviates from this, indicating a missense mutation in the HA determinant.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**  
   This is the most likely explanation. The HA determinant's coding sequence is incorrect, leading to an altered HA epitope. This would prevent detection via HA-specific antibodies and could contribute to the perception that the protein is not being expressed. While the protein might still be synthesized, the incorrect HA sequence could interfere with its proper detection or function, leading to the observed failure in overexpression.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early**  
   This is unlikely because the sequence does not contain any premature stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA) before the intended stop codon at the end. The ribosome should translate the entire sequence until the final stop codon.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**  
   This is speculative and not supported by the sequence provided. The HA tag is a short peptide and does not typically require a linker to prevent proteolysis. Additionally, the question does not mention any evidence of proteolysis.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**  
   This is irrelevant because the sequence does not contain a UAA codon in the coding strand. The only stop codon present is at the end (TGA), which is correctly recognized by the translation machinery.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that the HA determinant's coding sequence contains a missense mutation, leading to an incorrect HA epitope. This would prevent proper detection of the protein and could contribute to the observed failure in overexpression. 

Answer: A
