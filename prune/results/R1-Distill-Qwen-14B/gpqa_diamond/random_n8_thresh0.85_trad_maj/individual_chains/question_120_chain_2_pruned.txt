Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various inverse powers of plx.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. Right, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/distance. So, when plx increases, the distance decreases.

If stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means their number density is constant in space. So, the number of stars in a given volume depends on that volume. But how does this relate to parallax?

Let me think about distances. Let's say I have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. What is the corresponding range in distance? Parallax is 1/d, so distance d is 1/plx. So, the distance goes from d = 1/plx to d' = 1/(plx + dplx). Wait, but maybe I should think about it in terms of small increments.

Alternatively, for a thin shell at distance d, the volume element would be 4πr² dr, where r is the radius (distance). But since we're dealing with parallax, which is 1/d, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx.

So, the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + dd would be proportional to the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness dd. But since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. Let's say the number density is n stars per cubic parsec. So, the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

But parallax plx is 1/d. So, d = 1/plx. Let's express everything in terms of plx. Then, dd would be the change in d as plx changes. Since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/(plx²)) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But when calculating the number of stars, I can take the absolute value.

So, substituting d in terms of plx:

number of stars = n * 4π ( (1/plx) )² * ( -1/(plx²) dplx )

But wait, the number of stars per unit plx range (dplx) would be the above expression divided by dplx? Or wait, let me think again. No, the number of stars in a range of dplx is equal to n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). Since dd is the change in d, which is (-1/plx²) dplx. So, the number of stars in a dplx interval is proportional to (1/plx²) * (dplx) multiplied by 1/plx² again? Wait, maybe I'm confusing the variables.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the integral. Let me define the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx as N. Since the number density is n, uniform, the number in a spherical shell of radius d is n * 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/plx, and dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, substituting:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) dplx )

Wait, because d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/(plx²)) dplx.

But when considering the range of plx, dplx is positive, so the absolute value is (1/plx²) dplx.

So, N = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx )

Simplify that: N = n *4π (1/plx^4) dplx )

So, the number of stars per unit dplx is (n *4π )
