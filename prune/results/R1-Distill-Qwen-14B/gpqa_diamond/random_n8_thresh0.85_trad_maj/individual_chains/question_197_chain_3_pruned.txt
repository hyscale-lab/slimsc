Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the product formed when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI (hydroiodic) acid reaction, which is a type of acid-catalyzed cleavage. Oh wait, right! When you have a dibromide or a diiodide, HI can cause cleavage, especially in allylic or certain dihalide structures. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conditions. 

Let's look at the data given. The IR and NMR spectra should help me figure out the structure of compound X. Let's start with the IR. The peaks around 3400-2500 cm-1 suggest the presence of either an alcohol (O-H stretch) or maybe an alkyne (C-H stretch), but more likely an alcohol. Wait, another point is the 1720 cm-1 peak, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Then there's a peak at 1610 cm-1, which might be from conjugated carbonyl groups or aromatic C=C. The 1450 cm-1 could be related to aromatic substitution or perhaps some kind of ring strain.

Now the 1H NMR. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), that's a broad singlet. Aromatic protons usually aren't that downfield, but a carbonyl proton like an aldehyde is around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but 10.5 is pretty high. Could that be an aldehyde proton? Or maybe a carboxylic acid proton, but those are usually broad. Oh, wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3000 cm-1 which are much broader. The IR does show a peak around 3400â€“2500, which could include O-H, but the 1720 is the strong peak. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1. Hmm, but 1720 is more like an ester or aldehyde.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde proton. But al
