Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Okay, the question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, wait, I think that's a typo. Oh right, 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because sometimes the numbering might be a bit different, but let me confirm.

So the structure is bromobenzene with two methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. So the benzene ring has bromine at position 1 (or is it position 2?), wait no, waitâ€”probably wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene would have bromine at position 1, and methyl groups at 2 and 4. So the substituents are at positions 1,2,4 on the ring.

Wait, but sometimes when substituents are adjacent, like in 1,2,4, that's a meta arrangement? No, wait, 1,2,4 would be a para arrangement? Wait, no. Let me draw it out mentally. Positions 1, 2, and 4: position 1 has bromine, position 2 has methyl, and position 4 (which is across from position 1?) No, wait, position 4 is two carbons away from position 2, so perhaps it's a meta arrangement.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. The benzene ring has six positions. Position 1 is one corner. Position 2 is next to 1. Position 4 is two positions away from 1, in the opposite direction. So the substituents are bromine at 1, methyl at 2, and methyl at 4. So the arrangement would be: methyl groups at 2 and 4, which are adjacent to each other. Because position 2 and 4 are adjacent? Wait, no. Wait, in benzene, position 1 is opposite to 4. So, position 1 is where bromine is, position 2 is the next, then position 3, then position 4 is opposite to 1. So positions 2 and 4 are across from each other? No, wait, position 2 is adjacent to 1, position 3 is next, position 4 is next, then 5, then 6, and
