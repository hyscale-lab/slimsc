Okay, let me try to figure this problem out. So, the question is about a high-resolution transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules in the sample compartment. Hmm, I remember that the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. 

Mike created an ultra-high vacuum with a pressure less than 10^-9 Torr. He used vacuum pumps, so I guess the pressure is really low, which should mean a longer mean free path because there are fewer gas molecules—so they don't collide as often, right? 

He measured the mean free path as λ1 under these conditions. But when he turned on the electron beam, he noticed that the mean free path became λ2, which is different from λ1. The question is, why did this change happen, and what's the relationship between λ2 and λ1?

Wait, the sample compartment's temperature stayed the same. So temperature isn't changing. So factors affecting mean free path related to temperature are probably the same. Now, the mean free path is calculated using the formula λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the gas molecules, and P is pressure. 

Wait, so if temperature is the same, then the main factors would be pressure and the size of the molecules. But Mike's setup already achieved a very low pressure. So why would λ change when the electron beam is on?

Oh, right! When the electron beam is active, it's a high-energy beam. High-energy electrons can interact with the gas molecules. I think this might cause ionization of the gas particles. So when the gas molecules are ionized, they become charged. Charged particles would interact more strongly with the electric fields in the microscope, right? Or perhaps they are more likely to be affected by the electron beam itself, leading to different behavior.

Wait, but how does that affect the mean free path? Hmm, the mean free path is about how often molecules collide. But if the gas molecules are ionized, maybe their effective cross-sectional area for scattering electrons increases. Or wait, the mean free path for electrons. Oh wait, the question says the mean free path based on electron scattering. So the electrons are being scattered by the gas molecules. 

Wait, but when the electrons are in the beam, they can cause the gas molecules to either stay neutral or get ionized. When a gas molecule is ionized, it has a charge, which would make it respond to the electric fields in the electron microscope. That could cause the ions to be expelled or perhaps to move in ways that change their distribution in the compartment.

Alternatively, maybe the ions are attracted to the electron beam, so they cluster around the beam area. So in that region, the local pressure might be higher because more gas molecules are present there due to the beam's effect. So locally, the pressure increases, which would decrease the mean free path because higher pressure means more collisions. But wait, globally, the overall pressure in the sample compartment might remain the same because the pumps are maintaining the vacuum. Unless the beam is causing some sort of gas release or something. Hmm, not sure about that.

Wait, another thought: the electron beam might cause the gas molecules to become excited or ionized, which could change the effective diameter of the molecules in terms of electron scattering. So if the gas molecules are ionized, their effective cross-section for electron scattering might be larger. That would make the mean free path shorter because collisions would be more likely. But in the case when the electron beam is off, the gas is neutral, so the mean free path is λ1. When the beam is on, the gas is ionized, so the effective diameter (d) used in the mean free path formula increases. Since λ is inversely proportional to d squared, if d increases, λ decreases. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait wait, but the mean free path for electron scattering is different. The gas molecules could be causing more scattering when ionized. So the electron beam is what's being scattered, but does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves? Or is it affecting the electrons' path?

Wait, the question says Mike observed a change in the mean free path based on electron scattering. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The mean free path of the gas molecules isn't changing because the pressure and temperature are the same. But the mean free path for electrons scattering off these gas molecules would be a different matter. 

Wait, but the question says that the mean free path was no longer λ1; it became λ2. So perhaps he was measuring the mean free path of the gas molecules, but when the electrons are on, the gas molecules are ionized, making their mean free path different.

Alternatively, maybe the beam causes the gas molecules to move. For instance, the electrons could cause gas molecules to be heated or to move, altering their velocity distribution. But that would affect the mean free path. Wait, but the temperature is the same, so maybe the average velocity is same.

Alternatively, when the gas is ionized, their mean free path changes because they have a different way of interacting. For example, ions might have different
