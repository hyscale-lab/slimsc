Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. 

The question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty principle relates the variances of two observables. Oh right, the formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²), right? So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

Wait, but the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, which means that when we measure P_x, we'll get a definite value. But P_z is another observable, and since P_x and P_z don't commute (I think), the uncertainty in P_z won't be zero. 

So, the state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). That's the state vector. Let me denote this state as |ψ⟩. 

I need to calculate ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. 

First, let's write down the matrix for P_z. The matrix is given as:

P_z =
[ ħ    0      0   ]
[ 0    0      0   ]
[ 0    0   -ħ ]

Wait, no, actually looking back:

The operator P_z has components in the first row as (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.

Wait, but wait, that's the matrix. So when we calculate ⟨P_z⟩, it's ψ† P_z ψ.

So let me compute that. The state vector ψ is:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]
        [  1/√2 ]
        [ -1/2 ]

So, ψ is a column vector with these three components.

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is ψ† P_z ψ.

Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward. Let's compute each term.

The first component is ( -1/2 )^2 * ħ, because the first diagonal element is ħ. The second component is (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0, which is zero. The third component is (-1/2)^2 * (-ħ) → but wait, because when you multiply the components, it's the product of the component squared times the eigenvalue.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The expectation value is the sum over each state's component squared multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

So, |ψ₁|² * P_z(1,1) + |ψ₂|² * P_z(2,2) + |ψ₃|² * P_z(3,3)

So, |ψ₁|² is ( (-1/2)^2 ) = 1/4. Multiply by ħ (since P_z(1,1)=ħ). So that's 1/4 * ħ.

|ψ₂|² is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. Multiply by 0.
