Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Lagrangian of an interaction term and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which I remember is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, probably for electromagnetism or something similar. 

Wait, so the first step is to find the mass dimension of κ. I think the way to do that is to make sure the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

Let me break down the Lagrangian term: it's κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, and then F^{μν}.

I know that in four dimensions, the fields have specific dimensions. For a Dirac spinor ψ, which is a fermion, its mass dimension is 3/2. Because the Dirac equation has terms like iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must have the same dimension. The derivative ∂_μ has mass dimension 1, so ψ must be dimension 3/2 to balance it since (3/2) +1 =5/2, but wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again: the term γ^μ ∂_μ ψ would have dimensions [γ] is dimensionless, [∂] is 1, so [ψ] should be 3/2 because the derivative acts on ψ, which has dimension 3/2, making the term 3/2 +1 =5/2, but wait, the Lagrangian term should have dimension 4, so perhaps each field's dimension is determined by the Lagrangian terms they appear in.

Wait, perhaps I should remember the standard dimensions for each field. In four dimensions, the scalar field has dimension 1, the gauge field A has dimension 1, the spinor ψ has dimension 3/2. The field strength tensor F_{μν} for a gauge field A is dimension 2, because F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each A has dimension 1, so F has dimension 1 +1=2.

So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Now, σ_{μν} is made from gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless because they're just matrices, so [γ_μ] =0. The structure σ_{μν} is a product of two gammas, but since it's an antisymmetric combination, its dimension remains 0.

Now, the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ is a product of ψ̄ and ψ. ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, which has the same dimension as ψ. So ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is also 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ is [3/2] * [0] * [3/2] = 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

Then F^{μν} is 2. So the product (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F has dimension 3 +2 =5.

Wait, but the Lagrangian term is κ times that product, which is [κ] +5. The Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That narrows it down to options A or C.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? Renormalizability depends on the coupling's mass dimension. For a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants must have mass dimension ≤ 4 - (sum of fields in the interaction term).

Wait, the general rule is that in a renormalizable theory, the coupling constants must have positive or zero mass dimension. Because a coupling with negative dimension would imply that as the energy scale decreases (or equivalently, as the cutoff increases), the coupling becomes stronger, which leads to a Landau pole and makes the theory non predictive. So if a coupling has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, no, wait. For a term in the Lagrangian to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling must be at least zero. So if [κ]=-1, which is less than zero, then the interaction is non-renormalizable.

So the theory would not be renormalizable because the coupling has a negative mass dimension.

So putting it together: κ has dimension -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. So the correct option is C, which says dimension -1 and not renormalizable.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
In four spacetime dimensions, the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 to ensure the action is dimensionless. Breaking down the term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$:
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$, so $\bar{\psi}$ also has dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is constructed from the dimensionless gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$, so it has mass dimension 0.
- $F^{\mu\nu}$, the field strength tensor, has mass dimension 2.

The product $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has mass dimension:
\[
\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} = 3.
\]
The product $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ then has mass dimension:
\[
3 + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have mass dimension $\geq 0$. Here, $\kappa$ has mass dimension $-1$, which is negative. This implies the interaction term becomes more significant at lower energy scales, leading to a breakdown of predictivity and non-renormalizability. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. The correct option is:
