Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, actually, looking again, Reaction A gives (R)-product when treated with LiBH4, and Reaction B gives (S)-product when treated with BH3. The options are for what the starting materials A and B are.

So the products are the same compound but enantiomers of each other. That suggests that the reactions are leading to the formation of a chiral center, possibly through some kind of reduction where the stereochemistry is determined.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyl... something. Let me think. The product is a tetrahydro pyran-2-one with an ethyl group at position 4. So the structure is a six-membered ring, pyran, which is a cyclic ether with an oxygen. The 2-one part means there's a ketone at position 2, and the ring is saturated (since it's tetrahydro), so it's an oxolane ring with a ketone.

So the product is a cyclic ketone, and the starting material is probably a ketone as well, but maybe an ester? Or another structure that upon reduction gives the cyclic ketone.

Wait, no. Let me think about what LiBH4 and BH3 do. Both are reducing agents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used for reducing esters, ketones, aldehydes. BH3 is also a reducing agent, but in some cases, like in the hydroboration reaction, it adds to alkenes in a way that depends on the structure. Wait, but in this case, the reagent is BH3 followed by H+, which might be a BH3-H2O2 workup. Alternatively, if it's BH3 in a different context, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: when a cyclic ketone is formed, perhaps it's via a Robinson annulation or some kind of cyclization after a reduction. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something similar.

Wait, looking at the possible starting materials, the options are A and B being 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, with different stereochemistry. So that's a pentanoic acid derivative. Let me draw the structure mentally.

The formula would be something like:

O
||
O-C-O-R  where R is isobutoxy.

Wait, no, the structure is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So the pentanoic acid is CH2CH2... Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but substituted. Let's see:

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: CH(CH2CH3) (since it's 3-ethyl)
Carbon 4: OCH(CH2CH2CH3) (isobutoxy: OCH(CH2CH2CH3)? Wait, wait, isobutoxy is OCH(CH2CH2CH3)?

Wait no, isobutoxy is OCH(CH2CH3)2. Because isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, isobutyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but wait, no. Let me clarify: The isobutoxy group is OCH(CH2CH3)2? Or OCH2CH(CH2CH3) ?

Wait, no. The structure of isobutoxy is O-C(CH2CH3)2? Wait, no. Isobutyl is (CH2CH2)CH(CH3)-O-? So for isobutoxy, it's OCH(CH2CH3)2? Or wait, maybe it's OCH2CH(CH2CH3) ?

Wait, maybe I should think of isobutyl as CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no: isobutyl is (CH2)2CHCH2-? No, wait, isobutyl is (CH2CH(CH3))CH2-? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: the structure of isobutyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-. So the isobutoxy group would be OCH2CH(CH3)CH2-? Or maybe OCH(CH2CH3)2... Hmm, perhaps I should just move on.

The starting material is a pentanoic acid with substituents at carbons 3 and 5.

So, the structure would be:

Position 1: COOH (since it's pentanoic acid)
Position 2: CH2-
Position 3: CH(CH2CH3) (3-ethyl)
Position 4: OCH(CH2CH3)2? Or isobutoxy, which is OCH(CH2CH3)2?
Position 5: ketone (oxo group)

Wait, so the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-OCH(CH2CH3)2 -CO?

Wait, no, position 5 is the end, but it's pentanoic acid, so it's five carbons in total.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-C(CH2CH3)-OCH(CH2CH3)2 -CH3? No, that's six carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, the compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So the chain is five carbons: positions 1 to 5.

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH(CH2CH3)
4: OCH(CH2CH3)2
5: O=C-O-? No, wait, 5 is oxo, so a ketone.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(OCH(CH2CH3)2)-CO?

Wait, no, that would be position 4 as OCH(CH2CH3)2 and position 5 as CO, but that doesn't make sense because the chain is five carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's:

Position 1: COOH
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH3)
Position 4: OCH(CH2CH3)2
Position 5: carbonyl group (O=)

Wait, but that would make the structure:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-OCH(CH2CH3)2-CO?

Wait, that doesn't seem right because then the chain would be longer. Maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong.

Alternatively, the molecule is 3-ethyl, meaning on carbon 3 there's an ethyl group, and on carbon 5, there's isobutoxy and oxo (so a ketone). So the structure would be:

CH2(COOH) - CH2 - CH(CH2CH3) - C(OCH(CH2CH3)2) =O ?

Hmm, perhaps I should move on to the reaction part.

The reaction is treating the starting material (A or B) with a reducing agent. For reaction A, it's LiBH4 and H+, and the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. For reaction B, the reagent is BH3 and H+, giving the (S) enantiomer.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and usually used to reduce esters, ketones, etc. But if the starting material is a pentanoic acid with some protecting groups, perhaps the LiBH4 is reducing an ester to an alcohol, which then undergoes a cyclization.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an ester, and LiBH4 reduces the ester to an alcohol, which then forms a ring via hemiacetal formation.

Wait, but the product is a six-membered ring with a ketone. So maybe the starting material has a carbonyl group that can be reduced to an alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization, perhaps via an intramolecular hemiacetal formation.

Wait, wait, but LiBH4 is a hydride donor. So if the starting material has an ester group, LiBH4 would reduce it to a primary alcohol. Then, perhaps, that primary alcohol could undergo cyclization with the ketone or another carbonyl group to form a ring.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so the starting material must have a ketone that is being reduced. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if the starting material has an ester, LiBH4 would reduce it to an alcohol. Then, perhaps, an elimination occurs to form a double bond, which could then undergo a cyclization.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. When reduced, it would open up and form an alcohol, which could then cyclize into a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and when reduced, it becomes a diol, which then undergoes cyclization. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone, and the reduction is not occurring, but I'm not certain. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic acetal, and the reduction is breaking it open. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the stereochemistry of the product. The product (R) and (S) enantiomers imply that the starting material has a chiral center that becomes the stereocenter in the product.

So the product is a cyclic ketone with a substituent (ethyl group) at position 4. The ring has six members. So in the product, the substituents are arranged in such a way that the configuration is R or S.

Now, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative. Let's imagine that when it's reduced, it forms a diol or an alcohol which cyclizes into the ring.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction involves the reduction of a carbonyl group. Let's say the starting material has a ketone (the 5-oxo group). LiBH4 would reduce that to a secondary alcohol. But how does the secondary alcohol form a ring?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and LiBH4 reduces it to a primary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization with another group.

Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material's ester group is reduced to an alcohol, and another part of the molecule is a ketone. Then, the alcohol and the ketone can form a ring via an elimination reaction, perhaps forming a hemiacetal, which then loses water to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a Î²-hydroxy ester, and the LiBH4 is doing a reduction that leads to the formation of the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has an ester group and a carbonyl group, and the ester is reduced to an alcohol, creating a vicinal diol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, but let me think about the product structure again. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Its structure is a six-membered ring with oxygen at position 5 (since pyran numbering has oxygen at position 1, then positions 2-6 are around the ring). So position 2 is a ketone, and position 4 is ethyl.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure. The pyran ring has positions 1 (O), 2 (ketone), 3, 4 (ethyl), 5, 6.

So, the product is a ring with O at 1, ketone at 2, ethyl at 4, and the ring is saturated (so all single bonds).

So, how does the starting material lead to this?

Looking at the starting material options, it's a pentanoic acid with substituents. Let's think about what happens when such a compound is treated with a reducing agent.

If the starting material is an ester, say, the pentanoic acid is esterified. For example, the -COOH group is converted to an ester, perhaps as the ethyl ester or another.

When LiBH4 is used to reduce an ester, it typically reduces the ester to a primary alcohol. So, for example, RCOOR' would reduce to RCH2OH and R'OH. Wait, no, LiBH4 reduces esters to alcohols. Wait, no, more accurately, esters (RCOOR') are reduced by LiBH4 to the corresponding alcohols: RCH2OH and R'OH. Wait, no, perhaps the ester becomes a primary alcohol. For example, ethyl acetate (CH3COOEt) would reduce to CH3CH2OH (ethanol) and CH3CH2O- (which would become something else, but in practice, LiBH4 typically gives the primary alcohol.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with an ester group. So when treated with LiBH4, the ester group would be reduced to a primary alcohol.

But wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the structure is something like:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(OCH(CH2CH3)2)-O

Wait, perhaps I should think of the starting material as having a ketone at position 5, an isobutoxy group at position 5, and an ethyl group at position 3. Or wait, perhaps the 5-oxo is a ketone, and the 5-isobutoxy is an ether substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Position 1: COOH
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH3)
Position 4: OCH(CH2CH3)2
Position 5: O=C-O-R?

Wait, no, the 5-oxo would mean a carbonyl group, so the structure would have a carbonyl at position 5.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is:

CH2(COOH) - CH2 - CH(CH2CH3) - CO - OCH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the correct positions. Let me think of it as:

CH2(COOH) - CH(CH2CH3) - CH(OCH(CH2CH3)2) - CO ?

No, that seems incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-OCH(CH2CH3)2-CO ?

Wait, that would be five carbons: COOH (C1), CH2 (C2), CH(CH2CH3) (C3), OCH(CH2CH3)2 (C4), and CO (C5). So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-OCH(CH2CH3)2-CO ?

But that doesn't look right because the CO is at the end, which would make it a ketone at C5. So the structure would have a ketone at C5 and an isobutoxy group at C4.

Wait, so when LiBH4 is used to reduce this compound, what happens? LiBH4 would typically reduce esters, but in this case, the starting material is a pentanoic acid. Wait, but if it's an ester, perhaps the -COOH is esterified. Or maybe the starting material is an ester version of the pentanoic acid.

Wait, but the starting material is a pentanoic acid, not an ester. Hmm. So perhaps the LiBH4 is not acting on the -COOH group, but on another carbonyl group in the molecule. Wait, the starting material has a 5-oxo group, which is a ketone. So LiBH4 would reduce that ketone to a secondary alcohol.

So, if the starting material is (R) or (S) configuration at the 5-oxo group, then reducing it would give a secondary alcohol with the same configuration.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. How does that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction of the ketone leads to an alcohol that then forms a ring via an elimination reaction.

Wait, another possibility is that the starting material, after reduction, undergoes an intramolecular esterification or some kind of cyclization to form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a Î²-keto ester. For example, if the structure is RCO-COOR', then LiBH4 would reduce the ester to RCH2-COOR', and then perhaps the Î²-keto group would undergo some reaction.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has both an ester and a ketone group. So when LiBH4 reduces the ester to a primary alcohol, the molecule can cyclize to form the ring.

Let me think: after reduction, the ester becomes an alcohol. So, for example, the starting material is RCOOR', which upon LiBH4 reduction becomes RCH2OH and R'OH. But if R is a longer chain with a ketone, perhaps the alcohol and the ketone can form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has an ester group at one end and a ketone somewhere else. Upon reduction, the ester becomes an alcohol, and the molecule cyclizes to form a ring, bringing the alcohol and the ketone into proximity.

So, for example, if the starting material is:

CH2(COOH) - CH2 - CH(CH2CH3) - CO - OCH2CH3

Wait, that's just an example. So, reducing the ester (COOEt) would give an alcohol, CH2OH, and then the molecule would have a CO group elsewhere. Then, the alcohol and the ketone could form a hemiacetal, leading to ring formation.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone with ethyl group at position 4. So the ring size must be six, so the chain must be long enough to form a six-membered ring upon cyclization.

If the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative, perhaps after reduction, the chain becomes a hexane or similar, allowing for a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction is leading to the formation of a diol, which then cyclizes.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should think about the stereochemistry part. The product has R and S configurations, so the starting material must have a chiral center that determines the configuration in the product.

So in the product, the ethyl group is at position 4, so perhaps that corresponds to a carbon that was the 3-ethyl group in the starting material.

Wait, in the starting material, the substituent at position 3 is ethyl. So when the ring forms, position 4 in the product would correspond to position 3 in the starting material. Hence, the configuration at position 3 in the starting material would transfer to position 4 in the product.

So, if the starting material (A) has (R) configuration at position 5 (the ketone), then after reduction, the secondary alcohol would have the same configuration. Then, during cyclization, that alcohol would form the ring and create the new chiral center in the product.

Wait, but the product has a new chiral center, so maybe the starting material's configuration determines the product's configuration.

In reaction A, the starting material A is treated with LiBH4 to give (R)-product. Reaction B uses BH3 to give (S)-product.

Now, what's the difference between LiBH4 and BH3? Well, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and typically reduces esters, ketones, etc., under milder conditions. BH3 is often used in hydroboration reactions, but in this case, perhaps it's being used in a similar context as a reducing agent, but maybe with different stereochemical outcomes.

Wait, but another thought: BH3 is typically used in the formation of alkenes via hydroboration-oxidation, where the boron adds to the less substituted end (anti-Markovnikov), and the hydrogen adds to the more substituted end, with the stereochemistry determined by the geometry of the alkene.

But in this problem, the reagents are LiBH4 and BH3, both used with H+. So perhaps in one case, the reduction leads to retention of configuration, and in the other, inversion or something else.

Wait, when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol using a hydride agent, the hydride adds from the less hindered side, leading to the configuration of the resulting alcohol.

LiBH4 is a chiral reducing agent? No, it's not; it's a source of H- (hydride). The addition is typically from the same face, leading to the retention of configuration if the starting material is prochiral.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center adjacent to the ketone. When the ketone is reduced, the alcohol's configuration depends on the approach of the hydride.

Wait, in the starting material, the ketone is at C5, and C3 has an ethyl group. So when the ketone (C5) is reduced, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon (C5), creating a new chiral center there. The configuration of that center would determine the product.

Wait, the starting material's configuration at C5 would be either R or S. When LiBH4 reduces it, the hydride would add from the less hindered side, which might depend on the configuration of the starting material.

Wait, for a planar carbonyl group, the hydride can approach from either side, but if the starting material is chiral, the approach might be influenced by the existing groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to the same configuration as the starting material. For example, if the starting material is R at C5, the resulting alcohol would be R at C5, which then becomes the configuration in the product.

Wait, but in the product, the configuration is at position 4 (ethyl group), which is C4 in the product. So perhaps the C5 in the starting material becomes C4 in the product after cyclization.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mechanism of the reaction. Let's say the starting material is a ketone at C5, and when reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol at C5. Then, during cyclization, this alcohol would form a ring by attacking a carbonyl group elsewhere in the molecule, leading to the formation of the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material's C5 ketone becomes the C2 ketone in the product. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a Î²-keto ester, and when reduced, the ester becomes an alcohol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, another angle: the product is formed via a reduction of a ketone, followed by cyclization. The starting material's configuration at the ketone will influence the product's configuration.

So, in reaction A, using LiBH4, the product is R. In reaction B, using BH3, the product is S. What's the difference between these two reactions in terms of how they affect stereochemistry?

Wait, perhaps LiBH4 and BH3 have different approaches when reducing ketones, leading to different configurations.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically provides hydrides from the less hindered side, leading to the formation of the most stable alcohol, which is usually the less substituted (anti-Markovnikov) position. But in this case, the starting material is a ketone, so the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but in a cyclic ketone, the approach of the hydride from a specific face would determine the configuration of the resulting alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a chiral ketone. For example, if the starting material has R configuration at C5, then the hydride (from LiBH4) would add from the less hindered face, leading to R configuration in the resulting alcohol. Then, during cyclization, that configuration would be preserved, leading to the product's configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the reduction leads to the same configuration as the starting material because the hydride adds to the same face relative to the existing groups.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the product.

The product is (R) when treated with LiBH4, and (S) when treated with BH3. So the reagent used affects the configuration of the product.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. So perhaps the approach of the hydride differs between the two.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of a chiral starting material, the reduction could lead to either retention or inversion of configuration, depending on the reducing agent.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that. Perhaps the reducing agent's approach is influenced by the existing stereochemistry, leading to different configurations in the product.

Alternatively, the stereochemistry of the starting material determines the configuration of the product, and the choice of reducing agent doesn't affect it. But in that case, both reactions would give the same configuration, which they don't.

Wait, perhaps the reducing agents cause different stereochemical outcomes because of their different mechanisms. For example, LiBH4 may add the hydride from a certain face, while BH3 adds from the opposite.

Alternatively, if the starting material is R, then LiBH4 would give R in the product, while BH3 would lead to S. Or vice versa.

Wait, the options for starting materials are either A and B being the same or different. Let's look at the options.

Option D) A is R, B is S.

So, in reaction A, starting with A (R), using LiBH4, gives the product R.

In reaction B, starting with B (S), using BH3, gives the product S.

Wait, but that would mean that the configuration is retained from the starting material to the product, which would require that the reducing agents do not change the configuration.

But I'm not sure if the reducing agents affect the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to the opposite configuration.

Wait, another angle: the starting material has a carbonyl group (C=O) and a configuration (R or S) that would influence the approach of the hydride. When LiBH4 adds the hydride, it may approach from a specific face, leading to a certain configuration in the product.

If the starting material is R, then the hydride adds from the less hindered face, perhaps leading to the same configuration in the product. Alternatively, maybe the product's configuration depends on the configuration of the starting material.

Wait, let's imagine that the starting material's C5 is R. When it's reduced, the hydride adds from the opposite face, making the alcohol's configuration S. But then, during cyclization, the configuration could invert or retain, leading to the product's configuration.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the options given.

The options are:

Option D) A is (R), B is (S).

So, when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives the R product, and when B is treated with BH3, it gives the S product.

Assuming that the configuration of the starting material A (R) leads to R product, and the same for B (S) leading to S product, then the correct option would be D.

But wait, why would the reagents matter if the configurations are retained? Because LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. Maybe one leads to retention and the other leads to inversion.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents determine the approach of the hydride, thus determining the configuration.

Wait, another thought: LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and may proceed through a different mechanism than BH3. For example, LiBH4 might add the hydride in a way that leads to retention of configuration, while BH3 leads to inversion.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent together determine the product's configuration.

If the starting material is R, and using LiBH4 leads to R product, while using BH3 leads to S, then the starting materials must be different. But the options have A and B as either same or different.

Wait, looking back, option D has A as R and B as S. So, if reaction A uses A (R) and gives R product, and reaction B uses B (S) and gives S product, that would make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the product is the opposite of the starting material because the hydride adds to the opposite face.

Wait, let me think: when a ketone is reduced, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the configuration of the resulting alcohol depends on the approach of the hydride. If the starting material's configuration is R, the hydride adds from the same face, leading to the same configuration in the product. Or maybe the opposite.

Wait, perhaps the product's configuration is the same as the starting material, because the hydride adds to the same face, leading to retention.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Another approach: in the product, the configuration is R when using LiBH4 and S when using BH3. So the reagents affect the configuration. Therefore, the starting material must be the same for both reactions, leading to different product configurations based on the reagent.

Wait, but the options suggest that A and B are different. So, the starting materials must be enantiomers. So, when you reduce each enantiomer with a different reagent, you get the corresponding enantiomer in the product.

So, if A is R, and B is S, then upon reduction, they would yield R and S products, respectively.

Wait, but why would the reagents matter then? Because if the starting materials are enantiomers, wouldn't the product's configuration depend solely on the starting material's configuration, regardless of the reagent?

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents affect the approach of the hydride, leading to different configurations based on the same starting material.

Wait, for example, maybe LiBH4 adds the hydride from the same face as the existing substituents, leading to retention, while BH3 adds from the opposite face, leading to inversion.

But that's just a hypothesis. If that's the case, then the same starting material would lead to different configurations when treated with different reagents.

But in the problem, the two reactions are using different starting materials, A and B, treated with different reagents, leading to R and S products.

So, perhaps for reaction A, starting material A is R, and when treated with LiBH4, gives R product. Reaction B, starting material B is S, and treated with BH3, gives S product.

So, the correct option would be D: A is R, B is S.


The question involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 for reaction A and BH3 for reaction B. The starting materials are enantiomers of the compound (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and the goal is to match the correct enantiomer to each reaction to produce the desired enantiomeric product.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product is a six-membered cyclic ketone (tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one) with an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry of the product (R or S) depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent.

2. **Reducing Agents**:
   - **LiBH4**: A strong reducing agent that typically reduces esters, ketones, and aldehydes. It adds hydrides to carbonyl groups, and the stereochemistry of the resulting alcohol depends on the configuration of the starting material and the approach of the hydride.
   - **BH3**: A weaker reducing agent that may have a different mechanism of hydride addition, potentially leading to inversion of configuration compared to LiBH4.

3. **Starting Material**:
   - The starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This compound has a ketone at position 5 and an ethyl group at position 3. The stereochemistry at position 5 determines the configuration of the product after reduction and cyclization.

4. **Reaction Outcomes**:
   - Reaction A (LiBH4) produces the (R)-enantiomer of the product.
   - Reaction B (BH3) produces the (S)-enantiomer of the product.
   - The stereochemistry of the starting material dictates the stereochemistry of the product. If the starting material is (R), the product will also be (R), and if the starting material is (S), the product will be (S).

5. **Options**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This would result in the same product (S) for both reactions, which contradicts the question.
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This would also result in the same product (R) for both reactions, which contradicts the question.
   - **Option C**: A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This would produce (S) for reaction A and (R) for reaction B, which is the opposite of the desired outcomes.
   - **Option D**: A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This matches the desired outcomes: (R) for reaction A and (S) for reaction B.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for reaction A and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for reaction B. This ensures that the stereochemistry of the product matches the desired enantiomers.
