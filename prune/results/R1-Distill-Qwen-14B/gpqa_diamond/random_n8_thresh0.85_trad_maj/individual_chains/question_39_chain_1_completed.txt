Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of wave functions and probabilities. But let me try to think it through step by step.

The question says that we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (the x-axis). The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles, none were found outside the region x=1 to x=3. So, all the particles are in between 1 and 3.

Hmm, I remember that the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition. That is, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Because the probability of finding the particle somewhere must sum to 100%.

So the first thing I need to do is normalize the wave function. But wait, the wave function has both real and imaginary parts. Oh right, the wave function is generally complex, so when I square it, it's the modulus squared.

Wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me denote it as ψ(x). So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5)i.

The modulus squared of ψ(x) is [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ] because when you take the absolute value squared of a complex number A + Bi, it's A² + B².

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, the wave function must be normalized. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must equal 1.

But wait, particles can't be found outside x=1 and x=3, which means the wave function must be zero outside that region. Or perhaps another approach is that the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe the wave function is defined only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Because all the particles are found in this region.

So the normalization integral is from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

So let me write that integral:

∫ (from 1 to 3) [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but if the wave function is as given, maybe I should integrate the modulus squared. Let's compute this integral.

Breaking it down, the integral becomes:

a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3  +  ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

The first integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3.

At x=3: ln(4)
At x=1: ln(2)
So the first part is ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

So the first term is a² * ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

Putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

Taking square root: a ≈ sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral is ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3.

So, yes, that's correct.

So the first term: a² * [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² * ln(2).

Second term: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So equation: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² = (1 - 0.5)/ln(2) = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

a = sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849. So approximately 0.85, which is option B.

But wait, the options don't have 0.85 exactly. Let me check the options again.

Option B is 0.85, which is the closest. So the answer should be B.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition requires that the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over the region where the particle exists (from \(x=1\) to \(x=3\)) equals 1:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

Breaking this into two parts:

1. **First term**: \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\)

   The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln(1+x)\). Evaluating this from \(x=1\) to \(x=3\):

   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
   \]

   Thus, the first term becomes:

   \[
   a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx\)

   Evaluating this:

   \[
   0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{1 - 0.5}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to this value is **0.85**, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
