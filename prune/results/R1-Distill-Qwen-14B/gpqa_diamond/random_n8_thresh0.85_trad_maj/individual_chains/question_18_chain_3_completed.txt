Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on stellar abundances, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure if the mass matters here. The problem is about elemental abundances, so maybe the mass is just extra info.

The given data includes some abundance ratios. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Oh wait, [Fe/H] is the iron abundance relative to hydrogen. And [Mg/H] is magnesium relative to hydrogen. So Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0, same as Star_1's [Fe/H] being 0. That probably means that for Star_1, [Fe/H] is solar, and same for Star_2's [Mg/H].

The Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5, so that's the same as log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. Wait, no, wait. The notation is a bit tricky. [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun is 0. So when the problem says 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5, that's the same as log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5? Wait, no, wait. No, the way the notation is given is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So solving for log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5) in the Sun. Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7, so log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5. So nMg/nH is 10^-5.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find [Si/Star_1] / [Si/Star_2], or maybe nSi_1 / nSi_2?

Wait, no, the question says the ratio of silicon atoms between Star_1 and Star_2. So nSi_1 divided by nSi_2? Or is it [Si/H] for each star, and then take the ratio?

Let's see. The problem gives [Si/Fe] for Star_1 and [Mg/Si] for Star_2. So perhaps I can find [Si/H] for each star and then take the ratio.

Wait, for Star_1: [Si/Fe] is 0.3. That means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 0.3 dex higher than in the Sun. And since [Fe/H] is 0, meaning Fe abundance is the same as the Sun relative to H. So if [Fe/H] is 0, then [X/H] for X is the same as the Sun's for Fe.

Wait, no. [Fe/H] is 0 for Star_1. So in Star_1, the abundance ratio of Fe to H is the same as in the Sun. So nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH / (nFe_sun/nH_sun)) ) = 0, so nFe/nH is same as Sun.

So for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That is, log (nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun) ). Wait, no. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) = 0, so nFe/nH is the same as the Sun. So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun) * (nH_1 / nH_sun). Assuming that the total H is scaled by the star's atmosphere, but perhaps we can treat each element's abundance as a fraction of H.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's restate the problem.

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So (nSi_1)/(nSi_2).

To find this, perhaps we can express [Si/H] for each star and then compute (10^([Si/H]_1) ) / (10^([Si/H]_2) )).

So first, find [Si/H] for Star_1 and Star_2.

For Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. [Fe/H]_1 = 0.

So, [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

We know that for the Sun, [Fe/H]_sun is 0, so nFe_sun / nH_sun = some value.

Wait, let's compute [Si/H]_1.

In Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0, so nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

So, nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

But in the Sun, the ratio nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5), as per the given data: 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

So, for Star_1, nFe_1 = (1e-4.5) * (nH_1).

Now, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3.

But nSi_sun/nFe_sun is the solar ratio, which I don't have directly. Wait, the Sun's data gives nFe/nH and nMg/nH. So perhaps I can find nSi/nH for the Sun.

Wait, no. The problem gives the Sun's photosphere data as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 3.16e-5 (since 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5). Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe] or [Si/H]. Hmm, perhaps I can assume that in the Sun, [Fe/H] is 0, [Mg/H] is 0, so nMg/nH is solar value, etc. But how do I get the Sun's [Si/Fe]?

Wait, perhaps I can use the data for Star_2 to find something. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. So, [Mg/Si] = log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) = 0.3.

But [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg_2 /nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

So, nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2.

And for the Sun, nMg/nH = 1e-5.

So, for Star_2: nMg_2 = (1e-5) * nH_2.

Now, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg_2 /nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) + 0.3.

But I don't know nMg_sun /nSi_sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/H] for each star by relating the given ratios.

Let me think about Star_1 first.

For Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. [Fe/H]_1 =0.

So, [Si/Fe] = log(nSi_1 /nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

But nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun) ), because [Fe/H] is 0.

So, nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun).

Then, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^{0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun)}.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express [Si/H]_1 in terms of [Fe/H]_1 and [Si/Fe]_1.

Since [Fe/H]_1 =0, then [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3.

Wait, no, because [X/Y] + [Y/Z] = [X/Z]. So [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

Wait, that makes sense. So [Si/H] for Star_1 is 0.3.

So, nSi_1/nH_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Wait, no. Because [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun) ) = log( (nX/nH) / (nX_sun/nH_sun) ) )

So, [X/H] = log( (nX / nH) / (nX_sun / nH_sun) ) )

Which can be rewritten as:

(nX / nH) = (nX_sun / nH_sun) * 10^{[X/H]}.

So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

But I don't know nSi_sun /nH_sun. Hmm. Because the Sun's data only gives nFe/nH and nMg/nH.

Wait, perhaps I can relate [Si/Fe] in the Sun. Because Star_1's [Si/Fe] is 0.3, but the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero? No, wait, no. The [X/Y] is relative to the Sun. So the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero.

So, in the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun = 0 → nSi_sun /nFe_sun = nSi_sun /nFe_sun = same as [Si/Fe]_sun. So, nSi_sun = nFe_sun * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) = nFe_sun * 10^0 = nFe_sun.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if [Si/Fe]_sun is 0, then nSi_sun / nFe_sun = nSi_sun_sun /nFe_sun_sun = 1? No, that's not correct. Wait, the Sun's [X/Y] is the logarithm of (nX/nY)/(nX_sun/nY_sun). So if [X/Y] is zero, then nX/nY is the same as in the Sun. So for the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun is log( (nSi/nFe)_sun ) - log( (nSi/nFe)_sun ) )=0. So that's always zero for the Sun.

But I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe]. Oh wait, for the Sun, [Fe/H] is 0, [Mg/H] is 0, but we don't have [Si/H]. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can find nSi_sun /nH_sun from the Sun's other ratios.

Wait, how?

Wait, for the Sun, we have nFe/nH = 1e-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH? I don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can relate nSi to nMg somehow. Because in Star_2, [Mg/Si] is given.

Wait, for Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, [Mg/H]_2 =0.

So, [Mg/Si] = log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) = 0.3.

Which means nMg_2 /nSi_2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

But [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun).

So nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2.

Similarly, nSi_2 = nSi_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun) * 10^{-0.3}.

Wait, because from [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3: log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) + 0.3.

Which means nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

Rearranged, nSi_2 = nMg_2 * (nSi_sun /nMg_sun) ) * 10^{-0.3}.

But nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2.

So, nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2 * (nSi_sun /nMg_sun) ) * 10^{-0.3}.

This simplifies to (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2 * 10^{-0.3}.

So, nSi_2 = nSi_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun) ) * 10^{-0.3}.

Wait, that's the same as [Si/H]_2 = [Si/H]_sun + log(10^{-0.3}) = log(nSi_2/nH_2) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) = -0.3.

Because [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_2/nH_2) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) = log( [nSi_2/nH_2 ] / [nSi_sun/nH_sun] ) ) = log( (nSi_2/nH_2 ) * (nH_sun/nSi_sun) ) ) → but from earlier, nSi_2 = nSi_sun*(nH_2/nH_sun)*10^{-0.3}.

So, nSi_2/nH_2 = (nSi_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) *10^{-0.3}) ) /nH_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * 10^{-0.3}.

So [Si/H]_2 = log( (nSi_sun/nH_sun *10^{-0.3} ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) ) = log(10^{-0.3}) ) = -0.3.

Wait, so [Si/H] for Star_2 is -0.3.

But for Star_1, [Si/H] is 0.3.

Wait, but wait, I thought earlier that for Star_1, [Si/H] is 0.3 because [Si/Fe] is 0.3 and [Fe/H] is 0. So [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe] =0.3. That seems correct.

So, Star_1 has [Si/H] = 0.3.

Star_2 has [Si/H] = -0.3.

Wait, wait, so the ratio of silicon atoms is (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) ) = (nSi_1/nH_1 ) * (nH_2/nSi_2 ) ).

Which is (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) ) → which is 10^{[Si/H]_1} / 10^{[Si/H]_2}.

Because [Si/H] = log(nSi/nH / solar_ratio). So for each star, nSi/nH = solar_ratio * 10^{[Si/H]}.

So the ratio is (solar_ratio *10^{0.3}) / (solar_ratio *10^{-0.3}) ) = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.

Wait, 10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is about 4. So the ratio is about 4.

So the ratio of Star_1's silicon to Star_2's silicon is approximately 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which is close. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check my reasoning.

For Star_1: [Si/H] = 0.3 → nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

For Star_2: [Si/H] = -0.3 → nSi_2/nH_2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *10^{-0.3}.

Now, the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) = [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun 10^0.3 ) ] / [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun) 10^-0.3 ) ] = (10^0.3) / (10^-0.3) ) = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98.

Yes, so the answer is approximately 3.9, which is option A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the relationships between the logarithmic abundance ratios.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

   Since [Fe/H]_1 = 0, the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun. Using the relationship [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe], we find:
   \[
   [\text{Si/H}]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3 \, \text{dex}.
   \]

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

   Since [Mg/H]_2 = 0, the abundance of Mg relative to H is the same as in the Sun. Using the relationship [Mg/Si] = log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun), we find:
   \[
   \log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_2 = \log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_{\odot} + 0.3.
   \]
   Rearranging, we find:
   \[
   [\text{Si/H}]_2 = [\text{Mg/H}]_2 - [\text{Mg/Si}]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3 \, \text{dex}.
   \]

3. **Ratio of Silicon Atoms**:
   The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1}}{10^{[\text{Si/H}]_2}} = \frac{10^{0.3}}{10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.6}.
   \]
   Approximating \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), the ratio is approximately 3.9.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately 3.9.
