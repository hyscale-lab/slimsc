Okay, so I've got this science question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. 

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because the period is shorter. Also, both have circular orbits.

The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, same radius but different masses? Oh, because Planet_2's star is slightly evolved. Slightly evolved stars might be bigger, but in this case, their radii are same. Interesting.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability depends on the size of the orbit relative to the star. The formula I think is the probability P = (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (a / (a sqrt(1 - e²) ) ), but since orbits are circular, e=0, so it's just (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(a)). Wait, wait, no, I think I might be mixing things up. 

Wait, the transit probability is actually given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a) / (sqrt(a² - R_s²)) ) ), but that's when the star's radius is much smaller than the planet's orbital distance, which it always is. Alternatively, another approach: the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, but I might be getting that wrong. 

Wait, another approach: the probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star and a, it's roughly (R_star) / a. Because the planet has to be in the right part of its orbit, so the alignment probability is proportional to the size of the star relative to the planet's orbital distance. Wait, I think I'm getting closer.

Wait, I've read before that the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits) is given by (R_s + R_p) / a, but in most cases, R
