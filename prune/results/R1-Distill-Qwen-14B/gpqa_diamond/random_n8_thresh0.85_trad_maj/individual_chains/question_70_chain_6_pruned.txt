Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's break down the question step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to think this through.

The problem describes several reactions, and I need to identify the structures of the compounds involved to determine the symmetry of E. Let's start by mapping out each reaction.

First Reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I remember that when a solid reacts with a gas in a high stoichiometric ratio, it often forms something like a salt. Bright red products could be a clue. Maybe C is a metal sulfide or something with a red color. Wait, if A is a metal and B is a halogen, but that doesn't sound right. Oh, wait, another possibility: maybe A is a metal oxide or a metal, and B is a diatomic gas like Cl2 or O2. Another thought: 8 equivalents is a lot. Like, 8 moles of B per mole of A. That ratio makes me think of something like Fe reacting with Cl2. Iron and chlorine reaction produces FeCl3, but wait, iron can have different ratios. Alternatively, maybe B is sulfur (S8), but that's a solid, so probably not. Oh, wait, another possibility: maybe A is copper (Cu) and B is sulfur vapor (S8). But copper and sulfur react to form Cu2S, which is a solid, but I'm not sure about the color. Or perhaps another reaction.

Wait, another approach: product C is used in the next reaction. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E is probably a compound formed from C and D. Also, C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids F and G, where F is strong and G is weak. So, when C is treated with water, it breaks down into A, F, and G.

So, considering that, let's think about what C could be. If C reacts with water to form two acids, maybe C is a sulfide or a nitride? Wait, because when sulfides react with water, they usually form H2S (a weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide, but that depends on the metal. Alternatively, if C is a metal carbide, it might react with water to form CO2 and a base. Hmm.

Wait, if F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, think about the possible products. For instance, if C is a sulfide, like CuS, reacting with water might produce H2S (weak acid) and a metal oxide, which would react with water to form a strong acid like HCl or something? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another angle.

Looking at the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. E is extremely hazardous. So, what could E be? Maybe a highly toxic gas, like HCl? Or perhaps something like phosgene? Hmm, but phosgene isn't formed from C and D in that way. Alternatively, maybe E is something like SO2 or Cl2, but those are the reactants themselves. Wait, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule. Alternatively, maybe E is something like HCN, but I'm not sure how that would come about.

Looking back, the first reaction is solid A + 8 B → C (bright red). Let's think about metals and their reactions. For example, Fe and Cl2 react to form FeCl3, but that's not red. Alternatively, Cu and S8 (in solid form) react to form Cu2S, which is black, so that's not matching. Another red compound I know is mercury(I) oxide (HgO) is red, but that's when mercuric oxide forms. But I'm not sure how that fits here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like O2. But 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of O2 per mole of A. That's a lot. For example, if A is iron, Fe + O2 forms FeO, but that's a black solid. Hmm. Alternatively, could A be a metal that forms a complex with B?

Alternatively, maybe B is a diatomic gas like H2, but that's not likely since it's a gas. Wait, another possibility: B could be chlorine gas (Cl2). So, A is a metal that reacts with Cl2 in a 8:1 ratio. That would imply a metal that can form an 8 chlorides, but metals typically form +1, +2, +3, maybe higher oxidation states. 8 equivalents would mean 8 Cl2 per A.

Wait, maybe A is calcium (Ca), which has a +2 charge. If 8 Cl2 would give 16 Cl- per Ca, so CaCl8? That doesn't sound right. Or maybe A is something else.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is about a metal reacting with another gas, like sulfur vapor. For instance, Fe reacting with S8 to form FeS. But FeS is black, not red. Alternatively, maybe it's a different metal. How about copper? Cu and S form CuS, which is black. Not red.

Wait, another angle: the product C is a compound that when reacted with D produces a dangerous product E. Also, C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So, if C is a sulfide, then perhaps F and G are H2S (weak acid) and a strong acid like HCl. Wait, but H2S is a weak acid. So maybe the decomposition of C is something like C + H2O → A + HCl (strong) + H2S (weak). That suggests C is a sulfide, but then A would be the metal. Hmm.

Wait, but if C is a sulfide like FeS, then reacting with water would produce Fe(OH)S (but that's not stable) or perhaps Fe(OH)2 and H2S. But I'm not sure about the exact products. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacts with water to produce Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility is that C is a metal carbide. For example, SiC reacts with water to produce CO and a metal hydroxide. CO is a neutral molecule, not an acid. Hmm, not matching either.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate? No, that doesn't seem to fit. Another thought: maybe C is a chloride, and upon hydrolysis, it forms a strong acid and a weak one. For example, if C is something like AlCl3, but AlCl3 is a Lewis acid and reacts with water to
