Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products for two reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction is 1-nitropropane with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. The options are A, B, C, D with different products for A and B.

Starting with reaction A: The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. I remember that when ketones react with something like ethyl acrylate, especially in the presence of a strong base like t-BuOK, it's probably an example of a conjugate addition or maybe a Michael addition. Wait, no, Michael addition is when a nucleophile adds to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. But wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So maybe it's a Michael donor adding to the cyclohexanone.

Alternatively, another possibility is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. Wait, but Claisen usually involves two carbonyl compounds. Or maybe it's a conjugate addition, like a base-induced addition to the alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

Wait, the cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Maybe the ethyl acrylate (which is an enolate) will attack the ketone. Hmm, but t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So it would deprotonate the alpha position of the cyclohexanone.

Wait, the cyclohexanone has alpha protons. The structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at position 1, and substituents at 2 (ethyl), 6 (methyl). So the cyclohexane ring has substituents at positions 2 (ethyl), 6 (methyl), and the ketone is at position 1.

So the carbonyl is in position 1, so the alpha carbons are at positions 2 and 6. Wait, but position 2 is already substituted with an ethyl group. So the available alpha positions are probably position 6, but position 6 has a methyl group. So the alpha protons are in those positions. But wait, position 2 is ethyl, so maybe the alpha to the carbonyl is at position 2. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl acrylate acts as a Michael acceptor. The cyclohexanone would be the nucleophile, but wait, no, the cyclohexanone is a ketone, which would be an electrophilic site.

Wait, perhaps it's a crossed aldol addition? But that usually requires enolates. Alternatively, considering the possibility of a conjugate addition. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the structure of ethyl acrylate. It's CH2=CHCOOEt. So it's an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So when a base is present, perhaps the cyclohexanone can undergo enolate formation, and
