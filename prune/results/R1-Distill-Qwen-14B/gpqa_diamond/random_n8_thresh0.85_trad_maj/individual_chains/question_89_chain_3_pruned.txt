Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

First, the question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two opposite positions of the adamantane skeleton.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid, product 1. From what I recall, when vicinal dihalides (which are two halides on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo elimination to form alkenes. This is likely an E2 mechanism. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming an alkene. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide—it has bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3, which are separated by one carbon. So, elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, or maybe 2 and 3? Hmm, let me think. Oh wait, wait, the structure of adamantane is such that each carbon is connected in a diamond lattice. So, the positions 1 and 3 are adjacent in the structure. So eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond between C1 and C2, perhaps? Or maybe between C1 and C3? No, wait, elimination between adjacent carbons. So the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons. So the product would be 1,3-didehydroadamantane? Or maybe it's 1,2-didehydro... Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a trans-diene or something else. But the NMR and IR data might help.

The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). Wait, E2 elimination would form an alkene, but that doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Oh wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Oh, wait, KOH is a strong base but in certain conditions, maybe it's an elimination, but wait, if it's a vicinal
