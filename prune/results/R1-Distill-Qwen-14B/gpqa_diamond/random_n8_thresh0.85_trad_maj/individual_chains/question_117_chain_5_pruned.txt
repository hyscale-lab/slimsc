Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry and isomers. Hmm, optical isomerism, right? That's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they can rotate plane-polarized light. Let me think about what each of these moieties has.

The question lists four moieties, and I have to pick which ones show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations.

Let me go through each one:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at positions 1 and 1'. The substituents are nitro at 6 and 6', and carboxylate esters at 2 and 2'. Wait, biphenyls can have different conformations, but do they have stereoisomerism? Biphenyls can have cis and trans configurations around the single bond between the rings. But does that lead to optical isomerism? Or is it just geometric isomerism? Oh, wait, optical isomerism requires a chiral center or some kind of asymmetry. So in this compound, are there any chiral centers? Let me see. The ester groups are at positions 2 on each biphenyl. So each biphenyl has a substituent (COOCH3) at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. Wait, so each ring has these groups. Are the rings attached in a way that creates a plane of symmetry? If both rings are symmetric, maybe not. Let me imagine the structure. The biphenyl has two rings connected at C1 and C1'. The substituents are at 2 and 2', 6 and 6'. So on each ring, the substituents are at opposite positions. So perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. If that's the case, then it might not have a chiral center. Wait, but maybe because the biphenyl can rotate, but that would affect the isomerism. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule as a whole is chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the ester groups in the two rings could contribute to asymmetry. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't mirror each other, then the molecule might have a chiral center or a plane of asymmetry. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I need to think about whether this compound has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule is symmetrical, then it won't have optical isomers. But if it's asymmetrical, then it can have optical isomers. Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me imagine the structure: each biphenyl ring has a COOCH3 at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. So positions 2 and 6 are on the same ring. Wait, how are the substituents arranged? Are they para to each other on the ring? Because the numbering on biphenyl is such that the ring positions are across from each other. So 2 and 6 would be opposite each other on the same ring. So each ring has two substituents: a COOCH3 and a nitro group, opposite each other. So each ring is symmetrical. But the two rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. So the two rings have the same substituents but are attached across from each other. Wait, maybe the whole molecule is symmetrical. So that would mean no chiral center. So perhaps this compound doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should move to the next and come back.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is a carboxylic acid ester. Let's see: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is: the ester group is CH3O-CO-O attached to a propionoate chain. The structure would be methyl ester of
