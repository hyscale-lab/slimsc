Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 200 mL or 0.2 liters, right? And it contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given too: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is room temperature, so probably standard conditions.

The question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution. Orthophosphate is HPO4^3-, I believe. So, I need to find [HPO4^3-] in the solution.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. H3PO4 can deprotonate in steps. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 is 7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 is 6.2e-8). The third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 is 1.8e-12). So, orthophosphate would be HPO4^2-, but wait, wait. No, wait. Orthophosphate is HPO4^3-? Or is that the dihydrogen phosphate?

Wait, I think I'm getting this mixed up. Let me clarify:

- H3PO4 is the fully protonated form, trihydrogen phosphate.
- H2PO4^- is dihydrogen phosphate.
- HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate (which is sometimes called orthophosphate? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, I need to be careful here.)

Wait, no. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. When it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate). Losing another gives HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate, sometimes called orthophosphate), and losing a third gives PO4^3- (phosphate).

So the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

But wait, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So let's think about what each of these salts dissociates into.

KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

So KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate. It dissociates into Na+ and HPO4^2- (since Na is +1, so two Na+ per HPO4^2-). So each formula unit gives two Na+ and one HPO4^2-.

So, in solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O. But wait, in solution, these ions might interconvert because they are in a buffer system. So it's a buffer solution, right?

Because the solution contains a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), which makes a buffer. So the pH of the solution will determine the ratio of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-. So I need to calculate [HPO4^2-].

Wait, but how? Because when you dissolve these two salts into water, their ions are present, but they can react with each other.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the initial moles of each species, then consider the buffer equation to find their concentrations after accounting for any reactions.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, calculate the moles of each salt.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g is 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007339 mol. Let me compute that accurately.

1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007339 mol.

Similarly, the moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005606 mol.

Wait, what's the formula for Na2HPO4·2H2O? It's sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. So each mole gives 1 mole of HPO4^2-.

So, for the solution, the total volume is 200 mL (0.2 L).

So, the initial concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007339 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036695 M.

The initial concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005606 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02803 M.

But wait, in solution, H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can interconvert based on the pH. So the buffer equation (Henderson-Hasselbalch) applies.

The buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Wait, but wait, what about the other species? Do I need to consider anything else? Hmm, because the solution also has HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-, which are in equilibrium. So the buffer equation will relate the concentrations.

But wait, if I can find the pH of the solution, then I can find the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-], but I don't know the pH yet. Alternatively, I can use the moles to find the ratio.

Wait, but perhaps the solution is such that the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in equilibrium, and the total concentration is the sum of their concentrations. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the initial concentrations are the ones that will determine the ratio, and the solution will reach equilibrium based on that.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify any additional information like pH, so perhaps we can assume that the initial concentrations are the ones that set the ratio. But that depends on the assumption that the solution doesn't have any other sources or sinks for H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a buffer, and the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-] is determined by the amount of each present.

So, the initial moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007339 mol, and HPO4^2- is 0.005606 mol. So the ratio is (0.005606) / (0.007339)
