Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms is governed by the Boltzmann equation. 

The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So the excitation level is higher in star_1. I think the Boltzmann factor comes into play here, which relates the relative populations of two energy levels in a system. The formula is something like the ratio of the populations equals the exponential of the negative energy difference over k*T.

Wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, right, Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is equal to k*T. But wait, no, because the term is ΔE/(k*T), so when you compute that ratio, the k's might cancel out.

So let me think. The ratio of the populations, n_upper / n_lower, is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). But in this case, we're comparing two different stars. So for star_1, the ratio is n1_upper / n1_lower, and for star_2, it's n2_upper / n2_lower. The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited, so I guess that means the population ratio is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. Or wait, no, actually, the question says that the specific energy level is twice as excited in star_1. So perhaps the population in the higher energy level is higher there.

Wait, maybe I should set up the equations. Let's say for each star, the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state (or a lower state) is determined by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1, the ratio is (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)). Similarly for star 2, it's (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

But the problem says that the excited level is twice as much in star_1. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, the question says that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So maybe the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower)?

Wait, no, maybe it's that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So the ratio n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is twice as much as that for star_2. So, (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower).

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is higher in star_1, so the population in the upper energy level is higher. So, (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = 2*(n2_upper)/(n2_lower).

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So ratio for star_1 is r
