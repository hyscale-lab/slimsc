Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different exponents of 1 over plx.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula is plx (in parsecs) = 1/distance (in parsecs). So the closer the star, the larger the parallax.

But how does the number of stars per unit parallax change? Hmm, so if I have more stars at a certain distance, how does that translate to the number in a range of parallax?

Let me think about the distribution. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So, n = constant.

Distance and parallax are inversely related. So, when I increase the parallax, the distance decreases. So, for a given range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, the corresponding distance is from d to d + dd, where dd is a small change.

But wait, since plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, if plx increases by a small amount dplx, what's the corresponding change in distance? Let's see, d is 1/plx. So, dd is the change in d when plx changes by dplx.

We can write d = 1/plx. Taking derivative, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, the change in distance when plx changes by dplx is proportional to -dplx / plx². But since distance decreases as plx increases, the negative makes sense, but for small steps, the magnitude is important.

But how does this relate to the number of stars? The number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd would be the volume of the shell multiplied by the number density of stars.

The volume of a spherical shell is 4π d² dd. So, number of stars N in this shell is n * 4π d² dd, where n is the number density (stars per volume).

But since we want the number of stars per unit parallax range, I need to express N in terms of plx. Let me substitute d = 1/plx and dd in terms of dplx.

From d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx → dplx = - plx² dd. But since we're dealing with positive ranges, I'll take the absolute value: |dplx| = plx² dd.

So substituting back into N:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 dd

But dd is related to dplx: dd = dplx / plx² (since dplx is negative, but we take the magnitude). So,

N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2) )

So N = n * 4π dplx / plx^4

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So, if dplx is 1 unit, like per parsec of plx, then N is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, that would mean that the number of stars per unit plx range decreases as plx increases, which makes sense because closer stars have higher parallax and more stars would be found at lower parallax ranges. But wait, no, higher parallax is closer, so as plx increases, the number per unit plx (like per parsec) would be higher? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let me double-check. The number N per unit plx is N = (n * 4π d) / (plx^4) * dplx. So, if I take dplx as 1, then N is proportional to 1/plx^4. So, as plx increases, N decreases. That matches with the fact that more stars are at larger distances (lower plx), so in each unit of plx, you find fewer stars as plx increases.

But wait, is there another way to think about it? Maybe in terms of flux or something else?

Alternatively, think about the area and the distance. The number of stars in a given volume. If I have a range of parallax, plx to plx + dplx, which corresponds to a distance from d to d + dd. The volume is 4π (d^2) dd, as before.

But with d = 1/plx and dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So, the volume is 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * (dplx / plx^2 )

So, 4π dplx (1/plx^4)

So, the number of stars is n * 4π dplx / pl
