Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy change, right?

Wait, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization usually involves an acid reacting with a base to form water. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is around -57 kJ per mole for strong acids and bases, but this problem probably expects me to calculate it based on the amounts provided.

But wait, in this case, there are three solutions, so it's not just two reacting. I need to figure out all the possible reactions here. Let me list out the reactants and see what happens when they mix.

First, HCl is a strong acid. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, H2SO4 is diprotic. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when these mix, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

But wait, how do I calculate the moles of H+ and OH- available?

Let me break it down step by step.

Calculating moles for each solution:

1. HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, giving 1 H+ per molecule. So moles of H+ from HCl = 0.1 mol.

2. H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each molecule gives 2 H+ ions. So moles of H+ here = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

3. Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of OH- = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Wait, wait, but wait a second. When H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react, what's the stoichiometry? Because H2SO4 is diprotic and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but when they react, the reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, let me write the balanced equation:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 +
