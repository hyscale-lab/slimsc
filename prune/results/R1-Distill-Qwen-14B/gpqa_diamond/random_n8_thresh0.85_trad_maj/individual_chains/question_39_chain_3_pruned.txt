Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me read it again. So, there's a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. I need to find the value of 'a'. The options are A to D.

Wait, so the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. Oh wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function usually has a complex part, right? But when we're talking about the position probability, we're concerned with the modulus squared of the wave function. So the probability density is |psi|^2.

But wait, the wave function given here has a real part and an imaginary part. Let me think: the wave function is psi(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Hmm, that's interesting. So when I square the modulus, the cross terms might come into play.

The modulus squared is [Re(psi)]^2 + [Im(psi)]^2. Wait, no, because modulus squared is (Re(psi))^2 + (Im(psi))^2 only if the wave function is a complex number with real and imaginary parts independent of each other. But in reality, the modulus squared is |psi|^2 = psi * psi*, where psi* is the complex conjugate. So if psi = A + iB, then psi* = A - iB. So |psi|^2 = (A + iB)(A - iB) = A² + B².

So in our case, A is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and B is 0.5. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Oh wait, wait. Because in the problem statement, the wave function is written as (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the imaginary part is -0.5i, so B is 0.5.

So |psi|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. So
