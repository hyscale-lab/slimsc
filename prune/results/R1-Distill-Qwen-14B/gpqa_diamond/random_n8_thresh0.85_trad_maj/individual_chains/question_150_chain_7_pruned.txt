Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying the final product after a series of reactions. The starting compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO and some given NMR data. The reagents used are in three steps: first, NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aqueous KOH with heat. The options are four different compounds, so I need to figure out which one is the product.

First, let me understand the NMR data. The H-NMR spectrum shows peaks at 9.72 ppm (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). 

Looking at the peaks:

- 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. So the compound has an aldehyde group. The triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons, but wait, aldehydes usually have a doublet because they couple with only one adjacent proton. Hmm, maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde or part of an enol? Or maybe it's an aromatic proton in a different environment? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, wait. Aldehydes typically show around 9-10 ppm as singlets if there's no coupling, but if they're adjacent to something else, like another proton, they can split. But in this case, it's a triplet. Could it be an aldehyde adjacent to another proton? Or perhaps something else. Also, the integration is 1H, so only one proton here. So maybe it's an aldehyde.

The next peak at 6.98 ppm is a doublet (d) of 2H. That's in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So perhaps a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents. Like, maybe two substituents are in the para positions, each with a proton that couples with another.

Then, 6.51 ppm, another doublet (d) for 2H. So maybe two protons that are adjacent to each other on another aromatic ring. Alternatively, it could be part of a conjugated system, like vinyl protons.

6.27 ppm is a broad singlet (bs) for 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH proton or perhaps being part of a conjugated system. Or maybe it's a diene?

3.66 ppm is a doublet (d) for 2H. That's a bit upfield, so perhaps these are CH2 groups adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Like an OCH2 group or something similar.

Putting this together: There's an aldehyde, two aromatic rings, maybe each with substituents. Let's think about the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-0)/2 = (9)/2=4.5? Wait, wait, I must have made a mistake. Let me recalculate. 

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So:

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2*C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since no X (halogens?), X=0.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2 =5 DoU. So five degrees: could be a ring and some double bonds. For example, two rings and two double bonds, or one ring and three double bonds, etc.

Looking at the NMR, the aldehyde (DoU +=1), each
