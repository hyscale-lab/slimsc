Okay, I need to figure out which compound X is based on the given NMR data after reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the reaction conditions: Compound X (C11H12O) is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, that solvent and temperature... Oh right! 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common catalyst for the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides. Or wait, is it for the opening of epoxides under basic conditions? Hmm, no, I think it's used as a base. Or wait, no, 1,4-diazabicyclooctane is often used as a bulky base in E2 reactions or for epoxide ring openings, maybe under basic conditions. Or wait, perhaps it's involved in the formation of epoxides, but in this case, since it's given as a reagent, maybe it's opening an epoxide?

Wait, no. Wait, when you have an epoxide and you treat it with a base, it can open the epoxide. But in this case, the product's NMR is given. So the product is formed after the reaction, which involves the starting material X reacting with this reagent.

Wait, perhaps the reagent is for acid-catalyzed opening? Or maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide to form some diol? Or perhaps it's a different reaction altogether.

Wait, the product's NMR has signals that suggest certain functional groups. Let me look at the 1H NMR first.

The 1H NMR has:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): That's a singlet, probably a methyl group attached to something deshielded but not near other protons. Maybe attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen, or part of a carbonyl, but more likely a CH3 group adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group or in a ring.

- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet, same integration. So two separate methyl groups, each as singlets. Could they be on the same carbon? No, because they are two singlets. Maybe on adjacent carbons or in different environments.

Then, the aromatic region:
- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

These look like a pair of doublets, perhaps part of a conjugated system. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents that cause splitting. Let's think about coupling in aromatic rings. The downfield shifts (like 7.68 and 7.71) suggest some electron-withdrawing groups or conjugation.

Looking at the 13C NMR:
- 21.3 (1C, s): That's a very low shift, probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe a carbonyl or an electronegative atom but perhaps in an epoxide ring where the carbons are adjacent to oxygen.

- 28.4 (1C, s): Another methyl, perhaps attached to a carbon that's not near anything electronegative.

Then the aromatic carbons:
- 126.9 (2C, s): Two equivalent carbons, maybe a para-substituted benzene.
- 127.1 (1C, s): A single carbon, perhaps in a meta position.
- 129.1 (2C, s): Two equivalent, maybe another part of the aromatic ring.
- 130.3 (1C, s): Another carbon, perhaps a quaternary carbon in a substituent.
- 141.5 (1C, s): That's a high shift, maybe a carbonyl group adjacent to the ring, like an ester or a ketone.
Wait, no. Alternatively, it could be a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. Wait, or perhaps a carbonyl group. Wait, 141-144 ppm is typical for carbonyls like ketones, esters, or maybe an aromatic carbons attached to an electronegative group.

Wait, looking at the 13C NMR, there's a peak at 197.7 ppm which is a 1C, s. That's a very high shift. 197 ppm is usually a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or an ester. Wait, but in an epoxide, the carbons are around 60-70 ppm. So 197 must be something else, maybe a carbonyl like a ketone or an ester.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. The reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a bicyclic amine. It's often used as a base. So in the presence of a base, what reactions could happen with the starting material X?

If X is an epoxide, then treating it with a base would cause ring-opening. The ring-opening of an epoxide typically produces an alcohol or an alkoxide, depending on conditions. Alternatively, if X is an allyl oxide or something else, perhaps a different reaction.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows a carbonyl at 197.7 ppm. That's a strong indication of a carbonyl group. So the product might have a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone or an ester.

Wait, but the starting material X is C11H12O. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation. For C11H12O: Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is O, but it doesn't count here. So, (2*11 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (24-12)/2=6.

So six degrees: that could be three rings and three double bonds, or a combination. For example, a benzene ring (3 degrees), a double bond (1), and an epoxide (which is a three-membered ring with two double bonds, but wait, an epoxide is an ether with a three-membered ring, so one ring (counts as one degree) and one double bond (counts as one degree). So if X
