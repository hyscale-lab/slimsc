Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think carefully. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. 

First, let me visualize the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, I think I need to clarify the numbering. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Position 1 is where the ethoxy group is attached. Then, position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group. So, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). 

The starting material is benzene. So I need to add these substituents in the correct order and positions. 

I remember that when you add substituents to a benzene ring, the order matters because each substitution can influence the next. The directing effects of the substituents are key here. 

Let me list the substituents and their directing effects:

- Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3): This is an activating group (since it's an ether) and it's ortho/para directing.
- tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3): This is a bulky, deactivating (due to being an alkyl group) andortho/para directing.
- Nitro group (-NO2): This is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

But wait, nitro groups are meta directors, meaning they direct incoming groups to the meta position. However, in this molecule, the nitro is at position 3. Hmm, maybe it's added after the other groups? Or perhaps the order of addition is important.

Let me think about the synthesis steps. Typically, when you have multiple substituents, you can either do electrophilic substitution reactions step by step, considering the directing effects each time. Alternatively, sometimes you might use protecting groups or other strategies, but I don't see any of that in the options, so I'll proceed without that.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let me figure out which is added first, second, third, and in what order.

Wait, the substituents' positions:

Ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, on the benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a way that 1 and 2 are ortho to each other, 2 and 3 are meta, etc. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me draw this out mentally. If the positions are 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), then the positions are adjacent in a meta arrangement? Maybe I should sketch a benzene ring with substituents in those positions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the order in which substituents are added. Each new substituent will affect where the next one goes.

But first, let me think about the substituents in the target molecule and their activating or deactivating nature.

Ethoxy is activating, so it directs incoming groups to ortho and para.

tert-Butyl is activating (since it's an alkyl group, which is activating, but being bulky, it's more of an ortho/para director but may prefer para due to steric hindrance. Wait, no, alkyl groups are activating (electron donating) and o/p directors. So, the tert-butyl group is an activating o/p director.

Nitro group is deactivating and m-directing.

So, when adding substituents, the order can influence where each group ends up.

Now, the target has three substituents, so I need to figure out which substituent is added first, second, and third.

Let me approach this step by step.

Optionally, perhaps adding the nitro group last, because nitro is a strong deactivating group, and once it's added, the ring becomes less reactive, which might make subsequent substitutions difficult. So maybe the nitro group is added after the other two substituents.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the nitro is in position 3. Let me consider the possible order of substitution.

Suppose the first substituent is ethoxy. Then, the next substituent is tert-butyl. The third is nitro.

Alternatively, perhaps the first substituent is tert-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitro. Or another order.

But I'm not sure yet. Let me think about the nitration. Nitration is an electrophilic substitution, using HNO3 and H2SO4 as the nitrating agent. Once a nitro group is present, it deactivates the ring, making further substitution harder, especially for activating groups. So, if you add nitro last, you can have the other activating groups directing the nitro.

Hmm. Alternatively, adding nitro earlier might complicate adding another substituent. But maybe we can add it in a way that it's meta to another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added first because it's activating, so it can direct the next groups.

Let me try an order:

1. Add ethoxy group: Benzene â†’ ethoxybenzene.

2. Add tert-butyl group: The ethoxy directs substitution to ortho and para. So, adding tert-butyl in ortho or para position relative to ethoxy.

But in the target, tert-butyl is at position 2, which is adjacent to position 1 (ethoxy), so that's ortho.

So, after adding ethoxy, the next substitution is in the ortho position relative to ethoxy. That would be position 2.

But wait, the tert-butyl is a bulky substituent. So, perhaps it's better to add it in the para position for easier substitution, but the target has it ortho. Hmm. Maybe it's possible.

So, ethoxy is at position 1. Then, the next substituent is tert-butyl in position 2 (ortho). Now, the ring has substituents at 1 and 2.

Now, the next substituent is nitro group at position 3. So, how would that happen?

Wait, after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, we have substituents at 1 and 2. Now, the next step is to add nitro.

At this point, the ring is more substituted, and the directing effects of the existing substituents will determine where the nitro goes.

The ethoxy group (position 1) is an o/p director. The tert-butyl (
