Okay, so I've got this question about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says we're given phase shifts delta_0 to delta_4, and the rest are ignored. The energies involved are 50 MeV electrons scattering elastically from a nuclear target. We need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using partial waves. The general formula is something like f(θ) = sum over l [ (2l + 1) (sin(delta_l) / sin(2k r)) ) * (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ] times some spherical harmonics terms. But wait, for the imaginary part along the beam direction, I think that's when θ is 0 degrees, right? Because that's the direction of the incident beam.

Oh, right! When θ is 0 degrees, the scattering is along the beam, so we can use a different expression. I think the imaginary part of the amplitude f(0) is given by a specific formula involving the phase shifts. Let me try to recall.

I think the formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * sum over l [ (2l + 1) sin(2δ_l) ].

But wait, wait. Or maybe it's the sum of (2l + 1) times sin(delta_l), each multiplied by some factors. Alternatively, another formula I remember is that the total cross-section is 4π times the sum over l of (2l + 1) sin^2(delta_l), but that's for the cross-section, not the amplitude.

Wait, the amplitude's imaginary part. Oh, wait, the optical theorem says that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section. But maybe it's not necessary here. Let me think about the formula.

Another approach: I remember that in the partial wave expansion, each term contributes to the amplitude. The amplitude f(θ) can be written as:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) P_l(cosθ) 

Wait, no, that doesn't look right. Wait, maybe that's the expression for f(θ) in terms of the Legendre polynomials. So, the general term is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1) divided by something.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula. But since I can't, I'll try to reconstruct it.

The amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^{∞} (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) P_l(cosθ)

Wait, no, maybe it's (e^{iδ_l} - 1) multiplied by sin(δ_l) or something else. I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, I remember that the scattering amplitude has a real and imaginary part, and for the imaginary part at θ=0, we can sum over l the (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) terms multiplied by some factors.

Wait, another thought: The imaginary part of f(0) is given by (1/(2k)) sum_{l} (2l + 1) sin(2δ_l). Because when θ is 0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for l=0, and some other values for higher l.

Wait, no, higher l terms have P_l(1) = 1 for all l? Wait, no, P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because the Legendre polynomial of order l evaluated at 1 is 1, regardless of l. So for θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1)=1.

So, the amplitude f(0) would be sum over l of (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1) divided by (2ik), considering the expression from partial waves.

Wait, perhaps f(θ) is given by (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{i(δ_l)} (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ] P_l(cosθ) ?

Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, I think the correct expression is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) [e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1)] P_l(cosθ).

Wait, but when I'm evaluating the imaginary part, which part contributes? Let me take the imaginary part of f(0). So, f(0) will be (1/(2ik)) sum (2l
