Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Here, Pi(+) is at rest. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D, each with two values, probably the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino.

Hmm, wait, neutrinos are tricky because their rest mass is usually considered negligible, especially in particle physics. So I think in this problem, the neutrino's mass can be ignored, and we'll treat it as having zero rest mass. That simplifies things a bit.

Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me recall energy and momentum conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, the neutrino's energy comes from its kinetic energy and rest mass, but since its mass is negligible, its energy is approximately its kinetic energy. The same goes for the muon: its total energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy.

So, let's denote:
- m_π = 139.6 MeV/c² (rest mass of pion)
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c² (rest mass of muon)
- m_nu ≈ 0 (neutrino's rest mass)

Let me denote the energies:
- E_mu = gamma * m_mu c²
- E_nu = K_nu (since m_nu is negligible)
- But wait, since neutrino is a lepton, but in this case, its rest mass is negligible, so E_nu ≈ p_nu c.

And because momentum is conserved, the magnitudes of the momenta of mu and nu are equal. So p_mu = p_nu = p.

So for the muon, total energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )

Similarly, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c (since m_nu c² ≈ 0).

The total energy after decay should equal the initial energy, which is m_π c².

So,

E_mu + E_nu = m_π c²
=> sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c = m_π c²

I can factor out c², but let me divide both sides by c² to simplify units. Let me let E be in MeV, masses in MeV/c², and c=1 in these units.

So the equation becomes:

sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p = m_π

Plugging in the values:
m_pi = 139.6 MeV
m_mu = 105.7 MeV

So:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Let me denote x = p, so:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6

Hmm, solving for x. Let's subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding RHS:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

So, subtract RHS from both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 - [ (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x² ] = 0

Simplify:

x² + A² - (B² - 2 B x + x² ) =0 → A² - B² + 2 B x =0, where A=105.7, B=139.6

So,

(105.7)^2 - (139.6)^2 + 2*139.6 x = 0

Compute (105.7)^2: 105.7 * 105.7 ≈ let me calculate:

100^2 =10000, 5.7^2=32.49, 2*100*5.7=1140 → (105.7)^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 11140.49 + 32.49? Wait, no, 105.7^2= (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

Similarly, (139.6)^2: 139.6 is approximately 140, so 140^2 is 19600. Let's compute exactly: 139.6^2.

= (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2
= 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600-112=19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16.

So,

11172.49 - 19488.16 + 2*139.6 x =0

Compute 11172.49 -19488.16 = -8315.67.

So,

-8315.67 + 279.2 x =0 → 279.2 x =8315.67 → x=8315.67 /279.2 ≈ let's compute.

Let me calculate 8315.67 divided by 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67.

So 30 *279.2=8376. That's 8376-8315.67=60.33 less.

So 30 - (60.33/279.2) → approximately 30 -0.216≈29.784.

So x ≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, wait, x is p, which is in MeV/c units since we divided by c² earlier. So p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Now, the kinetic energy of the muon is total energy minus rest energy.

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Calculate 29.78^2: approx 29^2=841, 0.78^2≈0.6, cross terms 2*29*0.78≈44. So 29.78^2 ≈ 886 (exact calculation: 29.78*29.78. Let's compute:

29 *29=841, 29*0.78=22.62, 0.78*29=22.62, 0.78^2=0.6084. So (a+b)^2 where a=29, b=0.78: a² + 2ab + b² =841 + 2*(22.62) +0.6084 =841 +45.24 +0.6084= 886.8484.

So, p^2 = 886.8484 MeV².

m_mu squared is 105.7^2=11172.49 MeV².

So E_mu = sqrt(886.8484 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.3384) ≈109.81 MeV.

Wait, but the rest energy of muon is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy K_mu is E_mu - m_mu c² =109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

Hmm, looking at the options, option D has 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. Wait, but what about the neutrino's kinetic energy?

The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c ≈29.78 MeV (since in our units, c=1, so E_nu = p ). So K_nu is approximately 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but let me double-check because there's an error in how I computed E_mu. Let me compute E_mu again properly.

E_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt(886.8484 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.3384)= approximately sqrt(12059.34). Hmm, sqrt(12100)=110, so sqrt(12059.34) is slightly less than 110. Let me compute 109.8^2=119. So 109.8^2= (109 +0.8)^2= 109^2 + 2*109*0.8 +0.8^2= 11881 + 174.4 + 0.64=12056. So 109.8^2=12056.04. Our value is 12059.34, which is 3.3 more. So 109.8^2=12056. So 12059.34 is 3.3 more, so the square root is approximately 109.8 + (3.3)/(2*109.8) ≈109.8 + 0.015 ≈109.815 MeV. So E_mu≈109.815 MeV, so K_mu=109.815 -105.7=4.115 MeV, which rounds to about 4.12 MeV.

So the muon's kinetic energy is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's is approximately 29.78 MeV. Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That matches. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. But wait, a pion decay usually produces a muon and an antimuon neutrino, but perhaps here it's a neutrino, but the mass is negligible, so it doesn’t affect the calculation.

Wait, another approach: the Q-value of the reaction is the total energy available, which is the rest mass of the pion. The kinetic energies of the products depend on their masses.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for KE in two-body decay when one particle is at rest.

Another formula I remember is that for a decay A → B + C (where C is massless, like a photon or neutrino), the kinetic energy of B is [ (mA - mB)^2 ] / (2 mA) ) * c^4.

Wait, if that's the case, then K_mu = [ (m_pi - m_mu)^2 ] / (2 m_pi ) ) c^4. Let me compute that.

m_pi =139.6, m_mu=105.7.

So (139.6 -105.7)=33.9 MeV.

Square that: 33.9^2 = 1149.21 (MeV)^2.

Divide by (2 *139.6)=279.2 MeV.

So K_mu =1149.21 / 279.2 ≈4.114 MeV. So about 4.11 MeV. Which matches the earlier calculation.

Then, the neutrino's kinetic energy is the total Q (which is m_pi c²) minus the muon's total energy (E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu ). So E_mu =105.7 +4.11 =109.81 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is 139.6 -109.81=29.79 MeV. So approximately 29.8 MeV, which is as before.

So the KEs are approximately 4.12 and 29.8 MeV, which is option D.


To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\(\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu\)  
Here, the \(\pi^+\) is stationary, and its rest mass is \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\). The rest mass of the muon is \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\), and the neutrino's rest mass is negligible (\(m_{\nu} \approx 0\)).

### Key Conservation Laws:
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy (\(E_{\mu}\)) and the neutrino's energy (\(E_{\nu}\)):  
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi} c^2.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   Since the pion is initially at rest, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

### Expressions for Energies:
- The total energy of the muon is:  
  \[
  E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4},
  \]  
  where \(p\) is the magnitude of the muon's momentum.

- The neutrino's energy is approximately equal to its momentum:  
  \[
  E_{\nu} = p c.
  \]

### Solving for \(p\):
From energy conservation:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4} + p c = m_{\pi} c^2.
\]  
Dividing through by \(c^2\) (setting \(c = 1\) in natural units):  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi}.
\]  
Substituting \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\):  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6.
\]  
Let \(x = p\). Then:  
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - x.
\]  
Squaring both sides:  
\[
x^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x + x^2.
\]  
Canceling \(x^2\):  
\[
11172.49 - 19488.16 + 279.2x = 0.
\]  
\[
-8315.67 + 279.2x = 0.
\]  
Solving for \(x\):  
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]  
Thus, the momentum of the muon and neutrino is \(p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c\).

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon:
The total energy of the muon is:  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]  
Calculating:  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.85 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.34} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The muon's kinetic energy is:  
\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Rounding to two decimal places:  
\[
K_{\mu} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino:
The neutrino's energy is:  
\[
E_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is approximately:  
\[
K_{\nu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. This matches **Option D**.

**Answer: D**
