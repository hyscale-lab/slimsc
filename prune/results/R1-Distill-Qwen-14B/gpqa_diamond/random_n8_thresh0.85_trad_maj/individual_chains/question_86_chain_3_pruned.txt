Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says that a chemist did two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds. Each reaction produced (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. So, the products are enantiomers of each other. The task is to determine what the starting materials, A and B, are from the given options.

Hmm, so I need to figure out the starting materials for both reactions. The reducing agents used are different: one is LiBH4 and H+, and the other is BH3 and H+. I remember that LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think. Oh right, BH3 is a milder reducing agent, often used under specific conditions, maybe in THF or something, while LiBH4 is stronger and can reduce more things, like esters or amides maybe. But wait, in this problem, both reactions produce ketones (the product is a pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ketone). So perhaps the starting materials are carbonyl compounds themselves, like esters or something similar.

Wait, but let me think about the reactions. Both reactions are reductions, but the products are enantiomers. Oh, wait no, the products are different enantiomers. So the starting materials must be something that would lead to these products upon reduction, but with different configurations.

Wait, let me think about the mechanism of these reductions. When a ketone is reduced, I'm not sure that's the case here. Wait, no, the product is a cyclic ketone. So the starting material is perhaps a cyclic ester, like a lactone or something that upon reduction forms a ketone.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a gamma or delta lactone. If you have a lactone, reducing it would open the ring. Wait, but wait, LiBH4 typically reduces esters. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic acids or something else.

Wait, looking at the product structure, it's 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the pyran ring is six-membered, with the ketone at position 2
