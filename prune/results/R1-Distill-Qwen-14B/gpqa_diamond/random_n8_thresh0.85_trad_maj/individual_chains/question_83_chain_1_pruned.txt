Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so they should react completely. 

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, so first, let me figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. Dilution usually follows the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So the initial concentration before dilution is 0.05 M, volume is 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So M2 would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let's calculate that.

0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the concentration of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO-Na+ + H2O. So the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

But wait, let me calculate the moles first. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). So 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

The NaOH solution is 0.1 M. Let's find the volume needed at equivalence. Moles of NaOH = 0.001, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question talks about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no, the 25% might refer to the percentage of the acid that's been neutralized. Because the titration would involve adding a certain amount of base relative to the acid present. Let me double-check. So if the equivalence point requires 10 cm³ of NaOH, then 25% would be 2.5 cm³ added.

So for the 25% titration point, how much NaOH has been added? 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 * (0.0025 L) = 0.00025 moles. 

Since the reaction is 1:1, this means 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have been neutralized, and 0.00025 moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) have been formed. 

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001. After neutralization, moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume of the solution at this point includes the initial solution plus the added NaOH. The initial solution was 40 cm³ (after dilution). Adding 2.5 cm³ NaOH makes total volume 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). 

So the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Since this is a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)). Let's compute that. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 x10^-5, so pKa is around 4.73 (since 1e-5 is pH 5, and 1.85 is closer to 1.8, which would make pKa around 4.74, but wait, let me calculate more accurately. 

Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.7328, so about 4.73.

So plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me compute that ratio. 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333, which is 1/3. The log of 1/3 is about -0.477. So pH is 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. So approximately 4.25.

Now, checking the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which seems close to this. Option D has 4.57, which is higher, so perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, let me recalculate the concentrations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the dilution. Let me go back.

Original 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid: moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, making total 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

At 25% titration: the amount of NaOH added is 25% of equivalence. The equivalence volume is (moles of acetic acid) / (concentration of NaOH) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. So 25% is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So yes, neutralizes 0.00025 moles of acetic acid. So same as before.

Wait another thing: the total volume when 2.5 cm³ is added to the 40 cm³ solution is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). So the [HA] is (0.001 - 0.00025) / 0.0425 = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M, and [A^-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

The ratio is 0.005882/0.017647 = 1/3, so log(1/3) is -0.477.
