Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's break this down.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, what does that mean exactly? I think it's about the excitation energy or maybe the number of atoms in that energy level. Oh right, in thermal equilibrium (LTE), the population of energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is given by (n_i / n_j) = exp(-(E_i - E_j)/(k T)). Here, E is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote the two levels as level i and level j, where i is the higher energy level. So, the number of atoms in level i compared to level j is n_i / n_j = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but the question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait—excited state population is higher when the temperature is higher, right? Because higher temperatures make it easier to excite atoms.

So, if star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited, that probably means the ratio n1_i / n1_j is twice the ratio n2_i / n2_j. Or maybe the excitation in star_1 is higher, so the population in the excited state is higher. So n1_i / n_j is higher than n2_i /n2_j.

Wait, actually, let's think more carefully. Let’s define the excitation as the population in the higher energy level. So, for star_1, the ratio (n_i / n_j) is twice that of star_2. So:

(n_i / n_j)_1 = 2 * (n_i / n_j)_2

But according to the Boltzmann equation, each of these ratios is exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Wait, that would be if star_1 has higher excitation. But wait, let me think again. The higher the temperature, the more the population in the higher energy level. Let me clarify.

The excitation here refers to the higher energy state. So if star_1 has more atoms in the higher energy level, then (n_i / n_j) is larger for star_1.

So, (n_i / n_j)_1 = 2 * (n_i /n_j)_2

But according to Boltzmann,

(n_i / n_j) = exp( -ΔE / (k T) )

Wait, no, wait. Wait, E_i is the higher energy level. So ΔE = E_i - E_j.

So, the population in the higher level is n_i = n_j * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Therefore, the ratio (n_i / n_j) is exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, but wait, actually, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), which is less than 1. So when T increases, exp(-x) increases, because x is smaller. So higher T means higher (n_i / n_j) ratio.

So, for star_1, (n_i/n_j)_1 = 2 * (n_i/n_j)_2

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me write that down. Let me take natural logs on both sides to simplify.

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Rearranging:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let's compute 1/(T2) -1/(T1) = [T1 - T2]/(T1 T2)

So,

ΔE/(k) * [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

So,

ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) ) * (T1 - T2) ) ] / (T1 T2 )

Hmm, but the options don't have delta E in them, but perhaps it's a proportionality. Since the question is about the equation, I think the delta E might not factor into the options because it's given. But in the equation, the ratio would involve (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by some constants.

Wait, looking at the options, all the options have ln(2) equal to something involving T1 and T2. So let's see, the equation we derived is:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) ) ] / (T1 T2 )

But in the options, the equations don't include ΔE or k. So perhaps we can solve for the ratio, but I think the question is more about the structure of the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original setup was that the number of atoms in the higher level is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So:

n_i1 = 2 n_i2

But according to Boltzmann,

n_i = n_j exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming that the lower level population (n_j) is the same for both stars? Wait, no, the stars might have different total populations, but in the photosphere, it's about the local conditions.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the ratio is (n_i / n_j)1 = 2 (n_i /n_j)_2.

So, as earlier.

So, the equation leads to ln(2) = [ (ΔE /k ) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]

Which can be written as ln(2) = [ (ΔE/k) (T1 - T2) ) ] / (T1 T2 )

But looking at the options, the equation structure might match one of them.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So that's similar to the structure without the ΔE and k factors.

But our equation has (ΔE/(k)) multiplied by (T1-T2)/(T1 T2), equals ln(2). So without knowing the values of ΔE and k, the equation would involve those terms. But the options don't have those, so perhaps the problem is assuming that the excitation ratio is given, and the equation is about T1 and T2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the excitation is given as twice as excited in star_1. So the ratio is 2.

So, the equation derived earlier is ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But since the options don't include any constants (like delta E or k), perhaps the form of the equation is that the left side is ln(2), and the right is a function of T1 and T2.

But looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is exactly the structure of our equation without the (ΔE/k) factor. But since the question is about the correct equation form given the information, perhaps the correct equation is option D. But I'm not sure because the actual equation would also involve (ΔE/k), but in the problem, perhaps they are considering a ratio where that term is accounted for.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me check.

Wait, if star_1 has twice the excitation of star_2, that means (n_i/n_j)_1 = 2*(n_i/n_j)_2.

Which gives exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Taking natural log: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/k:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which is:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So, ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But without knowing ΔE or k, this is as far as we can go. The problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J, which is approximately k_B * 1 eV or something, but perhaps not relevant here.

But looking at the options, only option D has this structure, except without the ΔE/k factor. So perhaps the equation presented in the options assumes that the product (ΔE/k) is 1. But I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking which form the equation takes, regardless of the constants.

So, the equation we have is ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] * (ΔE/k )

But from the options, the only one that fits the form (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) is option D. So, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But wait, the options don't have the ΔE and k terms. So perhaps the problem is considering that the ratio of the populations is 2, which when you take the equation, leads to the form in option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the excitation temperatures. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The excitation (the ratio) is given by (n_i/n_j) = exp( - h c / (lambda k T) ) or something, but in this case, it's given as a delta E.

But regardless, the key is that the equation we derived is ln(2) = [ (ΔE/k) (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So if we factor out (ΔE/k), but the options don't have that, perhaps the correct equation is option D, but scaled by (ΔE/k). But since the options don't include the constants, option D must be the correct form.


The problem involves determining the correct equation for the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key information is that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as high as in star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), the Boltzmann distribution governs the population of energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation states:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( n_i \) and \( n_j \) are the populations of the higher and lower energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratio is given as:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j}_1 = 2 \cdot \frac{n_i}{n_j}_2.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring the temperature terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The problem asks for the correct equation structure, and the options do not include \( \Delta E \) or \( k \). Thus, the equation simplifies to the form:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches **Option D**. The other options are inconsistent with the derived equation. For example:

- **Option A** and **Option B** do not involve the correct temperature dependence.
- **Option C** incorrectly includes a squared term in the denominator, which is not present in the derived equation.

Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures is given by **Option D**.

Answer: D
