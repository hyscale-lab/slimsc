Okay, so I've got this problem here about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I need to figure out the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constants and the overall structure of the interaction terms.

The Lagrangian given is ℒ_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Let me break this down.

First, I should probably figure out the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian because the Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions. Since the Lagrangian is an integral over four dimensions, each term in it must have dimension 4 to keep the action dimensionless (since the integral is [mass]^4, each term is [mass]^4 to balance it).

So, let's look at the term κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Each part contributes to the overall dimension. I know that the Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2 because in four dimensions, the Dirac equation is first order in derivatives, so each ψ should have dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ and ψ each have dimension 3/2.

Next up is σ_{μν}. σ is defined in terms of the gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, so [σ_{μν}] = 0? Or wait, maybe I should think about the structure. Since σ is made of commutators of γ matrices, and γ's are dimensionless, σ itself is dimensionless. So [σ] = 0.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor of the electromagnetic field, I think. The field strength tensor F is made from the derivatives of the gauge field A, so F ~ ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1, because it's like a vector potential which is a 1-form. So each derivative ∂ brings a dimension of mass. So F would have dimension [∂][A] = 1 + 1 = 2. So [F^{μν}] = 2.

Putting it all together, the term κψ̄ σ ψ F: Let's multiply the dimensions.

Each ψ has 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2, and ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ψ would be 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Then σ is 0, so ψ̄ σ ψ is still 3. Then F is 2, so 3 + 2 = 5. So the term κψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension [κ] +5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the term in the Lagrangian is κ multiplied by all those fields. So the entire term must have dimension 4. So [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2. Let me calculate that: 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus F's 2 is 5. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, for renormalizability. I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≤ the spacetime dimension minus 2. Wait, no, I think the condition is that each coupling has dimension ≤ D-2, where D is the spacetime dimensions. Since we're in four dimensions, D=4, so couplings must have dimension ≤ 2 (4-2=2). Let me confirm: For a renormalizable interaction term, the coupling must have mass dimension ≤ 4 - (sum of the fields' dimensions) for the term to be renormalizable. Alternatively, the interaction term in the Lagrangian must have dimension ≤4.

Wait, no, more accurately, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. For a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have mass dimension ≥ (4 - (sum of fields' dimensions)).

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the superficial degree of divergence. The superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = d - (sum of the dimensions of each term in the interaction). For a term to be renormalizable, D must be ≥ 0.

But another approach is to think about the possible divergences. To have a renormalizable theory, all the terms in the Lagrangian must have dimension ≤4
