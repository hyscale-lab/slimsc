Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question is about a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a different formula.

Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that when dealing with light moving through a medium and the medium is moving relative to an observer, you have to consider the effects of both the medium's motion and the light's speed within that medium. 

Wait, I think this involves the concept of relative velocity. Like, the speed of light in the medium isn't just c/n because the medium is moving. Maybe I need to apply the velocity addition formulas from special relativity? Or is it just a matter of vector addition?

Wait, but wait. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving towards the observer. Let me break it down.

First, the speed of light in the glass is c/n. That's a standard formula. So in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. But the glass is moving in the lab frame. So how does that affect the speed of the light as observed in the lab?

Wait a second, I'm getting a bit confused. The glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving, and the light is moving through it. So the speed of the light in the lab frame would be the speed of the light in the glass's frame plus the speed of the glass, right?

Wait, no, that's only in the case of non-relativistic speeds. Because we're talking about light, which is moving at a significant fraction of c, maybe relativistic effects come into play. Oh wait, but the index of refraction n is a factor hereâ€”so maybe the glass's movement affects the observed speed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about it from the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at c/n relative to the glass. So what would the lab observer see?

Wait, in the glass's rest frame, the
