Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I've studied some acid-base chemistry before, so maybe I can figure this out.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We're supposed to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Alright, first, I think I need to find the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. Let me recall the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is M1V1 / V2.

Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³ and the concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So:

M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1) /40 = 0.025 M? Because 0.05 *20 is 1 mmol? Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, so 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Oh wait, no: 0.05 M is 0.05 moles per liter. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles of acetic acid. Then, after adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Right, that's correct.

So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, for the titration. We're titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. So I need to find the volume of NaOH added when 25% of the equivalence point is reached, and also the pH at equivalence.

Let me think about the equivalence point first. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid present. So, moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Because 0.025 * 0.04 is 0.001. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the first part is at 25% titration. So that's when 25% of the required NaOH volume has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but actually, I need to think about what's happening during the titration. Acetic acid is a weak acid reacting with NaOH, a strong base. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of acetic acid reacted would be a quarter of 0.001, which is 0.00025 mol. 

Wait, but wait. Let's calculate it properly. The initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of acetic acid has reacted.

So, the reaction consumes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid and produces 0.00025 mol of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

So after reaction, the moles of acetic acid remaining are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate are 0.00025 mol.

But wait, what's the volume at this point? The original solution was 40 cm³ (20+20). Then, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, this is a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that.

Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647 )

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.256, which is approximately 4.26. Hmm, that's close to option A's first value (4.26), but let me think.

Wait, but wait, I might have made a mistake in the concentrations. Let me double-check.

Wait, the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). So [CH3COOH] is 0.00075 / 0.0425.

Let me compute 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. Correct.

[CH3COO^-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. Correct.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 → 0.3333. So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.

So pH is 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. Rounded to two decimal places, 4.26. So that's the first pH value.

Now, for the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The solution at equivalence is 0.04 L (40 cm³) plus 10 cm³ (from 10 cm³ of NaOH) → total volume 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

The moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) produced are 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

So, the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Hmm, that's a very small Kb, so the hydrolysis will produce a small amount of OH^- ions. Let's set up the expression.

Let me denote the concentration of OH^- as x. Then:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small, so:

x² / 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10 → x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → x² ≈ 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) is about 0.017, so pOH is ~4.983. So pH is 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017. Wait, that's about 9.02, but none of the options have that. Hmm, that can't be right. Am I making a mistake here?

Wait, maybe I should think again. Let's recalculate Kb.

Wait, Kb = Kw / Ka → 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10, which is correct. So the Kb is about 5.4e-10.

The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis equation:

CH3COO^- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH^-

So the equilibrium expression is:

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since x is very small.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.983 → pH = 14-4.983 = 9.017.

But looking at the options, none of them have a pH above 8 at equivalence. Wait, what's going on? Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the stoichiometry. Let me check again.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. The solution is 0.001 mol of acetate in 50 cm³. So 0.02 M, correct.

Wait, but wait, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So acetate in water will hydrolyze to produce OH^- ions, making the solution basic. So the pH should be higher than 7. But none of the options have the equivalence pH higher than 8 except option D is 6.92 and option A is 8.52. Wait, option A's equivalence is 8.52. Hmm,
