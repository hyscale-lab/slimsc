Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm. I remember that [X/Fe] notation is used to express the abundance of element X relative to iron, and [X/H] is relative to hydrogen. 

First, let's jot down the given data. Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, and [Fe/H]_1 = 0. Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, so log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the formula is 12 + log10(n_X / n_H) = ... So for the Sun, the log(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Wait, wait, no, no, the equation is 12 plus log equals 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg, it's 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7. So log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5, so nMg/nH is 10^-5.

Wait, but I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So I need [Si/Star_1] / [Si/Star_2], or (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) multiplied by (nH2/nH1), perhaps? Or wait, maybe I should find nSi1/nSi2.

Wait, but let me think. Let's break down each star.

For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]1 = 0. That means [Fe/H] is 0, which implies that the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. So if [Fe/H]1 is 0, then log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun /nH_sun). So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe]1 = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3. So log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3. So nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

Wait, but nFe1/nH1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) as [Fe/H]1=0. So nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, nSi1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) *10^0.3 * nFe1. Substituting nFe1:

nSi1 = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) *10^0.3 * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH1 )

Wait, the nFe_sun and nH_sun terms would cancel out. So nSi1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) *10^0.3 * nH1.

Wait, but nSi_sun /nH_sun is the solar value, so 12 + log(nSi/nH)_sun. Wait, no, I don't think the solar Si/H is given. Hmm, the problem only gives us Fe and Mg for the Sun. So maybe I need to find the solar Si/H ratio in terms of the given Fe and Mg data.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express all elements in terms of Fe and H.

Wait, another approach
