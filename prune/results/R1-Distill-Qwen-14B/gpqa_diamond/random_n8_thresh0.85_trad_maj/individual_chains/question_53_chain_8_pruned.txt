Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct formula based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me think through this step by step.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that's a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which makes sense. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), and IR peaks around 1730-1760 cm⁻¹ usually indicate esters.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let me break them down.

1. Two signals for aromatic protons.
2. Two signals for vinyl protons: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets.
3. Two signals from methyl groups (-CH3). No signals for -CH2, so no methylene groups.

Hmm, di-substituted benzene rings can have different substitution patterns. The number of aromatic proton signals depends on the substituents' positions. For a 1,2-disubstitution, you usually get two sets of protons, maybe each as a doublet. Wait, but in this case, there are two signals, so maybe the substituents are para or meta? Wait, no. Let's think again.

Wait, a di-substituted benzene can have ortho, meta, or para substitution. If it's para, you'd typically have two distinct sets of aromatic protons, each as a doublet, I think. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the two substituents are opposite each other, so the ring has two equivalent sets of H—so two signals each for the adjacent H's. So that would result in two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating for two protons each. That fits the first part.

Now, the other substituent—wait, because there are two substituents. So for the benzene ring, let's say it's a di-substituted with two different groups. Because if they were the same, the substitution pattern might lead to fewer signals.

Wait, the substituents could be an ester group and another group. Oh, because the IR says ester, so one substituent is an ester group, -O-CO-O-R? Or wait, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So the substituent on the benzene could be an ester group, like O-CO-O-R or something else. Wait, no, more likely, the substituent would be an ester group such as O-CO-OR, but perhaps it's more like an alkoxy group connected to a carbonyl, like a COOR group.

Wait, maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group or something else. Let me think.

Wait, in the NMR, there are two methyl groups. So each substituent could have a methyl group. Or perhaps one substituent has two methyl groups, but that's not matching with the signals.

Wait, the two signals for methyl groups probably mean two different methyl groups. So maybe each substituent brings a methyl, or perhaps one substituent has a methyl and another substituent has another methyl.

Wait, but the substituents are attached to the benzene ring. Let's think about possible substituents.

One substituent is an ester group. Let's say it's, for example, -O-CO-O-R. But that would bring in more oxygens. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group like -COOCH3, which is a methyl ester. So that would be an acetyloxy group attached to the ring.

Wait, so if one substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-OCH3, or perhaps a propionyl group, but maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group. Because in the NMR, there are two vinyl protons. Wait, the vinyl Hs are the ones attached to a double bond. So maybe one substituent is a vinyl group.

Wait, but the problem says the compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring, so two substituents on the benzene ring. So, possibilities:

One substituent is
