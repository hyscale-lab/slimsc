Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the probabilities of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Alright, let's read it carefully.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis. Since the state is proportional, I guess I'll need to normalize it first. That means finding the normalization factor so that the sum of the squared magnitudes equals 1.

So, let's compute the coefficients. The first coefficient is (1+i), and the second is (2-i). The square of the magnitude of (1+i) is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. For (2-i), it's (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1 =5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the operator in question has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down states. So, the matrix looks like this:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

This matrix is actually proportional to the Pauli X matrix. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) times that. So, the eigenstates of A would be the same as those of Pauli X, which are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates for the spin in the x-direction.

Wait, no, let me think. Actually, the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are |+x> and |-x>, yes. So, for our operator A, the eigenstates are the same because A is proportional to X. So, the eigenstates of A would be (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because those are the eigenstates when you have the X operator.

But wait, the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator A. So, to find these probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Let me denote the eigenstates of A as |a1> and |a2>, where |a1> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |a2> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So, I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |a1> and |a2>, and the coefficients' squared magnitudes will give the probabilities.

First, let's express |alpha> in terms of |a1> and |a2>. So, let me write |alpha> as c1 |a1> + c2 |a2>. To find c1 and c2, I can take the inner products of |alpha> with |a1> and |a2>.

So, c1 = <a1|alpha>, and c2 = <a2|alpha>.

Let me compute c1 first. The inner product <a1|alpha> is [ <up| + <down| ]/(sqrt(2)) multiplied by [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ].

Wait, no. When you take the inner product, you have to compute each component. Let's expand it.

Breaking it down: <a1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> + <down|alpha> ]

But wait, no. Wait, |a1> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So, the bra vector is <a1| = ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So, <a1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> + <down|alpha> ]

Similarly, <up|alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7), and <down|alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So, plugging in:

c1 = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]
= (1/sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]
= (1/sqrt(14)) [ 3 + 0i ]
= 3/sqrt(14)

Similarly, c2 = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, because <a2| is ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2). So,

c2 = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> - <down|alpha> ]
= (1/sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]
= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i -2 +i) ]
= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (-1 + 2i) ]

So, c1 is 3/sqrt(14), and c2 is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

Calculating |c1|^2: (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

And |c2|^2: [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) ] squared. Let's compute the numerator: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + 2*(-1)(2)(i) wait no, wait, when you have a complex number a + bi, the magnitude squared is a^2 + b^2.

So, (-1 + 2i) has a magnitude squared of (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So, |c2|^2 is 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571. So, the probabilities are 9/14 and5/14. But wait, 9+5=14, so that's correct.

But looking at the options, the probabilities are given as 0.64, 0.36 in option A, 0.54,0.46 in B, 0.28,0.72 in C, and 0.61,0.29 in D.

Hmm, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36. So option A has 0.64 and 0.36 as probabilities. So that's a possible match.

But wait, wait a moment. Let me double-check my calculation for c1 and c2. Because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, in the expression for c1: (1+i) + (2 -i) is 3, yes. So c1 is 3/sqrt(14). So |c1|^2 is 9/14, which is approximately 0.6428.

c2: (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) +2i. The magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2=1+4=5. So |c2|^2 is5/14≈0.357, which would round to 0.36.

So, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but what about the average value of the operator? The operator A's average is <alpha|A|alpha>. So, perhaps I should calculate that as well.

The operator A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So, A = (hbar/2) * (|up><down| + |down><up| )

So, <A> = (hbar/2) <alpha| (|up><down| + |down><up| ) |alpha>

Since |alpha> is a spin-1/2 state, we can compute this.

Alternatively, since A is diagonal in the eigenbasis of X, and |alpha> can be written as a combination of |a1> and |a2>, we can compute <A> as the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities.

Wait, because A has eigenvalues when applied to |a1> and |a2>. Let me think. The operator A is (hbar/2) * X, so the eigenvalues of A are (hbar/2) * 1 and (hbar/2) * (-1). Because the eigenvalues of X are 1 and -1.

So, the average <A> is sum (eigenvalue * probability), which would be (hbar/2)(1 * P_a1 + (-1) * P_a2 )

Since P_a1 is 9/14, and P_a2 is5/14.

So, <A> = (hbar/2) [ (9/14) *1 + (5/14)*(-1) ] = (hbar/2) [ (9 -5)/14 ] = (hbar/2)(4/14) = (hbar/2)(2/7) )= hbar/(7).

Wait, so the average is hbar/7. So, looking back at the options, option A says average is hbar/7, which matches.

Wait, but option D has average 2hbar/sqrt(7), which is about 0.755 hbar. Hmm, but according to this, it's hbar/7, about 0.1428 hbar.

Wait, let me recompute the average value another way to make sure.

Alternatively, compute <A> directly. Since A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], the matrix is 2x2. The state |alpha> is ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) )^T.

So, <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Let me compute this. First, the vector for |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

So, the bra vector is the conjugate transpose: [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

Multiplying A with |alpha> gives:

A|alpha> = [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the dot product of the bra with A|alpha>.

So, compute:

[ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

So, each component:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) * hbar/(2 *7)
Second term: (2+i)(1 +i) * hbar/(2 *7)

Let me compute each term.

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 2 -i - 2i + i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2(1) + 2i +i(1) +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 =1 +3i.

So, adding them together:

(1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

Multiply by hbar/(2 *7) → 2 * hbar/(14) = hbar/7.

So, the average is hbar/7. So, that matches what I got earlier.

So, the probabilities are 9/14 and5/14, about 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that would be the correct option.

But wait, let me re-examine the options again.

Option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar /7. So that's what we have.

Wait, but looking at the other options: option D has average 2hbar/sqrt(7). That's about 2*1.732/2.645, which is roughly 1.27 / 2.645? Wait, no, wait. Wait, sqrt(7) is about 2.6458. So 2/sqrt(7) is about 0.755, but that's not matching our result.

So, the correct answer must be option A. But wait, I'm looking at the options again.

Wait, the question says the operator A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So, the diagonal elements are zero, and off-diagonal are hbar/2. So that matrix is correct for A.

Wait, another thought, perhaps I confused the eigenstates. Let's make sure that |a1> and |a2> are indeed the eigenstates of A.

The operator A has matrix [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation: det(A - λI) = 0.

So,

| -λ    hbar/2 |
| hbar/2  -λ    | = 0

Which gives λ^2 - (hbar^2 /4) =0 → λ= ± hbar/2.

So, the eigenvalues are ± hbar/2. So, the eigenstates are indeed the same as for the Pauli X matrix, which is correct.

Therefore, the average should be (hbar/2)(9/14 -5/14) )= (hbar/2)(4/14) ) = hbar/7.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the answer is option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7.


The problem involves determining the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of an operator \( A \) and calculating the average value of \( A \). The state of the electron is given as proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are orthonormal eigenstates of the \( z \)-component of the spin operator. The operator \( A \) has a matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise, which corresponds to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix.

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
- \( |1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \),
- \( |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \).

The total squared magnitude is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalization factor is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \). The normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) is proportional to the Pauli \( x \)-matrix, so its eigenstates are:
\[
|a_1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |a_2\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), corresponding to \( |a_1\rangle \) and \( |a_2\rangle \), respectively.

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |a_1\rangle \) and \( |a_2\rangle \)
To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |a_1\rangle \) and \( |a_2\rangle \), express \( |\alpha\rangle \) as a linear combination:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_1 |a_1\rangle + c_2 |a_2\rangle,
\]
where \( c_1 = \langle a_1|\alpha\rangle \) and \( c_2 = \langle a_2|\alpha\rangle \). Compute the inner products:
\[
c_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle + \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle \right),
\]
\[
c_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle - \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle \right).
\]
Substitute \( \langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \):
\[
c_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} (3) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} (-1 + 2i).
\]
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes:
\[
|c_1|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6428, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha| A |\alpha\rangle.
\]
Using the matrix representation of \( A \), compute:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |a_1\rangle \) and \( |a_2\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These match the values in **Option A**.
