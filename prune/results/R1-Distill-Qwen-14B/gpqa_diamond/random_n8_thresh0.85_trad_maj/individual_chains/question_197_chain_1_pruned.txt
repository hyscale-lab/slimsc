Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of Compound X based on the given spectral data. Then, I have to determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks in the range of 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ probably indicate an -OH group or maybe an alkyne or an amine. But wait, the other peaks are at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm⁻¹. The 1720 is a strong carbonyl peak, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 peaks are around the region for aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe there's a benzene ring involved.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first one is at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, so I'm thinking it's an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, and they're usually broad because they're exchangeable. But wait, another possibility is an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Then, there are two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm. Each integrates for 2H. Those look like aromatic protons. Since they're doublets, it suggests that each set is part of a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, you have two doublets for the protons ortho and para to the substituent. Wait, actually, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are as two doublets: the two ortho to the substituent would be a doublet each, and the para would be another. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, if it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, maybe something like two substituents across from each other. Or perhaps it's a single substituent, making the ring para-disubstituted. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substitution, but that usually gives other coupling patterns.

Looking further, the NMR continues with a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H), then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 3H is probably a methyl group attached to something that's next to a CH2, like a ethyl chain. The d at 1.4 ppm (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps as in a CH(CH3) group. The multiplet at 2.9 ppm is probably a CH group adjacent to something else, maybe a carbonyl.

Putting this together. Let's think about the structure. The 10.5 ppm peak suggests a carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons are para-substituted. So perhaps the compound is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carboxylic acid group and some alkyl chain.

Wait, alternatively, the substituent could be a ketone. But the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, which we have. Wait, but carboxylic acids also have a broad peak around 2500-3000 as well, which the IR shows in the 3400-2500 range. So that supports the idea of a carboxylic acid group.

So maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid substituent and another substituent which is an alkyl chain.

Looking at the NMR, the integration: 1H for the OH, 2H each for two sets of aromatic protons, so that's four aromatic protons in total. Wait, so a benzene ring has six protons, but if it's para-substituted, perhaps with two substituents, each taking up two positions. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a ketone. Let me think. If the benzene ring has a substituent that's a carbonyl group, like a ketone. But the IR shows a peak at 1720, which could be a ketone. But wait, the NMR doesn't show any strong signals in the regions typical for ketone protons. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or an acid.

Wait, let's try to sketch this. The benzene ring has a substituent that is a carboxylic acid. So, the structure is something like benzene with a -COOH group attached. Then, another substituent which is an alkyl chain. The alkyl chain could be attached in a position adjacent or para to the COOH group.

Looking at the NMR signals. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2. The 8.0 ppm is a doublet integrating for 2H, and 7.2 is another doublet for 2H. That suggests that the substituents are para to each other. So, a para-substituted benzene with two substituents: one is a COOH group, and the other is another group, maybe an alkyl chain.

Wait, but the substituent that's an alkyl chain might not be attached directly. Wait, looking at the other NMR signals, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to a carbonyl group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is probably two adjacent CH2 groups, like a -CH2-CH2-CH- group. Wait, but perhaps it's a branching, like a butyl group.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. So maybe the structure is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2... or something along those lines. Let me think about how all this could fit.

Putting it all together, perhaps the structure is (4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid? Let me check.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. If the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 4 and an ethyl group perhaps at position 1. Wait, but the substituents are para, meaning positions 1 and 4.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-ethylphenylpropanoic acid. Alternatively, considering the NMR data.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH in the middle of a chain. For example, if the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH2- group attached to the benzene, but that would be a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group attached.

Wait, another thought: the substituent might be a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group or something like that. Let me think about the NMR signals again.

The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a typical ethyl group. So maybe it's a CH2CH3 at the end of a chain. The triplet suggests it's attached to a CH2, which is next to a CH group that's split into a quartet, but I don't see a quartet here. Alternatively, the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be a CH2 next to a CH, which is at 2.9 ppm (m,1H). So perhaps it's a propyl group, like CH2CH2CH3, but with branching.

Wait, let me think about the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): -COOH proton.
- 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H): para-substituted benzene. So the substituents are probably at positions 1 and 4.
- Then, the other signals are a CH (2.9), two CH2 (1.7 m), a CH3 (1.4 d), and a CH2CH3 (0.9 t).

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, but that doesn't quite match. Wait, maybe it's a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene. Wait, a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, the substituent would be a -CH2CH(CH2CH3), but let me see the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group. Wait, no, that would give a different set of protons.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a
