Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, it's been a while since I studied this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass of 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But wait, the question is about their photospheric composition regarding silicon atoms. So I don't think the mass plays a direct role here; maybe it's just extra information.

The given data includes some abundance ratios determined using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. But I'm more focused on the [X/Y] notations here. Those are logarithmic abundance ratios relative to another element. Oh right, [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, no, the definition is [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Yeah, that's right.

Let me jot down the given values:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- Similarly, log10(nMg/nH)_sun = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, no. Wait, the way the Sun's composition is given is a bit different. Let me parse that correctly. The question says: "12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5" which implies that log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH for the Sun is 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. Similarly for Mg, log10(nMg/nH)_sun = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5.

I think I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, which is [n_Si_1 / n_Si_2] or something like that? Wait, no. Wait, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2). Because the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So Star_1's Si divided by Star_2's Si.

Wait, but to get that, I might need to figure out how much Si is in each star relative to hydrogen, and then take the ratio.

Let's break down each star.

Starting with Star_1:

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0
