Okay, so I have this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question is about the Lagrangian L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is given as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. The options are A, B, C, D with different combinations.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a coupling constant determines whether the theory is renormalizable. If the dimension is positive, the theory might be non-renormalizable, I think. Or wait, is it the opposite? Let me think. Oh right, a renormalizable theory has couplings with non-positive mass dimension. Or wait, renormalizable theories have couplings with mass dimension less than or equal to 4, but since the coupling is dimensionful in 4D spacetime, maybe it's about the dimension in terms of mass.

Wait, I should probably start by recalling how to find the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (since it's integrated over spacetime, which has dimension 4 in 4D spacetime, [L] = [Mass]^4).

Each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So for L_int, the term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's find the dimensions of each component.

First, ψ is a Dirac spinor. The Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D, the action is dimensionless, and the kinetic term is ∫ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ d^4x. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, so each ψ must have dimension 3/2 because (3/2) + (3/2) + 1 (from the derivative) = 4, which is the dimension of the action.

Next, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. So each γ matrix is dimensionless, right? Because they are just matrices. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless as well.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for the electromagnetic field (I think), which is like the derivative of the gauge field. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1. Because F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so each derivative is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1, so F is dimension 2.

So putting it all together, let's write the dimensions of each part in L_int.

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ is 3/2, σ_{μν} is 0, F^{μν} is 2. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions:

(3/2) + (3/2) + 0 + 2 = 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. Wait, but the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the entire term is κ multiplied by that, so [κ][ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 4.

So [κ] [5] = 4. Therefore, [κ] must be 4 -5 = -1. Oh wait no, because [κ] multiplied by the product dimension equals 4. So [κ] * 5 = 4 → [κ] = 4/5? That can't be right because 4/5 is not an integer. Wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me check each part again. ψ is a spinor, dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ is also 3/2. σ is dimensionless, so it doesn't contribute. F^{μν} is field strength. Let me think: F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Each A is dimension 1, each derivative is dimension 1. So F has dimension 2, yes.

So L_int is κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. So the product is [ψ̄] [σ] [F] [ψ] = (3/2) * (0) * 2 * (3/2) = (3/2)*(3/2) is 9/4, multiplied by 2 is 9/4 *2= 9/2. Then κ multiplied by 9/2 must equal 4 for the Lagrangian to have dimension 4.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because 9/2 is 4.5, and 4.5 × something equals 4. That's not possible. Because that would require [κ] to be 4 / (9/2) ) = 8/9, which is about 0.888. But the options are in integer. Hmm, did I do something wrong?

Wait, no. Maybe I messed up the dimensions. Let me think again. The Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So the term is κ times (ψ̄)(σ_{μν})(ψ)(F^{μν}).

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2. σ is dimensionless. F is dimension 2.

So the product of the fields is (3/2) * (3/2) * (2) ) = (9/4) * 2 = 9/2, which is 4.5. So κ times 4.5 must equal dimension 4.

So [κ] = 4 / (4.5) ) = 8/9. But the options don't have that. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the product.

Wait, no, wait. The term is ψ̄ σ ψ F, which is (3/2) + (3/2) + 0 + 2 = 3 + 2 =5. So the product has dimension 5. So [κ] *5 =4 → [κ] = -1. Oh wait, because [Lagrangian] is dimension 4, so [κ] times [the product] must equal 4. The product is dimension 5, so [κ] is 4 /5? Wait, no, because [κ] is a coupling; it's a dimensionless parameter? No, not necessarily. In the Lagrangian, the coupling could have a dimension because you have different kinds of terms.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up terms. Let me think about the general way to compute the dimension. The Lagrangian has to have dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

The term in question is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

So each field in the term contributes:

ψ̄ → 3/2

σ_{μν} → dimensionless (since it's made from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, and commutators)

ψ → 3/2

F^{μν} → 2

So the product is (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 + (dimensionless) = 3 +2 =5.

So the term is κ * (dimension 5). The Lagrangian term must be dimension 4. So [κ] must be [Mass]^(-1), because (Mass^{-1}) * 5 =4 → no, wait, [κ] *5 =4 → [κ]= 4/5. But 4/5 is not one of the options. The options say -1 or 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dimensions somewhere. Let me double-check each component.

ψ: yes, 3/2.

F^{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. Each A has dimension 1, each ∂ has dimension 1, so F has dimension (1+1) =2. Correct.

σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, so σ is dimensionless.

So yes, the product is (3/2 +3/2 +2) =5. So κ must have [κ] =4-5= -1. Because the Lagrangian term is [κ] + [fields] =4. So [κ] =4 -5= -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling. In 4 dimensions, a coupling is renormalizable if its dimension is ≤ 4. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in 4D, the mass dimension of a coupling constant is given by [g] =4 - [operators], where [operators] is the sum of the dimensions of the fields in the term, and for the term to be renormalizable, the coupling must have a dimension ≥0, right? Because terms with negative dimension would require an infinite number of terms in the perturbative expansion, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, more accurately, in a renormalizable theory, all the interaction terms have coupling constants with mass dimension ≥0. So if a coupling has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.

So in our case, [κ]=-1. Which is negative. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ]=-1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Which option is that?

Looking at the options:

A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable. No, because it's not renormalizable.

B) [κ]=1, renormalizable.

C) [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable.

D) [κ]=1, theory not renormalizable.

Wait, so the correct choice is option C: mass dimension -1, theory not renormalizable.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2} \left[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu\right]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ for the electromagnetic field has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ term is constructed from the dimensionless gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must have mass dimension $4$ in 4 spacetime dimensions. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes the following dimensions:
- $[\bar{\psi}]_M = \frac{3}{2}$,
- $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$,
- $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$,
- $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

Adding these contributions:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 + 0 = 5.
\]

Since the Lagrangian term must have dimension $4$, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa]_M \cdot 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = \frac{4}{5} = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions ($[\kappa]_M \geq 0$). Here, $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to **Option C**.
