Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light beams and moving glass. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to recall.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

The options are A, B, C, D with various expressions. And the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n. So in the glass, the speed of light would be v_light = c/n. Since c is 1, that's v_light = 1/n.

But wait, the glass is moving. Oh right, this is a problem involving relative motion. So how do we account for the glass's velocity when measuring the light's speed from the lab frame?

I'm a bit confused about whether to use Galilean addition or something else, but wait, Galilean addition is for non-relativistic speeds. Since we're dealing with light, which travels at speed c, maybe Galilean doesn't apply here. Oh wait, but in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v, which is presumably much less than c. So maybe we can use Galilean addition for simplicity.

Wait, but even so, in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. Oh right, that's the issue. So if the glass is moving, the speed of the light in the lab frame might change. But wait, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? Oh wait, no. Wait, the speed of light in the medium is different. Wait no, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. But when the medium is moving, does it affect the speed as observed in the lab frame?

Wait, maybe I should think about the frame of reference. From the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity v. The light is moving through the glass. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v_light = 1/n. But how does that translate to the lab frame?

Wait, if the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer (and the light is also moving in the same direction), then from the lab frame, the light's velocity would be the sum of the
