Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, then predicting its product after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus with HI is used for the hydrolysis of certain functional groups, like esters or nitriles maybe? Or wait, isn't that more for the substitution reactions, like maybe in the case of alkenes or something else?

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. The IR and NMR data will help me structure the molecule. Let's look at the IR data first.

The IR peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1. That's a broad region, which I think is indicative of an O-H stretch. Since the region is broad and covers a range, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but I also see a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 is usually a bit high, but I think esters or maybe carboxylic acids can show up there. Alternatively, a ketone? No, ketones are usually around 1700 but can be a bit higher. Wait, carboxylic acids usually have lower wavenumbers, around 1700, but maybe if it's a conjugated carbonyl or something else, it could be higher. Hmm.

Another IR peak is at 1610 cm-1, which is around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. And 1450 cm-1 is also in the aromatic region, possibly a ring substitution or some kind of bending. So, the molecule likely contains an aromatic ring.

Now the NMR data. Let's look at the 1H NMR.

The peaks are:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That's pretty high, probably an -OH proton. But wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm and can be broad. Alternatively, an exchange with NH, but that's less likely here. Or maybe an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10 and a triplet or something else. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. This suggests coupling with two equivalent protons. In an aromatic ring, this could be para-substituted protons. Like in para-substituted benzene, where the two protons are ortho to the substituent, leading to a doublet.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, but lower downfield. That also suggests aromatic protons, perhaps meta to substituents or perhaps adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. Wait, but if it's para substitution, the two sets of doublets would be for the two different substituents. Wait, but perhaps the ring has two substituents? Or maybe one substituent with multiple effects.

Wait, perhaps it's a mono-substituted benzene where the substituent is in a position that causes the neighboring protons to split into two doublets. No, more likely, it's a para-substituted ring. Let me think: in a para-disubstituted benzene, each substituent would cause the adjacent protons to show as doublets. For example, in p-xylene, the two sets of H would each be a doublet. Or maybe it's a substituent that has an electron-withdrawing effect, causing the chemical shift.

Wait, looking at the integration: 2H, 2H, so perhaps a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents? Or maybe one substituent that splits the ring into two sets of two equivalent Hs. Like if it's a substituent attached to position 1, and the ring has symmetry. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substitution, but that would give more complex splitting. Hmm.

Then, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, integrating to 1H. That might be a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom or something. Maybe a CH next to a carbonyl group?

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, integrating to 2H. Perhaps adjacent to the same group, like CH2 groups near an electronegative atom.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three Hs as a doublet. That's probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe an oxygen or a carbon adjacent to a branching point.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H, likely a terminal methyl group. Like in an ethyl chain, where the CH2CH3 would have the terminal methyl as a triplet.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has an aromatic ring with substituents, and a side chain with branching. Let's try to sketch this.

Looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is likely an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid. The IR's 1720 cm-1 would then correspond to the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids typically have a broad O-H peak and a strong carbonyl around 1700. 1720 is a bit higher, maybe indicating an ester or acid chloride? But the -OH is present, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but the O-H would not fit that.

Wait, but another possibility is that the O-H is from
