Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when compounds have chiral centers, meaning they lack a plane of symmetry and are non-superimposable on their mirror image. Alternatively, they can have some kind of stereogenic element like a chiral center or a plane of asymmetry.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: Hmm, I think biphenyl compounds can have stereoisomerism if there's a substituent on each ring that's in a position that allows for different configurations. Here, the substituents are at positions 2 on each ring, and there are nitro groups at 6 on each. Wait, wait. Wait, the structure is 6,6'-dinitro, so each phenyl has a nitro at position 6. And the carboxylate groups are at 2,2'. So the biphenyl has substituents in such a way that the arrangement could lead to different stereoisomers. Oh, but wait, do these substituents create a chiral center? Or is it about the possibility of the molecule being chiral due to the arrangement around the central bond?

Wait, biphenyls can have different configurations. In this case, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis or such. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it wouldn't be chiral. Let me imagine the structure. The biphenyl is connected at position 1 on each ring. The nitro groups are at 6 on each ring, which is the opposite side from the connecting bond. The carboxylate groups are at position 2. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. 

Wait, but each ring is symmetrical because the substituents are in positions that are mirrored when considering the biphenyl structure? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is planar or has a plane of symmetry. Wait, for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must not have a plane of symmetry. So if the substituents are arranged in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is meso. Wait, if the substituents are arranged so that the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, then it wouldn't have optical isomerism. But I'm a bit confused here. Let's think about the substituents. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. Are these in positions that would make the molecule symmetric? Hmm, perhaps not. Because each ring has substituents on opposite sides. Wait, maybe the arrangement is such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the biphenyl; the two rings are connected at position 1. The nitro groups are at 6 on both rings. And the COOCH3 groups are at 2 on both. So on each ring, the nitro is at 6, which is the meta position relative to the connecting bond, and the COOCH3 is at 2, which is the ortho position. So when you look at each ring, the substituents are on positions 2 and 6. But since the rings are connected at position 1, which is between 12 o'clock and 1 o'clock, positions 2 and 6 on each ring are on opposite sides of each ring.

Wait, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry because the substituents are arranged in a way that doesn't mirror. So maybe this compound can have enantiomers, hence optical isomerism. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro groups are para to each other if the rings are connected. Wait, no, because each ring is connected at position 1, so the nitro group at 6 would be on the same side as the other ring's nitro? Or maybe opposite? I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move on to the next compound and come back.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure here is something like CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, no, propanoate would be CH2CH2COO..., but let me think. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait: propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropano
