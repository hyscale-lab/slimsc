Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty of the Pz operator given a specific state. Let's see what I remember.

First, the problem gives me the matrices for the operators Px, Py, and Pz. I know that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the formula ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²). So I'll need to find the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared.

The system is in the eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Wait, but wait, I should double-check what the actual state is. The problem says the state is the column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So the state vector ψ is:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]
      [ 1/√2 ]
      [ -1/2 ]

But I should make sure that this vector is normalized. Let's calculate the norm: (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2. That's (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2 plus 1/2 gives 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, to find ΔPz, I need to compute ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩.

Since Pz is given, let's write it down. The matrix for Pz is:

[ ħ     0      0  ]
[ 0     0      0  ]
[ 0     0    -ħ  ]

So, it's a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ.

The expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ is ψ† Pz ψ. Since Pz is diagonal, this can be computed as the sum of each component squared multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

Wait, more accurately, the expectation value is the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by Pz multiplied by ψ.

But since all the elements in Pz are real, the calculation simplifies. Let's compute each term:

⟨Pz⟩ = ( (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) ) + ( (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) ) + ( (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) )

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the matrix Pz when multiplied by ψ, which is a column vector, would give each component as:

First component: ħ * (-1/2)
Second component: 0 * (1/sqrt(2))
Third component: (-ħ) * (-1/2)

Then, ψ† is the row vector [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].

So ψ† Pz ψ is the dot product of ψ† multiplied by Pz ψ.

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to compute each diagonal element multiplied by the magnitude squared of the corresponding component of ψ.

Because Pz is diagonal, the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ is sum over i of (ψ_i)^* * (Pz)_ii * ψ_i.

Since all ψ_i are real in this case, it's sum_i (ψ_i)^2 * Pz_ii.

So let's compute each term:

First term: ( (-1/2) )^2 * ħ = (1/4) * ħ.

Second term: (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 = (1/2) * 0 = 0.

Third term: ( (-1/2) )^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4) * (-ħ) = - ħ/4.

Adding them up:  ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0.

So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero. That makes sense because the state is symmetric in some way, maybe?

Now, I need to compute ⟨Pz²⟩. Since Pz squared is just the square of each diagonal element. So Pz² would be:

[ (ħ)^2   0         0       ]
[ 0       0^2       0       ]
[ 0       0       (-ħ)^2 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ ħ²  0   0 ]
[ 0   0   0 ]
[ 0   0   ħ² ]

So, again, the expectation value ⟨Pz²⟩ is sum_i (ψ_i)^2 * (Pz²)_ii.

So,

First term: (1/4) * ħ² = ħ²/4.

Second term: (1/2) * 0 = 0.

Third term: (1/4) * ħ² = ħ²/4.

Adding them up: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨Pz²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Now, the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - (⟨Pz⟩)^2 ) which is sqrt( (ħ²/2) - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the Pz² calculation. Because when you square the operator Pz, each diagonal element is squared. Since the original Pz matrix is diagonal, Pz squared is just the squares of each element.

So, for the first diagonal element, (ħ)^2= ħ^2, third is (-ħ)^2= ħ^2. The middle is zero.

So when calculating ⟨Pz²⟩, each component's contribution is (ψ_i)^2 multiplied by the squared Pz value at that position.

So yes, that looks correct. So the uncertainty is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. The state ψ is given as a column vector, but when I calculated the expectation value, did I do it correctly? Let me double-check.

The components are:

ψ₁ = -1/2, ψ₂ = 1/sqrt(2), ψ₃ = -1/2.

So for Pz, the diagonal elements are  ħ, 0, -ħ.

So, for each term:

ψ₁ squared times Pz₁₁: (1/4) * ħ.

ψ₂ squared times Pz₂₂: (1/2) * 0 = 0.

ψ₃ squared times Pz₃₃: (1/4) * (-ħ) → which is -ħ/4.

Summing gives 0 as before.

And for Pz squared, the diagonal elements are ħ², 0, ħ².

So each term is:

(1/4) * ħ² → ħ²/4.

(1/2) * 0 → 0.

(1/4) * ħ² → ħ²/4.

Sum to ħ²/2.

So yes, uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ / sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The operator $P_z$ is given as:

\[
P_z = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\hbar
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The state of the system is the column vector:

\[
\psi = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1/2 \\
1/\sqrt{2} \\
-1/2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \sum_i | \psi_i |^2 (P_z)_{ii}.
\]

- First term: $| -1/2 |^2 \cdot \hbar = (1/4) \hbar$.
- Second term: $| 1/\sqrt{2} |^2 \cdot 0 = 0$.
- Third term: $| -1/2 |^2 \cdot (-\hbar) = (1/4)(-\hbar)$.

Adding these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$:

\[
P_z^2 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \hbar^2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is computed similarly:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \sum_i | \psi_i |^2 (P_z^2)_{ii}.
\]

- First term: $| -1/2 |^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = (1/4) \hbar^2$.
- Second term: $| 1/\sqrt{2} |^2 \cdot 0 = 0$.
- Third term: $| -1/2 |^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = (1/4) \hbar^2$.

Adding these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \hbar^2/2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar / \sqrt{2}$.

Answer: B
