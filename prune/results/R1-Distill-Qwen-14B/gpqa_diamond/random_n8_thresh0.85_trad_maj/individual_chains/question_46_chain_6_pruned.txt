Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, typically used for ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis. So, in this case, the starting material is an alkene, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure to visualize.

3-methylpent-1-ene has the structure CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Pentene has five carbons. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, pentane has five carbons, so pent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Oh wait, but wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's count the carbons.

1   2   3   4   5
   CH2-CH2-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. No, wait. Let me think again. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, no, wait, wait. No, wait, pentane is five carbons, so pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methyl means on the third carbon, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, noâ€”the structure should be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, perhaps I got the numbering wrong.

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene?

Wait, no, let's number from the double bond. For pent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Oh wait,
