Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, wait, I remember that wave functions need to be normalized, right? Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere has to add up to 1.

The setup says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's under the same conditions. When they measure the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Wait, but wait, if x is less than 1, is the wave function zero? Or does it have some other behavior?

Wait, the problem says that when they measured, none were found at x <1 or x>3. So the wave function must be zero outside 1 and 3. But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because sqrt(1+x) when x < -1 would be imaginary, but in our case, x is between 1 and 3, so 1+x is between 2 and 4, so sqrt(1+x) is real. Oh, wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the imaginary part is 0.5i, which is a constant. But a wave function can't have a constant imaginary part because that would imply a non-zero probability density outside the region where the particle is found.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Oh wait, maybe the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). No, the problem writes it as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So it's a real term minus an imaginary constant. Hmm, that might complicate things. Because usually, the wave functions are complex, but the probability density is the square of the absolute value. So, the probability density is |ψ(x)|² = (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2, since the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the square would be (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. 

Wait, but for the wave function to be valid, it must satisfy the normalization condition. The integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1. Because the wave function is zero outside that interval, I suppose.

So let's write that down. The integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) ) + (0.5)^2 ] dx equals 1.

Wait, but wait—that can't be right. Because the wave function as given has an imaginary component that's a constant, which would contribute a constant term to the integral. Let me think again. The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) is a complex function where Re(ψ) = a/sqrt(1+x) and Im(ψ) = -0.5. So the absolute square is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx should be equal to 1.

Wait, but that would give us two terms. Let me compute each part.

First, the integral of a²/(1+x) from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So this part becomes a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2).

The second part is the integral of 0.25 from 1 to 3, which is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, but ln(2) is approximately 0.693. So 0.5 / 0.693 ≈ 0.721. So a² ≈ 0.721 → a ≈ sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849. Looking at the options, B is 0.85, which is close.

But wait, wait a second. I think I made a mistake. Because the wave function as given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, but the way the integral is set up. So the absolute square is [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + [0.5]^2. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but could the wave function have a time-dependent part? No, because the question says the wave function is stationary; it's the solution to the Schrodinger equation in a part where the particle exists.

Wait another thing. The wave function as given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Does this make sense? Because the imaginary part is a constant, which would mean that the probability density (which is the absolute square) would have a constant term. But in reality, the wave function should be zero outside x=1 to x=3, right? Because the particle was never found outside this interval. Oh wait, but the given wave function is only valid in the region where the particle can exist. So maybe the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, but inside this region, it's given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i.

Wait, but in that case, the integral of the absolute square from x=1 to x=3 must be 1, because the wave function is zero elsewhere. That's the correct approach.

So I should proceed with the calculation as before. So the integral is [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] from 1 to 3, which equals 1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the presence of the imaginary part suggests that the wave function isn't normalizable in the usual way. Because for a wave function ψ(x) = real part + imaginary part, the integral of |ψ|^2 must be 1. But if the imaginary part is a constant, like here, then the integral is a function of x where the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3. So the integral must be 1.

Let me re-do the calculation. The integral from 1 to 3 of (a²/(1+x) + (0.5)^2) dx = 1.

The integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

The integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So adding them: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931. So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721. So a ≈ sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait another thought. I'm assuming that the wave function is given correctly, but does the form make sense? Because the wave function ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So when x is between 1 and 3, sqrt(1+x) is between sqrt(2) and 2. So a/sqrt(1+x) is a real number. So the entire wave function is a complex number with real part a/sqrt(1+x) and imaginary part -0.5. So the absolute square is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but then the integral becomes a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1. So a²=0.5/(ln 2) ≈ 0.721. a ≈ 0.849, which is 0.85. So that's option B.

But wait, could there be an error in the setup? Another possibility is that the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 -0.5i), but that's not what's written. The problem states it as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, so it's a sum of two terms, not a product.

Hmm, but that seems a bit odd, because typically the wave function is a product of a spatial part and a time-dependent exponential, perhaps. But in this case, maybe the wave function is given in a way that the imaginary part is a constant. So perhaps the wave function isn't normalized as I thought, but the problem gives the condition that all particles are between 1 and 3, meaning that the wave function is zero outside this region. So the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must equal 1.

So I think the calculation is correct, and the answer is B) 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition for wave functions. The total probability of finding the particle in the region \( x \in [1, 3] \) must equal 1. The probability density is given by the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two terms:

1. **First term**: \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \)
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Thus:

   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \)
   The integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( [1, 3] \) is:

   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding the two terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.849.
\]

Thus, \( a \approx 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
