Okay, so I need to figure out which of these compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism, right? Oh wait, stereoisomers are compounds that have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement. And optical isomerism refers to compounds that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, leading to the phenomenon of optical activity, like rotating plane-polarized light.

So the question is about whether each of the four compounds listed can show optical isomerism. Let me look at each one by one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Oh, that's a biphenyl compound. The biphenyl groups are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6', and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. Wait, so each phenyl ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. Are there any chiral centers here? Well, the biphenyl itself can have different conformations, but can it have stereoisomerism? Wait, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule can have a plane of symmetry or not. Let me think. The substituents are on positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, biphenyl can sometimes have axial chirality, like in biphenyl compounds where the two rings are connected in such a way that the arrangement around the central bond can be chiral. I remember that for biphenyls, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a lack of a plane of symmetry, then axial chirality is possible. So in this case, the substituents are 2,2', 6,6'â€”so each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate at positions 2 and 6. Wait, but 2 and 6 on a benzene ring are meta to each other. Oh wait, the biphenyl is 1,1', so the rings are directly connected. So the positions 2 and 2' would be adjacent on each ring. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is that each phenyl ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So on each ring, the nitro is at position 6, which is para to position 2. Hmm, but wait, position 2 and 6 are para on a benzene ring. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So each ring has two substituents, para to each other. So when looking at the biphenyl, the arrangement could have the two nitro groups on the same side or opposite sides. Wait, but wait, each ring is connected at 1 and 1', so the positions 2 and 2' are across the central bond. So if each substituent (nitro and carboxylate) is on the same ring, but their arrangement around the central bond could lead to a chiral axis. So I think this molecule might exhibit axial chirality. If the substituents on each phenyl ring are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would have enantiomers. So this compound could have optical isomerism. So 1 is a candidate.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. Propanoate would be the ester of propanoic acid. The structure is CH2CH2COOCH3, but wait, wait. The formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HO-CH2-COO- attached to methyl? Wait no, wait. Alternatively, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is an ester where the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Let me draw it mentally. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. But 2-hydroxy would mean that the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure should be: the ester group is O-CO-OCH3. The rest is the propanoate part. So the acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Taking the ester, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule would have a hydroxyl group on the second carbon, which is adjacent to the ester group. Does this create a chiral center? Let's see. The second carbon (where the hydroxyl is attached) has four different groups: the hydroxyl (-OH), the ester oxygen (as part of the COOCH3), and two CH2 groups. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again. The compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is: CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait no, no, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is: the central carbon (carbon 2) has the hydroxyl group, a CH2COOCH3 group, and two CH2 groups? Wait, let me number the carbons. The propanoate is three carbons: the first is COOCH3, the second is CH(OH), and the third is CH3. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

Carboxylic acid: CH2CH(OH)COOH. So the ester would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the molecule is:

CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait. The structure of propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So for 2-hydroxypropanoate, it's CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-OCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-O-CH3.

Wait, that makes the carbon chain as COOCH3 connected to CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

The main chain is three carbons: the first is the COOCH3 group, the second is CH(OH), and the third is CH3. So the molecule is:

COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3.

So the central carbon (the second one) is connected to:

- COOCH3 group,

- OH,

- CH3,

- and another CH2 group?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps I should just look for chiral centers. For a compound to exhibit optical isomerism, it needs at least one chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon attached to four different groups.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait: the ester is (CH2)2COOCH3, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)CH2CH3. No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's:

The structure is O

       |
O-C-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-

Wait, no. Let me think again. The compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the parent acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Its ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

COOCH3 connected to CH2CH(OH)CH3.

So the central carbon is the one with the OH group. The groups attached are:

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me number the carbons. The carboxylate is on carbon 1. Carbon 2 has the OH. Carbon 3 is the methyl group.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3,

Carbon 2: connected to OH,

Carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, but then Carbon 2 would be connected to COOCH3, OH, and two CH2s? That doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe Carbon 2 is connected to COOCH3, OH, CH3, and another CH2 group. No, I'm getting tangled here. Let's think about the groups on the central carbon. If the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to four distinct groups, then it's a chiral center.

The groups would be:

1. -OH,

2. -COOCH3,

3. -CH2CH3,

4. -H? No, wait. No, wait, let's think of the structure as:

The central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- COOCH3 group,

- OH group,

- two CH2 groups?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the molecule is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-OCH3.

So the central carbon is the one in the middle: CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-OCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (one on each side),

- and the COOCH3 group.

Wait, no. Each CH2 is a group. So the second carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- CH2(OH),

- CH2COOCH3.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused, perhaps I should just sketch it mentally. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

O

||

O-C-OCH3 attached to a CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, but if that's the case, the central carbon would be the one with the OH. So the groups are:

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- CH2CH3,

- and another CH2 group? Wait, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH2(COOCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3.

So the central CH is attached to:

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- CH3,

- and another CH2 group? No, wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait a moment, perhaps I should think of the structure as:

The molecule is:

(CH3O)CO-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

O

||

O-C-OCH3 connected to a CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-?

Wait, perhaps I should just try to figure out if there's a chiral center. Let's imagine the structure.

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is a three-carbon chain with the carboxylic acid group. So the ester is CH
