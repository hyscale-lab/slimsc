Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. It contains 1.00 gram of KH2PO4 and 1.00 gram of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (which is PO4^3-) in the solution. The temperatures are 25°C, and they've given the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to figure out what these salts dissociate into in solution. I remember that KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate with two water molecules. Let's write their dissociation reactions.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water, but wait, the water is part of the crystal structure, so when dissolved, it just contributes H2O as solvent. So the main ions are Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But wait, how do these relate to orthophosphate (PO4^3-)?

I think orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-, which would come from HPO4^2- losing another proton. But under what conditions does that happen? Because the solution's pH must be such that HPO4^2- can deprotonate further.

Looking at the Ka values: H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- with Ka1=7.5e-3. Then, H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- with Ka2=6.2e-8. And HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3=1.8e-12.

So, to form PO4^3- from HPO4^2-, the solution must be highly basic. But wait, what's the pH of the solution here?

Wait, but in this solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts. So this is a buffer system, perhaps. Because when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, it forms a buffer. But wait, the two salts are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So in solution, H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present.

So, the solution is a buffer solution involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. That would come from the further deprotonation of HPO4^2- to PO4^3-.

Wait, so HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3- and H+. The Ka for that is Ka3 = 1.8e-12. But for that to happen, the solution must be such that the pH is higher than the pKa of the third dissociation. Let me think.

The pKa3 is log(1/(1.8e-12)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa3 = -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74.

So, if the solution's pH is higher than 11.74, then HPO4^2- would deprotonate to PO4^3-.

But wait, what's the pH of the solution? Since we have a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, perhaps we can calculate the pH first.

Wait, the buffer is H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so their ratio would determine the pH. Let me calculate the concentrations of each.

First, I'll find the moles of each salt. 

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 moles.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O has molar mass 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 moles.

Wait, wait: the formula for Na2HPO4·2H2O is Na2HPO4·2H2O, so each mole of this compound gives 1 mole of HPO4^2-.

So, in the solution, the concentration of H2PO4^- is from KH2PO4: 0.00734 moles / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M.

Similarly, HPO4^2- is from Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.00561 moles / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M.

Wait, no: Wait, the solution is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

So, H2PO4^- concentration is 0.00734 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M.

HPO4^2- is 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.

So, the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-] is 0.02805 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.764.

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Wait, because H2PO4^- is the acid (loses a proton to become HPO4^2-), so the pKa is Ka2. pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21.

So pH = 7.21 + log(0.764) ≈ 7.21 + (-0.113) ≈ 7.097, about 7.1.

Wait, so the pH is around 7.1. Now, the pKa3 is around 11.74, so since pH is 7.1, which is lower than pKa3, the solution is acidic enough that the HPO4^2- would not deprotonate much. So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low, perhaps negligible.

But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-). So, maybe we can calculate it using the third dissociation equation.

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-

The Ka for this is 1.8e-12. So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be [HPO4^2-] * Ka3 / [H+].

Wait, no. The expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We can calculate [H+] from the pH we found earlier. pH is 7.1, so [H+] = 10^-7.1 ≈ 7.94e-8 M.

Wait, let's compute that precisely. 10^(-7.1) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.1) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.794 ≈ 7.94e-8 M.

So, plugging in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.02805) / (7.94e-8)

Let me compute that step by step.

First, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ≈ 5.049e-14.

Denominator: 7.94e-8.

So, 5.049e-14 / 7.94e-8 ≈ (5.049 / 7.94) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.636 * 1e-6 ≈ 6.36e-7 M.

Wait, that's approximately 6.36e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, and option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm. Did I make any mistake?

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M, yes. Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[H+] is 10^(-7.1) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.1) = 1e-7 * 0.7943 ≈ 7.943e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 7.943e-8.

Let me compute numerator and denominator more accurately.

1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = ?

Let me calculate 1.8 * 0.02805 = 0.05049 → 0.05049e-12 → 5.049e-14.

Denominator: 7.943e-8.

So, 5.049e-14 / 7.943e-8 = (5.049 / 7.943) * 1e-6.

5.049 / 7.943 ≈ 0.6355 → 0.6355e-6 → 6.355e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.36e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7) and option D is 3.97e-7, which is much lower. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the pH calculation. Because the solution is a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but perhaps the actual pH is different. Let me re-calculate the pH.

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is 7.21.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02805 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.764.

Log(0.764) is approximately log(0.76) ≈ -0.117. So pH = 7.21 - 0.117 ≈ 7.093.

So [H+] is 10^-7.093 ≈ 7.94e-8 M, as before.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial assumption that the solution's pH is 7.1 is correct, but maybe I should consider activity coefficients or other factors. But I think for the purposes of this problem, the approximation is acceptable.

So, if I proceed with [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.35e-7 M, but option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So why the slight difference?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles. Let me double-check the moles.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

136.09 → 136.09 ≈ 136.09.

1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007341 moles.

Volume is 0.2 L → 0.007341 / 0.2 = 0.036705 M.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol.

1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005612 moles.

0.005612 / 0.2 = 0.02806 M.

Hmm, so that's accurate enough.

Wait, another thought: could the orthophosphate also come from the complete deprotonation of H3PO4? But in this solution, the main species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but perhaps considering the autoionization of water, but that's probably negligible. Alternatively, maybe the PO4^3- comes from both HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-?

Wait, no. Because H2PO4^- can't deprotonate to PO4^3- directly; it would require losing two protons. So the only source is HPO4^2- losing a proton, which requires a high pH.

But in our solution, the pH is around 7.1, which is lower than pKa3 (11.74), so the HPO4^2- will not lose a proton to form PO4^3-; instead, it will tend to gain a proton to form H2PO4^-.

Wait, wait, that's the opposite of what I thought before. Because when the pH is below the pKa, the dominant form is the acid form. Wait, no. Let's think about it.

In the third dissociation, HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The pKa3 is 11.74. So if the solution's pH is lower than 11.74, then HPO4^2- will remain as HPO4^2- and won't deprotonate to PO4^3-.

Wait, that makes sense because at low pH (acidic), the conjugate acid form is favored. So if pH is lower than pKa3, then the acid form (HPO4^2-) is favored, and PO4^3- is minimal.

Wait, but then why did we calculate a positive concentration for PO4^3-? Because according to the calculation, [PO4^3-] is about 6e-7 M. But if pH is 7.1, which is much lower than 11.74, the concentration should be very low. So why is it 6e-7 M?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the reactions. Let me think again.

H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. The first deprotonation is to H2PO4^- (pKa1 ~ 2.12), the second to HPO4^2- (pKa2 ~7.21), and the third to PO4^3- (pKa3 ~11.74).

So in this solution, we have a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which gives a pH around 7.1, which is below pKa2 and pKa3.

Wait, but in this solution, the pH is about 7.1, which is just below pKa2 (7.21). So, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but when the pH is below pKa3, the HPO4^2- doesn't deprotonate to PO4^3-; it's the other way around. So, the concentration of PO4^3- should be extremely low, but perhaps not zero.

Wait, so perhaps the main source of PO4^3- is the third dissociation, but since pH is much lower than pKa3, the concentration is very low.

Wait, but the calculation I did earlier gave a positive value, which suggests that some PO4^3- exists. However, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the third dissociation, but the contribution from HPO4^2- is negligible because the solution isn't basic enough.

Wait, but in the calculation, the [PO4^3-] would be [HPO4^2-] * Ka3 / [H+].

So, regardless of pH, this is the way to calculate it. So even if pH is lower than pKa3, the calculation applies.

So, perhaps the answer is 6.36e-7 M, but since it's not one of the options exactly, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options: option A is 6.24e-7, which is close to my calculation.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-calculate the numerator and denominator precisely.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

Let me compute that again: 136.09 is approximately 136.09.

1/136.09 = approximately 0.007341.

So, 0.007341 moles in 0.2 L → 0.036705 M H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol.

1/177.99 is approximately 0.005612 moles → 0.02806 M HPO4^2-.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[H+] = 10^-7.10 → let me compute that accurately.

pH = 7.10 → [H+] = 10^-7.10 = 7.943e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.02806) / (7.943e-8).

Calculating numerator: 1.8 * 0.02806 = 0.050508 → 5.0508e-14.

Denominator: 7.943e-8.

So, 5.0508e-14 / 7.943e-8 = (5.0508 / 7.943) * 1e-6.

5.0508 /7.943 ≈ 0.636 → 0.636e-6 → 6.36e-7 M.

So, approximately 6.36e-7 M. The closest option is option A: 6.24e-7.

But why is there a discrepancy? Let me check if I made a mistake in the moles.

Wait, perhaps I should be precise with the molar masses.

Molar mass of KH2PO4: K is 39.10, H2 is 2(1.008)=2.016, P is 30.97, O4 is 16*4=64. So total is 39.10 + 2.016 +30.97 +64= 136.086 g/mol. So 1.00 g is 1/136.086 = approx 0.007341 moles.

Same for Na2HPO4·2H2O: Na is 22.99 each, 2 → 45.98. HPO4^2-: H is 1.008, P 30.97, O4 64 → 96. So 45.98 + 96 = 141.98. Plus 2 H2O (each H2O is 18.015, so 2 * 18.015=36.03). So total is 141.98 +36.03=178.01 g/mol. So 1.00 g is 1/178.01 = approximately 0.005612 moles.

So the moles are correct.

Ah, wait—perhaps the solution is more complicated because of the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and how they affect each other.

Wait, but the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- affects the pH, but the calculation of PO4^3- is only from the HPO4^2-.

Hmm, perhaps my initial approach is correct, but let me think if there's another way this could be approached.

Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate (PO4^3-) comes from the full deprotonation of H3PO4, which would require losing all three protons. But in solution, H3PO4 is a weak acid and only partially dissociates. So in the given solution, with a pH of about 7.1, which is lower than pKa3, the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible except through the third dissociation.

Wait, but in the solution, H3PO4 isn't present. The salts are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, so the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but not H3PO4.

So, the only source of PO4^3- is from HPO4^2- losing a proton. But given the pH is lower than pKa3, the concentration is low, but not zero.

So, the calculation I did earlier is correct.

So, the answer would be approximately 6.36e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7) or perhaps another option. Wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 6.24e-7

B)5.48e-7 

C) 2.81e-7 

D)3.97e-7 

Hmm. So 6.36e-7 is option A, but the exact value I calculated is 6.36e-7, but option A is 6.24e-7 which is a bit lower. So perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation.

Let me recompute:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02806 M.

[H+] = 10^-7.1 ≈ 7.943e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (7.943e-8).

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Denominator: 7.943e-8.

So, 5.0508e-14 /7.943e-8 = 

5.0508 /7.943 = 0.6355.

Multiply by 1e-6 → 6.355e-7 M.

Which is 6.355e-7 ≈ 6.36e-7.

So why is option A 6.24e-7?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the solution's pH is not 7.1. Wait, perhaps the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- affects the concentration of H+ differently.

Wait, another approach: the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but H2PO4^- can act as an acid (losing a proton) or a base (gaining a proton). Similarly, HPO4^2- can act as an acid (losing a proton to become PO4^3-) or a base (gaining a proton to become H2PO4^-).

But in the solution, the pH is determined by the buffer system of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact pH using the buffer equation.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Which we did earlier, and got pH ≈7.09.

Wait, but perhaps we need to account for the fact that HPO4^2- can deprotonate further, but given the low pH, maybe the contribution is negligible. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is correct.

Wait, perhaps the actual [PO4^3-] is negligible, but according to the calculation, it's 6.36e-7, which is in option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the autoionization of water in the third dissociation.

Wait, but I don't think that's necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the initial buffer pH is incorrect, but I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem lies in the assumption that the concentration of HPO4^2- is only 0.02806 M. But in reality, some of it might have been converted to PO4^3- due to the dissociation. But how much?

Wait, but in the solution, the pH is 7.1, which is way below pKa3, so the extent of deprotonation is minimal. So, the [HPO4^2-] remains approximately 0.02806 M.

So, with that, the calculation stands.

So, the answer should be option A, 6.24e-7 M.

But wait, why the slight difference between 6.36 and 6.24e-7? Maybe I made a miscalculation in the Ka or the moles.

Wait, let me recompute the moles.

KH2PO4: 1 g /136.09 g/mol = 0.007341 moles.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1 g /177.99 g/mol = 0.005612 moles.

So, moles correct.

So, [HPO4^2-] is 0.005612 / 0.2 L = 0.02806 M.

Ka3 =1.8e-12.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (7.943e-8).

Wait, computing 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.05e-
