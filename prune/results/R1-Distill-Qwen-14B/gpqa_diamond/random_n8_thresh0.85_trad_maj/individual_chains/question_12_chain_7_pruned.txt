Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it again. It's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain reaction. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The pion is initially at rest. The rest masses are provided: the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of energies.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that in particle decay problems, conservation of energy and momentum are key. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So, the muon and neutrino will move in opposite directions with the same magnitude of momentum.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky. They have very tiny (almost zero) mass, right? So in the problem, I think we can treat the neutrino as massless because its rest mass is negligible. But I'm not entirely sure; maybe it's considered as having some mass in this context. Oh well, let's proceed.

So the initial energy of the pion is just its rest mass energy since it's stationary. That's 139.6 MeV. The total energy after decay must equal this, right? So the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino should be 139.6 MeV.

But wait, the muon will have its own rest mass energy to account for. The muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV. So the kinetic energy of the muon would be (its total energy) minus (its rest energy). Same for the neutrino, but since its rest mass is negligible, its energy is just its kinetic energy.

Wait no, the neutrino's energy is a combination of kinetic and rest mass energy, but if its mass is negligible, like approaching zero, then its energy is approximately its kinetic energy. So I can model it as E_muon = gamma * m_muon * c² and E_nu = kinetic energy (since m_nu ≈ 0).

But let's think in terms of energy and momentum conservation. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero, so the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta.

Let me denote:
- m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c² (rest mass of pion)
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c² (rest mass of muon)
- m_nu ≈ 0 (neutrino is massless in this context)

Let’s denote the momentum of the muon as p, so the neutrino's momentum is -p. Since momentum is a vector, they cancel each other.

The energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c², wait no, units might be a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1. Then E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²).

Similarly, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = |p|, since m_nu is zero.

The total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c², but since we're using units where c=1, it's E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.

So substituting E_mu and E_nu:

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi

Let me write that equation again:

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi

I can solve for p. Let me denote m_pi = M, m_mu = m.

So,

sqrt(p² + m²) = M - p

Squaring both sides:

p² + m² = (M - p)^2 = M² - 2 M p + p²

Subtract p² from both sides:

m² = M² - 2 M p

Rearranging:

2 M p = M² - m²

p = (M² - m²)/(2 M)

Let me plug in the numbers:

M = 139.6 MeV
m = 105.7 MeV

M² = (139.6)^2 ≈ let's compute that. 139.6 *139.6. Hmm, 140^2 is 19600; 140*139.6 = 19544, but wait no, 139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 +0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

m_mu² = (105.7)^2. Let's compute 105^2 = 11025, 105.7^2 = (105 +0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 +0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49= 11172.49 MeV².

So M² - m² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = approx 8315.67 MeV².

Then p = (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6) ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Let me do the division: 279.2 * 29.8 = 279*29.8. Hmm, 279 *30=8370. So 279.2 *29.8 ≈ 8315. So 8315.67 /279.2 ≈ approx 29.8 MeV/c.

Wait, wait. Because 279.2 *29.8 = 8315. Wait, 279.2 *29.8 = (280 - 0.8)(30 -0.2) = 28
