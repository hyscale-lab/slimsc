Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics because relativistic effects come into play. Let me think about how to approach this.

The question gives me two astronauts: one with mass 2m moving at 0.6c and another with mass 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

First, relative speed. I think in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical physics. Oh right! The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, but which one is the reference frame here? Because both are moving in the same direction, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed as observed from one astronaut's frame.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me clarify. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c, so from the perspective of the first astronaut, what is the speed of the second? Or is it the other way around? No, wait, relative speed is the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's frame, B's speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Wait, no, that's the formula for when you have two velocities u and v, and you want the velocity of one as seen from the other. Wait, no, I think the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So if I'm in the frame moving at speed v, the speed of an object moving at speed u is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So in this case, the first astronaut's frame is moving at 0.6c, and the second is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. Wait, but wait, from the perspective of the first astronaut (A), what is the speed of the second (B)?

So if I have u = 0.5c (B's speed in the lab frame) and v = 0.6c (A's speed in the lab frame), then from A's frame, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Oh, wait, that would be (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3c²)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 -0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1429c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c, but since it's negative, it indicates direction. But the question probably asks for the magnitude, so 0.14c. Alternatively, perhaps the relative speed is the absolute value, so 0.14c. So looking at the options, I see options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Next, the total energy of the system. For each astronaut, I need to calculate their relativistic kinetic energy plus their rest energy. The total energy would be the sum of their individual energies.

The relativistic energy E is given by gamma times mc². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for the first astronaut (2m mass, 0.6c speed), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.36c²)/c²) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = gamma * m_rest * c². Wait, no, wait the mass is 2m, so E1 = (gamma) * (2m) c². Gamma is 1.25, so E1 = 1.25 *2m c² = 2.5 mc².

The second astronaut has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma *3m c². So 1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.464m c².

Adding them together, 2.5 +3.464 = ≈5.964 mc². So the total energy would be approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². Option D says 0.14c and E=5 mc². So the correct E is about 5.96, which matches option C.

Wait, wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the total energy of the system from the rest frame, but I don't think that's the case. Because each astronaut is moving, their energies are their relativistic energies, so adding them gives the total energy.

So putting it all together, the relative speed is about 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option is option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of two objects moving in the same direction is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, the first astronaut (A) is moving at \( u = 0.6c \), and the second astronaut (B) is moving at \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.14c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the question asks for the magnitude. Thus, the relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

1. **First astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):**
   \[
   \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
   \]
   \[
   E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
   \]

2. **Second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):**
   \[
   \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
   \]
   \[
   E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
   \]

The total energy of the system is the sum of the two energies:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( E = 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: C**
