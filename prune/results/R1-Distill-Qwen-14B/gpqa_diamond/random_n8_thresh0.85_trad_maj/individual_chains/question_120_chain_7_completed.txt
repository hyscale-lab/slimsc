Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and we need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are power laws involving 1 over plx raised to some exponent.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So a larger parallax means a closer star, and a smaller parallax means a more distant one.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. Let's think about it. If stars are uniformly distributed, how does their density change with distance?

Since parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d), plx = 1/d. So, as d increases, plx decreases. The number of stars should be related to how much volume is at a certain distance, I think. Because in a uniform distribution, more volume means more stars.

The volume in a spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dr would be 4πd² dr. Because the volume of a thin shell is surface area (4πd²) multiplied by thickness dr.

But wait, how does that relate to parallax? Because plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that in. So, the volume in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (deltar). Wait, but delta r is the change in d, which is a function of plx. Since d =1/plx, dr = -1/(plx^2) * delta plx. Hmm, because plx is 1/d, so delta plx is -d^{-2} delta d. So delta d = - (plx^2) delta plx.

Wait, let me get this straight. If I have a small change in plx, how does that affect the change in d? Let's say plx increases by delta plx. Then d =1/plx, so delta d ≈ - (1/plx^2) delta plx. So delta d is proportional to delta plx over plx squared.

So, the volume at a certain plx is 4π d² delta d. Substituting d=1/plx, d² = 1/plx², and delta d is (delta plx)/(plx^2) but since delta plx is positive when plx increases, and d decreases, the delta d is negative. But I think in terms of magnitude, it's 4π (1/plx²) * (delta plx)/(plx²) )? Or wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express everything in terms of plx. Let me try again.

The volume element in 3D space is dV = 4π d² dd. So in terms of plx, since dd = - (delta plx) / (plx^2), so substituting, dV =4π (1/plx)^2 * (delta plx)/(plx^2). Wait, that would make dV proportional to (1/plx^4) delta plx. Hmm, that's 4π (1/plx^2) * (delta plx)/(plx^2) ) = 4π delta plx / plx^4.

Wait, but the number of stars in a shell would be proportional to the volume. So if the number density is constant (uniform distribution), then the number per unit volume is constant, say n.

So the number of stars between plx and plx + delta plx would be n * dV. Which is n * (4π delta plx / plx^4 ).

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So, the number per unit plx would be number divided by delta plx. So (n *4π delta plx / plx^4 ) / delta plx ) = 4π n / plx^4.

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer would be option A, which is ~ 1/plx^4.

But wait, let me think again. Because sometimes I get confused about whether it's the number per unit plx or per some other measure.

Wait, the problem says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx)"—so per unit plx. So for a small range delta plx, the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4 times delta plx. So per unit plx, it's 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer should be A: ~1/plx^4.

Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake in the substitution. Let me think of it another way. If I have a certain parallax range, how does the number of stars in that range depend on the parallax.

Alternatively, consider the number of stars in a small range of parallax. Since more distant stars have smaller plx, and the volume around a star increases with distance squared. So the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dr is proportional to d^2 dr.

But since d =1/plx, this becomes (1/plx)^2 times dr. But dr = (delta d) = -(delta plx)/(plx^2) ), so substituting, we have (1/plx^2) * (delta plx)/(plx^2) ), which again gives 1/plx^4 delta plx.

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume of that region, assuming a uniform distribution of stars.

The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume becomes proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot \frac{\Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \), where \( \Delta \text{plx} \) is the range of parallax. Simplifying, the volume is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \cdot \Delta \text{plx} \).

Since the number of stars in this volume is proportional to the volume, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( \Delta \text{plx} \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This means the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \text{plx} \) increases, following the relationship \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
