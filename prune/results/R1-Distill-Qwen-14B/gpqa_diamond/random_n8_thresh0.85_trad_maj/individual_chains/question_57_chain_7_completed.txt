Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, elastic scattering, right, that's when the particles don't lose any kinetic energy, so it's a collision where they just change direction. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, phase shifts... Right, I remember that in scattering theory, especially for partial waves, each partial wave is associated with a phase shift. The scattering amplitude is then a sum over these partial waves. So the general formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is something like the sum of (2ik)^{-1} times sin(δ_l) terms, right?

But wait, the problem says to calculate the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, incident beam direction is along the initial direction of the electrons, which is the case where θ = 0 degrees. So I guess I need to evaluate the scattering amplitude at θ=0 and then take the imaginary part.

So the formula for the scattering amplitude when θ is 0 is given by the sum over l of (2ik/(2l+1)) * sin δ_l. Wait, or was it something else? Let me think. Oh right, the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l (1 - cosθ)} sin δ_l. Hmm, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me recall. The amplitude f(θ) is given by (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{i δ_l (1 - cosθ)}. But wait, that's for the general case. But when θ is 0, cosθ is 1, so 1 - cosθ is zero. So e^{i δ_l * 0} is just 1. So the formula simplifies.

So then f(0) would be (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l. And since we're only given certain phase shifts (δ_0 to δ_4), I guess we're supposed to ignore the rest beyond l=4. So the sum becomes l=0 to 4.

Wait, but the problem statement says "ignore the rest of the phase shifts." So I only consider l=0 to 4, and the rest are zero.

But wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. Let me think about the structure of f. The scattering amplitude f is generally complex, with real and imaginary parts. But when θ=0, does the amplitude have any real part? Let me think.

Wait, no, because when θ=0, the formula for f is (1/(2ik)) times the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l. Let me write that more carefully. So, in terms of real and imaginary parts, since k is a complex number in some contexts, but in the Born approximation, k is real. Wait, but in this problem, I think k is real because we're dealing with electrons with a given energy. So 2ik is purely imaginary (since i is the imaginary unit). 

So, (1/(2ik)) multiplied by a real sum (since each term (2l+1) sin δ_l is real). So let's compute that. Let me think about the expression.

Let me write it again:

f(0) = [1/(2ik)] * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin δ_l 

Each δ_l is given in degrees, so I should convert them to radians before computing sine. Or perhaps the sine function in the formula works in degrees? No, in physics, we usually use radians, so I'll need to convert the phase shifts from degrees to radians.

Wait, the phase shifts are given as δ_0=90°, δ_1=67°, etc. So I need to compute sin(δ_0), sin(δ_1), etc., in radians.

So first, let's compute each sin(δ_l):

Compute each δ_l in radians:

δ_0 = 90° → π/2 ≈ 1.5708 radians
δ_1 = 67° → about 1.169 radians (since 60° is π/3 ~1.047, 67 is a bit more)
δ_2=55° → approx 0.9599 radians
δ_3=30° → π/6 ≈ 0.5236 radians
δ_4=13° → approx 0.2269 radians

Now, compute the sine of each:

sin(δ_0) = sin(90°) = 1
sin(δ_1) = sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205
sin(δ_2) = sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192
sin(δ_3) = sin(30°) = 0.5
sin(δ_4) = sin(13°) ≈ 0.22495

Then, each term (2l+1) * sin δ_l:

For l=0: (1)*1 =1
l=1: 3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615
l=2:5 *0.8192 ≈4.096
l=3:7 *0.5=3.5
l=4:9 *0.22495≈2.02455

Now sum all these terms:

1 + 2.7615 = 3.7615

3.7615 +4.096 =7.8575

7.8575 +3.5=11.3575

11.3575 +2.02455≈13.38205

So the sum is approx 13.38205.

Now, 1/(2ik) multiplied by this sum. But the question is about the imaginary part. So let's think about 1/(2ik). 

Wait, k is the wave number. But wait, electrons with 50 MeV, so we need to compute k. Because the expression for f(0) is (sum ... )/(2ik). So I need to calculate k.

So, what's the formula for the wave number k for electrons? The electrons are relativistic, but wait, 50 MeV is a lot for electrons. Let's see, the rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is much higher, so relativistic effects are important. 

The relation between the energy and the wave number is given by the relativistic formula. The total energy E is related to the momentum p via E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². But since the electrons are in motion, their kinetic energy is given as 50 MeV. Wait, but wait, in the lab frame, the electrons are moving with some kinetic energy. Hmm, but the problem states "elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target." So perhaps the electrons have a kinetic energy of 50 MeV each.

Wait, but for elastic scattering, the energy is the kinetic energy, but in the context of scattering, perhaps we're considering the center-of-mass energy, but no, I think k is calculated from the kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute k using the non-relativistic formula first, but given that 50 MeV is much higher than the rest energy, non-relativistic might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using a simple formula, maybe even non-relativistic.

Wait, but let me think. The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but this is the non-relativistic formula. Wait, but the energy here is the kinetic energy, so E = (p²)/(2m). So for non-relativistic, k = p/ħ = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. Wait, but perhaps I should use the relativistic formula. Let me get the exact approach.

Wait, the relativistic energy relation is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ). So for high energies, E ≈ pc. But in this case, the kinetic energy is 50 MeV. Wait, but E in the formula would be the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. So the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV.

But wait, wait, no. Wait, in particle physics, for electrons, the kinetic energy is often given as the total energy minus the rest energy. So if the kinetic energy is 50 MeV, the total energy E is 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈50.511 MeV.

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, it's acceptable to approximate E as 50 MeV, but that's a big approximation. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using a non-relativistic approach. Let's proceed, and perhaps that's the intended method.

So, non-relativistic:

E = (p²)/(2m_e), where m_e is the electron mass. 

But E here is 50 MeV. Wait, but if E is 50 MeV, then p = sqrt(2 m_e E). But let's compute that.

But let me make the units correct. Let's convert E into appropriate units. Let's use natural units where ħ = c =1, but perhaps it's easier to compute in SI units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation between the momentum and the wave number. The wave number k is given by k = p/(ħ), where p is the momentum.

Wait, but let's compute the momentum p. Using the energy relation E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

Solving for p: p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) )/(c^2) * c. Wait, no, let's do it step by step.

E = 50 MeV = 50 × 1e6 eV.

m_e c² is 0.511 MeV, so m_e c² = 0.511 × 1e6 eV.

So E =50 MeV, which is 50 × 1e6 eV.

Compute E² = (50e6)^2 (eV)^2.

m_e c² = 0.511e6 eV.

So (E)^2 = (50e6)^2 = 2.5e15 (eV^2).

(m c²)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 ≈ 0.261e12 (eV^2).

So (E)^2 - (m c²)^2 ≈ 2.5e15 - 0.261e12 ≈ ~2.5e15 eV².

So p c = sqrt(2.5e15) ≈ 5e7 eV.

So p = 5e7 eV / c.

Wait, because p c = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ), so p c ≈5e7 eV.

Wait, but wait, E in the formula is the total energy. So E = 50.511 MeV, which is 50.511e6 eV. So (50.511e6)^2 is about (5.0511e7)^2 = ~2.55e15 eV^2.

(m c²)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 ≈ 0.261e12.

So E² - (m c²)^2 ≈ 2.55e15 - 0.261e12 ≈ 2.55e15.

So p c = sqrt(2.55e15) ≈ 5.05e7 eV.

Thus, p = (5.05e7 eV)/c.

Now, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. In eV·s, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So k = p / ħ = (5.05e7 eV/c) / (6.582e-16 eV·s) ) * (c in m/s) ? Wait, no, let me think about the units.

Wait, to compute k in units of 1/m, because k is 1/m.

Wait, p is in units of (eV/c) * c → eV/(c) * c = eV / (m/s) → eV s/m → kg m²/s² * s / m → kg m/s² × s/m → kg/s² × s/m → kg/(s m). Hmm, perhaps better to compute in terms of eV and c.

Wait, maybe it's easier to express k in terms of 1/m. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula k = (m_e v)/ħ, but I'm getting stuck. Let's think in terms of the Compton wavelength.

Wait, perhaps I can compute k as follows. The Compton wavelength of the electron is λ_c = h/(m_e c) ≈ 2.426e-12 m. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the de Broglie wavelength. The de Broglie wavelength λ = h/(p). But again, to get k, which is 2π/λ.

Wait, so k = p/(ħ) because ħ = h/(2π). So, yes, k = p/(ħ). So, p in units of eV/c, and ħ in eV·s, but I need to convert units to get k in 1/m.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to compute it step by step.

p = (5.05e7 eV/c) → but to get p in kg·m/s, we can use the relation 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, and c ≈3e8 m/s.

So, p = (5.05e7 eV/c ) * (1.602e-19 J/eV) / c.

Wait, p = (5.05e7 * 1.602e-19 J ) / c².

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so p = (5.05e7 * 1.602e-19 kg·m²/s² ) / (c²) ) * (1/s).

Wait, no, wait, J is kg·m²/s², so eV is kg·m²/s² × (1.602e-19). So p = (5.05e7 eV) * (1.602e-19 kg·m²/s²/eV) ) / c.

So p = (5.05e7 * 1.602e-19) / (3e8) kg·m/s.

Compute the numerator: 5.05e7 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 5.05 *1.602e-12 = approx 8.09e-12.

Divide by 3e8: 8.09e-12 /3e8 ≈ 2.697e-20 kg·m/s.

Then, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s = 1.0545718e-34 kg·m²/s.

So k = p / ħ → (2.697e-20 kg·m/s) ) / (1.0545718e-34 kg·m²/s) ) → 2.697e-20 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 2.558e14 m^{-1}.

Wait, but that seems extremely large. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, p = (5.05e7 eV) * (1.602e-19 J/eV) / c.

Wait, 5.05e7 eV =5.05e7 * 1.602e-19 J =5.05e7 *1.602e-19 = 8.09e-12 J.

Then p = (8.09e-12 J) / (3e8 m/s) ) → J = kg·m²/s², so p = (8.09e-12 kg·m²/s² ) / (3e8 m/s) ) → 8.09e-12 / 3e8 = 2.697e-20 kg·m/s.

Then, k = p / ħ = 2.697e-20 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 2.558e14 m^{-1}.

Hmm, that's a very large k. Perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversions. Alternatively, maybe it's correct because the energy is high and wavelength is small.

Wait, the Compton wavelength for electron is about 2.4e-12 m, so a wavelength λ = h/(m_e c) ≈ 2.4e-12 m. So k=2π/λ ≈ 2.55e12 m^{-1}, which is way smaller than 2.55e14 m^{-1}. So this can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me try again. Maybe I should compute p correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of p.

p = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / c² → No, wait, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → so (pc)^2 = E² - (m c^2)^2 → pc = sqrt( (50e6 eV)^2 - (0.511e6 eV)^2 ) → approximately 50e6 eV.

So p = (50e6 eV) / c.

Wait, but to compute p in kg·m/s, we can write:

p = (50e6 eV) * (1.602e-19 J/eV) / (c) → J = kg·m²/s².

So p = (50e6 * 1.602e-19 kg·m²/s² ) / (3e8 m/s) )

= (50e6 * 1.602e-19) / 3e8 kg·m/s

= (8.01e-13) /3e8 kg·m/s

= 2.67e-21 kg·m/s.

Wait, that's a different result. So p is 2.67e-21 kg·m/s.

Then, ħ = 1.0545718e-34 kg·m²/s.

So k = p / ħ = (2.67e-21 ) / (1.0545718e-34 ) → approx 2.53e13 m^{-1}.

Hmm, that's about 2.5e13 m^-1. Now, 2π/k would be the wavelength, so λ = 2π/(2.5e13) ≈ 2.5e-13 m, which is 0.25 picometers. Considering high-energy electrons, that makes sense.

Now, going back to f(0). 

f(0) = [sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ] / (2ik)

So sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ≈13.38205.

So f(0) = 13.38205 / (2ik).

But 2i k is in the denominator. So 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k) → because 1/i = -i.

So f(0) = [13.38205 ] * (-i) / (2k) → which is purely imaginary, as expected. So the imaginary part of f(0) is [13.38205 / (2k)].

Wait, because f(0) = (13.38205)/(2ik) = (13.38205) * (1/(2ik)).

Which can be written as (13.38205) * (-i)/(2k) → so the real part is zero and the imaginary part is -(13.38205)/(2k).

Wait, but wait, when we take the imaginary part, the i is part of the expression. So the imaginary part is the coefficient of i, which is (13.38205)/(2k) multiplied by (-i), but considering the i, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write f(0) as a complex number. Let me compute f(0) in terms of real and imaginary parts.

f(0) = [sum ... ]/(2ik) → sum ... is real, 2ik is imaginary (since i is imaginary). So when you divide a real number by an imaginary number, the result is purely imaginary.

Because, suppose you have: real_number / (i * a), where a is real. So 1/(i a) = -(i)/(a). So real_number/(i a) = real_number * (-i)/(a) → that's purely imaginary.

So the imaginary part is (sum ... )/(2k) multiplied by (-1) ?

Wait, no. Let me think:

sum ... is 13.38205.

f(0) = 13.38205/(2ik) → which is 13.38205/(2i k) → multiply numerator and denominator by i: (13.38205 * i )/(2 i^2 k) → i^2 is -1, so denominator is 2*(-1)k → 13.38205 * i / (-2k) → which is - (13.38205)/(2k) * i.

So the expression is purely imaginary: imaginary part is - (13.38205)/(2k).

But when the question asks for the imaginary part, it's the imaginary component, but perhaps ignoring the sign. Or perhaps the magnitude.

Wait, the problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So, the imaginary part is Im{f(0)} = - (13.38205)/(2k). The sign is negative, but the magnitude is (13.38205)/(2k).

Wait, but in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f is often written as f = f_real + i f_imag. So the imaginary part is the coefficient of i. So in this case, f(0) is (13.38205)/(2ik) → which is (13.38205) * (1/(2ik)).

As I did earlier, this becomes (13.38205) * (-i)/(2k) → so the imaginary part is -(13.38205)/(2k). So the imaginary part is negative, but perhaps the question is only asking for the magnitude. Or perhaps the answer ignores the sign.

Hmm, but the options are all positive, so perhaps the magnitude is what is needed. So let's compute the magnitude.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me recheck.

Wait, f(0) = [sum ... ]/(2ik) → sum ... is 13.38205.

So 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k) → because 1/i = -i.

So f(0) = 13.38205 * (-i)/(2k) → which is a purely imaginary number with the coefficient of i being -13.38205/(2k).

So the imaginary part (Im(f(0))) is -13.38205/(2k) → but the question is asking for the imaginary part, which would be the coefficient of i. However, the answer options are all positive, so perhaps I should take the absolute value.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k more accurately.

Let me try a different approach to compute k.

Given that the kinetic energy K is 50 MeV, which is 50e6 eV.

The momentum p can be found using the relativistic energy equation.

E = K + m c^2 = 50e6 eV + 0.511e6 eV = 50.511e6 eV.

So, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2.

So (pc)^2 = (50.511e6)^2 - (0.511e6)^2 → approximately (50.511e6)^2 → since 50.511e6 is much larger than 0.511e6.

So pc = sqrt( (50.511e6)^2 ) → 50.511e6 eV.

Thus, p = (50.511e6 eV) / c → but to get p in kg·m/s, we can proceed as follows.

1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J.

So, pc = 50.511e6 eV → 50.511e6 * 1.60218e-19 J = 50.511e6 *1.60218e-19 kg·m²/s².

But J is kg·m²/s², so pc in kg·m²/s² is 50.511e6 *1.60218e-19 = 8.099e-13 kg·m²/s².

Then, p = (8.099e-13 kg·m²/s² ) / (c) → c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = 8.099e-13 / 3e8 = 2.6997e-20 kg·m/s.

Now, ħ (h-bar) is 1.0545718e-34 J·s = 1.0545718e-34 kg·m²/s.

Thus, k = p / ħ → 2.6997e-20 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 2.558e14 m^{-1}.

Wait, that's the same as before. So k≈2.558e14 m^{-1}.

Thus, 2k → 5.116e14 m^{-1}.

Then, 13.38205/(2k) → 13.38205 / (5.116e14) → approximately 2.616e-14.

But the options are in the order of 1e2 to 1e5 fm. Wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. So 2.616e-14 m is 26.16e-15 m → 26.16 fm.

But looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, option B is 355.351 fm, etc. So none of the options match 26 fm. Hmm, that's a problem. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for f(0). Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I forgot a factor of 2 somewhere. Or perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another approach. The scattering amplitude f(θ=0) is given by f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l → but maybe the denominator is 2ik, but perhaps the correct formula includes 1/(2ik) as a factor. So the sum is 13.38205, so f(0) = 13.38205/(2ik).

Wait, but I'm getting Im(f(0)) = -13.38205/(2k), which is about -2.616e-14 m. But the options are in fm, so 1e-15 m is 1 fm. So 2.616e-14 m is 26.16 fm.

But none of the options are near that. The options are ~177 fm, 355 fm, etc. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps the formula for f(0) is not (sum ... )/(2ik), but (sum ... )/(2ik) times something else.

Wait, another source I recall says that the scattering amplitude for θ=0 is given by (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So that part seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but I have to compute them correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me recompute the sum:

sum = (1)*1 + (3)*0.9205 +5*0.8192 +7*0.5 +9*0.22495.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1*1 =1 → sum=1.

l=1: 3*0.9205 =2.7615 → sum=3.7615.

l=2:5*0.8192=4.096 → sum=7.8575.

l=3:7*0.5=3.5 → sum=11.3575.

l=4:9*0.22495≈2.02455 → sum=13.38205.

Yes, that seems correct.

Hmm, another possibility: perhaps the formula for f(0) includes a factor of 2 somewhere else.

Wait, I'm getting a value of Im(f(0)) around 26 fm, but the options are way larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the wave number k correctly.

Wait, the kinetic energy is 50 MeV. Let me compute the momentum p using the relativistic formula.

E_kinetic = 50 MeV.

E_total = E_kinetic + m c² =50 +0.511 =50.511 MeV.

So, E_total =50.511 MeV.

So, E_total^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → (p c)^2 = E_total^2 - (m c^2)^2.

Let me compute this in MeV^2.

E_total in MeV: 50.511.

m c^2 is 0.511 MeV.

So, (p c)^2 = (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ (50.511)^2 → since 50.511 is much larger than 0.511.

50.511 squared is approximately (50)^2 =2500 → 50.511^2 = (50 +0.511)^2 =50^2 +2*50*0.511 +0.511^2 ≈ 2500 +51.1 +0.261 → 2551.361.

So (p c)^2 ≈2551.361 (MeV)^2 → p c = sqrt(2551.361) ≈50.511 MeV.

Now, p =50.511 MeV / c.

But wait, how to convert p into kg·m/s.

Wait, 1 MeV =1e6 eV, and 1 eV =1.602e-19 J, so 1 MeV =1.602e-13 J.

So p c =50.511 MeV =50.511e6 eV =50.511e6 *1.602e-19 J =8.088e-13 J.

But J = kg·m²/s² → so p c =8.088e-13 kg·m²/s² → p = (8.088e-13 kg·m²/s² ) / c.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So p =8.088e-13 /3e8 = 2.696e-20 kg·m/s.

Then, ħ =1.0545718e-34 J·s =1.0545718e-34 kg·m²/s.

So, k = p / ħ → 2.696e-20 /1.0545718e-34 ≈2.557e14 m^{-1}.

Wait, same result as before. So 2k = 5.114e14 m^{-1}.

Then, 13.38205/(2k) =13.38205/(5.114e14) ≈2.617e-14 m → 26.17 fm.

But none of the options match this. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section. The optical theorem says that the imaginary part of f(0) is (k/(4π)) times the total cross-section σ_total. But wait, I don't have the cross-section here. So perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for f(0) is (2ik)^{-1} sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l → but that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts. Let's recheck the phase shifts.

Given phase shifts: δ_0=90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55°, δ_3=30°, δ_4=13°. All in degrees.

sin(90°)=1.

sin(67°)= approx 0.9205.

sin(55°)= approx 0.8192.

sin(30)=0.5.

sin(13)= approx 0.22495.

So the sum is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude multiplied by k? Or perhaps the quantity is in units of fm^{-1}.

Wait, but the options are in fm, which is 1e-15 meters. So 26.17 fm is 2.617e-14 m.

Wait, the options are:

A)87163.4 fm → 8.7e4 fm → 8.7e-11 m.

B)355.351 fm → 3.55e2 fm → 3.55e-13 m.

C)177.675 fm → 1.77e2 fm → 1.77e-13 m.

D)251.271 fm → 2.51e2 fm → 2.51e-13 m.

Wait, my calculation is 26.17 fm, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is f(0) = (sum ... )/(2ik) → that's correct.

But wait, when you compute the imaginary part, perhaps the formula is different. Let me compute f(0):

f(0) = (sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2ik) → sum is 13.38205.

So f(0)= 13.38205/(2ik) → which can be written as (13.38205/(2k)) * (1/i).

But 1/i is -i, so f(0)= (13.38205/(2k)) * (-i) → which is purely imaginary with Im(f(0)) = -13.38205/(2k).

But the question says to compute the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which is the coefficient of i → so that's -13.38205/(2k).

But this gives 26.17 fm, which is not an option. So perhaps the question actually expects me to compute the magnitude without the sign. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps the formula for k is incorrect. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression for k is k = (p ) / ħ → but p is in kg·m/s, and ħ is in J·s → so k is in m^{-1}.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the momentum in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between the de Broglie wavelength and the momentum.

λ = h/(p) → so p = h/(λ).

But since electrons have high energy, their wavelength is small.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this approach is leading me anywhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects using a non-relativistic formula for k.

In non-relativistic, E = p²/(2m) → p = sqrt(2m E).

E is 50 MeV, which is 50e6 eV → converting to J: 50e6 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV =8.01e-13 J.

m is the electron mass, ~9.109e-31 kg.

So p = sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J ) = sqrt( 2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 )

Calculate inside the sqrt: 2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 → 2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 ≈ 1.459e-43 → sqrt(1.459e-43) ≈ 1.208e-21 kg·m/s.

Then, ħ =1.0545718e-34 J·s → so k = p / ħ → 1.208e-21 /1.0545718e-34 ≈ 1.145e13 m^{-1}.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 *1.145e13) → ~4.36e-14 m → 43.6 fm.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for f(0) is (sum ...) / (2ik) but multiplied by something else. Alternatively, perhaps the sum is different.

Wait, perhaps I should include all the phase shifts up to l=4 but the problem says to ignore the rest, so I think that's correct.

Wait, let me think again about the formula.

In the partial wave expansion,

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sum_{m=-l}^l [ (e^{iδ_l} -1 )/(2ik) ] e^{i m φ} P_l^m (cosθ)

But for forward scattering (θ=0, φ=0), so P_l^m(1) is zero except when m=0 and l=0.

Wait, but no, because P_l^m(1) is 1 when m=0, for all l. So for θ=0, P_l^m(1) is 1 when m=0, and zero otherwise.

So for θ=0 and φ=0, f(0,0) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} -1)/(2ik) ) *1.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1) )

Which can be expressed as (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l -1 ]

= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ (cos δ_l -1 ) + i sin δ_l ]

So the real part comes from (cos δ_l -1) and the imaginary part from sin δ_l.

So the imaginary part is (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which is the same as before. So the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1 sin δ_l )) / (2ik) → which is same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but I've been treating them as degrees. That would be a big mistake. But the question states δ₀=90 degrees, so if I mistakenly took it as radians, that would be wrong. Let me check.

Wait, sin(90°) is 1, but sin(90 radians) is about 0.8415. So if I treated the phase shifts as radians instead of degrees, that would change the sum.

But the question says the phase shifts are measured in degrees. So I should not make that mistake. But perhaps I should check what the sum would be if I treated them as radians.

Let's compute the sum if δ_0=90 radians, which is about 5156.6 degrees.

But that's not the case, the question says degrees, so I should proceed as before.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is different. Let me think again.

Another approach: f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l → so the imaginary part is (sum ... )/(2k).

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recompute k.

Using the relativistic formula for E=50 MeV kinetic energy.

E_total =50 +0.511 =50.511 MeV.

So, E_total in MeV is 50.511.

p c = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) → which is sqrt(50.511^2 - 0.511^2) ≈50.511 MeV.

So p =50.511 MeV/c.

Now, to compute k, since k = p/(ħ).

But let me compute p in units that can be converted to m^{-1}.

p =50.511 MeV/c.

1 MeV/c is equal to (1e6 eV)/(3e8 m/s) → but I need to find p in kg·m/s.

Alternatively, use the relation between MeV and momentum in terms of ħ c.

Wait, since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, 1 MeV/c → p = (1 MeV/c) = (197.33 MeV·fm )^{-1} → because p = E/(c) → E in MeV, p in MeV/c → but to find p in units of ħ c, which is MeV·fm.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of fm^{-1}.

Because 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

So, if I can compute k in fm^{-1}, that would make the calculation easier.

So, k = p/(ħ) = (50.511 MeV/c) / ħ.

But ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm → so ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm ) / c.

So, ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm / c.

So, k = (50.511 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm /c ) ) → the MeV and c cancel out.

So, k =50.511 / 197.33 → approximately 0.256 fm^{-1}.

Ah! That's a much simpler way to compute k.

So, k ≈0.256 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's a big difference. So 1/(2k) would be 1/(2 *0.256) ≈1.953 fm.

Wait, no, 1/(2k) is (1 fm )/(2k) → because k is 0.256 fm^{-1}.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 0.256) fm → 1/(0.512) → ≈1.953 fm.

Wait, but that is 1.953 fm. So then the sum is 13.38205, so the imaginary part is 13.38205 * 1.953 fm ≈26.17 fm.

Again, same result as before. So why are the options so much higher?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let's compute k using the relation k = (p c )/(ħ c^2) ) → because p c is in MeV.

Wait, because I know that ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm → so p c =50.511 MeV.

So, p c =50.511 MeV → p =50.511 MeV /c.

So, k = p/(ħ) → p = (50.511 MeV )/(c ħ) → because p = E/c.

Wait, so k = (50.511 MeV )/(c ħ) ) → but c ħ is in MeV·fm.

Because ħ c =197.33 MeV·fm → so c ħ =197.33 MeV·fm.

So, p/(ħ) = (50.511 MeV ) / ( c * ħ ) ) → (50.511 MeV ) / (197.33 MeV·fm ) ) = (50.511/197.33) fm^{-1} → 0.256 fm^{-1}.

So, k=0.256 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/(2k) =1/(2 *0.256) fm → 1.953 fm.

So, the imaginary part is (13.38205) * (1.953 fm) → 26.17 fm.

But the options are all larger than 177 fm, so I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (sum ... ) * k/(2) instead of 1/(2k).

Wait, because the units are getting me confused.

Wait, let's think about the units. The scattering amplitude f is dimensionless in natural units, but in SI units, it has units of meters. But perhaps in this problem, they're using Gaussian units or some other system.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of k in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (sum ... ) * (k) / (2).

Wait, because 1/(2ik) multiplied by (sum ... ), which is dimensionless, gives f in units of 1/m.

But the options are in fm, which is 1e-15 m.

So, if the imaginary part is (sum ... ) * k / (2) → but let's check the units.

sum ... is dimensionless.

k has units of m^{-1}.

So (sum ... ) *k has units of m^{-1}.

Multiply by 1/(2i) → remains m^{-1}.

But the scattering amplitude f has units of m^{-1}, so the imaginary part would be in m^{-1}.

But the options are in fm, which is 1e-15 m → so 1 m^{-1} is 1e15 fm^{-1}, which is not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(0) = sum ... * (1/(2ik)) → which is in 1/m.

So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the imaginary part multiplied by k, giving a dimensionless quantity, but that doesn't fit the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude in this context includes a factor of k, leading to the imaginary part being proportional to k multiplied by the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the formula.

f(0) is (sum ... )/(2ik) → sum ... is 13.38205.

So, f(0) =13.38205/(2ik).

But when you compute the imaginary part, you have:

Im(f(0)) = -13.38205/(2k) → as before.

But with k=0.256 fm^{-1}, 1/(2k) = 1/(2 *0.256 ) fm → 1.953 fm.

So, Im(f(0)) = -13.38205 * 1.953 fm → which is about -26.17 fm.

But the options are way higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, let me compute the sum again.

l=0: (2*0+1) sin(90) =1*1=1 → sum=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67) → 3*0.9205=2.7615 → sum=3.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55) →5*0.8192=4.096 → sum=7.8575.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5 → sum=11.3575.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9*0.22495≈2.02455 → sum=13.38205.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to 26.17 fm, but the options are way larger. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (sum ... ) *k/(2π).

Wait, perhaps considering that the cross-section σ_total = (4π/k) Im(f(0)).

But without knowing the cross-section, I don't think that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude multiplied by k.

Wait, but that would give:

Im(f(0)) *k =13.38205/(2k) *k =13.38205/2 → 6.691 → ~6.69 fm.

Not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the formula for f(0) is different. I've found a reference that says that in the partial wave expansion, the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is:

f(0) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) [ (e^{iδ_l} -1 )/(2ik) ) ]

Which simplifies to sum (2l+1) [ (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l - 1) / (2ik) ]

So the imaginary part comes from the (2l+1) sin δ_l terms.

Which is the same as before.

So, perhaps the mistake is somewhere else. Maybe I should compute the sum in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting degrees to radians for the sine function. No, I think I did it right.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula actually includes a factor of (2l+1) in the denominator.

Wait, no, the formula is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is (2l+1) sin (δ_l * (1 - cosθ)), but at θ=0, that's sin(δ_l * 0 )=0.

Wait, no, that's the general term. At θ=0, 1 - cosθ is zero, so e^{i δ_l (1 - cosθ)} is 1.

So that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts should be treated as complex numbers, but no, the question gives them as real numbers.

Hmm, I'm stuck. According to the calculation, the imaginary part is 26.17 fm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me compute k using the formula k = (E)/(ħ c) * something.

Wait, E is 50 MeV, which is 50e6 eV.

But ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm → 197.33e6 eV·fm.

So, E =50e6 eV.

Thus, k = E/( ħ c ) → 50e6 / (197.33e6 ) → 50/197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Which is the same as before.

So, 1/(2k) =1/(2 *0.253) → ~1.976 fm.

So, 13.38205 *1.976 →26.45 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects using the non-relativistic formula for k, which would give a much smaller k, leading to a larger imaginary part.

Wait, let's compute k non-relativistically.

E_kinetic = (p²)/(2m) → p = sqrt(2m E_kinetic )

E_kinetic =50 MeV =50e6 eV → 50e6 *1.602e-19 J =8.01e-13 J.

m=9.109e-31 kg.

p= sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J ) → sqrt( 2*9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 ) → sqrt(1.459e-43) → 1.208e-21 kg·m/s.

Then, k =p/ħ → 1.208e-21 /1.0545718e-34 → approx 1.145e13 m^{-1}.

Which is 1.145e13 m^{-1} =1.145e13 /1e15 fm^{-1} → 0.01145 fm^{-1}.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 *0.01145) fm → ~43.6 fm.

Then, Im(f(0)) = (sum ... ) *1/(2k) →13.38205 *43.6 fm ≈584.6 fm.

But none of the options match that either.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. The calculation according to the relativistic approach gives 26 fm, but the options are higher. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the nuclear target, and we should consider the Born approximation, but I don't think that affects the calculation of the scattering amplitude's imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for f(0) is (sum ... ) * (k)/(2i) → which would make the imaginary part sum ... * k/(2).

So, sum ... =13.38205.

k =0.256 fm^{-1}.

So (sum ... ) *k/2 →13.38205 *0.256/2 →13.38205 *0.128 →1.724 fm.

No, that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula f(0) = sum ... * sin(δ_l) * (k)/(2i) → but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the sum is multiplied by 1/(2ik), but in terms of fm^{-1}, it's 1.953 fm.

So 13.38205 *1.953 fm →26.17 fm.

But the options are much higher, so perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for k.

Wait, I think I found the mistake. Oh no! I think I messed up the calculation of k when using the relation k = (p c )/(ħ c^2) → because when I compute p c in MeV, and ħ c is about 197 MeV·fm, then:

k = (p c )/( ħ c ) → because ħ c is in MeV·fm.

So, p c =50.511 MeV → k =50.511 MeV / (197.33 MeV·fm ) → 50.511/197.33 →≈0.256 fm^{-1}.

Wait, which is the same as before. So that's correct.

But wait, 1 fm^{-1} is 1e15 m^{-1}.

So, 0.256 fm^{-1} is 0.256e15 m^{-1}.

So, 1/(2k) =1/(2 *0.256e15 m^{-1}) → 1/(5.12e14 m^{-1}) → 1.953e-15 m → which is 1.953 fm.

So, 13.38205 * 1.953 fm →26.17 fm.

But the options are much larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude in barns or another unit, but the options are in fm, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me recheck.

Wait, the sum is 13.38205. If I made a mistake in the sum, perhaps the actual sum is larger.

Wait, l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 *0.9205=2.7615 → sum 3.7615.

l=2:5 *0.8192=4.096 → sum 7.8575.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5 → sum 11.3575.

l=4:9 *0.22495=2.02455 → sum 13.38205.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula (sum ... ) *k/(2) → but that would give:

13.38205 *0.256 fm^{-1} /2 →13.38205 *0.128 →1.724 fm^{-1} → which is 1.724e15 m^{-1} → which is 1.724e15 m^{-1} → which is 1.724 fm^{-1}.

But that's not matching any option.

I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me compute k again.

p c =50.511 MeV.

So, p =50.511 MeV/c.

k = p/(ħ) → but  p =50.511 MeV/c.

But ħ c=197.33 MeV·fm → so ħ=197.33 MeV·fm /c.

So, k= (50.511 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV·fm /c ) → the MeV and c cancel.

So, k=50.511 /197.33 →≈0.256 fm^{-1}.

Yes, that's correct.

So, 1/(2k) =1/(2 *0.256 ) →≈1.953 fm.

So, the imaginary part is 13.38205 *1.953 fm →26.17 fm.

Hmm.

Looking at the options:

A)87,163.4 fm → way larger.

B)355.351 fm → around 355 fm.

C)177.675 fm → ~178 fm.

D)251.271 fm → ~251 fm.

Wait, option D is close to 251 fm, which is about 9.5 times larger than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are δ_0=90, δ_1=67, δ_2=55, δ_3=30, δ_4=13 → but perhaps the sum should include (2l+1) terms correctly.

Wait, let me recheck the (2l+1) factors:

l=0:1 → correct.

l=1:3 → correct.

l=2:5 → correct.

l=3:7 → correct.

l=4:9 → correct.

Yes.

So, the sum is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the calculation of the sine terms. Let me compute them more accurately.

Compute each sin(δ_l):

δ_0=90° → sin=1.

δ_1=67° → sin(67) ≈0.92050485345.

δ_2=55° → sin(55) ≈0.81915204428.

δ_3=30° →0.5.

δ_4=13° → sin(13)≈0.2249510543.

So, exact sum:

l=0:1 → sum=1.

l=1:3 *0.92050485345=2.76151456035 → sum=3.76151456035.

l=2:5 *0.81915204428=4.0957602214 → sum=7.85727478175.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5 → sum=11.35727478175.

l=4:9 *0.2249510543=2.0245594887 → sum=13.3818342704.

So, more precisely, the sum is 13.3818342704.

So, 13.3818342704 *1.953 fm → 13.3818342704 *1.953 → let's compute.

13.3818342704 *1.953:

13 *1.953 =25.389.

0.3818342704 *1.953 → approx 0.746.

Total ≈25.389 +0.746=26.135 fm.

Still around 26 fm.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as using the optical theorem. The optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total is (4π/k) * Im(f(0)).

But without knowing σ_total, I can't use this.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for something else, like the real part, but it's specified that it's the imaginary part.

At this point, I think I've made all the correct calculations, but the answer isn't matching any options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects using f(0) as (sum ... ) * (k)/(2i), which would give:

Im(f(0)) = sum ... *k/(2) →13.38205 *0.256/2 →13.38205 *0.128 →1.724 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(0) = sum ... * (1/(2i)) → which would make the imaginary part sum ... * (1/2) →13.38205 *0.5=6.69 fm. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute k in m⁻¹ and then convert to fm⁻¹.

k=0.256 fm⁻¹ → which is 0.256e15 m⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) →1/(2 *0.256e15 ) →1/(5.12e14 ) m →1.953e-15 m →1.953 fm.

Then, 13.38205 *1.953 fm →26.17 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is f(0) = sum ... * (1/(ik)) → without the 2.

Then, Im(f(0)) = sum ... *1/(k) →13.38205 /0.256 →52.27 fm.

But that's close to option D (251.271 fm) only if I made a mistake and 13.38205 *k →13.38205 *0.256 →3.43 fm.

No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(0) = sum ... * (k)/(2i) → which would make the imaginary part sum ... *k/(2).

So, 13.38205 *0.256/2 →13.38205*0.128 →1.724 fm.

Not matching.

I'm really stuck. I think the correct answer based on the calculation is approximately 26.17 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts should be in radians, but I treated them as degrees. Let me try that.

Compute each δ_l in radians:

δ_0=90° → π/2 →1.5708 rad.

sin(δ_0)=1.

δ_1=67° →1.16937 radians.

sin(1.16937) → approx 0.916.

δ_2=55° →0.95993 rad.

sin(0.95993)=0.8155.

δ_3=30°→0.523598 rad.

sin=0.5.

δ_4=13°→0.226893 rad.

sin=0.2257.

Now, compute the sum:

l=0:1 *1=1 → sum=1.

l=1:3 *0.916=2.748 → sum=3.748.

l=2:5 *0.8155=4.0775 → sum=7.8255.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5 → sum=11.3255.

l=4:9 *0.2257=2.0313 → sum=13.3568.

So sum≈13.3568.

Then, 13.3568 *1.953 fm →26.13 fm.

Same issue.

I think I've tried all possibilities, but I can't get an answer matching the options. Perhaps the correct answer is not given, but since this is a multiple-choice question, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 2 somewhere. Let me check the formula again.

The formula is f(0)= [sum ... ]/(2ik). So, the imaginary part is (sum ... ) / (2k).

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by 2 instead of dividing.

Wait, if I compute (sum ... ) *2k →13.38205 *2 *0.256 → 13.38205 *0.512 →6.856 fm.

No, doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by k/2 →13.38205 *0.256/2 →13.38205 *0.128 →1.724 fm.

Still no.

I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to go with the calculation as is, even though it doesn't match the options.


To solve the problem, we calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at the incident beam direction (θ = 0°) using the given phase shifts and the formula for the scattering amplitude:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin \delta_l
\]

### Step 1: Compute the sum of \((2l+1)\sin \delta_l\)
The phase shifts are given as \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). Converting these to radians and calculating \(\sin \delta_l\):

- \(\sin(90^\circ) = 1\)
- \(\sin(67^\circ) \approx 0.9205\)
- \(\sin(55^\circ) \approx 0.8192\)
- \(\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5\)
- \(\sin(13^\circ) \approx 0.22495\)

Now, compute the weighted sum:

\[
\begin{align*}
l=0: & \quad (2(0)+1)\sin(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \\
l=1: & \quad (2(1)+1)\sin(67^\circ) = 3 \cdot 0.9205 = 2.7615 \\
l=2: & \quad (2(2)+1)\sin(55^\circ) = 5 \cdot 0.8192 = 4.096 \\
l=3: & \quad (2(3)+1)\sin(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot 0.5 = 3.5 \\
l=4: & \quad (2(4)+1)\sin(13^\circ) = 9 \cdot 0.22495 = 2.02455 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Summing these terms:

\[
\text{Total sum} = 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.02455 = 13.38205
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(k\)
The wave number \(k\) is derived from the relativistic energy relation:

\[
E = \sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}
\]

For a 50 MeV electron:

- \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV} + 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 50.511 \, \text{MeV}\)
- \((pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 \approx (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 \approx 2551.361 \, \text{MeV}^2\)
- \(pc = \sqrt{2551.361} \approx 50.511 \, \text{MeV}\)

Using \(\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\):

\[
k = \frac{pc}{\hbar c} = \frac{50.511}{197.33} \approx 0.256 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the imaginary part of \(f(0)\)
The imaginary part of \(f(0)\) is given by:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{\text{Sum}}{2k}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{13.38205}{2 \cdot 0.256} \approx \frac{13.38205}{0.512} \approx 26.17 \, \text{fm}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
The calculated value of \(26.17 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest match to the calculation is **Option D: 251.271 fm**, which is approximately 9.5 times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the problem setup or a mismatch in the interpretation of the formula or units.

### Final Answer
Based on the calculation, the closest option is:

**Answer: D**
