Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should prioritize that one. Both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the RV method, which gives us their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but different orbital periods and host stars.

Let me think about the factors that influence the transit probability. I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to its star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. Oh wait, but RV method already tells us the planet's mass and orbital period, so we can get some parameters from that.

Transit probability formula: I think it's something like (R_p / R_s)^2, but wait, no—that's the depth of the transit, not the probability. Oh right, the probability of a transit is more about the geometry. The chance that the planet's orbit, from our point of view, actually crosses in front of the star.

The formula for the probability of a transit is (R_p / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, wait. Maybe it's more about the ratio of the planet's orbital size to the star's radius, but I'm a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, another approach. The transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2 + ...), but I think for Earth-like planets and stars, R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So the probability is roughly proportional to (R_star / a)^2. Wait, no, that's not right because if a is the semi-major axis, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on, which affects the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the geometric probability. The transit probability (P) is approximately (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)), but since R_planet is much smaller, it's roughly (R_star / a). But wait, no, maybe it's more about the relative sizes and the orbital inclination.

Wait, the transit probability formula is actually P ≈ (R_*/a) * (1 + (R_p / R_*)). But since both R_p and R_* are known, and because R_p << R_*, the second term is negligible. So P ≈ (R_*/a). But wait, that can't be right because if a is larger, the probability is lower. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability of a transit is given by (R_* + R_p)^2 / (a^2 + (R_* + R_p)^2)^(1/2). Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Another approach: the transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on with our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance from the star to the planet, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is (R_*/a) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2)), but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so it's simply (R_*/a). But wait, that would mean that the probability is higher when a is smaller, because R_* / a is larger. Wait, but that can't be correct because a smaller a (closer planet) would have a higher probability. But wait, no, because when a is smaller, the planet's orbit is more likely to transit? Hmmm.

Wait, let me try to get the exact formula. The geometric probability of a transit is P = (R_s + R_p) / a, where R_s is the star's radius, R_p is the planet's radius, and a is the semi-major axis. But since R_p is negligible compared to R_s, it's approximately R_s / a. So yes, P is proportional to R_s / a.

Wait, but that makes sense. The larger the star (for the same a), the higher the probability. And the smaller the a (closer orbit), the higher the probability. Because if the planet is closer, its orbit is more likely to pass in front of the star from our point of view.

Wait, but wait—if a is smaller, the planet is closer, so the orbital plane is more likely to be edge-on, which is needed for a transit. So yes, smaller a would lead to higher probability.

So, putting it together, the transit probability is proportional to (R_s / a). So for each planet, we compute (R_s / a) and compare.

But wait, but in the question, the planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. And their host stars have different masses but same radii.

Let's restate the given data:

- Planet_1: Period P1 = T. Planet_2: Period P2 = 3T.

Wait, no, the question says "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So Planet_1 has P = P1, Planet_2 has P2 = 3 P1.

Wait, no, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter, meaning P1 = (1/3) P2. So if P2 is, say, 300 days, P1 is 100 days.

But both have circular orbits.

We need to find a for each planet. Because Kepler's third law says (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star + M_planet)/(4π²). Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_planet can be neglected. So a^3 = [ G M_* P^2 ]/(4 π² )

So, a = [ (G M_* P^2 )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3)

But we can write a in terms of P and M_*. So to find a for each planet, we can calculate a1 and a2.

Given:

- M_*,1 = 2 M_*,2. Because the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host.

Wait, no. The host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host of Planet_2. So M_*,1 = 2 M_*,2.

But both host stars have the same radii, R_*,1 = R_*,2 = R_*.

So for each planet:

a1 = [ ( G * M_*,1 * P1^2 ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)

a2 = [ ( G * M_*,2 * P2^2 ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)

But P2 is 3 * P1.

So substituting P2 = 3 P1 into a2:

a2 = [ G * M_*,2 * (3 P1)^2 ]^(1/3) / (4 π²)^{1/3}

= [ G M_*,2 9 P1^2 ]^(1/3) / (4 π²)^{1/3}

= [ 9 G M_*,2 P1^2 ]^(1/3) * [1/(4 π²)]^(1/3)

So, a2 = [9]^(1/3) * [ G M_*,2 P1^2 / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

But looking back at a1:

a1 = [ G * (2 M_*,2) * P1^2 ]^(1/3) / (4 π²)^{1/3}

= [ 2 G M_*,2 P1^2 ]^(1/3) * [1/(4 π²)]^(1/3)

So, a1 is [2]^(1/3) times [ G M_*,2 P1^2 / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Now, let's take the ratio a2 / a1.

a2 = [9]^(1/3) * ... and a1 is [2]^(1/3) * same.

So a2 / a1 = [9/2]^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of 4.5.

Wait, 4.5 is 9/2. Let me compute cube roots.

Cube of 1.6 is 4.096, which is close. So cube root of 4.5 is about 1.65, perhaps.

Wait, 1.6^3 = 4.096, 1.65^3= (1.65)^3 = let's compute: 1.65 *1.65 = 2.7225; 2.7225 *1.65 = approx 4.49 (since 2.7225 *1.6 = 4.356, 2.7225 *0.05=0.136125, total 4.492). So cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65.

So a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

Wait, but a2 = [9/(2)]^(1/3) * a1?

Wait, no, perhaps I got the ratio wrong. Let me recompute.

Wait, a1 is [2 M_*,2 P1^2 ]^(1/3), a2 is [9 M_*,2 (3 P1)^2 ]^(1/3)? Wait no, because P2 is 3 P1, so P2=3P1.

Wait, no, wait: a2 is [ G * M_*,2 * (3 P1)^2 ]^(1/3)

So that's [ G M_*,2 * 9 P1^2 ]^(1/3) = [9 G M_*,2 P1^2 ]^(1/3 )

Similarly, a1 is [ G * 2 M_*,2 * P1^2 ]^(1/3 ) = [ 2 G M_*,2 P1^2 ]^(1/3 )

So the ratio a2/a1 = [9 / 2 ]^(1/3 ) = (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

Wait, so a1 is smaller than a2. Because Planet_1 has a shorter period and a more massive star.

Wait, let me think: for the same mass, if a planet has a shorter period, it's closer in (smaller a). But if it's orbiting a more massive star, that also brings it closer.

Wait, Kepler's law says a^3 ∝ M_* P^2.

So for Planet_1: a1^3 ∝ 2 * (P1)^2.

For Planet_2: a2^3 ∝ 1 * (P2)^2. But P2 is 3 P1. So a2^3 ∝ 1 * (9 P1^2) = 9 P1^2.

So a1^3 = 2 P1^2.

a2^3 = 9 P1^2.

So a2^3 = (9/2) a1^3 → a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ a1 * 1.65.

So a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

Now, transit probability P is (R_* / a), and since both R_* are same, P1 and P2 are proportional to (1/a1) and (1/a2).

So transit probability for Planet_1: P1 = R_* / a1.

Transit probability for Planet_2: P2 = R_* / a2.

So the ratio P2/P1 = (R_* / a2) / (R_* / a1) ) = a1 / a2 = 1/(1.65) ≈ 0.606.

Wait, that's about 0.6. So Planet_2's probability is about 60% of Planet_1's.

But wait, that would mean Planet_1 has a higher probability. So the researchers would choose to observe Planet_1.

Wait, but wait, the options suggest that Planet_2 might be preferred. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, according to this, Planet_1 has a higher probability because P is (R*/a). a1 is smaller, so (R*/a1) is larger. So higher probability for Planet_1.

Wait, but wait, what about the masses. Wait, the planet masses are same, but the star's mass affects a.

Wait, the transit probability is (R_* / a). So for each planet, a is inversely proportional to sqrt(M_*, and directly proportional to P^(2/3). Wait, let me re-examine.

Wait, let's re-derive a.

Kepler's third law: a^3 = [ G(M_*) P^2 ]/(4π² )

So a = [ G M_* P^2 / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

So a is proportional to ( M_* )^(1/3 ) * ( P )^(2/3 )

So, a1 = k * (2)^(1/3) * (P1 )^(2/3 )

a2 = k * (1)^(1/3) * (3 P1 )^(2/3 )

Where k is the proportionality constant.

So, a2 = k * ( (3)^(2/3) ) * (P1^(2/3) )

a1 = k * (2^(1/3)) (P1^(2/3) )

So, a2/a1 = [ (3^(2/3) ) / (2^(1/3) ) ] = [3^2 / 2 ]^(1/3) = (9/2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So transit probability for Planet_1: P1 = (R_* ) / a1.

Probability for Planet_2: P2 = R_* / a2 = (R_*/ a1 ) * (1/1.65 ) ≈ P1 * (0.606).

So P1 is larger than P2, meaning Planet_1 is more likely to transit.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have any option where Planet_1 has a higher probability. Let me check the options.

Options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability.

So according to my calculation, Planet_1's probability is higher than Planet_2's. So they should choose Planet_1. So options C or D.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have the probabilities inverted. Because I thought P is (R_* /a ), so for a1 smaller, P1 is higher. So P1 is higher than P2.

But wait, the probabilities are P1 and P2, and P1 = R*/a1, P2 = R*/a2.

So P1/P2 = a2/a1 ≈1.65. So P1 is 1.65 times higher than P2.

Which means the probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.

So they should choose Planet_1, option C says it's preferred due to 1.65 times higher probability.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* P^2 \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period, we calculate the semi-major axes for both planets:

1. **Planet_1**:  
   Orbital period \( P_1 = P \), host star mass \( M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2} \).  
   \( a_1 \propto (M_{*,1} P_1^2)^{1/3} = (2P^2)^{1/3} \).

2. **Planet_2**:  
   Orbital period \( P_2 = 3P \), host star mass \( M_{*,2} = M_{*,2} \).  
   \( a_2 \propto (M_{*,2} P_2^2)^{1/3} = (M_{*,2} (3P)^2)^{1/3} = (9M_{*,2} P^2)^{1/3} \).

Taking the ratio of \( a_2 \) to \( a_1 \):  
\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{(9M_{*,2} P^2)^{1/3}}{(2P^2)^{1/3}} = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3} \approx 1.65.
\]  
Thus, \( a_2 \approx 1.65a_1 \), meaning Planet_2 has a larger semi-major axis than Planet_1.

Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher than that for Planet_2. Specifically:  
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.65.
\]  
This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

Given this analysis, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a higher probability of transiting.

**Correct Answer: C**
