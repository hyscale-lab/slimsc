Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So if I imagine a range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars would be in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I think that means their distances are uniformly spread out. Wait no, wait. Uniformly distributed in the sky—does that mean uniform in space or just on the celestial sphere? Hmm, I think it's uniform in space, so their distances are spread out in a way. But wait, if they are uniformly distributed in three-dimensional space, the number density is constant.

Let me think about this. The number of stars within a certain volume should be proportional to the volume. So the volume in space relates to the distance in parsecs. But parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so maybe I can express volume in terms of parallax.

The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to 4πd² dd, assuming uniform distribution. Since each star contributes to a certain parallax, I can express this in terms of parallax (plx).

Plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that into the volume. So the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But wait, dd is the change in distance, so how does that translate to a change in parallax?

Hmm, if plx changes by a small amount dplx, then d = 1/plx, so the change in d (dd) would be -d^2 dplx. Because d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx. Let me check that: derivative of d with respect to plx is dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2). So dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So when plx increases, the distance d decreases. So for a small change dplx, the change in d is negative, but when I consider the number of stars, I probably should take the absolute value, so the volume is positive.

So the number of stars in a parallax range from plx to plx + dplx would be proportional to 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again.

The number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to d² dd. Since d = 1/plx, then d² = 1/(plx)^2. And dd is (1/plx^2) dplx, but wait, because plx is inversely proportional to d.

Wait, perhaps I should change variables. Let me express the volume in terms of plx instead of d. So if I have a parallax range dplx, then the corresponding range in distance is dd = -d² dplx, as I thought earlier.

So substituting into the volume, the number of stars in that parallax range would be proportional to (d)^2 * dd. Substituting d = 1/plx, and dd = - (1/(plx^2)) dplx, the number is proportional to (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx. So (1/plx^4) dplx. Wait, but that can't be right, because the options don't have 1/plx^4 as the correct answer except option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let's think again. The volume of the shell is 4π d² dd. But when integrating in terms of parallax, each shell in parallax dplx corresponds to a shell in distance dd.

So number of stars N is proportional to 4π d² dd.

But d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/(plx)^2.

And dd = ( -1/(plx^2) ) dplx.

So substituting:

N ∝ 4π (1/plx^2) * (-1/(plx^2)) dplx.

But the negative sign indicates direction, so when considering the magnitude, we can take the absolute value.

Thus N ∝ (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that would imply that the number of stars per unit parallax range (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. But let's look at the options: option A is ~1/plx^4.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think about it from another angle. If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density is uniform. So the number of stars in a volume V is proportional to V.

The volume between distances d and d + dd is 4π d² dd. So number of stars in that volume is n * 4π d² dd, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The volume element in terms of plx is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But dd is the change in d, which is dd = ( -1/(plx^2) ) dplx. So substituting, the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx^2) * ( -1/(plx^2) dplx ). So it's 4π ( -1/(plx^4) ) dplx. The negative indicates the direction, but for the magnitude, it's 4π / plx^4 dplx.

So the number of stars dN in a parallax range dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4. Thus, the number per unit parallax (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that seems to suggest option A is correct. But wait, another approach: think of the distribution of stars in space. If they are uniformly distributed, the number in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to d² dd.

But in terms of parallax plx =1/d, so d =1/plx. So d² = 1/plx². And dd is ( -1/plx² ) dplx.

So substituting, the number of stars is proportional to (1/plx^2) * (1/plx²) dplx = 1/plx^4 dplx. So again, the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4. So option A.

Wait, but I've heard that the number of stars per unit parallax increases with distance, which would mean that as plx decreases (distance increases), the number of stars per unit parallax increases. Which makes sense because more stars are at larger distances, so within a small plx range, you have more stars.

So the trend is that as plx decreases (i.e., as you go to larger distances), the number per unit plx increases. So for each small plx interval, you have more stars when plx is smaller.

So the function is N ∝ 1/plx^4, which is option A. But wait, I'm a bit confused because in an exam I recall that the number of stars per unit volume increases with distance, but that's not exactly the same as per unit parallax.

Wait, another approach: the distance modulus. The flux from a star depends on distance, but perhaps that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of the inverse square law. For a uniform distribution, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d would be the surface area (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness in distance (dd), which gives the volume. So N = n * 4πd² dd, where n is number density.

Expressed in terms of plx, since d = 1/plx, then N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * dd.

But what is dd in terms of dplx? So plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.

The differential dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting, N = n * 4π (1/plx²) * ( -1/plx² dplx ) = n *4π ( -1/plx^4 ) dplx.

Again, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but the number of stars is positive, so the number is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the number per unit plx (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Because when you integrate N over all plx, you should get the total number of stars. But if N is proportional to 1/plx^4, integrating from 0 to infinity would give a finite result, which isn't the case if stars are uniformly distributed in space, which would lead to an infinite number of stars at large distances. Oh wait, no, in reality, the universe is finite, but in this problem, we're assuming an infinite space.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question only asks about the change with plx, not the total number.

So per the calculations, the correct answer would be option A, ~1/plx^4.

But wait, let me think again. I'm considering the number of stars in a parallax range dplx. So for a small change in plx, how many stars are there. So in terms of plx, each plx corresponds to a distance d =1/plx.

The number of stars in that shell is proportional to d² dd. But when you express dd in terms of dplx, it's ( -1/(plx^2) ) dplx.

So substituting:

N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * ( -1/(plx^2) ) dplx )

Which is N = n *4π * (-1) * 1/plx^4 dplx.

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So option A.

But wait, I remember thinking that the number of stars per unit volume is uniform, which would make the number of stars in a volume increase with the cube of the radius. But that's when considering a sphere, not a shell. Hmm, maybe that's where I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, another way: the number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + dplx is N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd), where dd is the thickness in distance. But since dd = ( -1/(plx^2) ) dplx, substituting gives N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) ( -1/(plx^2) ) dplx.

Which again gives 1/plx^4.

So the answer should be A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \).

Expressing this in terms of parallax, we substitute \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), so \( d^2 = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \). The change in distance \( dd \) can be related to the change in parallax \( d\text{plx} \) using the derivative \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting these into the volume expression, the number of stars in the shell becomes proportional to:

\[
N \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Thus, as parallax decreases (corresponding to greater distances), the number of stars per unit parallax increases.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
