Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the right sequence of reactions to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. The structure is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, let's imagine the benzene ring. The substituents are: at position 1, an ethoxy group (OEt), at position 2, a tert-butyl group (t-Bu), and at position 3, a nitro group (NO2). Wait, wait, numbering might be a bit tricky here. Let me get that right. I think the numbering goes such that the substituents are in order 1, 2, 3. So positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent, but wait, how can that be? Oh wait, benzene is a ring, so the positions go in a circle. So positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in a row, right? So the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So that would mean all three are meta to each other? Wait, no. Let's think of the benzene ring with six positions. Let me imagine the substituents as 1, 2, 3 in order, so each is adjacent. So ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So the substituents are in positions 1, 2, 3. So that's adjacent.

But wait, when you have multiple substituents on benzene, the order of reactions matters because each step is a substitution, and the substituents can direct the next substitution. So I need to plan the order of adding each group.

Looking at the substituents: ethoxy is a strong activating group (ortho/para director), nitro is deactivating (meta director), and tert-butyl is a bulky activating group (ortho/para director, but more para due to bulk). So adding them in a certain order will influence where the next substituent goes.

What's the target structure again: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me number the ring as follows: position 1 (ethoxy), position 2 (t-Bu), position 3 (nitro). So they're adjacent. Hmm, but wait, is that possible? Because each substituent directs where the next will come in.

I think I should decide the order of adding the substituents. Let me consider that nitro is a meta director, which would mean that once nitro is added, the next substitution would be in the meta position relative to nitro. But our target has substituents adjacent to each other, which might require some careful planning.

Wait, maybe it's better to start with the most deactivating group first because once you add a deactivating group, the ring becomes less reactive, so any subsequent reactions should be done before that. Alternatively, since the ethoxy group
