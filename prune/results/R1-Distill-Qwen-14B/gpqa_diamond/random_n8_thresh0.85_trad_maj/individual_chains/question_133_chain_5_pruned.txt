Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters). It contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given too: KH₂PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na₂HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, and we're given the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^3-, I think. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. Phosphoric acid is H3PO4. It can donate protons in three steps, so the species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

Wait, orthophosphate is usually the HPO4^2- ion, but sometimes people refer to H2PO4^- as orthophosphate. Hmm, maybe I should double-check that. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering HPO4^2- as the ortho form. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, I remember that orthophosphate is HPO4^3-? No, no. Wait, I think that orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-, and hydrogen phosphate is H2PO4^-.

Wait, actually, sometimes orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it's deprotonated once, it's H2PO4^- (hydrogen phosphate), then HPO4^2- (dihydrogen phosphate), and then PO4^3- (orthophosphate). Hmm, no, wait. Maybe I got that reversed. Let's think: H3PO4 is the fully protonated form. When it loses one proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (so that's hydrogen phosphate), losing another gives HPO4^2- (dihydrogen phosphate), and losing the third gives PO4^3- (orthophosphate). Or is it the other way around? No, no, wait. I think orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- ion. Because the formula for orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4; when it loses H+ once, it's H2PO4^- (so hydrogen phosphate), then HPO4^2- (dihydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- is called orthophosphate. Hmm, not sure, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, in the context of this problem, we're being asked about orthophosphate ions. So let's assume that orthophosphate is HPO4^2-. Alternatively, some sources say that orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but I'm not so sure.

Wait, perhaps the
