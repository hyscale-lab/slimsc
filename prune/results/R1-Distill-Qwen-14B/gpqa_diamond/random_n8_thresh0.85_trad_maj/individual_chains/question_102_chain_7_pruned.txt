Okay, so I've got this really complicated question about a scientific experiment involving gene constructs and fluorescent markers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let me try to think through this.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The setup involves a bicistronic vector with loxP and lox2272 cassettes. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP. They used Cre to induce recombination and then checked expression via Western blot and confocal microscopy.

So the main issue is that when they looked under the microscope, there was no green signal. The options given are A to D, each suggesting a different reason. Let's unpack each part step by step.

First, the vector setup: bicistronic means two ORFs (ligand and receptor) in one vector. The ligand is at 5', the receptor at 3', each with their own fusions. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor is after an IRES element, which allows internal ribosome entry, so the two proteins can be expressed from the same mRNA but independently.

Each ORF has a stop cassette with loxP (ligand) and lox2272 (receptor). So, in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent expression of the downstream ORFs. But when Cre is present, which recognizes lox sites, it would delete the stop cassettes, allowing the ORFs to be expressed.

Wait, loxP is recognized by Cre recombinase. So in the ligand region, the stop is between ligand and mCherry, so if Cre is present, it would delete the stop, allowing the ligand to be expressed along with mCherry. Similarly, for the receptor, the stop is between receptor and eGFP. But the lox2272 is a variant, I think, which might not be cut by Cre unless in a certain context, or perhaps requires a different Cre type? Or maybe in this case, it's just another lox site that Cre can recognize, but in this setup, the construct is set up in a way that when Cre is present, the stop is removed.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic with the ligand first, then the receptor. The stop for the ligand is loxP, and for the receptor, it's lox2272. So, when Cre is introduced, both stops should be removed, leading to both ligand and receptor being expressed.

But in the experiment, when they cross their homozygous mice with SOX10-Cre, which is a transactivator that's expressed in neural crest cells, the Cre would recombine the lox sites. So the ligand and receptor should be expressed, with the ligand fused to mCherry and the receptor to eGFP.

But in the offspring, under the confocal, they don't see any green signal. So eGFP isn't being expressed, or it's not fluorescent for some reason.

Possible reasons:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But how would that affect expression in the construct? If the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells, perhaps the eGFP wouldn't be expressed in the same cells. But the construct is in the same vector, so both should be expressed in the same cells. So maybe the issue is that the eGFP isn't being made, not that it's in another cell.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That could prevent it from being at the cell surface, but the Western blot would still show the protein being expressed, just not properly trafficked. But the question says the Western blot didn't show the eGFP, so if the protein isn't made, the blot wouldn't pick it up. So if it's stuck in Golgi, the blot would show the protein but not the fluorescence. But the question says after transfection, they used Western blot and saw signals proportional to actin, but I think the expression was tested before. Wait, the question says: "after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading." So they ran a Western and presumably saw expression of the proteins. But in the mouse model, when they crossed with SOX10-Cre, they didn't see green signal.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The Western blot was done after transfection, perhaps in cell culture, but the mouse model is a different experiment. So the construct was transfected into astrocytes, but the mouse model is a germline insertion, meaning the construct is in the mouse's genome, and upon Cre activation (with SOX10-Cre), the stops are removed, allowing ligand and receptor expression.

But in the mouse, they didn't see any green (eGFP) signal. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is under an IRES, which is probably dependent on the upstream promoter. So if the enhancer is missing, maybe the expression isn't happening, but the CBA should drive expression regardless.

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, wait, the ORF is the receptor, and then the eGFP is at the C-terminus. If the stop cassette includes a stop codon, and the lox2272 is used to delete it, but if the reading frame isn't correct, then when the stop is removed, the eGFP might not be in frame and thus not expressed correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the insertion of the eGFP caused a frameshift, so the protein isn't made correctly.

Wait, the construct has the receptor ORF fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the construct is: Receptor ORF with a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette before eGFP? Or is the eGFP at the end. Wait, the setup says: the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the receptor is expressed, followed by a stop cassette, then eGFP? No, no. Wait, the vector is ligand ORF (5'), which is fused to mCherry, but between ligand and mCherry is a stop in a loxP cassette. Then, the receptor is at 3', and between the receptor and eGFP is a stop in lox2272.

Wait, perhaps the vector is:

Ligand (with CBA promoter) --> stop cassette (loxP) --> mCherry

Then, IRES --> Receptor (ORF) --> stop cassette (lox2272) --> eGFP

Wait, no, the description says the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So the vector has two ORFs: the first is ligand under CBA, then an IRES, then the receptor, followed by the stop cassette (lox2272) and eGFP.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me rephrase.

The vector is bicistronic, meaning two ORFs in one mRNA. So the setup is probably:

5' CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop cassette (loxP) -> mCherry

Then, after the ligand, an IRES, which allows ribosome to translate the second ORF: receptor ORF -> stop cassette (lox2272) -> eGFP.

But wait, that can't be right because the ligand is at 5', so the mRNA would have the ligand first, then IRES, then receptor. So in the mRNA, it's CBA promoter driving the transcription, producing a transcript with ligand, then IRES, then receptor and eGFP.

So when the transcript is made, the ribosome first translates the ligand, then moves to the IRES to translate the receptor.

But in the vector, the ligand is fused to mCherry. So the ligand is at the beginning, followed by a stop cassette (loxP) and mCherry? Or no, the ligand is the ORF, then after stop, mCherry is another ORF? Wait, no, the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry. Hmm, perhaps the ligand has a tag, but if there's a stop cassette between them, maybe that's preventing expression.

Wait, the question says: ligand ORF is at 5' and fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at 3' and fused to eGFP at C-terminus. Between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP cassette. Between receptor and eGFP, a stop in lox2272.

So the ligand ORF is followed by a stop (with loxP), then mCherry. But that would mean that without Cre, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry? Or maybe the ligand is a separate ORF, and mCherry is another, but they're separated by a stop. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a stop and eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the vector is designed so that the first ORF is ligand, with a stop after it (loxP), then mCherry. The second ORF is receptor, with a stop after it (lox2272), then eGFP.

But that doesn't make sense, because then the ligand would be in frame with mCherry? Or perhaps the ligand is a separate ORF, and mCherry is another ORF, but the stop would prevent their expression unless Cre is used to remove the stop.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is: the vector has two cassettes. The first is ligand ORF with CBA promoter, then a stop cassette (loxP), then mCherry. The second is IRES, then receptor ORF, followed by stop (lox2272), then eGFP.

But bicistronic vectors usually have a single promoter for two ORFs. So perhaps the CBA promoter drives the transcription of both ORFs, and the IRES allows the second ORF to be translated.

Wait, perhaps the vector is:

5' CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop (loxP) -> mCherry

Then, downstream is IRES -> receptor
