Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. The question is about identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of the product after a reaction. 

The reaction conditions are: Compound X reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in eliminations. Oh wait, it's also called DBU, a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So maybe this reaction is an elimination, perhaps deprotonating a compound to form a double bond or something like that.

The product's NMR data are given. Let's look at the 1H NMR first. The signals are:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s),
6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d),
7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So the 1H NMR has two singlets integrating to 3H each. That suggests two methyl groups, probably attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, like maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom or aromatic rings but not in a position where neighboring protons cause splitting. 

Then, we have a bunch of aromatic protons. Let's see: 6.75 (d), probably a proton adjacent to substituents. 7.08 (2H, d), maybe part of a para-substituted benzene ring. 7.68 (d) and 7.71 (2H, d) — maybe this is another set of aromatic protons, perhaps a substituent causing some coupling.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s),
126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s),
129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s),
141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s),
197.7 (1C, s).

So the 13C NMR shows two methyl carbons at 21.3 and 28.4. The rest are aromatic carbons, with some quaternary carbons. The 197.7 is a carbonyl carbon. Wait, but the product's 13C doesn't show an oxygenated carbon, unless the oxygen is in another position. Hmm. Or maybe it's an epoxide or something else.

Wait, let me think. The starting compound is X, and after reaction with DBU, which is a strong base, perhaps X is an epoxide that undergoes ring-opening? Or maybe X is something else that gets deprotonated to form a double bond.

Wait, but looking at the options given, all are oxirane derivatives. Oxirane is another name for epoxide. So the product comes from an epoxide reacting with DBU. What kind of reactions do epoxides undergo with strong bases?

Well, epoxides can undergo ring-opening under basic conditions. If DBU is the base, it could deprotonate something adjacent to the epoxide oxygen, leading to ring opening. But wait, if the epoxide is symmetrical, perhaps it's more likely to undergo a rearrangement or elimination.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening via a conjugate addition or some kind of elimination. Or perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed reaction, but DBU is a base, so more like a base-catalyzed process.

Wait, but wait, the product's NMR shows a carbonyl carbon at δ 197.7. That's a strong indication of a ketone or an aldehyde. But let me check the 1H NMR. There's no peak around δ 9-10, which might indicate an aldehyde proton. So maybe it's a ketone. Wait, but how does that happen? If X is an epoxide, and under basic conditions, maybe the epoxide ring opens and forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: the ring-opening of an epoxide can form a diol if it's acid-catalyzed, but under basic conditions, maybe it's a different pathway. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination reaction, forming a double bond. But the product has a carbonyl, so maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the epoxide, leading to ring expansion or a conjugate elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't an epoxide anymore. It's a ketone. So the starting material was an epoxide and after reaction, it becomes a ketone. Or maybe the starting material was a diol that forms an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, looking at the product's 13C NMR, the carbonyl is at 197.7, which is a typical ketone value, perhaps. So the product is a ketone with some aromatic substituents.

Wait, but looking at the options, all of them are oxirane derivatives. So maybe the product isn't an oxirane anymore. So the reaction must have converted the epoxide into something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is an elimination that converts an epoxide into a diene or some conjugated system. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening via nucleophilic attack, but DBU isn't a nucleophile. So perhaps it's more of a base-induced elimination.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an epoxide with a neighboring carbonyl group. Under basic conditions, the epoxide could open to form a carbonyl. For example, imagine an epoxide adjacent to a carbonyl. If the epoxide oxygen is between two carbons, one of which is a carbonyl, then upon ring-opening, you could form a ketone.

Wait, but let me think about the product. The product has a carbonyl, and the aromatic groups. So maybe the starting material was an epoxide that, upon reaction with DBU, underwent ring-opening to form a ketone.

Another thought: some epoxides can rearrange under certain conditions. For example, acid-catalyzed ring opening could lead to a carbonyl via a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement or similar. But wait, DBU is a base, not an acid, so maybe a different mechanism.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps Compound X is an epoxide where ring opening leads to a conjugated carbonyl. Let me think about the product's structure.

Looking at the 1H NMR, let's try to interpret the aromatic protons. The peaks at δ7.71 (2H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d) could be part of a para-substituted benzene ring. Let me imagine something like a styrene group. Let's say we have a benzene ring with two substituents: one at the para position and another at ortho or meta.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows four aromatic protons, two as a doublet (2H, d) and another as a doublet (1H, d). Maybe it's a styryl group, like CH2=CH-C6H4- something.

Wait, the product's 13C NMR has a quaternary carbon at 144.1 and another at 141.5. That could correspond to the carbons in a double bond or aromatic carbons. Let me try to sketch this.

So, the product has two methyl groups (from the 2.28 and 2.31 singlets), a carbonyl group (197.7), and an aromatic ring with substituents. The aromatic protons in the 1H NMR suggest a para-substituted benzene with some coupling.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone with a styryl substituent, like something like (E)-4-methylstyryl ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cinnamaldehyde, but the absence of an aldehyde proton suggests it's a ketone.

Wait, but the 13C NMR has a
