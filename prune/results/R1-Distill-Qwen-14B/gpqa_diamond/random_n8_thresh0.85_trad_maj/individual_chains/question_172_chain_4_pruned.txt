Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So each region of the photosphere behaves like a blackbody in equilibrium.

Wait, right, in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy states can be described by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two states is proportional to the exponential of the energy difference divided by k*T. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor: (n_upper / n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but wait. The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state is higher in star_1. Or wait, perhaps star_1 has higher excitation, so more atoms in the higher energy level. So the ratio n1_upper / n1_lower would be higher than n2_upper / n2_lower.

Wait, but the question says star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited. Oh wait, maybe it's that the number in the excited level is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So for star_1, n1 = 2 * n2, where n2 is the number in the same level in star_2.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the excitation is the fraction in the higher energy level. So maybe the excitation level is proportional to the population in the higher level. So n_upper / (n_upper + n_lower) would be higher for star_1. Hmm, but maybe the question is simplifying it and using the ratio of the populations.

Wait, the key point is that in star_1, the population of the excited state is twice that of star_2's. Or wait, perhaps the excitation is the ratio of the excited to the lower state. So if it's twice as excited, that ratio would be twice as much. Wait, maybe the problem states that the excitation level is twice, which relates to the ratio of excited to ground state.

Actually, the problem says that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. So let's focus on the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann factor is (n_upper / n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

In star_1, n1_upper / n1_lower = x, and in star_2, n2_upper / n2_lower = y.

But according to the problem, the excitation is twice as much in star_1. I'm a bit confused about what exactly is being compared. Wait, maybe the ratio (n_upper)/(n_lower) is twice as large in star_1 compared to star_2. So x = 2y.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is the number in the upper level, and star_1 has twice that
