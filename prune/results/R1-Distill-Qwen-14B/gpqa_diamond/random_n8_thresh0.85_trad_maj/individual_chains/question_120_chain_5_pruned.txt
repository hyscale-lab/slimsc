Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh wait, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther, the parallax is smaller.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution would mean that the number of stars doesn't depend on where you look in the sky, but how does that translate to their distribution in space?

Wait, I think it's about the density in 3D space. Oh right, if stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (stars per volume) is constant. So the number of stars within a certain volume depends on that volume.

Now, parallax is in parsecs. Parallax p is 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if I have a range of parallaxes, say from p to p + dp, what's the corresponding distance range? Let's see, when p increases (parallax is larger), the distance d decreases. Because p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. So a small change dp in parallax corresponds to a change in distance. Let me find the relation between dp and dd.

Differentiating p = 1/d: dp = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = -d² dp. But since d = 1/p, substituting gives dd = - (1/p)^2 dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases (more parallax), d decreases (closer). So the change in distance for a given change in parallax depends on 1/p².

But wait, I'm looking for the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So let's think about the volume between two distances. The volume between d and d+dd is approximately 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be the volume multiplied by the number density, which is constant.

So number of stars N = n * 4πd² dd. Since n is constant, let's see how this translates into parallax terms. Because d = 1/p, then:

d = 1/p → dd = -1/p² dp (from differentiation, but the negative just indicates direction, so I'll take absolute values for the count).

Substituting into N:

N = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp.

Wait, no, because dd is (1/p²) dp. Wait, earlier I had dd = - d² dp → but since d = 1/p, dd = -(1/p²) dp. Taking the absolute value, it's (1/p²) dp.

So N = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp → n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So for a unit range of parallax (like dp =1), N is proportional to 1/p^4. Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So N per dp is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the options are in terms of how the number changes with plx. So as plx (p) increases, 1/p^4 decreases. So the number of stars per unit parallax decreases with p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, which matches. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact reasoning.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The question says: how does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx?

So for each unit increase in plx, how many stars are there?

Wait, let's consider a small range dp in plx. The number of stars in that range is N = n * 4π ∫ (d^2) dd.

Wait, but d = 1/p → dd = -1/p² dp.

So the integral becomes ∫ (d^2) dd = ∫
