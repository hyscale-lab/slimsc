Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I think that means the usual blackbody or thermal equilibrium applies here.

Wait, what do I remember about excitation in stars? Oh right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific level. Let me clarify: does that mean the population of a higher energy level (n_i) is twice that of star_2 for the same level? Or is it in comparison to their ground state? Wait, the problem says "twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for the same energy level, the population is twice as high in star_1 than in star_2.

So, assuming that the energy difference between the two levels is given, and we can probably neglect the statistical weights if they are the same for both stars, since the same element is considered. Or wait, the problem doesn't specify anything about the statistical weights, maybe they’re the same, so g_i = g_j for both stars. So the equation simplifies to (n1 / n2) = exp( -(ΔE)/(k*T1) ) / exp( -(ΔE)/(k*T2) ). Wait, or is n1/n2 = 2?

Wait, let me think. The population ratio between the two levels in star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. So for star_1: n1_level2 / n1_ground = ? And star_2: n2_level2 / n2_ground = ?

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "
