Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stellar astrophysics, when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. Right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states based on temperature and the energy difference between those states.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, so the population of a specific energy level is higher in star_1 compared to star_2. Let me think: the ratio of populations (n1/n2) is 2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, but wait, I think the exact value might not matter because the options are in terms of logarithms, which relate to ratios.

The Boltzmann equation is n_j / n_i = (g_j/g_i) * exp( - (E_j - E_i)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (like degeneracy). In this problem, I think the statistical weights (g_j and g_i) are the same since it's the same element and same transition. So the ratio simplifies to exp( - ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference (E_j - E_i), and k is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. If E_j is higher than E_i (since it's an excited state), then the population ratio n_j/n_i is proportional to exp( - (E_j - E_i)/(k T) ). So for star_1, n1_j is twice n2_j (since star_1 has twice as excited). Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of each star's own ratio.

Wait, the problem says: "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited... compared to star_2". So for each star, the population of the excited state relative to the ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor. Let me denote for star_1: n1 = population of excited level, and n1' the ground state. Similarly, for star_2: n2 and n2'.

But wait, the question says that the ratio (n1/n1') is twice that of (n2/n2'). Or wait, the problem says that in star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. Wait, no, the exact wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited". Oh, perhaps that's comparing the ratio of excited atoms in star_1 to those in star_2. No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question says: "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or perhaps the ratio of excited atoms to something else is twice. Hmm, the exact statement isn't super clear. But I think the key is that the ratio of the excited states in the two stars is 2:1, star_1 having twice as much as star_2.

Wait, perhaps more accurately: For each star, the ratio of the number of excited atoms to the total is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, the ratio would be (g_j/g_i) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, it's (g_j/g_i) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). But since g_j and g_i are the same for both, the ratio between star_1 and star_2's excited atoms would be exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)) )

Wait, because if I take the ratio (n1_excited/n1_total) / (n2_excited/n2_total) ) = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) )

But the problem states that star_1's excited atoms are twice as much as star_2's. Wait no, wait, the question says that the excited level in star_1 is twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps the ratio (n1/n2) is 2. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the question.

It says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or perhaps the ratio of excited to ground state in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

Let me assume that the ratio of excited to ground state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So (n1_excited/n1_ground) = 2 * (n2_excited/n2_ground)

Using Boltzmann, n_excited/n_ground = exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

So, taking natural logs on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/k:

ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T
