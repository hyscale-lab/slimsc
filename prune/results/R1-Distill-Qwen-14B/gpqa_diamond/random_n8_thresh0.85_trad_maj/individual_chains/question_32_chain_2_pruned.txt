Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, like gold nuclei, but in this question, the ion is something else. Let me read the question again.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Oh, and nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes the mass number A = 3 + 3 = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6. But wait, isn't Li usually Li-7? Hmm, maybe that's a typo, but the problem says 3 neutrons, so Li-6 it is. So the mass number A is 6.

So, the problem is about finding the kinetic energy or the total energy? Well, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, it's usually the total energy per particle, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

RHIC accelerates heavy ions to high speeds, so relativistic effects are important. The speed here is 0.96c, which is pretty high. So we need to calculate the relativistic energy of the ion.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m_0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So first, let's compute gamma for v=0.96c. 

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let's calculate 0.96 squared. 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, 1/0.28 is 3.5714 approximately. But let me calculate it more accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784. Wait, no, I think I mixed up. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

But wait, I should check that again. Let me calculate sqrt(0.0784). 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so yes, correct. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c². But the problem gives us the ion's mass as Li with 3 neutrons, which makes it Li-6. So the mass of Li-6 is approximately the mass of 6 nucleons. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a mass of about
