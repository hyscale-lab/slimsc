Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when acetic acid is titrated with NaOH. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my acid-base titrations, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

First, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the initial volume is 40 cm³, right? Because 20 plus 20 is 40. And the concentration after dilution can be calculated using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

Wait, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³, so M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40. Let me compute that. 0.05 times 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. Got that.

Then, we're titrating this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Let me tackle each part separately. First, the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present. So I need to find the volume of NaOH needed for that.

The diluted acetic acid solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M. So moles of acetic acid = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) equals 0.001 moles. Because 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, at equivalence point, the solution is a sodium acetate solution because the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base. Sodium acetate will dissociate completely in water, so the acetate ions will hydrolyze to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

The pH at equivalence point can be calculated using the acetate ion's Kb. Since Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, then Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5. Let's see: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9, which is 5.405e-10. So Kb is about 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point is the moles of acetate divided by the total solution volume. The moles of acetate are 0.001 moles, same as acetic acid initially. The total volume is the initial acetic acid solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (10 cm³), so 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, since Kb is small, we can assume that the hydrolysis of acetate is minimal. So the expression is Kb = [OH-][AcOH]/[Ac-]. But since it's a weak base, I can approximate that [OH-] is sqrt(Kb * C), where C is the concentration.

So [OH-] ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02). Let me compute that.

5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. The square root of that is sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is about 1.04e-5 M.
