Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each providing a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which option gives the desired product with high yield.

Let me start by drawing the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, numbering might be a bit confusing here. Let me think about the numbering. The ethoxy is at position 1, the nitro at position 3, and the tert-butyl at position 2. So positions 1, 2, 3 are all ortho to each other. Alternatively, perhaps I should visualize the benzene ring with substituents in the order that makes sense during the synthesis.

I know that the synthesis of aromatic compounds usually involves electrophilic substitution reactions. The order in which substituents are introduced matters because activating and deactivating groups can influence where the next substituent adds.

Looking at the substituents:

- tert-butyl (a bulky alkyl group) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.
- Ethoxy (OCH2CH3) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.
- Nitro (NO2) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.

Wait, but the nitro group is meta-directing. So if the nitro is added after these groups, it would go in a position relative to them. But in the target molecule, the nitro is at position 3 relative to ethoxy (position 1). Hmm.

Wait, maybe the sequence of adding the groups matters. Let's think: if we add the nitro group first, then the ethoxy, then tert-butyl, or some other order.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director. So if I add nitro first, then the next substituent would go meta to it. Let's say I add nitro first. Then, perhaps adding ethoxy next. But ethoxy is activating, so when I add the next group after ethoxy, it would be directed by both nitro and ethoxy.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added last because it's a strong deactivating group, which might make subsequent reactions difficult. Or maybe it's added earlier.

Wait, the target has nitro at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. So positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So the substituents are 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So they are all meta to each other? Wait, no. Let me imagine the benzene ring:

Position 1: ethoxy

Position 2: tert-butyl

Position 3: nitro

So position 1 is ethoxy. Then position 2 is next to 1 (ortho), position 3 is next to 2 and 1 (so meta to ethoxy, but ortho to tert-butyl).

Wait, perhaps the order of adding the substituents is important. Let me think about how each substituent affects the direction of incoming groups.

Let me outline the target structure again. The benzene ring has:

- Position 1: OCH2CH3 (ethoxy)
- Position 2: C(CH2CH3)3 (tert-butyl)
- Position 3: NO2 (nitro)

So in this arrangement, the ethoxy is at 1, the nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. So each is adjacent to the others. Hmm.

So let me think about the possible synthesis steps. Let's consider the possible order of adding the substituents.

Option 1: Add the ethoxy group first.

Benzene â†’ nitration? No, wait, ethoxy is activating, so after ethoxy is added
