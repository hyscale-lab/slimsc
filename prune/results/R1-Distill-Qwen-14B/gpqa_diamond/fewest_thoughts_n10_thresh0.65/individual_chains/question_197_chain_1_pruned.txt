Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, sounds like a typical reaction mechanism problem.

Alright, let's start by analyzing the spectral data given for Compound X. The IR and NMR data should give me clues about the functional groups and structure of the compound.

Looking at the IR first: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates an O-H stretch or possibly an N-H. But wait, 3400-2500 is a broad range, so maybe it's an O-H from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator. That's a carbonyl group, likely a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300 and a strong carbonyl around 1700. So maybe that's a carboxylic acid. Or maybe an ester? Esters also have carbonyls around 1720. Let me think.

Then there's the 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ peaks. Those are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So the molecule probably has an aromatic ring. The 1610 is around where conjugated carbonyls or aromatic rings with substituents might show up. So maybe a benzene ring with substituents that have electron-withdrawing groups, like a carbonyl.

Moving on to the NMR. The 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Aromatic protons usually aren't that high, unless it's a proton on an electronegative group attached to the ring. Wait, 10.5 is really high. That's more characteristic of an aldehyde proton. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an O-H proton from a carboxylic acid. But wait, the O-H in carboxylic acids is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So maybe that's where it's coming from. Or perhaps an alpha proton to a carbonyl, but those are usually lower. Wait, maybe it's a phenolic O-H, but those are usually broader and can appear around 5-10 ppm, depending on substitution. But this is 10.5, more like a carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet. Aromatic protons, probably para-substituted. So if the ring has two substituents in the para positions, the protons adjacent would be doublets. Maybe a para-substituted benzene, like para-methyl or para-ethyl.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Also a doublet. So same as the above, but maybe in a different position. Hmm, but wait, maybe it's a meta substitution? No, because in a para-substituted benzene
