Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum states. Hmm, I need to figure out the momentum of the photon that's absorbed for the molecule to switch to the next state. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which probably means the lowest energy state. The model being used is the quantum rotation-vibration model, or non-rigid rotor model. Wait, wait—I remember that the non-rigid rotor model accounts for the bond length changing during rotation, but I'm not too sure. But for this problem, maybe the main thing is calculating energy transitions.

The molecule is X and Y, with masses given as Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. I need to find the photon's momentum when the molecule moves to the next lowest state.

Wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized both for rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation (v=0) and vibration (n=0 or something like that).

But wait, the question is about moving to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So what's the next state? I think the next state would be the next higher energy state, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the problem says 'the next state with the lowest possible energy'—so probably the next state is the one with the least energy required, which would be the first excited vibrational state because vibrational energy is higher per quantum than rotational.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because in a diatomic molecule, the rotational energy levels are closer together than vibrational. So the next state after the fundamental (ground) state would be the first vibrational state (n=1), or perhaps the first rotational state (like J=1). But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the energy levels for a diatomic molecule in the rotational-vibration model are given by the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental state is when both n and J are at their lowest. So the molecule is in n=0 (vibrational ground state) and J=0 (rotational ground state). The next state could be either n=1 (vibrational first excited) or J=1 (rotational first excited). But which transition requires less energy?

The vibrational energy levels are given
