Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has molecules where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K, which is about 4Â°C. Interesting.

Then, there's another part about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.

First, let's think about gas W. Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for a molecule, each atom's neutrons and protons would contribute. Let's think about possible gases. Hydrogen gas (H2) has 1 proton and 0 neutrons per atom, but that doesn't fit. Helium is He, but that's monoatomic. Wait, maybe CO2 or something else? Wait, no. Wait, the number of neutrons and protons in the molecule as a whole.

Wait, no, the problem says the molecule of gas W has same number of neutrons and protons. So for a molecule, each atom contributes. Let's think about possible molecules where the total protons equal total neutrons.

Wait, maybe H2O? No, because H has 1 proton and O has 8. So H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton) and one O (8). So protons: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: H has 0, O has 8 (if it's the common isotope). So 0 +8 =8 for neutrons. Not equal.

What about CH4? No, that's a gas but doesn't fit. Maybe CO? No, let's think of something else. What about NH3? No, because it's a gas but not sure. Wait, maybe it's a diatomic molecule. Let's think of H2: each H has 1 proton. So 2 protons. Each H has 0 neutrons. So total pro
