Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The task is to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I need to find the eigenvectors of the operator P corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. But wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So maybe I should first find the components of the operator P in the direction of n.

Wait, no, wait. The operator given is P, which is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, P_z. So, the actual operator we're interested in is the component of P along the direction n. Because the problem says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane." So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which implies that n has components (nx, 0, nz), since y-component is zero.

Wait, no, wait. If n is in the x-z plane, then its y-component is zero. So n can be represented as (n_x, 0, n_z). But since it's a unit vector, n_x² + nz² = 1.

So the operator along direction n would be the dot product of the vector operator P and the direction vector n. So the operator is P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because the y-component of n is zero, so there's no P_y term.

Wait, but wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so P·n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding component of n. So yes, n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y=0. So it's n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So the operator we're looking at is (n_x P_x + n_z
