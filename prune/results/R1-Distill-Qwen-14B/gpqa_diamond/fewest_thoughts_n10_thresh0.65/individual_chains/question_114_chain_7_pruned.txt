Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the problem is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through what each reaction involves.

The first reaction is butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, so butan-2-one is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with cyanide, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. Typically, ketones react with HCN to form cyanohydrins. But here, the reagent is NaCN. So maybe it's a similar situation. NaCN is a source of CN- ions.

So the reaction is probably the formation of a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + HCN â†’ cyanohydrin. But wait, in this case, they're using NaCN. How does that work? Oh, right, sometimes you need an acid catalyst. Because the CN- is a weak nucleophile, so it might not attack the carbonyl on its own. So you add an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A for reagent A) to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So the CN- can attack the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen becomes -OH, which then gets deprotonated by something else, maybe the Na+ from NaCN.

So for reagent A, it's probably H3O+ because that's the acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation. So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm, I don't think NaHSO3 is an acid catalyst here. So maybe A is H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it reacts with reagent B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, so the nitrile group is converting into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions to form carboxylic acids
