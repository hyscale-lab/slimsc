Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding an eigenvector for a given operator. Hmm, let me think. The question is a bit dense, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that we have a quantum mechanical operator P with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Oh wait, right, so the operator P is a vector operator, meaning it has components in x, y, and z directions. The eigenvector we're looking for is for the operator along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, so the direction n is in the x-z plane. That means the direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in the x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal angle) would be zero since it's around the y-axis. Because the direction vector is in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So the direction is determined by θ, the polar angle from the z-axis.

The operator along direction n would be the vector sum of the components. So the operator P·n would be P_x multiplied by the x-component of n plus P_z multiplied by the z-component. Since n is in x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so P_y isn't involved here.

Wait, more accurately, the operator along n is P·n = P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n = P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z.

But wait, the problem says that the muon is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So for the eigenvalue equation: (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So our task is to find the eigenvector of the operator (P·n) with eigenvalue ħ/2.

Wait, but wait. The operator P is given as components. Let me write down each component matrix.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]].
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

So, the operator P·n would be (n_x P_x) + (n_y P_y) + (n_z P_z). But since n is in x-z plane, n_y = 0, so P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So substituting:

P·n = sinθ (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Let me factor out ħ/2:

P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Let me compute the matrix inside:

The (1,1) element is cosθ.
The (1,2) element is sinθ.
The (2,1) element is sinθ.
The (2,2) element is -cosθ.

So the matrix is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So P·n = (ħ/2) * this matrix.

We're looking for eigenvectors of this matrix with eigenvalue ħ/2. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, wait. The eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no. Wait, the operator is P·n = that matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So when we write (P·n) |ψ> = λ |ψ>, λ would be the eigenvalue. We're told the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So,

( (P·n) ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

But let's write the matrix equation. Let me denote the matrix as M:

M = [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So P·n = (ħ/2) * M.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

(ħ/2) M |ψ> = λ |ψ>.

We're told λ = +ħ/2. So,

(ħ/2) M |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Divide both sides by (ħ/2):

M |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix M must have an eigenvector |ψ> with eigenvalue 1.

So the equation is (M - I) |ψ> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So, M - I = [ [cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ]

We can write the equations from this:

(cosθ -1) ψ₁ + sinθ ψ₂ = 0

sinθ ψ₁ + (-cosθ -1) ψ₂ = 0

We can set up the first equation:

(cosθ -1) ψ₁ + sinθ ψ₂ = 0 → equation (1)

From equation (1):

ψ₂ = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] ψ₁

Assuming sinθ ≠ 0, which it is unless θ=0 or π, but those are edge cases.

So ψ₂ = (1 - cosθ)/(sinθ) ψ₁.

We can use the identity (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So:

(1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = tan(θ/2).

So ψ₂ = tan(θ/2) ψ₁.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ ψ₁, tan(θ/2) ψ₁ ]^T. Let's let ψ₁ = A, then ψ₂ = A tan(θ/2).

So the vector is A [1, tan(θ/2)]^T.

We can normalize this vector. The normalization condition is |A|^2 (1 + tan²(θ/2)) ) = 1.

But 1 + tan²(x) = sec²(x) = 1/cos²(x).

So,

|A|^2 * [1 + tan²(θ/2)] = |A|^2 * sec²(θ/2) ) = 1.

So |A|^2 = cos²(θ/2) → A = cos(θ/2) / sqrt( something ), wait.

Wait, let me compute normalization:

The vector is [ A, A tan(θ/2) ].

The squared magnitude is |A|^2 (1 + tan²(θ/2)) ) = |A|^2 * sec²(θ/2) ) = 1.

So,

|A|² = 1 / sec²(θ/2) ) → |A| = cos(θ/2).

Assuming A is real for simplicity, since eigenvectors can be real in this case.

So A = cos(θ/2), so the components are:

ψ₁ = cos(θ/2), ψ₂ = sin(θ/2), because tan(θ/2) = sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2), so ψ₂ = cos(θ/2) * [sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2)] = sin(θ/2).

Wait, let me check:

ψ₂ = A tan(θ/2) = cos(θ/2) * [sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2)] = sin(θ/2).

So the vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but wait a second. Because when I set ψ₁ = A = cos(θ/2), then psi_2 is sin(theta/2). So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But wait, wait a second. I think I made a mistake because in the setup, the vector is in two dimensions, so in the spin-1/2 system. The eigenvectors are usually for spin up or down along a certain axis.

Wait, but let me think again. The eigenvalue equation we had was M |ψ> = |ψ>, since (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ> → (ħ/2 M) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ> → M |ψ> = |ψ>.

So yes, the eigenvalue is 1 for matrix M. So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is the same as the spin-up state along direction theta in the x-z plane.

So the normalized eigenvector components are [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check:

Option C is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Option D is [ sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but wait, the vector I found is just [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is option C.

But let me think again. The problem statement says the eigenvector is for the operator P·n. Because the operator is (ħ/2) M, the eigenvalue is (ħ/2) * 1 = ħ/2, which matches the given condition.

But the question is about the eigenvector's elements. So the answer would be option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, looking at the other options:

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Option D has a sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, multiplied by hbar, but I don't think hbar would be in the eigenvector components because eigenvectors are dimensionless in this context. Wait, the given options have some with hbar, but in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors are usually dimensionless, so perhaps the options with hbar are incorrect.

Wait, but wait: The operator P is given in terms of matrices with elements multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator's matrix is, for example, P_x = (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the eigenvectors would be vectors of the same dimension as the operator's space, which is spin-1/2.

But when I computed the normalized eigenvector, I found it to be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is correct for spin-up in the direction theta in the x-z plane.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is exactly that, (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So I think the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem gives the options in terms of hbar. Wait, no, option C doesn't have hbar. The eigenvectors are usually represented without hbar because they are states, not operators. So in the options, it's more likely that option C is correct.

Wait, but let me look at the other options. Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by hbar and theta/2. Hmm, but I don't see where those factors come from in my calculation. Unless I missed something about the direction of the vector or other components.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me recheck.

Wait, the operator P·n is given by (n_x P_x + n_z P_z), because n_y = 0. The components are:

n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

So P·n = sin(theta) P_x + cos(theta) P_z.

Each of these is (ħ/2) times their respective matrices.

So when I calculate P·n, it's (ħ/2) [ sin(theta) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos(theta) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Which gives the matrix:

[ [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ],
  [ sin(theta), -cos(theta) ] ]

So the matrix is correct.

Then I set up M |psi> = |psi>, leading to the equations.

So, the eigenvector I found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Which is option C.

Wait, another way to think: The operator P·n is proportional to the spin component along n. The eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along n. For spin-1/2, the spin-up state is given by [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T, but in our case, phi is zero since n is in the x-z plane (so phi = 0), so the state becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So yes, that's option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ for a muon, where $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane and the eigenvalue is $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as follows:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be represented as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$. The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is then given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z
\]

Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right)
\]

Simplifying the matrix:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) |\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\psi\rangle
\]

Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, we get:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} |\psi\rangle = |\psi\rangle
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\left( \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \right) |\psi\rangle = 0
\]

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} |\psi\rangle = 0
\]

From the first row of the matrix equation:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1) \psi_1 + \sin\theta \psi_2 = 0
\]

Solving for $\psi_2$:

\[
\psi_2 = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} \psi_1
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$, so:

\[
\psi_2 = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \psi_1
\]

The eigenvector can thus be written as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \psi_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}
\]

To normalize, we impose:

\[
|\psi_1|^2 \left( 1 + \tan^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \right) = 1
\]

Using the identity $1 + \tan^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \sec^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$:

\[
|\psi_1|^2 \sec^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 1 \implies |\psi_1| = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}
\]

This matches option **C**, which is:

\[
\left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \right)
\]

The other options are incorrect because:

- **A** and **D** include $\hbar$, which is not part of the eigenvector components.  
- **B** introduces an $e^{i\phi}$ factor, which is unnecessary since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane ($\phi = 0$).  

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
