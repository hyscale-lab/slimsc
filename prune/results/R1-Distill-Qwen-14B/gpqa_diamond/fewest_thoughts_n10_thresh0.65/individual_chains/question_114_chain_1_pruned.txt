Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about identifying the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose between options A to D for the reagents A and B.

Hmm, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. Adding NaCN and reagent A gives a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN is a nucleophile. So this sounds like a nucleophilic addition reaction. Oh right, the formation of a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin forms when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion.

But wait, in the product, the structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the cyanide added to the carbonyl, making a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group. But how does the reaction proceed? Normally, the cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl, but maybe under certain conditions. Oh, I think the reaction requires an acid catalyst because the carbonyl might not be reactive enough otherwise. So NaCN is a good nucleophile, but the reaction might not proceed without an acid.

Wait, what's the role of reagent A here? If butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN and A, then A must be providing a protic environment or perhaps an acid catalyst. Alternatively, maybe it's about the reaction conditions. Oh wait, if the reaction is done under acidic conditions, then the NaCN would be present in a solution that's slightly acidic. So H3O+ (proton source) would help generate the cyanide ion. Because NaCN is a salt, in acidic solution, CN- might be present.

Alternatively, sometimes for such additions, an acid like H2SO4 is used. Oh wait, but the options for A are H3O+ (which is just a proton source, maybe from HCl or something) or NaHSO3 (which is a source of HSO3^-). But I'm a bit confused about the first step.

So, for the formation of the cyanohydrin, the typical reagents are a ketone, HCN, and an acid catalyst. Oh wait, but NaCN in aqueous solution would need an acid to generate the HCN. Wait, actually, NaCN is a good source of CN- ions, but in acidic conditions, HCN can form. Alternatively, maybe the reaction proceeds through a protonation.

Wait, but the first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the addition is of CN- to the ketone. But for that, you usually need an acid catalyst. Because the ketone is not very reactive, so the acid helps protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, which
