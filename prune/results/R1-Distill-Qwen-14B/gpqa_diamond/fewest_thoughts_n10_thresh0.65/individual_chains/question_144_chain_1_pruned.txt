Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV.

Wait, I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and their mean lifetime is related to their width. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy times the uncertainty in time is approximately hbar over 2. So, the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the width Γ.

So the formula I think is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I should double-check the exact expression. Oh yeah, I think Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy uncertainty in the particle's rest frame. So the uncertainty in time is ħ divided by Γ. That makes sense.

But wait, the particle is produced with a certain energy, not necessarily at rest. So that probably affects the decay length. The mean decay distance L would be the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime τ, right? Because L = v * τ.

But since the particle has a lot of energy, it's moving relativistically. So I need to calculate its velocity, maybe using the energy and mass. Let's think about relativistic mechanics.

The energy E of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Oh wait, E_X is given as 8 GeV. So I can find the momentum p from this equation. Let me rearrange it: p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) ) / c². Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused with the units here. Let me write it more carefully.

E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (p c)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2 → p c = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / c → wait, maybe it's better to work in units where c=1 for the initial steps. Because in particle physics, people often use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1. So maybe I can proceed that way.

So E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c² (but in natural units, m is 1.2 GeV). So p² = E² - m² → p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) GeV. Let me compute that. 8^2 is 64, 1.2^2 is 1.44, so 64 -1.44 is 62.56. The square root of 62.56 is approximately 7.91 GeV/c. Wait, wait, in natural units, p would be GeV/c if c isn't set to 1. Hmm, maybe this is getting messy. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, since E is much larger than m, maybe we can approximate the velocity as being close to the speed of light. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Let's proceed step by step.

First, calculate the lifetime τ. τ = ħ / Γ. But I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let's convert Γ into GeV units since the others are in GeV. Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Now, ħ in units of GeV·s is necessary. I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) → let me compute that.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, that's τ. Then, the mean lifetime is about 2.056875e-24 s.

Next, I need to find the velocity v of the particle. To find v, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. E = γ m c² and p = γ m v. Alternatively, I can compute the velocity using the relation between E and m.

In natural units (c=1, ħ=1), E = sqrt(p² + m²). So p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) ≈ sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c. So the momentum is about 7.91 GeV/c.

Then
