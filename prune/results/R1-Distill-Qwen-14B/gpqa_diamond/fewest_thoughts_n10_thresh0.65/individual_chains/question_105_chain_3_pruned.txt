Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem is about a star similar to the Sun, with some spots on it. The question is asking about the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spots. So, the scenario is that when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing the observed brightness to dip periodically. But if instead, it were an exoplanet transiting the star, what size planet would cause the same dip in brightness, or the same amplitude in the light curve?

Let me jot down the given data:

- Star's radius (Rstar) is equal to the Sun's radius. Let's denote the Sun's radius as Rsun, so Rstar = Rsun.
- Hemisphere has dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Hmm, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots, right? So 20% coverage on one side.
- The star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K.
- The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So spot temperature is 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.
- The star shows brightness variations due to these spots rotating into and out of view. When the spots are facing us, the brightness dips. But when the star is not spotted (meaning no spots on the side facing us), the same dip would be caused by a planet blocking some light.

Wait, but the question says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, then what planet radius would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve.

So the main idea is to calculate the relative change in brightness (delta F over F, where F is the flux) when the spots are causing a dip, and then find the planet's radius that would cause the same dip.

But wait, how is the star's brightness affected by the spots? The spots are cooler, so when they face us, the total flux decreases. So the observed flux from the star is a combination of the unspotted areas and the spotted areas.

The star emits light based on its temperature and surface area. The flux from a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = sigma * T^4. So the total flux from the star without any spots would be F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * (4 pi Rstar^2) / (4 pi D^2) ) â€” but wait, when considering the total flux, the distance D cancels out when comparing changes, so maybe we can ignore it for this purpose.

But when spots are present, part of the star's surface is emitting less. The filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So the hemisphere has 20% spots. Let me think: the star is a sphere, so one hemisphere is 50% of its surface. So the total spotted area is 0.5 * 20% = 10% of the star's surface. Wait, no. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So if the filling factor is 20%, then
