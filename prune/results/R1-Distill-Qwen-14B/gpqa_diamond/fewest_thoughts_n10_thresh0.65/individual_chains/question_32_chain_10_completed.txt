Alright, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons, which I think makes it Li-6, but wait, wait. Let me think again. Lithium usually has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, that's 3 + 3 = 6, so yes, Li-6. Got it.

Okay, so I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we have to use the theory of relativity, specifically the energy-momentum relation. The total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²).

First, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Wait, how do I find that? Well, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately known, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact value. Let me think. The mass of a nucleus can be found using the atomic mass, which includes protons, neutrons, and electrons. But wait, for heavy ions like Li-6, the electrons are probably negligible compared to the mass of the nucleus, but I'm not sure. Hmm, perhaps I should check. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate using the mass number.

Wait, another approach. The rest mass of the nucleus can be calculated using the mass of its constituent particles. So, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², same for a neutron. But wait, actually, a neutron is slightly more massive than a proton. Let me recall: the proton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So each neutron is a bit heavier.

Wait, but when you form a nucleus, there's a mass defect due to binding energy. So the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons. So I need to compute that. Or is this getting complicated? Alternatively, maybe I can look up the atomic mass of Li-6 in MeV/c².

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Since the problem is about relativistic energy, perhaps I can use the rest mass energy without worrying about the binding energy, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass number and approximate the mass as A * (mass of a proton). But that might not be accurate enough. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the molar mass of Li-6 and convert that into energy. The molar mass of Li-6 is about 6 grams per mole, right? So 6 g/mol is 6e-3 kg/mol. Then, using Avogadro's number (6.022e23 mol^-1), the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus would be (6e-3 kg/mol) / (6.022e23 nuclei/mol) ≈ around 9.96e-27 kg. But wait, that's the mass. But to get the rest energy, I need to multiply by c².

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I can find the rest mass energy of Li-6 directly. Let me think. Oh wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 atomic mass units (u). I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.0151 u multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u gives the rest energy in MeV.

Let me compute that. 6.0151 * 931.5 ≈ Let's calculate step by step.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.0151 * 931.5 ≈ 14.02 MeV.

So total is approximately 5589 + 14.02 ≈ 5603.02 MeV, which is about 5.603 GeV. Wait, that can't be right, because 6 u is 6*931=5586 MeV, so 5.586 GeV, and the 0.0151 adds a little, so around 5.6 GeV.

Wait, but wait. If I'm using the atomic mass, which includes electrons, but for a nucleus, the electrons are not part of the nucleus? Oh wait, no, the atomic mass includes electrons, so for a Li atom, which has 3 electrons, each with mass ~0.511 MeV/c². So 3 electrons would add about 1.534 MeV. But when considering a nucleus, the electrons are not part of it, so perhaps the rest mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the nucleus's rest mass as approximately the same as the atomic mass, because the difference is negligible for the purposes of this problem. Or perhaps the problem uses the mass of the nucleus as approximately A * (mass of a nucleon), but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem gives me a hint. The options are around 20 GeV, 18, 23, etc. So the energy is several times the rest mass energy.

Wait, but let's proceed. So, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is around 5.6 GeV. Now, the speed is 0.96c. So the gamma factor is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that.

v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 (since 0.28^2 is 0.0784). So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

So the total energy is gamma * m c^2. So E = 3.5714 * 5.6 GeV ≈ Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857 GeV.

3.5714 * 0.6 is approximately 2.14284.

So total is about 20.00 GeV. Hmm, that's close to option C (20.132 GeV) and option D (21.419 GeV). But wait, let me do the exact calculation.

Wait, 3.5714 * 5.6 = ?

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857.

3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.1428.

Total: 17.857 + 2.1428 = 20.0 (approximately). But wait, maybe I should be more precise with the gamma calculation.

Wait, v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 10/2.8 = 3.57142857.

So gamma is exactly 35/10 * (10/28) → no, wait, 1/0.28 is 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So 25/7 multiplied by 5.6 GeV.

Wait, 5.6 GeV is 56/10 GeV. So (25/7) * (56/10) GeV.

25 * 56 = 1400.

7 * 10 = 70.

1400 /70 = 20 GeV. So exactly 20 GeV.

But wait, this is under the assumption that the rest mass energy is exactly 5.6 GeV. But earlier, I estimated it as around 5.6 GeV. But what's the precise value?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me double-check.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0151 atomic mass units (u). Each u is 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.0151 * 931.5 MeV.

Let me compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.0151 * 931.5 = 14.02 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.02= 5603.02 MeV → 5.60302 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is approximately 5.60302 GeV.

Now, gamma is 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857. So E = gamma * m c² = (25/7) * 5.60302 GeV.

Compute 5.60302 *25 = 140.0755 GeV.

Divide by 7 → 140.0755 /7 ≈ 20.0108 GeV.

Wait, so about 20.01 GeV. The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Hmm, 20.01 GeV is not exactly any of the options. The closest is C) 20.132 GeV. But wait, perhaps my initial assumption about the rest mass is off.

Wait a second, perhaps I should have considered the mass of the nucleus without the electrons. Because the atomic mass includes electrons, but the nucleus doesn't. So the rest mass of the nucleus is less than the atomic mass by the mass of the electrons.

Wait, Li-6 has 3 electrons. Each electron has a rest mass of 0.5109989461 MeV/c². So three electrons would be about 1.533 MeV.

So the rest mass of the nucleus would be the atomic mass (6.0151 u) multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u minus the mass of the three electrons.

Wait, but 6.0151 u * 931.5 MeV/u = about 5603.02 MeV as before. Then subtract 3 * 0.511 MeV ≈ 1.533 MeV. So 5603.02 - 1.533 = 5601.487 MeV → 5.601487 GeV.

So now E = gamma * (5.601487 GeV) = (25/7) *5.601487.

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.601487 ≈ Let me compute this accurately.

Compute 5.601487 *3 = 16.804461.

5.601487 *0.57142857 ≈ let's compute that.

0.5 *5.601487 = 2.8007435

0.07142857 *5.601487 ≈ approx 5.601487 *0.07143 ≈ 0.4007.

So 2.8007 + 0.4007 = 3.2014.

So total is 16.804461 + 3.2014 ≈ 20.00586 GeV.

Hmm, so around 20.0059 GeV. Which is about 20.006 GeV.

Looking at the options, C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher than 20.006. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute (25/7) *5.601487 GeV.

25/7 is exactly 3.5714285714.

5.601487 * 3.5714285714 = ?

Let me do this multiplication more precisely.

We can write 3.5714285714 as 25/7.

So 5.601487 *25 = 140.037175.

Then divide by 7: 140.037175 /7 = 20.0053107 GeV.

So approximately 20.0053 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is C) 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's about 0.127 GeV higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps the atomic mass of Li-6 is different than what I used. Let me think. I used 6.0151 u, but perhaps I should look up the exact value. Wait, I think the exact mass is 6.0151 u.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the protons and neutrons, without considering binding energy. So 3 protons + 3 neutrons.

Proton mass: ~938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron mass: ~939.565 MeV/c².

So 3*(938.272 +939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV.

Wait, that's 5.633511 GeV.

Hmm, that's higher than the atomic mass approach. Because the binding energy is about (sum of nucleons) - (mass of nucleus) = 5.6335 -5.6015 ≈ 0.032 GeV. So the binding energy is about 32 MeV for Li-6. So the rest mass without binding would be higher.

So using this method, the rest mass would be 5.6335 GeV. Let's compute E again.

E = gamma * m c² = (25/7) *5.6335 GeV.

25/7 is about 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.6335.

Let me compute this.

5 *3.57142857 = 17.85714285.

0.6335 *3.57142857:

0.6 *3.57142857 = 2.14285714.

0.0335 *3.57142857 ≈ 0.119333.

So total is 2.14285714 + 0.119333 = 2.26219.

So total E is 17.85714285 +2.26219 ≈ 20.1193 GeV.

Ah, that's closer to option C) 20.132 GeV. Hmm, so now it's about 20.1193 GeV. Which is about 20.12 GeV, but the option is 20.132.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute 5.6335 * (25/7).

25/7 = 3.5714285714.

5.6335 *3.5714285714.

Let me compute it as:

5.6335 *3 = 16.9005.

5.6335 *0.5714285714.

0.5*5.6335=2.81675.

0.0714285714 *5.6335 ≈ approx 0.0714285714*5.6335.

Let me compute 0.07 *5.6335 = 0.394345.

0.0014285714 *5.6335 ≈ about 0.00807.

So total is about 0.394345 +0.00807 ≈ 0.4024.

So 0.5714285714 *5.6335 ≈ 2.81675 +0.4024 ≈ 3.21915.

So total E = 16.9005 +3.21915 = 20.11965 GeV. So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Which is about 20.12 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV. So close, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I should use exact values for the masses. Let me use more precise numbers.

Proton mass: 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron mass: 939.565 MeV/c².

So 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV →5.633511 GeV.

Gamma is 25/7 →approx 3.571428571.

So E =5.633511 *3.571428571.

Compute 5 *3.571428571 =17.85714285.

0.633511 *3.571428571.

Let me compute 0.633511 *3 =1.900533.

0.633511 *0.571428571.

Hmm, 0.633511 × 0.5 is 0.3167555.

0.633511 × 0.071428571 ≈ approximately 0.633511 * 0.071428571.

0.633511 *0.07 =0.04434577.

0.633511 *0.001428571 ≈0.000904.

Total ≈0.04434577 +0.000904 ≈0.04525.

So 0.633511 ×0.571428571 ≈0.3167555 +0.04525≈0.3620055.

So total 0.633511 ×3.571428571 ≈1.900533 +0.3620055≈2.2625385.

So E ≈17.85714285 +2.2625385 =20.1196813 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV. Hmm, the option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, a difference of about 0.0123 GeV, which is 12 MeV. That's not a huge difference, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy formula differently. Wait, for a heavy ion, perhaps the energy is given as the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Or does the problem refer to the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass) or just the kinetic?

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think the energy being referred to is the total energy (gamma * m c²), not just the kinetic energy.

Wait, but maybe I should compute the total energy and the kinetic energy and see which option fits. Let's compute the kinetic energy (K.E.) as (gamma - 1)*m c².

So for gamma≈3.5714, K.E. = (3.5714-1)*5.6335 GeV →2.5714 *5.6335 ≈ around 14.498 GeV.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps the question is about the total energy, which is about 20.12 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV).

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should consider that the atomic mass I used includes the electrons, but the nucleus doesn't. So using the sum of protons and neutrons gives a higher rest mass, which leads to a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the exact mass of Li-6. Let me think. The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.0151 atomic mass units. So 6.0151 u *931.5 MeV/u = 6.0151 *931.5 = let me compute that.

6 *931.5=5589.

0.0151 *931.5=14.02.

So 5603 MeV, which is 5.603 GeV.

So E = (25/7)*5.603 GeV.

25/7 is about 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.603 → let's compute:

5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.603 *3.57142857.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.003 *3.57142857=0.0107142857.

So 2.14285714 +0.0107142857=2.15357142.

So total E ≈17.85714285 +2.15357142 =20.010714 GeV.

So approximately 20.0107 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is C) 20.132 GeV. But that's over 0.12 GeV higher, which is a significant difference.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 5.603 *25/7.

5.603 *25 =140.075.

140.075 /7 =20.010714 GeV.

Hmm, so that's about 20.0107 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's a difference of about 0.121 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is higher than 5.603 GeV. Because when I used the sum of protons and neutrons, I got 5.6335 GeV, which gave an energy of about 20.12 GeV, closer to option C.

So perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the individual nucleons' rest masses, ignoring binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the ion as m = A * (mass of a proton), which is an approximation. Let's see: Li-6 has A=6, so 6 *938.272 MeV/c² =5629.632 MeV →5.629632 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.629632 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.629632.

5 *3.5714 =17.857.

0.629632 *3.5714 ≈ let's compute 0.6 *3.5714=2.1428. 0.029632*3.5714≈0.1056. So total 2.1428 +0.1056=2.2484.

So E≈17.857 +2.2484=20.1054 GeV.

Still a bit less than option C. But option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact gamma calculation is a bit more precise. Because when I calculated gamma as 1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2), perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216. 1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, right? Because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the rest mass is more accurately 5.603 GeV. So E=3.5714 *5.603=20.0107 GeV.

So the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let me think. No, the question says the energy of the collider to reach that speed. Typically, the collider's energy refers to the total energy, not kinetic.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the exact value of sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) more accurately. Wait, but I already did that. It's exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the rest mass in terms of exact MeV.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is actually 6.015132 u, which is more precise. Let me compute that.

6.015132 u *931.499563 MeV/u = ?

6.015132 *931.499563 = let's compute.

6 *931.499563 =5588.997378 MeV.

0.015132 *931.499563 ≈0.015132 *931.5 ≈14.022 MeV.

So total is 5588.997378 +14.022 →5603.019378 MeV →5.603019378 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.603019378.

Which is 3.57142857 *5.603019378.

Let me compute this using a calculator approach.

Multiply 3.57142857 by 5.603019378.

Break it down:

3 *5.603019378 =16.80905813.

0.57142857 *5.603019378.

0.5 *5.603019378 =2.801509689.

0.07142857 *5.603019378 ≈0.07142857 *5.603 =0.401334.

So 2.801509689 +0.401334=3.202843689.

So total E=16.80905813 +3.202843689=20.01190182 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.0119 GeV.

So 20.0119 GeV, and the closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is higher by about 0.12 GeV.

Hmm, but that's a significant difference. Did I make a mistake in the rest mass? Or perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the nucleus as (A * m_p), where m_p is the proton mass. So Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3p +3n). So 6 * m_p.

m_p=938.272 MeV/c² →6 *938.272=5629.632 MeV →5.629632 GeV.

So E=gamma *5.629632 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.629632 → Let me compute:

5.629632 *3 =16.888896.

5.629632 *0.57142857.

0.5 *5.629632=2.814816.

0.07142857 *5.629632≈0.402351.

So 2.814816 +0.402351=3.217167.

Total E=16.888896 +3.217167=20.106063 GeV.

So approximately 20.106 GeV. So option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, but the problem says the precision is at 1e-4, so four decimal places. So perhaps my initial calculation was missing some precise factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy equation differently. Let me recheck the formula.

The total relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c².

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v =0.96c.

So v² =0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

Gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's correct.

Perhaps the error is in the rest mass calculation. Let me find the exact rest mass of Li-6.

Looking it up, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.015132 u.

So 6.015132 u *931.499563 MeV/u = 6.015132 *931.499563.

Let me compute this more accurately.

6 *931.499563 =5588.997378 MeV.

0.015132 *931.499563 → Let me compute 0.01 *931.499563=9.31499563.

0.005132 *931.499563.

0.005 *931.499563=4.657497815.

0.000132 *931.499563≈0.1229.

So 4.657497815 +0.1229=4.780397815.

So 0.015132 *931.499563=9.31499563 +4.780397815=14.09539344 MeV.

So total mass energy is 5588.997378 MeV +14.09539344 MeV =5603.092771 MeV →5.603092771 GeV.

So E=gamma *5.603092771 GeV.

So 3.57142857 *5.603092771.

Let me compute this precisely.

3 *5.603092771=16.80927831.

0.57142857 *5.603092771.

0.5 *5.603092771=2.801546385.

0.07142857 *5.603092771.

Compute 5.603092771 *0.07142857.

0.07 *5.603092771=0.3922165.

0.00142857 *5.603092771≈0.007997.

So total is 0.3922165 +0.007997=0.4002135.

So 0.57142857 *5.603092771=2.801546385 +0.4002135=3.201759885.

So E=16.80927831 +3.201759885=20.01103819 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.0110 GeV.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match, but the closest is C) 20.132 GeV. But that's 0.121 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the rest mass. Let me think again. The rest mass of the nucleus is the mass when it's at rest. The atomic mass includes electrons, but the nucleus doesn't. So the rest mass of the nucleus is equal to the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

Wait, but in reality, the nucleus doesn't have the electrons. So for Li-6, which is a +3 charge (since Li has 3 protons, and it's Li^3+), but in the collider, it's probably in the form of a bare nucleus, so the electrons are not part of it. So the rest mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the electrons' rest mass.

So the atomic mass is 6.015132 u, which includes 3 electrons. So the rest mass of the nucleus is 6.015132 u - 3*(electron mass in u).

Electron mass is about 0.00054858 u.

So 3 electrons: 0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass: 6.015132 - 0.00164574 =6.01348626 u.

Now, convert to MeV: 6.01348626 u *931.499563 MeV/u.

6 *931.499563 =5588.997378 MeV.

0.01348626 *931.499563 = let's compute.

0.01 *931.499563=9.31499563 MeV.

0.00348626 *931.499563.

0.003 *931.499563=2.79449869 MeV.

0.00048626 *931.499563≈0.4527 MeV.

So total 9.31499563 +2.79449869 +0.4527≈12.5622 MeV.

So total nucleus mass energy is 5588.997378 +12.5622 ≈5601.5596 MeV →5.6015596 GeV.

Now compute E=gamma *5.6015596.

Gamma=3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.6015596.

Compute 3 *5.6015596=16.8046788.

0.57142857*5.6015596.

0.5 *5.6015596=2.8007798.

0.07142857 *5.6015596≈approx 0.40139.

So 0.57142857 *5.6015596=2.8007798 +0.40139=3.20217.

Total E=16.8046788 +3.20217=20.0068488 GeV.

So approximately 20.0068 GeV.

Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is still higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the rest mass without considering the electrons, but instead just the sum of protons and neutrons. Let's see: 3p +3n as before.

So 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565)= 3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV →5.633511 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.633511.

Which is (25/7)*5.633511.

25/7=3.57142857.

So 5.633511 *3.57142857.

3*5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857*5.633511=3.217185.

Total=20.117718 GeV.

So approximately 20.1177 GeV.

Which is very close to option C) 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use this method, ignoring the binding energy and the electrons.

Given that, the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, but my calculation here gives 20.1177 GeV, which is below option C. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation.

Wait, 5.633511 *3.57142857.

Let me compute this accurately:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.033511 *3.57142857≈0.119333.

So 2.14285714 +0.119333=2.26219.

Wait, no, that approach isn't correct. Let me use the exact multiplication.

5.633511 *3.57142857.

Let me compute step by step.

5.633511 *3 =16.900533.

5.633511 *0.5 =2.8167555.

5.633511 *0.07142857.

Compute 0.07 *5.633511=0.39434577.

0.00142857 *5.633511≈0.007997.

So 0.39434577 +0.007997=0.40234277.

So 5.633511 *0.57142857=2.8167555 +0.40234277=3.21909827.

So total E=16.900533 +3.21909827=20.11963127 GeV.

So approximately 20.1196 GeV, which is about 20.1196 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.01237 GeV higher.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses without considering binding energy, which gives E≈20.1196 GeV, which is close to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a miscalculation in the gamma factor.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precise v.

v=0.96c → v²=0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

But perhaps I should compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

Wait, 0.28^2=0.0784 exactly, so the square root is exactly 0.28.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So no error there.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the nucleus as a point particle without accounting for any binding energy or other factors, leading to the higher rest mass. In that case, the rest mass would be higher, leading to a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the exact rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. According to some sources, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus (in MeV/c²) is approximately 5.6015 GeV. So E=gamma *5.6015 GeV=3.57142857 *5.6015≈20.011 GeV.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total energy including the kinetic energy, but that's the same as the total energy. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem made a mistake in the options, but more likely, I must have made a mistake in my approach. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things.

Another approach: perhaps the energy is the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

If that's the case, then KE = (gamma -1) * m c².

With m c²=5.603 GeV.

Gamma=3.5714.

So KE=2.5714 *5.603 ≈14.43 GeV.

But the options are all higher than that, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is expressed in terms of the rest mass of the nucleons, not the nucleus. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon, but that doesn't fit the options either.

Wait, let me look back at the options. The options are:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So option C is 20.132, which is close to my 20.1196 calculation when using the sum of nucleon masses. So perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using more precise rest mass.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the mass of the entire Li atom, including electrons, but that would make the rest mass higher, leading to a higher energy.

But Li-6 has 3 electrons, so including them would add 3*0.511 MeV=1.533 MeV, which is 0.001533 GeV. So that would take the energy from 20.01 GeV to about 20.01 + 0.001533=20.0115 GeV, still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV, given that it's the closest to my calculations when using the sum of nucleon masses.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The speed of the nucleus is \( v = 0.96c \). Substituting into the Lorentz factor:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus
The rest mass energy of the nucleus is calculated using the atomic mass of Li-6, which is approximately \( 6.0151 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
m c^2 = 6.0151 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5603.02 \, \text{MeV} = 5.60302 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Substituting \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m c^2 \approx 5.60302 \, \text{GeV} \) into the energy equation:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.60302 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
E = (3 \times 5.60302) + (0.5714 \times 5.60302)
\]

\[
E = 16.80906 + 3.2016 \approx 20.0107 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.0107 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

The closest match is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which is slightly higher than the calculated value due to potential approximations in the rest mass or rounding errors.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
