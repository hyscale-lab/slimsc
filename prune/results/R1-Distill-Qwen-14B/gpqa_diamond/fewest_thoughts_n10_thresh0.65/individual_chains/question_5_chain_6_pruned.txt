Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators like P have eigenvectors corresponding to specific eigenvalues, which usually represent the possible outcomes of a measurement.

Wait, wait. So, the operator P is given in terms of its components: Px, Py, Pz. Each of these components is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, I think the operator P along an arbitrary direction n can be written as the dot product of the vector of Pauli matrices with the direction vector n. Or wait, no, the operator for the component along direction n would be P·n, right? Because the total angular momentum operator in the direction n is the sum of each component multiplied by the respective component of n.

So, the operator P is given, but the problem says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane." So, the direction vector n must have components (nx, 0, nz). Since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So, n is (nx, 0, nz). Also, it's a unit vector, so nx² + nz² = 1.

The operator P along n would be P·n = nx P_x + nz P_z. Because the y-component of n is zero, the Py term isn't present. Oh wait, the full operator would be sum over i (P_i * n_i), so yeah, that would be nx P_x + nz P_z.

Each of the P_i matrices is scaled by ħ/2. So, P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix, and P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

So, the operator for P along n is (ħ/2)(nx σ_x + nz σ_z), where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices. So, the matrix form of this operator is (ħ/2) times
