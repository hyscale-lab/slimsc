Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand everything.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are several steps with different reagents, and some hints provided. Plus, there are four options to choose from. Hmm, let me break it down.

First, the reaction steps are:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints are:
a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) IR peaks: A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has one around 1715 cm^-1.

So, I need to figure out what each compound is based on these reactions and the hints.

Starting with hint a). The reaction of compound A with a phosphorous ylide gives 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction, which forms alkenes. So, compound A must have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) because that's what the Wittig reacts with.

Looking at the product from the Wittig reaction: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The structure of that would be a cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached via the double bond. So, the Wittig would have added a new alkene to the ring.

Wait, no. The Wittig takes a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and replaces it with an alkene. So, if the product after the Wittig has a double bond, that would mean the starting compound A had a carbonyl group in that position.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to draw that. So, cyclopentane with methyl groups at C1 and C2. Then, at C4, there's a substituent which is CH2-C(CH3)= (propan-2-ylidene is (CH2)2C=CH? Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Propan-2-ylidene would be something like CH2-C(CH3)-, but as a ylide, it's CH2=C(CH3)-PPh3+ or something, but in the product, it's a substituent. So the product has a double bond because the Wittig forms it.

Wait, perhaps the product is cyclopentane with a ring substituent. So,
