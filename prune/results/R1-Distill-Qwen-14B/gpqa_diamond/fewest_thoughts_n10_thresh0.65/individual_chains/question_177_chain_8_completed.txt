Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it step by step.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars. Let me read it again. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength due to blackbody radiation. Oh wait, the peak wavelength is related to the star's temperature. So maybe I can use Wien's Law here.

Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature T. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 equals T2.

But wait, that can't be right because usually, more massive stars are hotter. Hmm... Wait, the problem says that the peak wavelengths are the same. So regardless of their masses, the temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2.

Now, the problem asks about the luminosity ratio. Luminosity of a star as a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. Since T is the same for both stars, the ratio of L1 to L2 would be (R1/R2)^2 multiplied by (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, the (T) part is (1)^4 = 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Wait, R1 is 1.5 times R2. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options have 2.25, 2.32, 2.35, 2.23. So option A is 2.25. But wait, I'm not considering all the factors.

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh, right! Because when a star is moving towards or away from us, it causes a Doppler shift in its spectrum. The radial velocity could affect the observed wavelength, but the question says they found the peak wavelengths to be the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift is already accounted for, meaning their intrinsic temperatures are the same?

Wait, no. The radial velocity relates to the Doppler shift. The observed wavelength would be shifted. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, its observed wavelength would differ. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe the observed λ_max is the same, but their intrinsic λ_max could be different because of the Doppler shift.

Oh wait, that's a more accurate approach. Because the observed peak wavelength is λ_observed = λ_intrinsic * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ), assuming v_r is much less than c. But wait, v_r is 700 km/s. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is about 0.23% of c. So using the approximation λ_observed ≈ λ_intrinsic * (1 + v_r/c) for a receding star? Or wait, if the star is moving away (positive v_r), the wavelengths would be redshifted, so λ_observed = λ_intrinsic * (1 + v_r/c). But if the star is moving towards us, it's blueshifted, so λ_observed = λ_intrinsic * (1 - v_r/c).

Wait, the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Oh wait, wait. So Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its observed λ_max is the same as its intrinsic λ_max. Star_2 has radial velocity 700 km/s. Let me assume it's moving away, so its observed λ_max is longer than its intrinsic λ_max. But the question says that the observed λ_max are the same for both stars. So that means that the intrinsic λ_max of Star_2 must be shorter than that of Star_1 to compensate for the redshift.

Wait, no, let me structure this better.

Let me denote:

For Star_1: v1 = 0. So observed λ1 = intrinsic λ1 * (1 + 0) = λ1.

For Star_2: v2 = 700 km/s. Assuming it's moving away, so observed λ2 = λ2_intrinsic * (1 + v2/c).

But the problem states that λ1_observed = λ2_observed. So λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v2/c).

But λ is inversely proportional to T. So λ1 = b / T1, λ2 = b / T2.

So substituting, b/T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c).

So T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but this would imply that T1 is lower than T2 because (1 + v2/c) is greater than 1. So the star with higher observed λ has lower temperature.

But wait, according to the problem, both stars have the same observed λ_max. So Star_1's intrinsic λ must be equal to Star_2's observed λ. Wait, no, the observed λ_max are the same.

Wait, no, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_intrinsic, because v1 is zero. For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_intrinsic * (1 + v2/c), assuming it's moving away.

So λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v2/c).

But λ is inversely proportional to temperature. Let me write that.

λ is proportional to 1/T: λ = b/T.

So λ1 = b / T1, λ2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c)

So T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c)

Wait, but since v2 is positive (700 km/s away), T2 must be greater than T1. Because (1 + v2/c) is greater than 1.

Wait, but that's a problem because earlier I thought that because their observed λ_max are the same, their temperatures would be the same. But no, because of Doppler shift, that's not the case. Oh, so I was wrong earlier. So the initial assumption that T1=T2 is incorrect. Because their observed λ_max are the same, but their intrinsic λ_max are different due to Doppler shift.

So T1 and T2 are different.

Wait, let me re-derive this.

Star_1: observed λ_max = λ1 = intrinsic λ1 * (1 + v1/c). But v1 is 0, so λ1 = λ1_intrinsic.

Star_2: observed λ_max = λ2_obs = λ2_intrinsic * (1 + v2/c). Here, v2 is 700 km/s. But wait, if the star is moving towards us, v would be negative. Wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. It doesn't say the direction. So perhaps Star_2 is moving towards us, making it blueshifted. Then v2 is negative.

Wait, the radial velocity is given as 700 km/s. But radial velocity can be positive (recession) or negative (approach). So let's clarify: If a star is moving away, its radial velocity is positive, and the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). If it's moving towards us, the radial velocity is negative, and the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted).

But the problem says the observed λ_max are the same. So in this case, Star_2's intrinsic λ_max is either higher or lower depending on its velocity.

Wait, but to have the same observed λ_max, let's suppose that Star_2 is moving towards us. So its observed λ is shorter. So to have λ_observed same as Star_1, which is at rest, Star_2's intrinsic λ must be longer, because when blueshifted, the observed wavelength is shorter.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think again.

If Star_2 is moving towards us (v2 negative), its observed λ is λ2_obs = λ2_intrinsic * (1 + v2/c) ≈ λ2_intrinsic * (1 - |v2|/c). So λ_observed is smaller (blueshifted).

If Star_2 is moving away, λ_observed is larger (redshifted).

In our case, the observed λ for both is the same. So suppose Star_1's λ is λ1, and Star_2's observed λ is λ1 as well.

So for Star_1: λ1_obs = λ1_intrinsic.

For Star_2: λ2_obs = λ2_intrinsic * (1 + v2/c) = λ1.

Wait, but v2 is given as 700 km/s. If it's moving away, v2 is positive, so λ2_obs = λ2_intrinsic * (1 + 700/c). But since Star_2's observed λ is same as Star_1, λ1 = λ2_obs.

So Star_2's λ_intrinsic would be λ2 = λ1 / (1 + v2/c).

But λ is proportional to 1/T, so λ1 = b/T1, λ2 = b/T2.

So, λ2 = λ1 / (1 + v2/c) → b/T2 = (b/T1) / (1 + v2/c)

Simplify: T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

So T2 is larger than T1 because (1 + v2/c) is greater than 1. So Star_2 is hotter than Star_1.

Wait, but the problem says Star_1 has a mass of 1.5 times Star_2. Do more massive stars have higher temperatures? Well, not necessarily. For example, red giants are more massive than white dwarfs but are cooler. So it's not directly about mass but about other factors like evolutionary stage. But in this problem, we can't assume anything about T based on mass. So we proceed.

So, the temperatures are different. Now, we can calculate the luminosity ratio.

Luminosity L is given by L = 4π R² σ T^4, so it's proportional to R² T^4.

So, L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4)

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5 → (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

T1 is given by T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c), from earlier. So T1 = T2 / (1 + 700/c).

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. The speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s.

v2 is 700 km/s, so v2/c is 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.0023333.

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.0023333.

So T1 = T2 / 1.0023333 ≈ T2 * (0.99767).

So T1 ≈ 0.99767 T2.

Now, let's compute the ratio of T1^4 / T2^4.

≈ (0.99767)^4 * (T2^4 / T2^4) ) → 0.99767^4 ≈ ?

0.99767^4 → Let's compute this approximately.

First, ln(0.99767) ≈ (since x is small) approx -0.002333.

Multiply by 4: -0.009333.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.009333) ≈ 1 - 0.009333 + (0.009333)^2/2 ≈ approx 0.9907.

Wait, but let me double-check using calculator steps.

Alternatively, 0.99767^2 = approx (1 - 0.00233)^2 = 1 - 0.00466 + (0.00233)^2 → 0.99534 + 0.0000054 → ~0.995345.

Then square that: 0.995345^2 ≈ (1 - 0.004655)^2 → 1 - 2*(0.004655) + (0.004655)^2 → 1 - 0.00931 + 0.0000216 → ~0.99069.

So about 0.99069.

So T1^4 / T2^4 ≈ 0.99069.

Now, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4) ) = (2.25) * (0.99069) ≈ 2.25 *0.99069 ≈ 2.2275.

Wait, 2.25 * 0.99069 ≈ 2.2275. Which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the temperature relation?

Wait, earlier I thought that T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c). Because from the equation:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Which rearranges to T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

Because 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Multiply both sides by T2 T1:

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

So yes, that's correct. So T2 is larger than T1.

So, when calculating L1/L2, it's (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 ) = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Which is (2.25) * ( (T1/T2)^4 )

But T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v2/c ) → (1/(1.002333)) ≈ 0.99767.

So (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.99069.

So 2.25 * 0.99069 ≈ 2.2275 → approx 2.23, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the relativistic Doppler shift more accurately. But since v2 is just 700 km/s, which is much less than c (about 0.23% of c), the approximation using (1 + v/c) is acceptable. Alternatively, perhaps use the exact formula for Doppler shift: λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ). But for small v, sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ) ≈ (1 + x), where x = v/(c).

So, for small x, the approximation is accurate.

Wait, but the problem says the observed λ_max are the same. So for Star_2, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) (assuming it's moving away, positive v). So λ_rest = λ_obs / (1 + v/c). So T_rest = b / λ_rest = b / (λ_obs / (1 +v/c) )) → T_rest = T_obs * (1 +v/c).

Wait, wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try again.

The observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the rest frame wavelength λ_rest via the Doppler formula. For a source moving away with velocity v, the observed wavelength is longer: λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).

So for Star_2, λ_obs = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

But the observed λ_max for Star_1 is λ_obs1 = λ_rest1, since it's not moving (v1=0).

The problem states λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So, λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

But λ_rest is related to temperature: λ_rest = b / T_rest.

So, substituting:

b / T_rest1 = (b / T_rest2) * (1 + v2/c )

Divide both sides by b:

1 / T_rest1 = (1 / T_rest2) * (1 + v2/c )

→ T_rest2 = T_rest1 * (1 + v2/c )

So T_rest2 is higher than T_rest1.

So now, when we calculate luminosity, we must use each star's rest frame temperature.

So, L1 = 4π R1² σ T_rest1^4.

Similarly, L2 = 4π R2² σ T_rest2^4.

So, L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T_rest1^4 / T_rest2^4 )

We have R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1²/R2² = 2.25.

T_rest2 = T_rest1 * (1 + v2/c ), so T_rest1 / T_rest2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c )

Thus, (T_rest1 / T_rest2 )^4 = [1/(1 + v2/c )]^4.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ 1/(1 + v2/c )^4 ]

Wait, no, wait, that's not correct. Because we have (T_rest1^4)/(T_rest2^4) = (T_rest1 / T_rest2 )^4.

So,

(T_rest1 / T_rest2) = 1/(1 + v2/c )

Thus,

(T_rest1 / T_rest2 )^4 = 1/(1 + v2/c )^4.

Therefore,

L1/L2 = (R1²/R2²) * [ (T_rest1 / T_rest2 )^4 ]

= 2.25 * [ 1/(1 + v2/c )^4 ]

Wait, no! Wait, because in the ratio L1/L2, it's (T1^4)/(T2^4). But T1 is T_rest1, and T2 is T_rest2.

So,

(T_rest1^4)/(T_rest2^4) = (T_rest1/T_rest2)^4 = [ 1/(1 + v2/c) ]^4.

Wait, no, because T_rest2 = T_rest1 * (1 + v2/c ), so T_rest1 = T_rest2 / (1 +v2/c )

So,

(T_rest1^4) = (T_rest2^4 ) / (1 +v2/c )^4.

Thus,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * [ (T_rest2^4 ) / (1 +v2/c )^4 ) ] / (T_rest2^4 )

Which simplifies to 2.25 / (1 +v2/c )^4.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation led to a higher L1.

Wait, perhaps I confused the ratio earlier. Let me re-express this.

Wait, L1 = 4π R1² σ T_rest1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T_rest2^4.

The ratio L1/L2 = (R1²/R2²) * (T_rest1^4 / T_rest2^4 )

But since T_rest2 = T_rest1 (1 +v2/c ), then T_rest1 = T_rest2 / (1 +v2/c )

So,

(T_rest1^4) = (T_rest2^4 ) / (1 +v2/c )^4.

Thus,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * [ (T_rest2^4 / (1 +v2/c )^4 ) / T_rest2^4 ) ]

= (2.25) * [ 1/(1 +v2/c )^4 ]

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1 +v2/c )^4.

Wait, v2 is 700 km/s, c is 3e5 km/s → 700 / 3e5 = 0.0023333.

So, 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.0023333.

So, (1.0023333)^4 ≈ let's compute this.

Compute (1.0023333)^4: Let me approximate.

Using the binomial expansion, (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + n(n-1)/2 x² + ... for small x.

x = 0.0023333.

n=4.

So,

(1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 + 4x + (4*3/2) x² + (4*3*2/6) x³ + (4*3*2*1/24) x^4 )

Wait, more accurately,

(1 + x)^4 = 1 + 4x + 6x² + 4x³ + x^4.

x = 0.0023333.

Compute each term:

x = 0.0023333.

x² ≈ (0.0023333)^2 ≈ 5.444e-6.

x³ ≈ ~1.268e-8.

x^4 ≈ ~2.952e-10.

So,

1 +4x = 1 +4*(0.0023333) ≈ 1 + 0.0093333 ≈ 1.0093333.

6x² = 6 *5.444e-6 ≈ 3.266e-5 → 0.00003266.

4x³ ≈4 *1.268e-8 ≈5.07e-8 → 0.0000000507.

x^4 ≈2.952e-10 → negligible.

Adding them up:

1.0093333 + 0.00003266 = 1.00936596.

Then add 5.07e-8 → about 1.0093660107.

So, (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.009366 approx.

So, 1/(1.009366) is about 0.99067.

Wait, but L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1.009366 )

So 2.25 / 1.009366 → let me compute that.

2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ Let's compute 2.25 / 1.009366.

Well, 1.009366 is approximately 1.009366.

Divide 2.25 by 1.009366:

Approximately, 2.25 * (1/1.009366) → 2.25 * (1 - 0.009366 + (0.009366)^2 - ... )

But perhaps a more precise way is better.

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.009366.

Approximate:

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.009366.

1.009366 × 2.227 ≈ 2.227 *1 =2.227, 2.227 *0.009366≈0.02085. So total ≈2.2478, which is higher than 2.25. So 2.227 ×1.009366 ≈2.25.

So 2.25 /1.009366 ≈2.227.

So approximately 2.227.

Which is about 2.23, so option D.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(L\) is proportional to \(R^2 T^4\). The problem provides the following information:

1. **Radius Ratio**: \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\), so \((R_1/R_2)^2 = 2.25\).
2. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of \(v_1 = 0\), and Star_2 has \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\). The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, meaning the Doppler shift must be accounted for when comparing their temperatures.

### Step 1: Relating Observed and Intrinsic Wavelengths
The observed wavelength \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\) is related to the intrinsic wavelength \(\lambda_{\text{rest}}\) by the Doppler shift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

For Star_1 (\(v_1 = 0\)), \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}}\). For Star_2 (\(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)), \(\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)\). Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we have:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Using the relationship \(\lambda \propto 1/T\), we find:

\[
T_{\text{rest,2}} = T_{\text{rest,1}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The ratio of the intrinsic temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{rest,1}}}{T_{\text{rest,2}}} = \frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}
\]

Substituting \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s}\):

\[
\frac{T_{\text{rest,1}}}{T_{\text{rest,2}}} = \frac{1}{1 + 700/300,000} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.99767
\]

Raising this to the fourth power (since \(L \propto T^4\)):

\[
\left(\frac{T_{\text{rest,1}}}{T_{\text{rest,2}}}\right)^4 \approx (0.99767)^4 \approx 0.99069
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_{\text{rest,1}}}{T_{\text{rest,2}}}\right)^4
\]

Substituting \((R_1/R_2)^2 = 2.25\) and \(\left(\frac{T_{\text{rest,1}}}{T_{\text{rest,2}}}\right)^4 \approx 0.99069\):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.99069 \approx 2.2275
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \(2.23\) times that of Star_2. 

**Answer: D**
