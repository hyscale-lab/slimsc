Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and the uncertainty in time for each state is roughly that lifetime. So for E1, the lifetime (Δt1) is 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, but when you're trying to resolve two energy levels, the time during which each state exists might matter for the uncertainty. Alternatively, perhaps the time we should consider is the time it takes to measure the energy difference. Hmm, not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference needs to be greater than the uncertainty in energy determined by the longer of the two lifetimes. Because if one state has a longer lifetime, its energy uncertainty is smaller, but maybe when you're looking to resolve the two states, you consider the time over which both are being observed.

Wait, perhaps each state has its own lifetime and its own energy uncertainty. So for E1, the energy uncertainty would be ΔE1 = ħ/(2Δt1) = ħ/(2 * 1e-9). Similarly for E2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2) = ħ/(2 * 1e-8). 

Wait, wait, but when you have two states, like E1 and E2, and you want to distinguish them, the energy difference needs to be larger than some uncertainty. But I think the total uncertainty in the energy measurement would be dominated by the worst case, which is the larger energy uncertainty. 

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or maybe each state's uncertainty is considered, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, let me think again. The energy-time uncertainty principle tells us that for a state with a certain lifetime (Δt), the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is at least ħ/(2Δt). So for E1, ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * 1e-9 s). For E2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8 s). 

Which of these is larger? Let's compute. 

Δt1 is 1e-9, so ΔE1 is proportional to 1e9. Δt2 is 1e-8, so ΔE2 is proportional to 1e8. So ΔE1 is much larger than ΔE2.

Wait, that would mean that E1 has a larger energy uncertainty than E2. But that can't be right because a shorter lifetime (E1) would imply a larger uncertainty. Because the formula says that the shorter the Δt, the larger the ΔE. So yes, that's correct.

So when you have two states with different lifetimes, the state with the shorter lifetime has a larger energy uncertainty.

Now, the idea is that to distinguish between E1 and E2, the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of their individual energies. Or, perhaps, larger than the uncertainty in the measurement. Hmm, that's a bit unclear.

Wait, perhaps the energy resolution required is such that the energy difference must be larger than the energy uncertainty associated with the measurement. But if the measurement is made over a certain time, perhaps the time is the limiting factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the time over which the measurement is made is the longer of the two lifetimes. Because, if you have to wait for both states to decay, perhaps the total time is the maximum of the two lifetimes.

Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating it. Let me think about this another way. The energy difference must be at least as large as the uncertainty in energy for the system. The system's overall uncertainty in time is perhaps the minimum of the two lifetimes. No, wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the measurement time is the same as the shorter lifetime, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: To clearly distinguish two energy levels, their energy difference must be much larger than the energy uncertainty associated with the measurement time. So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty ΔE = ħ/(2Δt), where Δt is the time over which the measurement is made.

But in this scenario, what is Δt? Is it the sum of the lifetimes, the maximum, or something else? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the measurement time is longer than the lifetimes, but the question doesn't specify.

Wait, perhaps the measurement is made quickly enough that the states don't decay much, so the Δt is small. But I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to assume that the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of the longer-lived state. Because if one state has a longer lifetime, its energy is measured more precisely. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the uncertainty of the longer-lived state.

Because the longer the lifetime, the smaller the uncertainty. So for E2, which has a longer lifetime (1e-8 s), the energy uncertainty is smaller. So to distinguish E1 and E2, their energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the E2 state, which is smaller. Alternatively, perhaps their difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the E1 state, which is larger.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Suppose we have a measurement that can resolve energy differences down to a certain level. The precision of the measurement is limited by the energy uncertainty. So for the two states to be distinguishable, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties, or perhaps greater than the larger of the two uncertainties.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the uncertainty for each state and ensure that the energy difference is larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me try calculating the energy uncertainties. Given that ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

So for E1: Δt1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2Δt1) ≈ 1.05e-34 / (2 * 1e-9) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-9) = approx 5.25e-26 J.

Wait, but converting that to eV, since the options are in eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So 5.25e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV → approximately (5.25 / 1.602) * 1e-7 ≈ 3.28e-7 eV. So about 3e-7 eV.

Similarly for E2: Δt2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2) = 1.05e-34 / (2e-8) = 5.25e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ (5.25 /1.602) * 1e-8 ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 3e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference between E1 and E2, ΔE, should be larger than the sum of these uncertainties? Or just the larger of the two?

Wait, but the two states have different uncertainties. To distinguish the two, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the measurement, which is perhaps the larger of the two uncertainties.

Because, if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, it's definitely larger than the smaller one. So let me check: if ΔE > ΔE1 (since ΔE1 is 3e-7 eV), then it would be easily distinguishable.

Wait, but wait. The energy difference could be smaller than ΔE1 but larger than ΔE2. Would that suffice? Because E2 has a smaller uncertainty. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the measurement's time is the maximum of the two lifetimes. Because if you have to wait longer for the state with the longer lifetime, that would influence the Δt.

Wait, perhaps the measurement time is the same as the state's lifetime. So for E1, the uncertainty is 3e-7 eV, and for E2, 3e-8 eV.

If the two energies are E1 and E2, then the energy difference is |E2 - E1|.

To be clearly distinguishable, |E2 - E1| must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps greater than the larger uncertainty.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe another approach: The energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, but probably considering the longer lifetime.

Wait, because the longer the lifetime, the more precise the energy measurement. So if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty of the shorter-lived state (E1) but larger than the uncertainty of the longer-lived (E2), perhaps they still can't be distinguished.

Wait, because if E1 has a larger uncertainty, meaning that its actual energy could vary by ±ΔE1, and E2's energy is known with higher precision. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 could be within the uncertainty of E1, making it hard to distinguish.

But maybe the real approach is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the measurement, which is determined by the time over which the measurement is made. If the time is the same as the shorter lifetime (1e-9 s), then the uncertainty is higher. But perhaps the actual measurement time is the minimum of the two lifetimes.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think in terms of the energy-time uncertainty relation.

The formula can be written as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So if you have a measurement that lasts for time Δt, the minimum energy resolution you can get is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). 

So, for the measurement to resolve the two energies, the energy difference must be greater than or equal to the uncertainty. So ΔE ≥ ħ/(2Δt). 

But what is Δt in this context? The time during which the measurement is made. If the states have different lifetimes, perhaps the measurement is made quickly enough that the states don't decay too much. So perhaps the measurement time is much shorter than both lifetimes, making Δt small, leading to a larger ΔE. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the measurement time is the maximum of the two lifetimes, or the minimum. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty determined by the longer lifetime. Because a longer lifetime implies a smaller energy uncertainty, making it easier to distinguish. So if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty of the longer-lived state, then it's sufficient.

So, ΔE > ΔE2. Because ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1. So in that case, the energy difference must be larger than 3e-8 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → smaller than 3e-8. So not sufficient.

B) 1e-11 → way smaller.

C) 1e-4 → much larger than 3e-8.

D) 1e-8 → exactly 1e-8 eV.

But wait, my calculation for ΔE2 was 3e-8 eV. So for the energy difference to be distinguishable, it needs to be larger than 3e-8 eV. So option C is 1e-4, which is 1e4 times larger, which would definitely work. Option D is 1e-8, which is just about equal to 3e-8. So D is 1e-8 eV, which is around 33% less than 3e-8. So it's smaller than the uncertainty.

Wait, but perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty. So if the uncertainty is 3e-8, then the required ΔE should be greater than that. So option D is 1e-8, which is smaller. So D is not sufficient.

So the correct option would be C, which is 1e-4 eV. Because that's way larger than the required 3e-8.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck the calculation of ΔE in eV.

Earlier, I computed:

ΔE1 = ħ/(2Δt1) = (1.05e-34 J·s)/(2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-9) = 5.25e-26 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 5.25e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (5.25 / 1.602) * 1e-7 eV ≈ 3.28e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.25e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.602e-19 = (5.25/1.602) *1e-8 eV ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

So for E1, the uncertainty is about 3.28e-7 eV, and for E2, 3.28e-8 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the state with the longer lifetime, which is E2. Because the longer the lifetime, the smaller the uncertainty. So if the energy difference is larger than E2's uncertainty, then it's distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than 3.28e-8 eV. Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.1 times 1e-8 → too small.

B) 1e-11 → way too small.

C) 1e-4 → way larger → works.

D) 1e-8 → exactly 1e-8. So 3.28e-8 is approximately 3.28 times 1e-8. So D is 1e-8, which is less than 3.28e-8. So it's not enough.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option C, 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than the required 3e-8 eV.

Wait a second, but wait. Are we considering the energy difference as the difference between E2 and E1, meaning ΔE = E2 - E1. Wait, but the actual energy difference is a fixed value. But when considering the uncertainty, perhaps we have to make sure that ΔE is larger than the sum of the two uncertainties?

No, because each state has its own uncertainty. So the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties to ensure they don't overlap.

Wait, no, because the uncertainties are in the same measurement. Let me think: if E1 has uncertainty ΔE1 and E2 has ΔE2, then the energy difference between them should be larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2? Or just larger than the maximum of the two?

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to ensure that the energy difference is larger than the sum of the uncertainties. So:

ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ 3.28e-7 + 3.28e-8 = 3.6e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be greater than 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 → no.
B) 1e-11 → no.
C) 1e-4 → yes, larger.
D) 1e-8 → 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is less than 3.6e-7.

So option C would be the correct choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the individual uncertainties of the states. But I'm not sure. Another angle: the question is about clearly distinguishing the two energy levels. For that, the energy difference must be greater than the experimental uncertainty, which is determined by the measurement time.

Wait, perhaps the measurement time is the minimum of the two lifetimes, because you can only measure for as long as the state exists. So for E1, the measurement can only last up to 1e-9 s, as it decays after that. So the uncertainty would be based on Δt = 1e-9 s, giving ΔE = 3.28e-7 eV.

So in that case, the energy difference must be greater than 3.28e-7 eV. Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger. Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is much smaller.

So that would make option C the correct answer.

But wait, another thought. Suppose the experiment is designed to measure the energies of both states, but each state's lifetime is different. You measure each state separately. So for E1, the uncertainty is 3.28e-7 eV, and for E2, 3.28e-8 eV. The energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties to be distinguishable.

But that sum is about 3.6e-7 eV. So energy difference should be larger than that.

Which again points to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs only to be larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime, which is E1. Because if the uncertainty of E1 is 3.28e-7 eV, then the energy difference must be larger than that. Because if the energy difference is smaller than that, then E1's uncertainty could encompass the difference, making it unclear.

But in that case, the energy difference must be greater than 3.28e-7 eV. Only option C is larger.

So in all cases, the correct answer is option C.


To distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be larger than the energy uncertainty associated with the measurement. The energy-time uncertainty principle states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). For a state with lifetime \( \Delta t \), the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
- For \( E_1 \) with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
  \]

- For \( E_2 \) with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required for distinguishability
To clearly distinguish \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be larger than the energy uncertainty associated with the measurement. Since \( E_2 \) has the longer lifetime, its energy uncertainty (\( \Delta E_2 \)) is smaller. Therefore, the energy difference must be larger than \( \Delta E_2 \), which is \( 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \).

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much larger than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is slightly smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The energy difference must be larger than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \). Among the options, only \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) satisfies this condition.
