Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stars, the excitation of atoms in the photosphere relates to the thermal conditions there. The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Also, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation. Right, the Boltzmann distribution describes the population of particles in different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative of the energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So the Boltzmann factor is (ΔE)/(k*T). The ratio of excited to ground states, or whatever, depends on this. Let me recall: the ratio is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around because higher energy states have fewer populations. But in this case, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So, star_1 has a higher population in the excited state compared to star_2.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Let's say star_1 has twice as excited, meaning the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice as much as in star_2. So, for star_1, n1_upper/n1_lower = 2*(n2_upper/n2_lower). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited". So when they say "excited", I think it refers to the number of atoms in the excited state. So for a given energy level, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. So the ratio (upper / lower) in star_1 is higher than in star_2. Because more atoms are in the upper state, the ratio would be higher.

So the ratio for star_1 is (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper)/(n2_lower). Because star_1 is twice as excited, so more in the upper state
