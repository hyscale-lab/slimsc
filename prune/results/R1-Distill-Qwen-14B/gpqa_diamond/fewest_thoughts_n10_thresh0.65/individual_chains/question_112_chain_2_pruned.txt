Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it step by step. So the question is about an electron in a specific state, and we need to find probabilities and an average value of some operator.

First, let's parse the given information. The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, okay, so |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. I remember that for spin-½ particles, the eigenstates of S_z are |up> with eigenvalue ħ/2 and |down> with eigenvalue -ħ/2.

But the state |alpha> is given as proportional to that expression. So I think I need to normalize it first. Because in quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized to 1. So the state is given as a vector in the spin space, but I have to find the normalization factor.

The state is: |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So the coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2 - i) for |down>. Let me compute the norm (the squared magnitude of the state) to find the normalization constant.

So the norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2. Let's compute each term. |1+i| squared is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. |2 - i| squared is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1=5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> all over sqrt(7).

So the state can be written as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

Now, the next part is about an operator whose matrix representation A has elements A_ij. The definition is that A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait. Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, because we're dealing with up and down, which are two states.

Wait, let me think about the matrix. The operator is a 2x2 matrix. So for i and j, each being 1 and 2, perhaps. So the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, because if i=j, A_ij is zero. For the off-diagonal elements (i≠j), A_ij is ħ/2. So the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because for i=1, j=2, and i=2,j=1, the elements are ħ/2. The diagonal is zero.

Wait, but wait that's a bit odd. Because typically, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and have off-diagonal elements with 1, but this matrix has 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So this operator is a scaled version of the Pauli
