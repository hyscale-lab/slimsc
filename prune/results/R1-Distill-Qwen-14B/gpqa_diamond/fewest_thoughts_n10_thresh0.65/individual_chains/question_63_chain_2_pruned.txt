Okay, so I've got this question about quantum mechanics and diatomic molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down. The question is about the momentum of a photon that a molecule absorbs to switch to the next energy state.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. So, it's in the ground state for both rotation and vibration. The options give different momenta, so I need to figure out what the correct photon momentum is required for the transition.

Wait, the model mentioned is the quantum rotation-vibration model, or non-rigid rotor. Oh right, that means the molecule isn't just treated as a rigid rotor but also accounts for the vibration. So, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions.

In the quantum model, the energy levels are quantized. For the non-rigid rotor, the energy levels have a different form than the rigid rotor. I remember that for a rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number. But for a non-rigid rotor, the energy depends on both the rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, the fundamental state in rotation-vibration modelsâ€”so it's the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state would be the next higher energy level. But which transition are we talking about here? The question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, that would probably be the next allowed state.

Wait, in rotation
