Okay, so I've got this physics question here about which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, let me think through this.

I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergencesâ€”those pesky infinities that pop up in calculations. Regularization isn't the same as renormalization; it's a step that comes before, helping to make the calculations finite so renormalization can handle the infinities in a meaningful way.

The question gives four options: A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, let me think about each one. 

First, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory. I remember that QED does require renormalization because of loop diagrams leading to divergences. But does it need regularization? Well, regularization is often used in QED calculations to handle these divergences. So QED probably does require regularization.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is similar but deals with the strong force. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory. It also has issues with divergences, so I think it requires regularization as well. Plus, things like the renormalization group equations are important in QCD, so regularization must come into play.

Superstring Theory... Oh, right! String theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics with general relativity. In string theory, particles are not point-like but are strings. One thing I remember is that string theories don't have the same kinds of divergences as in Q
