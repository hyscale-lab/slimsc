Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. 

Another part says that a certain keto acid reacts with Substance X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Also, Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. We need to find the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's break this down. First, I'll try to identify each component.

So, let's start with the reaction. X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is about 277 K. Wait, 277 K is approximately 4Â°C, I think. What substances have a melting point around there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or maybe something else. Alternatively, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. Let me think: water freezes at 273 K, so 277 is just 4 degrees above that. Maybe something like ice melting? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps B is some kind of salt that melts around that temperature. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid that's being heated upon decomposition. 

Wait, when G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate and B is CO2? Or maybe G is a bicarbonate that decomposes into a carbonate and CO2. Hmm, but I'm not sure yet.

Let's think about gas W first. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule's composition must have equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases.

Possible gases: CO2, H2O, NH3, maybe CH4. Let's see:

- CO2: Each molecule has 1 C (6 protons) and 2 O (8 each). Total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: C has 6, each O has 8, so 6 + 2*8=22. So protons and neutrons are equal? Wait, each CO2 molecule actually has 22 protons and 22 neutrons? Let me compute:

Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Oxygen-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each CO2 molecule would have (6+8*2) protons: 6 + 16 =22. Neutrons: 6 (from C) + 8*2=22. So yes, 22 each. So W could be CO2.

Alternatively, another gas: H2O. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (assuming H-1), O has 8 and 8. So H2O has 2*1=2 protons, 8+0=8? Wait, no. Wait, H is
