Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.

The question is about finding the speed of light in glass relative to a lab observer. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the glass is moving toward the observer but in the same direction as the beam. Wait, no, wait. The light beam is propagating through the glass, which is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer? That might be a bit confusing. Let me make sure I get it right.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. Oh, but the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer. So both the light and the glass are moving in the same direction towards the observer. Hmm.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving. So the glass is moving with velocity v. The light is inside the glass, which is itself moving. So I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab (observer's) frame.

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, where n is the refractive index. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium, right? So if the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed of light?

Wait, I think this has to do with the addition of velocities in special relativity, but wait, this is a classical optics problem, perhaps? Or maybe it's a trick question where the speed of light in the medium is just c/n, regardless of the movement of the medium. Because in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, but that's for light in a vacuum. Wait, but when light is in a medium, like glass, its speed is c/n. But when the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the measurement of the speed of light in that medium, as seen from the lab frame?

Hmm. Let's think. In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. But when the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, how does that translate? Is it just a matter of adding velocities, like in Galilean relativity?

Wait, but in Galilean transformations, velocities add linearly. So if an object is moving at u in the medium's
