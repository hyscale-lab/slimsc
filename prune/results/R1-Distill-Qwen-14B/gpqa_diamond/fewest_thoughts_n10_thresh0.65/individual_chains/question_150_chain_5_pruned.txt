Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure out what the final product is after a series of reactions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that doesn't immediately ring a bell, but I can think about possible structures. The NMR data might help me figure out the structure.

The NMR data given is:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I remember that in NMR, the chemical shifts can indicate certain functional groups. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's probably an aldehyde proton since they typically appear around 9-10 ppm. So there's an aldehyde group in the compound.

Looking at the aromatic region:
- 6.98 ppm is a doublet, which might be two protons from a substituted benzene ring. Maybe para-substituted because the coupling is with two protons.
- 6.51 ppm is another doublet, maybe two protons as well. If these are in another aromatic ring, perhaps another para-substituted group.
- The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for two protons. Broad suggests some exchange, maybe an alcohol group? Or maybe it's part of a conjugated system like a vinyl proton, but the singlet is a bit confusing. Alternatively, it could be an -OH group, but that's usually broader and maybe split into a singlet if it's exchanging rapidly.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for two protons. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to something electronegative, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group or part of an ether or ester.

Putting it together, perhaps the structure is something with two benzene rings attached, an aldehyde group, and some oxygen-containing groups. Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation: Each degree is one ring or double bond. For C8H9NO:

Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees: maybe two benzene rings (each with three degrees), but wait, two benzene rings would be 6 degrees. Hmm, maybe not. Or perhaps a benzene ring, a double bond, and some rings or other structures.

Wait, maybe the structure is an aromatic aldehyde with substituents. Let's think of something like diphenyl compounds.

Looking at the options provided, all involve but-...-enals or but...-enals. So perhaps the main chain is a four-carbon chain with double bonds and substituents, including phenyl groups.

Looking at the NMR:

The aldehyde proton is at 9.72 ppm as a triplet. So maybe it
