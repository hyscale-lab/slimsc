Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth as the planet orbits, which shifts the spectral lines.

The question says there are two stars, each with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a Neptune-mass planet. The planets are in circular orbits. So, the setup is similar except for something else.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods. How does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period?

Wait, I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the Doppler shift. K is the maximum velocity the star moves toward or away from us. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(something... wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Oh right! The radial velocity semi-amplitude formula is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 day) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: from what I remember, the formula for K is:

K = ( (2πG) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) * (1 / P )^(1/3)

But wait, maybe there's a simpler way. Since both stars have the same mass (solar masses), and the planets have the same mass (Neptune), and assuming e=0 (since orbits are circular), then the formula should depend on the orbital period P.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the periods. So I can set up a ratio between planet #2 and planet #1.

Let me think: the RV method
