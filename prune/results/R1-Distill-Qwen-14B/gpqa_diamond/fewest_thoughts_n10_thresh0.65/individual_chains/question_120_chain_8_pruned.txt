Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll think it through.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth during the year, right? The closer the star, the larger the parallax. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is pretty close, right? I remember that the formula for distance in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax (d = 1/plx). So if plx increases, the distance decreases.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. Let's say we have a range of parallaxes from plx to plx + dplx. How many stars are in that range?

Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, their spatial density is uniform. So the number of stars should depend on the volume of space they occupy. But wait, how does parallax relate to volume?

Well, the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. If the distance (r) is 1/plx, then volume is proportional to (1/plx)^3. So as plx increases, the volume per unit distance decreases.

But wait, the number of stars depends on the volume. So if we have a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx, the volume of that shell is the difference in the volumes at plx + dplx and plx. The volume of a sphere is 4/3 π r³, so the derivative with respect to r is 4π r² dr. Since r is 1/plx, dr/dplx would be -1/(plx²). Hmm, that's a bit tricky.

Let me think again. The number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume is (4π/3) ( (1/(plx + dplx))³ - (1/plx)³ ). But when dplx is small compared to plx, maybe we can approximate this using derivatives.

The differential volume dV would be the surface area of the sphere times dr. Surface area is 4π r², and dr is the change in radius. Since r = 1/plx, dr = -1/(plx²) * dplx. So dV = 4π (1/plx²)² * (-1/(plx²
