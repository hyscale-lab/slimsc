Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents from the given options.

Let me first write down the target molecule: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, the structure probably has a cyclohexane ring attached to another cyclohexane, but wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally. Wait, the formula might help. The target has a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group (like -CH(OH)-), and a formyl group (carbaldehyde). So perhaps the structure is something like cyclohexane with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl-(hydroxymethyl) group and a formyl group attached.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is a triple bond, so that's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached.

So the synthesis steps need to convert ethynylcyclohexane into this target. Let's think about the possible reactions.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, maybe for elimination or alkyne reactions. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So maybe an alkylation? But wait, when you have a triple bond, using NaNH2 (a strong base) and an alkyl halide might lead to alkyne alkylation. Oh! The formation of a longer alkyne. So adding methyl group to the ethynylcyclohexane would give propynylcyclohexane? Or wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2CH2C≡CH (but that's not right; structure is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group). So, adding a methyl via NaNH2 and CH3Cl would perhaps add a methyl to the triple bond. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, which can deprotonate alkynes. So maybe a deprotonation followed by alkylation. Oh, wait, when you have a terminal alkyne like RC≡CH, treating with a strong base like NaNH2 would deprotonate to form RC≡C^- Na^+. Then adding an alkyl halide (like CH3Cl) would give RC≡C-CH3? No, wait, CH3Cl is a methylating agent. So adding a methyl to the alkyne. So that would make the alkyne longer. So ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH) would become cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3? So that would be propargylcyclohexane.

Then, the next step is H2/Pd. Hydrogenation of the alkyne. H2 with a palladium catalyst would hydrogenate the triple bond. So propargylcyclohexane would become cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group, but wait, no. Propargyl is CH2CH2C- group. Wait, no. Propargyl is CH2CH2C≡CH, but after hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes single. So hydrogenation would reduce the triple bond to a single bond. So cyclohexane-CH2CH2-CH3? No, wait, propargylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane attached to a CH2-C≡C-CH3? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane attached to a C≡CH group. Then after alkylation with methyl chloride using NaNH
