Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. They observed the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest and found them to be the same. Also, the radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The astronomers assume the stars radiate as black bodies and compute the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a certain factor, which we have to find from the options.

Hmm. So, the main thing here is to find the luminosity ratio. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars are black bodies, we can use this formula.

Wait, but how do the temperatures come into play here? The problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength (λ_max) of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature.

So, T1 = T2. Because λ1 = λ2.

Wait, but what about the Doppler shift? Oh wait, the radial velocities are given. Oh right, because the stars are moving, their observed wavelengths would be Doppler shifted. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. But the actual emitted λ_max might be different.

Wait, this is a bit tricky. Let me think. If a star is moving towards us (positive radial velocity?), its light is blueshifted, making the observed λ shorter. If moving away, redshifted, longer λ. But in this case, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so no shift. Star
