Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, so I need to calculate which one it is.

Wait, what's the formula for the mean decay distance? I remember that decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the decay distance L is the product of the lifetime (τ) and the speed (βc), where β is v/c.

So L = βcτ. But how do I find τ from the given data?

I think the lifetime τ is related to the width Γ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but more accurately, τ is the inverse of the width Γ (divided by some constants). So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Wait, I think the relation is τ = ħ/(Γ), but I'm not entirely sure about the factors. Oh wait, no, actually, the natural line width formula is Γ = ħ/τ. So τ = ħ/(Γ). But I should probably double-check that.

But wait, another thing: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. Hmm, I wonder if that's relevant. Oh, perhaps when the meson is produced, it's moving with some kinetic energy, so its total energy is E_X, and its mass is m_X. So I can find its velocity β from that. Because E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). Wait, but here energies are given in GeV, and masses also in GeV/c², so units might be a bit tricky, but I'll manage.

So first, compute γ. E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV/c². So γ = E/(m c²) → but since E is given in GeV and m in GeV/c², and c is in m/s, but perhaps when using natural units where c=1, it's easier. But I'm not sure, maybe I should work in SI units.

Wait, natural units: in particle physics, c=1 and ħ=1, but for calculations involving real units, I need to be careful. Maybe it's better to calculate β in terms of E and m.

So, the formula for relativistic energy: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

Alternatively, since E = γ m c², and p = γ β m v. Wait, but perhaps using β = v/c, so β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Wait, let me think. γ = E/(m c²). So γ = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV c²) → wait, no, because E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c²
