Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. So the question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f̄ ψf(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think this describes the interaction between the boson X and some fermions. 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed means that the energy must be sufficient for the production of the decay products. Oh right, the decay products must each have a mass less than or equal to half the mass of X since they are produced in pairs. Wait, no, wait. Wait, for a decay like X → f f̄, each fermion must have a rest mass less than or equal to M_X / 2. Because the minimum energy needed is when the fermions are at rest, so each would have energy M_X/2. So the maximum mass each can have is (M_X/2) because their combined rest mass can't exceed M_X.

X's mass is 6 GeV. So each fermion's mass must be ≤ 3 GeV. Because if each is 3 GeV, then together they sum to 6. But wait, wait, the fermions come in pairs, right? So for each pair, each has a mass m, so 2m <= 6 GeV → m <=3 GeV.

Wait, but what are the masses of the known fermions? Let me think. The fermions are quarks and leptons. The quarks include up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Leptons are electrons, muons, taus, and their neutrinos. But I think in this problem, the neutrinos are negligible because they have very small masses, but maybe they're not considered here.

Wait, but the options given include things like b quarks, which have a mass of about 4.5 GeV each. Wait, wait a minute. Wait, the bottom quark (b) has a mass around 4.5 GeV. So if X is 6 GeV, then a pair of b quarks would each be 4.5 GeV, so 4.5 * 2 =9 GeV. That's way more than 6 GeV, so that's impossible. So X can't decay into b b̄. Wait, but looking at the options, option A includes b b̄, but others don't. So I'm thinking, that's not possible.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the mass values. Let me double-check. The top quark is the heaviest, with a mass around 173 GeV. Bottom is about 4.5 GeV. Charm is about 1.5 GeV. Strange is around 100 MeV (0.1 GeV), up is like 2 MeV, so negligible. For leptons, the tau is about 1.78 GeV, muon about 0.1 GeV, electron about 0.0005 GeV. Neutrinos are much lighter but perhaps not considered here.

So, for X (6 GeV) → f f̄, the allowed fermions f must have m_f ≤ 3 GeV. So let's see:

- For quarks:
   - up (u): m ≈ 2 MeV → allowed
   - down (d): ≈ 4-5 MeV → allowed
   - strange (s): ~100 MeV → allowed
   - charm (c): ~1.5 GeV → allowed, 1.5 < 3
   - bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 > 3 → not allowed
   - top (t): way too heavy, 173 GeV → no.

So, allowed quarks are u, d, s, c.

For leptons:
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV → 1.78 ≤ 3 → allowed.
- Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV → allowed.
- Electron (e): allowed.
- Neutrinos: their masses are negligible, so maybe they're allowed, but I don't think the options include them.

So the possible decay products are:

Quarks: u, d, s, c → each can produce their anti-pairs, so uū, dđ, sš, cī.

Leptons: τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the interaction given by the Lagrangian. The interaction term is -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I'm reading that wrong. Let me parse it again.

The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f f̄ ψf(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, no, perhaps I'm misreading the notation. Oh wait, perhaps it's more like L = -λ f f̄ X ψ_f ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe it's a Yukawa-type interaction. So the boson X is coupling to a fermion ψ_f. So in this case, the fermions that X can interact with are the ones present in the Lagrangian. Because in the decay, X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs only if X couples to those fermions.

So the interaction term is perhaps proportional to X ψ_f ψ_f, so X can decay into ψ_f and ψ_f̄ (if that's the case). So, the possible decay products are those fermions that the boson X interacts with.

So the problem says, "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by [equation]." So the fermions that X can interact with are those ψ_f present in the Lagrangian.

Wait, in the given Lagrangian, it's written as -λ f f̄ ψf(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, perhaps it's written as L = - λ (f ψf(y) X ψf(y) + ... ). Maybe the exact structure isn't crucial, but the important point is which fermions are involved.

Wait, perhaps the interaction is of the form L = -λ X ψ_f ψ_f, so ψ_f is a fermion that X couples to. So the fermions that can be decay products are those ψ_f that X can annihilate into.

So, for the decay X → f f̄, f must be a fermion that X couples to. So, the possible decay channels are determined both by the mass (m_f ≤ M_X/2) and whether X couples to that fermion.

In the problem, the interaction is given for fermions f, so X can couple to any fermion f. But perhaps not. Wait, the Lagrangian is given as -λ f f̄ ψf(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, perhaps the fermion ψf is a field, so perhaps the interaction is for each fermion species. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps the exact form of the Lagrangian isn't crucial for this problem. The key is that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided that their combined mass is less than or equal to X's mass (6 GeV) and that the fermion's mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So, possible decay products are all pairs of fermions where each has a mass ≤3 GeV.

So let's list all possible fermions:

Quarks:
- up (u): ~2 MeV → allowed
- down (d): ~4-5 MeV → allowed
- strange (s): ~100 MeV → allowed
- charm (c): ~1.5 GeV → allowed
- bottom (b): 4.5 GeV → too heavy (needs 4.5 *2 >6)
- top (t): way too heavy.

Leptons:
- electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV → allowed
- muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV → allowed
- tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV → allowed
- neutrinos: masses are much smaller than 3 GeV, but perhaps the problem doesn't consider them as decay products because their interactions are too weak, or because the problem specifies charged leptons.

So the decay possibilities are:

uū, dđ, sš, cī, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

But wait, wait. The decay X → b b̄ is possible if b's mass is acceptable. But as I thought before, 4.5 GeV per b, so 9 GeV total, which is more than 6. So that's not allowed. So X can't decay into b b̄.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b b̄, s s̄, uū, dđ, τ+ τ−, e+ e−. But b b̄ is excluded because their mass is too high. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, uū, dđ, τ+, tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. So c has 1.5 GeV, which is allowed. So B includes c, which is allowed, but not b. So this seems possible.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t (t is way too heavy, so that's not allowed). So C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but let me think again. X has a mass of 6 GeV. The c quark is about 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 GeV ≤6, which is allowed. So X can decay into c c̄.

So the decay X → c c̄ is allowed.

So looking at the options, which include c c̄?

Option B includes c c̄, s s̄, uū, dđ, τ+ τ−, mu+ mu−, and e+ e−. So that's all possible allowed fermions except for the b quark.

Wait, but the problem says 'lowest order' decays. Does that affect anything? I think it just refers to tree-level decays, not higher-order processes. So the allowed are those with m_f ≤3 GeV.

So the allowed decay channels are c c̄, s s̄, uū, dđ, τ+ τ−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

So the correct option should include all these.

Looking at the options:

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is too heavy, so C is wrong.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. The decays are determined by two main criteria: (1) the fermion pair \( f\bar{f} \) must have a combined mass less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), and (2) each fermion \( f \) must have a mass less than or equal to \( M_X / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Additionally, the boson \( X \) can only decay into fermions it couples to, as dictated by the interaction term.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Constraints**:  
   For a decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \), the mass of each fermion \( f \) must satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This ensures that the total mass of the fermion-antifermion pair does not exceed \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

2. **Fermion Masses**:  
   - Quarks:  
     - \( u \): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)  
     - \( d \): \( \sim 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)  
     - \( s \): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)  
     - \( c \): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)  
     - \( b \): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_b > M_X \))  
     - \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, far too heavy).  
   - Leptons:  
     - \( e \): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)  
     - \( \mu \): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)  
     - \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).  

3. **Interaction Term**:  
   The boson \( X \) couples to fermions \( f \), as described by the interaction term in the Lagrangian. The decays are restricted to fermions that \( X \) interacts with.

4. **Allowed Decays**:  
   Based on the mass constraints and the interaction term, the allowed decays of \( X \) are:  
   \[
   X \to u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^-.
   \]

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > M_X \). Incorrect.  
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.  
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( m_t \gg M_X \). Incorrect.  
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.  

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.  

Answer: B
