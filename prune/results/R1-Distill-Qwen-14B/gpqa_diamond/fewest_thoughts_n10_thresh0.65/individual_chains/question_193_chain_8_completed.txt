Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, or 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are about different powers of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle at which the position of a star appears to shift when observed from two points on Earth's orbit. The formula I recall is that distance (d) in parsecs is approximately 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So d ≈ 1 / plx. Wait, right, because parallax plx = 1/d. So plx is inversely proportional to distance.

So if the number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5, and since plx is 1/d, substituting that in gives N proportional to (1/(1/d))^5. Let me think about that: 1/(1/d) is d. So 1/(1/d) is d, so (d)^5, so N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. If plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is about how N changes with distance. So as d increases, N increases as d^5. But wait, the question is about per unit range of distance. Hmm, I think I might be mixing up something here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider N as a function of distance r, and find how the number of stars (per unit volume maybe?) depends on r. Or perhaps it's about the density of stars as a function of distance.

Wait, the question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5". So N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx = 1/d, 1/plx = d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5, so N ∝ d^5. So as distance d increases, the number of stars increases as d^5.

But wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive because in reality, the number of stars doesn't increase with distance. But maybe in this specific scenario, it's given in that way.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Like, how does the number of stars per unit distance (so like a differential) change? So perhaps we're looking for dN/dr, the rate of change of number of stars with distance.

If N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would increase with d^4. Looking at the options, option C is r^4.

Wait, but wait again. Let me think about what the question is exactly asking. The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, so N = k * (1/plx^5) = k * (d^5), because plx = 1/d. So N = k * d^5. Now, when you increase the distance by a small amount dr, how much does N increase? That would be dN = 5k d^4 dr. So dN/dr = 5k d^4. So per unit distance (dr = 1), dN/dr is proportional to d^4. So as the distance r increases, the rate at which stars appear per unit distance increases as r^4.

So the correct answer would be ~r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the number of stars generally decreases with distance. But the question is specifically about this particular region and the given relation, so maybe in this case it does vary as r^4.

So the steps were:

1. Parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.
2. N ∝ 1/plx^5 → substituting d, N ∝ d^5.
3. To find how N changes with distance (per unit r), take derivative dN/dr, which is 5d^4.
4. So dN/dr ∝ r^4. So the answer is C.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relation, \( N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{d}\right)^5} = d^5 \). Thus, \( N \propto d^5 \).

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), we compute the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Since \( N \propto d^5 \), differentiating gives \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4 \). Therefore, the rate at which the number of stars changes with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
