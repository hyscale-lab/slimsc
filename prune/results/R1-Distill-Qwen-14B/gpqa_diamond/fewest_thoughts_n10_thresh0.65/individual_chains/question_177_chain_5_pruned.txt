Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers observed the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest and found them the same. Oh, and their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. The problem states that we should assume the stars are black bodies. Then, the question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm. So, I remember that luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, right? So L is proportional to R squared times the temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, I think that refers to the peak wavelength of their black body radiation. Because for a black body, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

But wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait, the stars' velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh, but wait, does radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right! Because of the Doppler effect. So the observed wavelength would be shifted if the star is moving towards or away from us.

Wait, wait. So the peak wavelengths observed are the same. But that doesn't necessarily mean their intrinsic temperatures are the same. Because the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), or something like that, if we consider relativistic Doppler shifts. Wait, but maybe v is much smaller than the speed of light, so we can approximate it with the non-relativistic formula: λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted (1 + v_r /
