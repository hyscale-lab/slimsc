Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question has three separate reactions labeled A, B, and C, and I need to figure out the major products and match them with the options provided. Let's take each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So, I think this is a classic Michael addition scenario. Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester of malonic acid. The enolate form is what's going to attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure where the acrylate group is E-configured. The acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which makes it a good electrophile. The Michael donor is the enolate of dimethyl malonate. So the enolate (which is a strong nucleophile) will attack the beta position of the acrylate.

When the enolate attacks the beta carbon, the mechanism should form a new carbon-carbon bond. The product should be a new ketone or ester, depending on the groups. Since both are esters, I think the product will be a larger ester.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO)2CH2. When it forms the enolate, it's CH2CO2Me with a negative charge. The attack on the acrylate would add the CH2 part to the beta position.

So the acrylate is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, no, the substituentsâ€”actually, wait, the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2-CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3, but with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no: the correct structure is CH2=CH-CO
