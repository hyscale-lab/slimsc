Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on differential geometry, but let me think through this.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? It looks like it's in terms of x and y, so maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space or something.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere... I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a horn. The metric for a pseudosphere usually has a specific form. Oh right, the Poincaré disk model or something similar.

Wait, the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let's see, the standard Poincaré disk metric is usually written as ds² = [4/(1 - x² - y²²)] (dx² + dy²), where r is the radius of the disk. But here, the denominator is 4 - x² - y², so maybe the radius parameter is different.

Wait, if I compare the two, the given metric has 32 over (4 - x² - y²). Let's factor that out. Let me think: 32/(4 - x² - y²) can be written as (32/4) * [1/(1 - (x² + y
