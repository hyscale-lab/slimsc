Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Then, there's another operator with a matrix representation where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. I need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator and the average value of the operator.

Wait, first, let me get the state right. The state |alpha> is proportional, so I need to normalize it. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i) for |up> and |down>, respectively. So the state can be written as |alpha> = a(1+i)|up> + a(2-i)|down>, where 'a' is the normalization constant. To find 'a', I need to compute the norm.

The norm squared is |a|^2 times the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients. So the squared magnitude of (1+i) is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2, and for (2 - i), it's (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 + 1 = 5. So the total is 2 + 5 =7. Therefore, a^2 *7 =1, so a =1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the operator in question has matrix elements Aij = hbar/2 when i≠j, else zero. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out. The diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix is:

[ 0        hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   0     ]

Hmm, this looks like the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Wait, the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Wait, but the eigenstates of sigma_x are not the same as |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of sigma_z. So to find the eigenstates of this operator, I need to diagonalize it.

Alternatively, maybe the operator is given in a basis that is not the computational (z) basis. So, the eigenstates of this operator would form a different basis, perhaps. Let me find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The operator matrix is:

[[0, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, 0]]

The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation. The determinant is (0 - lambda)^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0. So lambda^2 - (hbar/2)^2 =0 → lambda = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. The corresponding eigenvectors would be for each lambda.

For lambda = hbar/2:
We have the matrix equation ( ( -hbar/2, hbar/2 ), (hbar/2, -hbar/2 ) ) [x, y]^T = 0.

The equations are:
(-hbar/2) x + (hbar/2) y = 0 → -x + y =0 → y =x.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1, 1]. But wait, considering normalization. So the eigenstate is |psi+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for lambda = -hbar/2:
The equations would give ( -(-hbar/2) x + (hbar/2) y ) =0 → (hbar/2 x + hbar/2 y )=0 → x + y =0 → y = -x.

So the eigenstate
