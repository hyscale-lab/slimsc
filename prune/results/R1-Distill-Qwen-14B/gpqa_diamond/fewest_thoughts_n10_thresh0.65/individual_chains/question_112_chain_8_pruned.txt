Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again and break it down.

The problem says that we have an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to find two things: the probability of measuring the electron in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator's matrix representation has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise.

Hmm, wait. So first, let me note down what I know.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So I think I should normalize it first. Because when dealing with quantum states, the state vector must have a norm (or length) of 1. So I need to find the normalization factor.

The given state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me compute the inner product of this with itself to find the normalization constant.

The inner product <alpha|alpha> would be (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i), because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, let me think again. The state is a linear combination, so the inner product is the sum of the products of the coefficients and their conjugates.

Wait, actually, the inner product for a state a|up> + b|down> is |a|^2 + |b|^2, since |up> and |down> are orthonormal. So for |alpha>, the coefficients are a=(1+i) and b=(2-i). So |a|^2 = (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2, and |b|^2 = (2-i)(2+i) = 4 + (i)(-i) = 4+1=5. So the total norm is 2 +5=7. So the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> divided by sqrt(7), to make it a unit vector. So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is about an operator whose matrix elements are A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, this is a 2x2 matrix because |up> and |down> are the basis states, so the operator is 2x2.

Let me write down the matrix. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j can be 1 and 2, representing |up> and |down> respectively.

So for i=1, j=2: A_12 = hbar/2. For i=2, j=1: A_21 = hbar/2. All the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero. So the matrix
