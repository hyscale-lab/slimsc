Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let me read it again.

So, the question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when we observe the star from Earth, its brightness will vary as it rotates, just like how exoplanets cause dips in brightness when they transit. The question is asking, if there were no spots, what would be the radius of a planet that would cause the same brightness variation as these spots do?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The situation is that the spots cause a variation in brightness, and this looks similar to an exoplanet. The question is, what planet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So, when the star isn't spotted, the planet's transit would cause a dip. But in this case, the spots are causing a similar-looking dip. So we need to find the planet radius that would give the same depth.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says, "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star."

Oh, so normally, without spots, the light curve would have a dip when a planet transits. But in this case, the spots are making the star's brightness vary, and it's mimicking a planet. So, for the same brightness variation, what is the planet's size relative to the star.

Wait, but the spots are causing a variation. So when the spots are facing us, the star appears dimmer because the spots are cooler, so the total brightness is lower. As the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing a dip in brightness. So the amplitude of this dip is what we want to compare to the dip caused by a planet.

So to find the planet's radius that would cause a similar dip, we need to compute the relative area blocked.

Wait, but let's think about the star's brightness variation. The spots are darker, so when they're on the side facing us, the light is less
