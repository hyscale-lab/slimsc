Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that it's a framework used to describe physics beyond the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. I need to figure out which of these must be upheld.

Wait, I should think about each symmetry one by one. So, let's start with Lorentz symmetry. I remember that in the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible Lorentz-invariant operators. So, any operator in SMEFT must transform properly under the Lorentz group. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But wait, in effective field theories, we usually think about Lorentz symmetry but not necessarily all of Poincare. Because effective theories are built around a particular energy scale, and when you go to different scales, you might integrate out some degrees of freedom. But do SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare? I think not, because the effective theory is valid up to a certain cutoff, and Poincare symmetry might not hold if there's a preferred frame, though I'm not entirely sure. Wait, but I think that in SMEFT, we assume the theory is Lorentz invariant but not necessarily Poincare. Because Poincare includes the translation part,
