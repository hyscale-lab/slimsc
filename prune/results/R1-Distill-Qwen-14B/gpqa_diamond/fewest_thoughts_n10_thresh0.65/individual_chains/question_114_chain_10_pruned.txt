Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The question involves two reactions and identifying the correct reagents A and B from the given options.

First, let me look at the reactions:

1. Butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. Then, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I need to figure out what reagents A and B are.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is a ketone. Adding NaCN and a reagent leads to a nitrile with a hydroxy group. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with NaCN, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution or addition. Oh, wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. In a ketone, the carbonyl is a good electrophile, so maybe it's a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, but ketones typically don't undergo nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but wait, in the presence of a strong acid, the carbonyl can be protonated, making it more electrophilic. Oh, right! The formation of a cyanohydrin. That's a reaction where a nucleophile (like CN-) adds to a carbonyl group, and then another proton is added by an acid. Or wait, the mechanism is that the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon, resulting in a tetrahedral intermediate, and then a proton transfer happens.

But in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's draw that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So, butan-2-one ( (CH3)2CO ) reacts with CN- to form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That makes sense as a cyanohydrin formation. The general reaction is ketone + CN- in presence of an acid catalyst gives a cyanohydrin. 

So NaCN is the source of CN-, and the acid would be the catalyst. So what is the acid? The options for A are either H3O+ (which is a strong acid) or NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2- perhaps? Wait, no, NaHSO3 in solution would provide H+ (from HSO3^- acting as an acid), but it's a weaker acid than H3O+ (which is just H+ from H3O+). Alternatively, H3O+ is a strong acid, providing more H+.

So, for the cyanohydrin formation, the reaction is usually done under acidic conditions. Therefore, reagent A should be an acid. So in the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. But NaHSO3 may not provide enough H+; H3O+ is
