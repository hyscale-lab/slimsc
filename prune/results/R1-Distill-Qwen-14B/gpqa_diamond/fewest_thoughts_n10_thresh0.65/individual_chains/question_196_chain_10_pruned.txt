Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that the oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A, and it obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. They're asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A to D, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, so since it's a relativistic oscillator, I guess we can't use the classical harmonic oscillator equations because those assume non-relativistic speeds. Oh right, in the classical case, the maximum speed is given by v = sqrt(kA²/m), but that's non-relativistic. But here, we're considering the relativistic scenario, so we need to account for relativistic effects.

In relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², where p is the momentum. But wait, how does this apply to a harmonic oscillator?

In the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the total energy is conserved. So at maximum displacement (amplitude A), all the energy is potential, and at the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So the maximum speed in classical terms is when all potential energy is converted to kinetic. So the non-relativistic v_max is sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But since this is a relativistic problem, I can't directly use that.

Hmm. So maybe I need to think about energy in the relativistic context. The total energy E of the particle would be the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement A, all the energy is stored as potential energy, which in the relativistic case probably isn't just ½ k A² anymore. Wait, not sure about that. Or maybe in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², and the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Wait, but the problem states that it's a relativistic oscillator. So perhaps the equations are modified to include relativistic effects. I remember that in relativistic mechanics, momentum p isn't just mv, but is gamma times m times v, where gamma
