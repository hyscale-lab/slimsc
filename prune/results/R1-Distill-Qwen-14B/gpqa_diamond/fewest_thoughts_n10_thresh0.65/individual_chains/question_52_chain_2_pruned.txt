Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots versus not. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, the star's properties: when it doesn't have spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but I think the spots are cooler regions, right? Because dark spots on a star are usually cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when the spots cover part of the surface, the overall brightness (and hence effective temperature) decreases.

Now, the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. The options are A to D, with some numbers.

I remember that in stellar atmospheres under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy difference, and k is Boltzmann's constant. So, the ratio depends exponentially on the temperature.

Wait, but the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star is cooler (because of the spots), the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Let me think: the energy difference between the two levels is what's important here. The transition corresponds to about 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or perhaps visible spectrum? Let me calculate the energy associated with that wavelength.

The energy E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s. So λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters. Let me compute E:

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878
