Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in a substitution reaction, probably a dehydrohalogenation or maybe something else. Wait, no, red phosphorus is often used in the hydroxylation of alkenes, but wait, maybe it's more about elimination. Or perhaps it's a Mitsunobu reaction? No, Mitsunobu uses DEAD or DIAD and a phosphine. Oh wait, red phosphorus with HI is commonly used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. No, wait, no, that might be with H2O. Alternatively, I think when you have a nitrile and you treat it with H2O and red phosphorus, it gets hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, but that's under acidic conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where a leaving group is replaced.

But before that, I need to figure out what Compound X is. They've given me the IR and NMR data. Let me start by looking at the IR.

The IR shows strong peaks around 3400-2500 cm-1. That's a broad region, probably O-H or N-H. The other peaks are at 1720, 1610, 1450 cm-1. 1720 is likely a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone,
