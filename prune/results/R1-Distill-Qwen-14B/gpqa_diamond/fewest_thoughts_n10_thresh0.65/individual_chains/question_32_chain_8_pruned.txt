Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons, so I think that means it's lithium-6 because lithium usually has 3 protons and if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number would be 6. So, Li-6, which has a mass number A=6.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic energy equation. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

Wait, but I need to find the total energy of the nucleus. Oh, right, because RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so each ion has a certain kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy. But wait, the question says the speed is 0.96c, so I guess we're looking for the total energy, which includes the rest mass and the kinetic part.

So first, I need to calculate gamma. Let me think: v is 0.96c, so v squared over c squared is (0.96)^2. Let me compute that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Taking the square root of that, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, I should be more precise. Let me do it more accurately. 0.28 times 3.5714 equals roughly 1. Wait, maybe 1 divided by 0.28 is about 3.57142857. Let me check: 0.28 * 3.57142857 ≈ 0.99999999, which is 1. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c². The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus is approximately the same as the atomic mass, but I have to remember that 1 atomic mass unit (u) is about 1.66053906660e-27 kg. But wait, the mass of Li-6 is 6 u. So m = 6 u.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to remember that 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy E_rest is m*c² = 6 u * 931.5 MeV/u. So that would be 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV. Wait, 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is 5.589 GeV. Then the total energy E is gamma multiplied by this, so E = gamma * E_rest. Gamma was approximately 3.5714, so 3.5714 times 5.589 GeV.

Let me calculate that. 3.5714 * 5.589.

Hmm, 3 *5.589 is 16.767. 0.5 *5.589 is 2.7945. 0.0714 *5.589 is about 0.0714 *5 = 0.357, and 0.0714 * 0.589 ≈ 0.0420. So total is approximately 0.357 + 0.042 = 0.399. So adding all together:

3.5714 = 3 + 0.5 + 0.0714.

So 3 *5.589=16.767, 0.5 *5.589=2.7945, 0.0714 *5.589≈0.3993.

Adding them up: 16.767 + 2.7945 = 19.5615; plus 0.3993 gives about 19.9608 GeV.

Wait, but that's approximately 20 GeV. But the options don't have exactly 20. Let me see the options:

Options are A) 18.4
