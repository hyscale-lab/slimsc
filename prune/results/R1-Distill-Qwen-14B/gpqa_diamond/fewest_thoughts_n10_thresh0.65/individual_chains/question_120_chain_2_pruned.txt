Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy, right? The closer a star is, the higher its parallax. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is twice as far as one with 2 parsecs. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, higher parallax means closer distance. Oh wait, no, wait. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So distance d = 1/plx, where plx is in parsecs. So if plx is 1, d is 1; plx is 0.5, d is 2. Yeah, that's right.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in what sense? Oh, I think it means their density is uniform in space. So the number density of stars is the same throughout the volume. Or maybe it's uniform in the galactic plane, but I think for this question, it's just a general uniform distribution.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So like, if I look at a certain range of parallax values, say from plx to plx + dplx, how does the number of stars in that range change with plx.

Let me think about it. If the stars are uniformly distributed, then the number density n is constant. So the number of stars in a volume element dV would be n * dV.

But how do I relate this to parallax? Well, parallax is related to distance. Since d = 1/plx, so plx = 1/d. So when plx increases, d decreases. But wait, no, plx is higher for closer stars. So for a given range in plx, like from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range?

Wait, let's express distance in terms of parallax. d = 1/plx. So if plx goes from p to p + dp, the distance goes from d to d + dd, where dd = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, because d = 1/p, so dd/dp = -1/p². So the change in distance is related to the change in parallax.

But how does the volume element look in terms of distance? Let's imagine a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of that shell is 4π d² dd. But since the density is uniform, the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π d² dd.

So the number of stars per unit parallax range would involve how the change in parallax relates to the distance. Let's see. So if I have a small change in parallax, dp, how much does d change? Since d = 1/p, then p = 1/d. So dp = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = - d² dp. But since dp is a small positive number, when p increases, d decreases. So maybe it's better to express in terms of p.

So the number of stars in a shell between p and p+dp would be n * 4π d² (dd). But dd is -d² dp. So substituting:

Number of stars in dp range = n *4π d² * (-d² dp)

Wait, but d is 1/p, so d² is 1/p². So let's plug that in.

Number of stars = n *4π * (1/p²) * (1/(p²)) * |dp|

Wait, because I think I might have messed up the substitution. Let me try that again.

Wait, the shell volume is 4π d² dd. From earlier, the number is n * 4π d² dd. But we need to write this in terms of p.

We have d = 1/p, so d² = 1/p². Also, dd = - d² dp, because from before, dd = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting:

n *4π (1/p^2) * (- (
