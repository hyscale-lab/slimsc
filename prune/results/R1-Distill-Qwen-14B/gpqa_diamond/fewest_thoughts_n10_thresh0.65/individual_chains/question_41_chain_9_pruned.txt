Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down step by step. Let me try to think through this.

Alright, so the setup is: a light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. And the light is moving toward the observer because the glass is moving toward the observer. Wait, noâ€”wait, the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the light is moving towards the observer, but the medium (glass) is moving towards the observer as well.

I remember that in physics, when dealing with relative velocities, especially with light, things get a bit more complicated because of relativity. But wait, this scenario is probably using the classical approach, not considering special relativity because the speeds involved are much lower than c. Or is it? Hmm, but since the question mentions the index of refraction, maybe it's assuming that the medium's velocity is non-relativistic.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. But wait, that's the speed within the medium when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But here, the medium itself is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed of light?
