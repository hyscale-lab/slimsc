Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let's see what the question says.

So, we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so Planet_1 orbits its star quickerâ€”so it's closer in, right? Because orbital period relates to the distance from the star.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm, that's interesting. So Planet_2's star is less massive but has the same radius as Planet_1's star. I wonder how that affects things.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. The formula for transit probability is something like (R_p / a)^2, but maybe it's (R_*/a)^2? Or wait, I think the probability is proportional to (R_*/a) times (something else). Wait, let me think. The transit probability P is given by P = (R_p / a) * ( (R_* / a) )? Or wait, no. Maybe the transit probability is (R_*/a) multiplied by the ratio of the planet's orbital plane being edge-on. Oh wait, the main factor is the ratio
