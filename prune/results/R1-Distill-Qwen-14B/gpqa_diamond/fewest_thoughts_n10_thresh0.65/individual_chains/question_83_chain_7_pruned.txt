Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to titration calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe I can figure this out.

First, let me note down the given data. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and the concentration is 0.05 M. Then, we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5. The temperature is 25°C, which probably doesn't affect much here.

So the first step is to calculate the diluted concentration of acetic acid before titration. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on dilution.

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. Here, M1 is the initial concentration (0.05 M), V1 is 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration M2 is (M1V1)/V2.

Let me compute that: (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, but how much volume of NaOH is needed for equivalence? Let's find that first because the pH at equivalence might depend on that.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in the diluted solution: M = moles/volume (L). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M, so moles = M * V. Let V be the volume in liters. 0.1 * V = 0.001 → V=0.01 L = 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the problem asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So I need to calculate the pH when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added and when 10 cm³ is added.

Let me tackle the 25% titration point first.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. Let me compute the moles of NaOH: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

Each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, forming acetate ions.

So initial moles in solution (after dilution):
CH3COOH: 0.001 mol
NaOH added: 0.00025 mol

So after reaction:
CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol
CH3COO^-: 0 + 0.00025 = 0.00025 mol

The total volume of the solution is the original 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, this is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5.

pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) = 0 - (log(1.85) + log(1e-5)). 

Log(1.85) is about 0.267, and log(1e-5) is 5, so pKa ≈ 4.733 (since 5 - (0.267 -5) ? Wait, no. Wait, pKa = -log(Ka) = 4.733. Because 1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 10^-5, so log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). 

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.
