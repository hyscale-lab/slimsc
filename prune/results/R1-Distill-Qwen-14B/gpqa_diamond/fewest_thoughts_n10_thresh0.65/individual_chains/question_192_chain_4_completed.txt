Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again carefully. Hmm, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The cavity isn't at the center; it's shifted by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than the conductor's radius R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity.

The question asks for the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. So point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, let me visualize this. The conductor is a sphere, and there's a cavity off-center. The charge +q is inside this cavity. Since the conductor is uncharged, its net charge is zero. But when the charge is placed inside the cavity, what happens? I remember that in conductors, charges reside on the surface. But wait, this is a conductor with a cavity. Oh right, when you have a charge inside the cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to it, and the outer surface will have a charge equal to the net charge of the conductor.

Wait, but the conductor is initially uncharged. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the part near the cavity) will have an induced -q charge. Then, since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have a +q charge. But wait, no, because the conductor was uncharged. So the inner surface must have -q (induced by the +q), and the outer surface must have +q to balance, because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer. Oh wait, no, wait. The conductor has zero net charge. So the inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must be +q? Or is it that the outer surface adjusts to maintain the net charge zero?

Wait, no. Let's think again. The conductor is neutral. So the induced charges must sum to zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. So the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. But since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance the -q on the inner surface. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, so inner is -q, outer is +q. So the total is zero. Wait, no. Wait, the conductor itself is neutral. So the net charge is zero. So if the inner surface is -q, the outer surface must be +q, because the conductor's total charge is (inner + outer) = 0. So -q + outer = 0 → outer is +q.

But wait, let me make sure. The cavity is inside the conductor. The conductor is neutral. So when you place a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's walls) will have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor must cancel the electric field within itself. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q so that the total charge of the conductor remains zero (since it started uncharged). So the outer surface has +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P is due to the charges on the outer surface of the conductor. Because the inner charges (the -q on the cavity's inner surface) are screened by the conductor. So the field outside is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center, because of the spherical symmetry. Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has +q, but the conductor's shape is spherical, so perhaps the field outside depends on that.

Wait, but the charge distribution on the outer surface isn't uniformly spherical? Because the cavity is offset, so maybe the outer surface charge isn't uniform. Hmm, but I think the field outside a spherical conductor only depends on the total charge enclosed, regardless of the distribution. Because of the shell theorem, right? Or is that only for electrostatic situations where the charge distribution is spherically symmetric?

Wait, in this case, the conductor is a sphere, but the cavity is off-center. So the inner surface has -q, but it's not a uniform distribution. It would arrange itself to exactly cancel the field inside the conductor. But the outer surface has +q, but how is it arranged? Since the conductor is a sphere, but the charge inside the cavity is off-center, does that affect the outer charge distribution?

Wait, but for external points, the electric field due to a spherical shell is as if all the charge is at the center. But that's only when the shell is uniformly charged, right? If the charge distribution is non-uniform, then the external field isn't the same as a point charge. Hmm, but wait, in this case, the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface has to be a spherical shell. Because the conductor is a sphere, but the charge distribution on the outer surface might not be uniform.

Wait, no. Because the conductor is a sphere, the charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves to maintain electrostatic equilibrium. But in this case, the charges on the outer surface are free to move. So if the inner surface has a non-uniform distribution (due to the off-center charge), would that cause the outer surface to have a non-uniform distribution as well?

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral. When you place a charge +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) must have a charge of -q to cancel the electric field within the conductor. The outer surface must then have +q to make the conductor's net charge zero.

But since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge distribution is symmetric? Or because the inner charge is off-center, does it cause the outer surface's charge to be non-uniform?

Wait, in a spherical conductor, any excess charge resides on the surface. But if the conductor is neutral, but the inner surface has a non-uniform charge distribution (like -q not uniformly spread), then how does that affect the outer surface?

Wait, I think that the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, and the inner charge is -q, so the outer must be +q. But since the conductor is a sphere, I think the outer charge would distribute uniformly because the electric field inside the conductor must be zero everywhere. So the charges arrange in such a way that the field within the conductor is zero, which would require the outer charge to be spherically symmetric.

Wait, but wait. The charge on the inner surface is -q, but it's not uniformly distributed because the cavity's center is offset. So how can the outer surface still distribute uniformly? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's the case that the inner surface's charge distribution is non-uniform, but the outer surface's is uniform. Because, in a conductor, the charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves to cancel any internal fields. So the fact that the inner charge is off-center might cause the inner surface to have a non-uniform distribution (like more negative charge closer to the point where the +q is), but the outer surface, being a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, distributes uniformly because any external fields would cause movement of charges.

Wait, no. The outer surface's charge distribution is determined by the external conditions. In this case, the only external influence is the inner charge. So perhaps the outer surface's charge is arranged in such a way that it cancels the field inside the conductor. But since the inner surface's field is due to the -q charge, which is off-center, the outer surface's charges would arrange such that the net field inside the conductor is zero.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the electric field outside the conductor. The point P is outside the conductor, so the conductor's outer surface's charge is +q. If the outer surface's charge distribution is spherically symmetric (because the conductor is a sphere and charges arrange uniformly), then the electric field at P would be the same as if all the +q were concentrated at the center. So the electric field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²). Option D is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(l²). Hmm. So which is it?

Wait, but maybe the distribution on the outer surface isn't uniform because the inner surface's charge is off-center. So the outer surface charge might not be uniformly distributed. In that case, the electric field outside wouldn't necessarily be the same as a point charge at the center. So maybe the field isn't just (q/L²).

But wait, I thought that for a spherical conductor, the external field only depends on the total charge, regardless of internal cavity structure. Because the conductor shields the interior from external fields, but the external fields are determined by the total charge. So maybe the field outside would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L², regardless of the position inside the cavity.

But wait, that's only true if the charge distribution on the outer surface is uniform. But in this case, because the inner charge is off-center, the outer surface might not be uniform. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I should think about the method of images. Or perhaps use Gauss's law.

Wait, for a point outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. Since the conductor is neutral except for the outer surface's +q, the Gaussian surface outside the conductor will enclose +q. So by Gauss's law, the electric field should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor.

So looking back at the options, option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Option D is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / l². So which one is correct?

Wait, but the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, but l is the distance from P to the center of the cavity. So L is the distance from the conductor's center, and l is from the cavity's center.

Wait, perhaps because the charge is inside the cavity, which is offset, the effective charge distribution on the outer surface isn't uniform. So the electric field at P might not be just q/(4πε₀ L²). Hmm, but that depends on whether the outer surface is uniform or not.

Wait, no. The conductor is a sphere, so the charges on the outer surface will distribute uniformly regardless of the inner charge's position. Because in a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the charge on the outer surface must arrange to make the electric field inside the conductor zero. Since the conductor is a sphere, the outer charge must distribute uniformly because any non-uniform distribution would create an internal field. So the outer surface's charge is uniform, so the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center.

So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². So option B.

Wait, but then why are other options present? Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the charge inside the cavity is +q, but the induced -q on the inner surface. The outer surface has +q. So the total charge on the conductor is zero, but the outer surface has +q. So the field outside is due to the +q on the outer surface. But because the outer surface is a spherical shell, the field outside is as if all the charge were at the center, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

But wait, another thought: the point P is located at a distance L from the center of the conductor, but the center of the cavity is offset by s. So the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the angle between l and s is theta. So maybe the field at P isn't just due to the outer charge uniformly distributed. Maybe because the charge inside the cavity is at a different point, the field due to the outer surface isn't spherically symmetric, so the field isn't simply (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

Wait, but I thought the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge should be uniform, regardless of what's happening inside the cavity. So the field outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So option B.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Because the charge inside the cavity is off-center, maybe the conductor's outer surface's charge distribution is not uniform. Because the electric field inside the conductor must be zero. So if the inner surface is non-uniform, perhaps the outer surface must adjust to maintain zero field inside.

Wait, no. The field inside the conductor is zero. The inner surface's charge distribution (non-uniform) produces a field that, combined with the outer surface's charge, ensures the conductor's interior has zero field.

Wait, but the outer surface's charge distribution is only influenced by the need to make the field within the conductor zero. So if the inner surface's field is non-uniform, the outer surface's charge must arrange in such a way that their combined fields cancel inside the conductor.

But the outer surface is a sphere. So perhaps the outer surface's charge remains uniform because any non-uniform distribution would create a field inside the conductor. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, maybe the outer surface's charge isn't uniform. In that case, the electric field outside the conductor wouldn't be as if it were a point charge. But without knowing the exact distribution, it's hard to model the field.

Wait, but the problem gives several options, option B being (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². Let me think about other possibilities. For example, another approach: the point P is outside the conductor. So the conductor's own charges don't affect the field inside the cavity. The only charges that contribute to the external field are those on the outer surface, which sum to +q.

But if the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, then E at P is as option B. But if the distribution is non-uniform, perhaps the field depends on the position relative to the cavity's center.

Wait, but the problem states that the conductor is a sphere. So the outer surface must be a sphere. So the charge on the outer surface must be uniformly distributed because the only way for a spherical conductor to have a zero electric field inside is for the charge to be uniform. Because otherwise, any non-uniformity would cause internal fields.

Wait, that makes sense. So the outer surface's charge is uniform, so the field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center. Thus, E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$) located off-center at a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charges**:  
   - Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the inner surface of the conductor (near the cavity) will have an induced charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor due to the charge $+q$ in the cavity.  
   - To maintain the conductor's neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   - For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. In this case, the outer surface of the conductor has a total charge of $+q$, and the field outside is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor due to the shielding effect of the conductor.  
   - The distance from the center of the conductor to the point $P$ is $L$, so the electric field at $P$ is given by:  
     \[
     E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
     \]

3. **Irrelevance of Internal Geometry**:  
   - The position of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity (offset by $s$) and the angle $\theta$ do not affect the electric field outside the conductor. This is because the outer surface charge distributes uniformly on the spherical conductor, ensuring that the field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l - s \cos\theta)^2}\) is not relevant because the field outside depends only on $L$, not on $l$ or $\theta$.  
   - **Option B**: Correct. The field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l + s \cos\theta)^2}\) is not applicable for the same reason as Option A.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the field due to a point charge is proportional to \(\frac{1}{l^2}\), the field outside the conductor in this case depends on $L$, not $l$.

### Conclusion:
The electric field at point $P$ outside the conductor is given by Option B:  
\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]
