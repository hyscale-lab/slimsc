Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is about finding the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is in its fundamental state. Wait, fundamental state... I think that's the ground state, right? So, the lowest energy state possible.

The molecule is diatomic, so made of atoms X and Y. The given data includes their masses: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy states are quantized. For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are given by the combination of rotational and vibrational states. But wait, the question is about moving to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, what's the next state after the fundamental?

The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0) maybe. Or perhaps it's the next state refers to the next rotational state if the vibrational state is already at its lowest. Or maybe it's a combination of both.

Wait, the question says, 'the next state with the lowest possible energy.' So, I think it's looking for the smallest possible energy increment. So, the molecule absorbs a photon that causes the minimal possible transition. That would probably be a change in either rotation or
