Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with decay processes and mesons. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that decay processes involve particles breaking down into other particles. The mean decay distance probably depends on the particle's lifetime, how long it exists before decaying. The longer the lifetime, the further it can travel before decaying.

Wait, but how do I find the lifetime? I think the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ. Oh right! The uncertainty principle tells us that Γ is the energy uncertainty, and τ is the time uncertainty. So the relation is Γ * τ = ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, what units are we dealing with here? Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is usually in units involving GeV·s or something. Let me recall the value of ħ. I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh right, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant in terms of eV·s is about 6.58e-16 eV·s, so in GeV·s it's 6.58e-25.

So Γ is 320 MeV. Let me convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Now, τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in numbers: τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute 6.582 divided by 0.32. 0.32 times 20 is 6.4, so 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check the calculation. 6.582 / 0.32: 0.32 goes into 6.582 how many times? 0.32*20=6.4. So 20 with a remainder of 0.182. 0.182/0.32 is approximately 0.56875. So yeah, about 20.56875.

So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

But wait, that's the lifetime. The next step is to find how far the meson travels before decaying. For that, I need its velocity. Because distance = velocity × time.

So I need to find the velocity of the meson. Since it's produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, and its mass is 1.2 GeV. Hmm, E is the total energy, so E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). Since m is in GeV/c², and E is GeV, the GeV units should cancel.

Wait, but in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, energy and mass are equivalent. But in real units, the velocity is calculated using relativistic equations.

Let me compute the velocity beta (β) where β = v/c. The relativistic energy is E = γ m c², and γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²).

So, β
