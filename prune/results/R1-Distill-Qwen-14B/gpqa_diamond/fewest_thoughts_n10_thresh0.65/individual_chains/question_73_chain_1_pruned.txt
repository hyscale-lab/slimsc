Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think this through.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. Wait, the question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are given, so I need to compute both and pick the correct one.

First, relative speed. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract them normally like in classical mechanics. Instead, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, both are moving in the same direction, so v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So the relative speed would be v1 minus v2, but adjusted for relativity.

Let me compute that. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. The numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's the relative speed.

Now, the other part is the total energy of the system. Oh, right, each astronaut's energy in relativity is given by gamma times m c squared. So I need to calculate the relativistic gamma for each and sum their energies.

Wait, but the masses are 2m and 3m. So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v is 0.6c, so v² is 0.36c². 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So the energy E1 is gamma * m c² * 2m? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is E = gamma * m_rest * c². So for the first astronaut, m_rest is 2m. So E1 is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait, hold on. No, that's not right. Oh no, wait, no, the rest mass is m. So for the first astronaut, the rest mass is 2m, right? So E1 = gamma * (2m) c². So yes, 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

For the second astronaut, mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Let me compute gamma. v is 0.5c, so v² is 0.25c². 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma * (3m) c² = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 mc².

So the total energy E_total is E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.9641 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². That fits. Option C is the one. Let me check the other options.

Option B has E=4.96, which is much lower. Option D has E=5mc², which is less than 5.96. So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts moving in the same direction:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(
