Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see what it's about.

Alright, the question says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. Because the star is rotating, these spots will come into and go out of view, causing brightness variations. The problem states that this situation can look like an exoplanet causing a dip in brightness when it transits in front of the star. Now, we need to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots.

Wait, so if the star wasn't spotted, what exoplanet radius would create the same signal in the light curve? I think this is about comparing the depth of the brightness dip caused by the planet transit versus the dip caused by the spots.

So, first, I should probably calculate the change in brightness due to the spots. Then, I can compare that to the change caused by a planet blocking part of the star's disk.

Let me start with the star's parameters. The star has a radius R equal to the Sun's radius, R_sun. The effective temperature, Teff, is 6000 K. The spots are cooler by 1000K, so their temperature is 5000 K. The filling factor is 20%, so the area covered by spots is 0.2 on one hemisphere.

Wait, but since only one hemisphere is spotted, and the star is rotating, the spots will come in and out of view as the star spins. So the maximum effect will be when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the other side (non-spotted) is facing. But for the brightness variation, we need to find the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, no. Think again. The star's brightness is modulated as the spots rotate into and out of view. The overall effect would be a periodic dip when the spots are on the side facing us. But the problem says that if the star wasn't spotted, the same amplitude in brightness variation would be caused by an exoplanet. So we
