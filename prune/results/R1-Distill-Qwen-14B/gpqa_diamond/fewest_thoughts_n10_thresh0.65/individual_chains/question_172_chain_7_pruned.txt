Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. The question states that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the energy levels is 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of energy levels depends on temperature. The Boltzmann factor tells us that the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights. But in this case, the problem says the energy levels have a specific energy difference, and the excitation is twice as much in star_1.

Wait, wait, I think the problem is comparing the excitation of the same energy level in both stars. So for a given transition, the excitation (which I think refers to the number of atoms in an excited state) depends on the temperature. So the ratio of excitation between the two stars would be a function of their temperatures.

Let me get this straight. Let's denote n1 as the number of excited atoms in star_1, and n2 for star_2. The question says n1 = 2 * n2. So n1/n2 = 2.

The Boltzmann equation for the population of a particular energy level is n = (g / Z) *
