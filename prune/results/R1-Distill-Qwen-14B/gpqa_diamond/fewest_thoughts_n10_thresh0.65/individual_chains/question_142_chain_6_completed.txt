Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

The question gives me the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. But wait, what's the geometric interpretation of this?

I think in the Bloch sphere representation, any single qubit state can be represented as a vector on a unit sphere. The Bloch vector has components (x,y,z), right? For pure states, the vector lies on the surface of the sphere, but for mixed states, it's inside.

Wait, the given ρ is a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ states. Let me write it out. The density matrix is ½(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Oh wait, that's the same as the completely mixed state for a qubit. Because when you have equal probabilities of being in |0⟩ and |1⟩, the density matrix is diagonal with ½ and ½ on the diagonal.

So in the Bloch sphere, how does this look? The Bloch vector for a general qubit state is (x, y, z), where each component is related to the density matrix elements. For a density matrix ρ, the components are:

x = 2 Re(ρ_01)
y = 2 Im(ρ_01)
z = Tr(ρ · σ_z) / 2, or more directly, the (0,0) element minus the (1,1) element divided by 2.

Wait, let me get that right. The Bloch vector components are calculated as:

r_x = 2 * Re(ρ_01)
r_y = 2 * Im(ρ_01)
r_z = (ρ_00 - ρ_11)

Wait, no. The general formula is that the Bloch vector r is given by:

r = [2 Re(ρ_01), 2 Im(ρ_01), ρ_00 - ρ_11]

Wait, let me double-check. The density matrix ρ is a 2x2 matrix. Let's write it out in terms of the Bloch sphere:

ρ = [ [ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],
       [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

Wait, no, I think I have that slightly off. The correct expansion is:

ρ = (1/2) [ I + r · σ ]

Where σ represents the Pauli matrices. So expanding that, it's:

ρ = (1/2) [ [[1,0],[0,1]] + r_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + r_y [[0,-i],[i,0]] + r_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So each component:

ρ_00 = (1 + r_z)/2
ρ_11 = (1 - r_z)/2
ρ_01 = (r_x - i r_y)/2
ρ_10 = (r_x + i r_y)/2

So from the given ρ, which is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) /2, let me compute each element.

ρ_00 = ½ (⟨0|0⟩ + ⟨0|1⟩⟨1|0⟩ )? Wait no. Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 at (0,0) and 0 elsewhere. Same for |1⟩⟨1|, which is 1 at (1,1). So when you add them, you get a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Multiply by ½, so ρ_00 = ½, ρ_11 = ½. The off-diagonal terms ρ_01 and ρ_10 are both 0.

So putting that into the Bloch vector components:

r_x = 2 Re(ρ_01) = 2 Re(0) = 0
r_y = 2 Im(ρ_01) = 0
r_z = ρ_00 - ρ_11 = ½ - ½ = 0

Wait, but wait another thing. Because for the Bloch vector, r_z is (ρ_00 - ρ_11). So in our case, ½ - ½ is zero. So r_z is zero. So the vector is (0,0,0). That's the origin in the Bloch sphere.

But wait, in the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state is represented by the origin. Because when all states are equally probable (like a maximally mixed state), the vector is at the center.

So the geometrical position is the origin, which corresponds to r=(0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that should be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the system has equal probability of being in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit is described by a vector \((r_x, r_y, r_z)\), where the components are related to the elements of the density matrix as follows:

\[
r_x = 2 \, \text{Re}(\rho_{01}), \quad r_y = 2 \, \text{Im}(\rho_{01}), \quad r_z = \rho_{00} - \rho_{11}.
\]

For the given \(\rho\), the diagonal elements are \(\rho_{00} = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(\rho_{11} = \frac{1}{2}\), and the off-diagonal elements are \(\rho_{01} = \rho_{10} = 0\). Substituting these into the formulas for the Bloch vector components:

\[
r_x = 2 \, \text{Re}(0) = 0, \quad r_y = 2 \, \text{Im}(0) = 0, \quad r_z = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = 0.
\]

Thus, the Bloch vector is \((r_x, r_y, r_z) = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This is consistent with the fact that the maximally mixed state is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the Bloch vector is \((0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
