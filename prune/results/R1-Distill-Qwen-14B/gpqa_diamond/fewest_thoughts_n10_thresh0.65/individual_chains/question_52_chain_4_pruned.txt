Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about stars with dark spots and how they affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that stars have things like starspots which can influence their overall temperature and emission, but I'm not entirely sure how that ties into the energy levels of atoms in the photosphere.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the spots are cooler regions, I think. Because when spots are present, the average temperature of the star's surface goes down.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, without spots, the ratio is higher than when there are spots. The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes. So, factor = ratio_without_spots / ratio_with_spots.

Wait, the ratio of number in level 1 to level 2. The problem states that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. Which means the factor would be greater than 1.

I remember that in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (or degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, so if the star's overall temperature changes, how does that affect the ratio n1/n2? Let's think: when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower, 5500 K instead of 6000 K. But wait, does the temperature of the photosphere decrease uniformly because of spots, or is it just the spotted regions that are cooler?

Hmm, the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the average temperature drops. But wait, maybe the star's photosphere is a mix of the spotted and unspotted regions. But if 40% of the surface is spots, but the problem states that the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, maybe the effective temperature is an average, but the photospheric temperature varies across the surface. But for the purpose of this problem, we're considering the photosphere as being at a certain temperature. Because the question says, in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio... and assumes LTE, so perhaps the relevant temperature is the effective temperature of the photosphere.

Wait, the problem says that when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temp is 5500 K. So, perhaps the photosphere as a whole is
