Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. 

So the problem gives the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. I think K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-, and K would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So I guess that means the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. Because it's a 1:1 complex, right? So the initial concentrations would be [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M, and initially, [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] would be zero, but that's not right because when the complex dissociates, some Ca²+ and EDTA will be released. 

Wait no, wait. Actually, when the solution is made, you have the complex already formed. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M of CaEDTA^2-. Then, it can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA
