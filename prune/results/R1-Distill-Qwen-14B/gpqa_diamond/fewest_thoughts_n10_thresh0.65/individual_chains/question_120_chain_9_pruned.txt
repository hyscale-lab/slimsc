Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

Alright, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance. The parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. So, a star with a smaller parallax is farther away, and a larger parallax means it's closer. So, if I think about the sky, stars are spread out in all directions, but how does that distribution affect the number we see with a certain parallax?

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Does that mean their distance is uniform? Or is it their position on the celestial sphere? I think it means that the density of stars is uniform in space. So, more distant stars would be less dense in terms of how many are in a given volume because the volume increases with distance.

So, let me think about the number of stars per unit volume. If the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in a volume element dV would be proportional to dV. But dV depends on the distance. Let me recall the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is (4/3)πr³. So, the number of stars at a distance r and within a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr would be something like n = 4πr² dr multiplied by the star density (let's say a constant σ stars per cubic parsec or whatever unit).

So, n ∝ r² dr. But how does this relate to parallax? Parallax plx is equal to 1/ distance (in parsecs), right? So plx = 1/r. Then, r = 1/plx. Substituting that into the expression, n ∝ (1/plx)^2 * (dr), but wait, I think I need to express dr in terms of plx. Because the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So, as parallax changes by dplx, how does r change?

Let's see, plx = 1/r → r = 1/plx. Differentiating both sides, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Since I'm considering a small change in plx, the negative sign just indicates direction, but when considering magnitudes, it doesn't matter. So, the absolute value would be dr = (1/plx²) dplx. Rear
