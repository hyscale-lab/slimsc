Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. The given relationship is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

Wait, the formula given is N ∝ 1/plx^5. That means as plx gets smaller (because distance is getting larger), N increases. But I need to find how N changes with distance, not parallax.

I think I should express plx in terms of distance. Oh yeah, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So plx is inversely proportional to d.

So, substituting plx into the equation. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). But since plx is 1/d, then plx^5 is (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5.

So substituting that in, N ∝ 1/(1/d^5) = d^5. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me think again. 1/plx^5 is equal to (1/(1/d))^5? Wait, no. Wait, plx =1/d, so plx^5 = (1/d)^5. Then 1/(plx^5) would be (d^5) / 1. So N is proportional to d^5. That suggests that as distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm, wait, that's the tricky part.

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?". Oh, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. So the number of stars isn't just a function of distance, but perhaps how much the number increases as you move a unit distance. So perhaps it's the differential, like dN/dr.
