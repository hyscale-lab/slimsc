Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The amount of shift is related to the mass of the planet and other orbital parameters.

Wait, the formula that relates the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) to the orbital period (P) and other variables. I think the formula is K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )

But wait, since the planet mass is much smaller than the star (Neptune is much less than Sun), M_p is negligible compared to M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, which is the same for both stars since they're the same mass as the Sun.

So, K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)).

Wait, no, let me think again. The exact formula, I think, is K = ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/(M_star)) )^(something). Wait, perhaps I should look for a simplified version when M_p << M_star.

In that case, the formula simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star^(2) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ) ) * (some factors... Wait, perhaps a
