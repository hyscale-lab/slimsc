Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but I'll give it a shot. Let me try to unpack what's being asked.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each particle has a charge of 2 times that. Their mass is negligible, so maybe I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—probably just focusing on potential energy.

So there are 12 of these charges constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, I think this is about electric potential energy because when charges are placed in a system, their potential energy contributes to the total energy.

Wait, but wait. The system is isolated, so the potential energy would be the sum of the interactions between all the charges, I suppose. But since the 13th charge is fixed at P and the others are at 2m from P, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th. But I also need to consider the interactions between the 12 charges themselves because they're all at the same point (same distance from P, but their positions relative to each other matter).

Let me think. The formula for electric potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, right? Where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². Since all charges are the same, each pair will contribute similarly.

So, first, let's calculate the potential energy between the 13th charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges at 2m. Then, I have to calculate the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges. Adding all these together will give the total potential energy, which I guess is the minimum energy of the system.

Wait, but wait. The 12 charges are constrained at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other—how are they arranged? Oh, because the problem doesn't specify, I think I have to assume that each of the 12 are equally spaced on a sphere (or maybe a circle, but in 3D,
