Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, the question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, so in this case, the angles are 30 degrees each. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. 

Wait, interatomic distance... I think in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a. So in this case, a is 10 Angstroms. But since it's rhombohedral, maybe I have to consider the unit cell more carefully.

The formula for interplanar distance d(hkl) is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ), but wait, no. Oh wait, no, that's not correct. I think the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the Miller indices vector. But wait, for cubic systems, it's simpler, but rhombohedral might be different because the angles aren't 90 degrees.

Right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hk + hl) cos α ), wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: maybe I should use the formula for a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system.

Wait, rhombohedral is a special case of hexagonal? No, actually, hexagonal is different. Rhombohedral has threefold symmetry, just like hexagonal, but I think the unit cells are different. 

I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a, b, c which are equal, and the angles between them are all equal. So in this problem, a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and α = β = γ = 30 degrees. 

The formula for interplanar distance in such a system is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos γ + kl cos γ) ), wait wait, no. Let me think again. The general formula for d(hkl) in a rhombohedral system is
