Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and see what it's asking.

So, the question is about an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that electric potential energy is involved when dealing with charges. Since all the charges are the same, this should be a case of calculating the potential energy between each pair of charges.

Wait, the system is isolated, so I don't have to consider any external potential energy, just the interactions between the charges in the system. Right.

Let me think. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, each of these 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge. Also, the 12 charges are probably arranged in some symmetrical way around P. But does their arrangement matter for the potential energy between them? Because for potential energy, each pair contributes, so maybe I can calculate each pair's contribution and sum them all.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So, their distance from each other might not necessarily be 2 m. Wait, no, if all 12 are at a radius of 2 m from P, their distance from each other depends on their positions. But since the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, perhaps we're to assume that they're all at the same point? Or maybe they form a regular dodecahedron or something, but that's probably overcomplicating.

Wait, no. Actually, the problem might be that each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from P. So each of the 12 is 2m from the fixed charge. But how about the distances between the 12 charges? Do I need to consider the potential energy between them as well?

Hmm. Because the system is of 13 charges, but the 1
