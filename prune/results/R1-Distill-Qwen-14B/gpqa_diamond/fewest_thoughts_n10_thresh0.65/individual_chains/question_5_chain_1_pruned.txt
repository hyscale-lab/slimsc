Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, with eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So the overall operator would be the vector sum of its components in the x, y, and z directions. But the question specifies that the direction is arbitrary, but lies in the x-z plane. That means the arbitrary direction n would have components (nx, 0, nz), because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

The eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I think I need to find the eigenvector of the operator P·n, where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane.

Let me think. The operator P is a spin-1/2 operator, probably for a muon, which has spin 1/2. So the possible eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. The direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so it's some direction making angles θ with the z-axis, perhaps. But I'm not sure yet.

First, let me write down the expressions for each component of P. 

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], and Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, the operator P·n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction vector components. Since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So P·n = Px * nx + Pz * nz.

But wait, P is a vector operator so P·n would be nx*Px + ny*Py + nz*Pz. Since the direction is in x-z, ny =0, so P·n = nx*Px + nz*Pz.

So let's express this operator. Let me
