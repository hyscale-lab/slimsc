Okay, so I have this titration problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are provided, so maybe I can figure it out by following each step carefully.

First, I think I should find out how much acetic acid we started with and then what happens after dilution. Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we dilute it, its concentration decreases, which should affect its dissociation. 

So, the initial volume is 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) and the concentration is 0.05 M. The moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity × Volume, so 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, that's not right. Because when you dilute a solution, the moles stay the same, right? So the initial solution has 20 cm³ × 0.05 M = 0.001 mol of acetic acid. After adding 20 cm³ water, the volume is 40 cm³, so the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Got it.

Now, for the titration with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid.

We're asked about two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Let me tackle each part one by one.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid present. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed to reach equivalence (V_eq) is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted into its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-). So the solution will consist of Na+ and CH3COO^- ions. Since Na+ is a spectator ion, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate in water.

The solution at equivalence is a solution of sodium acetate. The concentration of acetate will be the moles of acetate divided by the total volume.

Wait, the total volume at equivalence is the initial diluted solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (10 cm³). So 40 + 10 = 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L.

Moles of acetate = 0.001 mol (same as initial acetic acid). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate (CH3COO^-) is the conjugate base of acetic acid. It will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-
