Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on stellar atmospheres, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles among energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

Right, the Boltzmann factor. The population ratio between two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is N2/N1 = exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, in this case, the energy difference is the same for both stars, right? Because it's the same energy levels in iron atoms. So E2 - E1 is the same for both stars, let's call that delta E. The problem states that iron is twice as excited in star_1, so N2_1 / N1_1 = 2. Or wait, no, actually, the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So if I let N be the population of the higher energy level, maybe N1 for star_1 and N2 for star_2, then N1 = 2 * N2.

Wait, wait, no. The question says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. I think that refers to the ratio of the excited state population. So if in star_2, the population is N, then in star_1 it's 2N. Or perhaps the other way around. Let me think. If star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited, then the number in the higher energy level must be higher for star_1. So N1/N2 = 2, where N1 is the excited state of star_1 and N2 is that of star_2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so perhaps the excitation level for star_1 is double that of star_2. So for each atom, the probability of being in the excited state is higher in star_
