Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed, but this is relativistic, so things must be different. Let me think.

The question gives me that the oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A, and it obeys Hooke's law F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are A to D, so I'll have to figure out which formula is correct.

Wait, in the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is given by v_max = (kA)/m, or maybe v_max = sqrt(k/m) * A? Because the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², which converts into kinetic energy, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = A sqrt(k/m). Oh wait, that's different from what I first thought. So yeah, v_max squared is (kA²/m), so v_max is sqrt(kA²/m) which is A*sqrt(k/m). So option C is sqrt(kA²/m), which is the same as (A sqrt(k/m)), so that's correct classically. But this is a relativistic oscillator, so maybe there's a gamma factor involved.

In relativity, when velocities approach the speed of light, the mass increases due to gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the energy might not be just (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh wait, but the problem says it's a relativistic oscillator, so we probably can't ignore relativistic effects.

Wait, the potential energy in a relativistic harmonic oscillator might be treated differently. Let me think about the energy. The total energy in the system would be the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². The potential energy is (1/2)kx², just like classical.

But at maximum amplitude, x is A, so the potential energy would be (1/2)kA². But wait, in the relativistic case, is the potential energy still (1/2)kx²? Or does it change? Hmm, I think in some treatments, like the
