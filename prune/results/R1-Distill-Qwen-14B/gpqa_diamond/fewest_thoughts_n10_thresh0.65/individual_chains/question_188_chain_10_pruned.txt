Okay, so I've got this problem about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Let's see, what do I remember about rhombohedral crystals?

Rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal, right? So the lattice parameters a, b, and c are the same. But wait, the angles between them aren't necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, no, wait—no, wait. Wait, no, wait. No, rhombohedral usually refers to a system where a = b = c, and angles can be different. Or is it that in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal? Hmm, I think I might have confused that. Oh, right, the rhombohedral system is a special case of the hexagonal system where the angles α, β, γ are all equal. Or wait, no, I think I got that mixed up. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, in the hexagonal system, the angles are 90, 90, and 120. So rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system, but with all angles equal. So, yeah, here the angles are all 30°, which is less than 90. Interesting.

But wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, another thought: rhombohedral structures can also be a type of cubic system when all angles are 90 degrees, but when they're not, it's a different case. Hmm, perhaps it's better to focus on the formula for interplanar distance.

The interplanar distance (d) for a plane (hkl) in a crystal lattice is given by the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ) )

Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, wait, no, because in the case of a cubic crystal (like simple cubic, fcc, etc.), the formula is d = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2). But when the crystal is not cubic (
