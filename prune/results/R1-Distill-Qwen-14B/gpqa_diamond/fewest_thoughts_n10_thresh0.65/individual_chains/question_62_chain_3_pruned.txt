Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, let me visualize that. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane ring. Also, there's an aldehyde group somewhere. Wait, the name says cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane ring. So the structure is probably a cyclohexane with an aldehyde group (CHO) and another substituent which is a hydroxymethyl attached to another cyclohexane (cyclohexyl group). So the substituent is -(cyclohexyl-CH2-OH), attached to the cyclohexane with the aldehyde.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (C≡C-) attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So the starting molecule is cyclohexane with a triple bond between two carbons attached to it.

I need to figure out the sequence of reagents to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule. Let me think about the possible reactions.

The target has an aldehyde group. So, perhaps the triple bond is involved in forming a ketone or aldehyde through some kind of oxidation. Alternatively, maybe adding a functional group that can be oxidized.

Looking at the options, the reagents vary. Let me think about each step.

First, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, possible reactions on alkynes: hydration, addition of halogens, deprotonation, etc.

Option A starts with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation or elimination. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl, which is a methylating agent. Maybe an alkylation? Wait, but where? If the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (C6H
