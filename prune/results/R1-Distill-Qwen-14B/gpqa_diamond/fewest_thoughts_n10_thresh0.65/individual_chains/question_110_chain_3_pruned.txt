Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that both instruments have different magnitude limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, while HIRES can go down to 16. So the stars have to be bright enough (apparent V mag ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES) to be detected by both. Wait, no, wait—because each spectrograph can observe stars up to a certain magnitude. So, a star must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. Wait, no, wait, no—ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17, meaning it can see stars that are 17 or lower. Because if a star is brighter (lower magnitude number), it's easier to detect. So, for ESPRESSO, apparent V mag ≤17. For HIRES, it's ≤16. So the star needs to be within both limits, which would be ≤16 mag, because that's the stricter limit.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed," meaning that ESPRESSO can't detect stars fainter than 17. So, the maximum apparent mag
