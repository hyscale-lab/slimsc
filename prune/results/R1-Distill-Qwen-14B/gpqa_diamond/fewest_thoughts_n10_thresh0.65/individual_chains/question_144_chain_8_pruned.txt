Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given data is production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Wait, the mean decay distance... I remember that particles that decay quickly don't travel far. The decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. But how do I calculate that?

I think the formula for the mean decay distance (L) is L = v * τ, where v is the velocity and τ is the mean lifetime. But to get τ, I should use the uncertainty principle or the relation involving the decay width.

Oh right! The mean lifetime τ is the inverse of the total decay width Γ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, units are important here. Γ is given in MeV, but constants like ħ have units of GeV·seconds or something like that.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. But Γ is given in MeV. So I need to make sure the units match. Let's convert Γ into GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that makes sense. Now, the velocity v. How do I find that? The particle's energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, and its rest mass m_X = 1.2 GeV. So I can find the velocity using the relativistic energy equation.

The total energy E is related to the rest mass and the momentum. E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Since energy is in GeV and mass is in GeV/c², I think I can work in natural units where c=1, but maybe I should be careful.

But wait, in natural units, c=1, so E
