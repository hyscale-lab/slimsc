Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and then determining the final product. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I need to analyze the given spectroscopic data. The IR and NMR data are provided.

Starting with the IR spectrum: The peaks observed are between 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretching or maybe N-H. But looking at the options, they don't have amines, so probably an O-H. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, putting this together, Compound X likely has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester or acid) and an aromatic ring. The broad peak in the IR around 3400-2500 could be from an -OH group. Wait, but 1720 could also be an ester or maybe a ketone. But if it's a carbonyl, and there's an aromatic ring, maybe it's a benzaldehyde or a benzoic acid derivative? Hmm.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but a carboxylic acid proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and broad. So the 10.5 ppm peak could be a carboxylic acid -OH, which is broad. But wait, the integration is only 1H. So if it's an acid, then maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but let me look at the other peaks. 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. So the aromatic system is para-substituted. So the substituents are on opposite positions of the benzene ring.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is maybe a CH group next to an oxygen or something else. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Possibly adjacent to another CH or perhaps part of a chain. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, which is often a methyl group attached to something like a CH that's split into a doublet. 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, probably attached to a CH2, like an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a para-substituted benzene ring with a side chain. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

The aromatic protons are in a para arrangement. Let's say the substituent is at the para position. The substituent might be a ketone or an ester. Wait, but the IR has 1720 cm-1, which is more like a carbonyl. So perhaps a ketone group attached to the benzene. Or maybe an ester or an acid.

Wait, but the IR also shows 3400–2500, which I thought was O-H. If it's a carbonyl and an O-H, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have both O-H and C=O. So the IR would show a broad O-H around 2500-3000 (which might be the case, but sometimes the O-H can be a peak around 3000 and maybe not as broad if it's deprotonated, but in the data, it's 3400-2500, which is a range that includes O-H stretch). So maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but let me think. If it's a benzoic acid, the NMR would show a broad peak for the -OH, which the 10.5 ppm is. Then, the other substituents on the benzene are at the para position. So maybe there's a substituent with a carbonyl group attached.

But wait, the NMR doesn't show a carbonyl group, because in 1H NMR, the carbonyl is usually not seen. So perhaps the substituent is a ketone or an ester.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde or something else.

Wait, another approach: Let's go through the NMR signals.

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a singlet, but
