Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure out which one never needs regularization. Let me think.

First, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle those infinities.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity, right? And it's supposed to unify all the forces. Since it's a theory that includes gravity and works at high energies, maybe it doesn't have the same issues as other quantum field theories. But wait, do string theories require regularization? I'm not too sure. I remember that string theory has a concept called the Regge slope which is related to the string tension. But does that mean it uses regularization? Or is that a different concept?

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong force. I know that at high energies, QCD exhibits asymptotic freedom, meaning the coupling constant becomes weak. But I also remember that QCD calculations can lead to divergences, like in loop diagrams. So regularization is definitely used here. For example, lattice QCD is a way to regularize the theory by putting it on a discrete space-time grid. So B would require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED has processes that lead to divergences, like the electron self-energy. These require renormalization, which often involves some form of regularization. Techniques like the Pauli-Villars regularization or dimensional regularization are used. So C does require regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, this is the classical theory, not the quantum version. Classical theories don't have the same divergences as quantum field theories because they don't involve the same kind of calculations with virtual particles and loops. In classical E&M, you might have issues like the infinite charge density at a point charge, but those are more philosophical and not handled by regularization. Regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So D doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. It's handled classically, possibly through other means or by ignoring the singularities since they don't affect physical measurements.

So the question is asking which theory never
