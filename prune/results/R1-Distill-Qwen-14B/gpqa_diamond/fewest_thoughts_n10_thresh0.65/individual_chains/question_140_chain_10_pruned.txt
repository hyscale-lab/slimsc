Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then there's something about a product of a keto acid reacting with X containing 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Hmm, I need to identify what X is. Let's break down each part.

First, the reaction between X and Y produces gas W. The key here is that W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let me think about gases produced in reactions. Common ones could be H2, O2, CO2, NH3, etc.

If the molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons, maybe it's something like H2O. Wait, no, H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons), and O with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the molecule would have 2*(1p,0n) and 8p,8n. The total would be 10p and 8n. Not equal. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: the molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. So each atom in W's molecule should have same number? Or maybe the total for the molecule. Let's think of possible molecules.

For example, CO2: C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (assuming 12C), O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. CO2 molecule: (6+8+8) protons = 22, neutrons = 6+8*2=22. So 22 each. That fits! So W could be CO2. Because the molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate again. CO2 has one C and two O atoms. C has 6p and 6n, O has 8p and 8n. So total p = 6 + 8*2=22. Total n =6 +8*2=22. So yes, same number of pro
