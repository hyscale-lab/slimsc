Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, parallax is involved. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax angle (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance to the star. So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

The problem is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, I think they want to know the relationship between the number of stars and the distance r. The options are all about different exponents, so I need to find how the number of stars (N) depends on r.

Given N varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, plx = k / r, where k is some constant. So plx is proportional to 1/r. Let me write that down.

plx = k / r → plx ∝ 1/r

So substituting plx into the N equation. N ∝ 1/( (1/r)^5 ) → because (plx)^5 is (1/r)^5. So 1 over that would be r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. Let's break it down:

N ∝ 1/(plx^5). Since plx is inversely proportional to r, plx = k/r. So plx^5 = (k/r)^5 = k^5 / r^5.

So 1/(plx^5) = r^5 / k^5. So N is proportional to r^5, because the constants don't matter for the proportionality.

So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance. So per unit range of distance, the number of stars would go up by r^5.

Looking at the options, option B is ~ r^5. So the correct answer should be B.

But wait, maybe I should think about this in another way. Parallax is in arcseconds, and distance in parsecs. Oh right, the formula for distance is distance (pc) = 1 / parallax (arcsec). So plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.

If the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, then N = C * (1/plx)^5 = C * d^5, since d = 1/plx. So yes, N is proportional to d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with d^5. So per unit distance, the number increases as r^5, so option B.


The question involves determining how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{k}{r} \), where \( k \) is a constant. Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{k}{r} \) into the given relationship, we get:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{k}{r}\right)^5} = \frac{r^5}{k^5}.
\]

This shows that \( N \propto r^5 \), meaning the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance. Among the given options, this corresponds to option B (\( \sim r^5 \)).

Answer: B
