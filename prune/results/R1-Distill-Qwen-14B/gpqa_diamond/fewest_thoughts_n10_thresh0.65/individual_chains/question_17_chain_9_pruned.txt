Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a certain concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex. The given information is that the solution has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The formation constant (K) is a measure of how strong the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

So the problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in the solution. I think the key here is to use the formation constant equation. The formation constant, K, for a complex is given by the formula:

K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, in this case, the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex already. The concentration given is 0.02 M, which I assume is the concentration of the complex, [Ca-EDTA].

Since EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, it can bind to Ca²+ in a 1:1 ratio. So, each mole of Ca-EDTA complex uses one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. If the solution is 0.02 M in Ca-EDTA, does that mean all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex? Probably not, because even though the K is large, some dissociation will occur. So I can't just say [Ca²+] is zero because the complex doesn't dissociate completely.

So I need to set up an equilibrium expression. Let me think.

Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M.

At equilibrium, some of this complex will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me set up the variables. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates from the complex. So:

[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x
[Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, since x is probably very small compared to 0.02.

Wait, is that right? Because if K is very large, the complex is stable, so x would be small. So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x.

Plugging into the K expression:

K = [Ca-EDTA] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )
5x10^10 = (0.02) / (x * x)
So 5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Then, solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12
