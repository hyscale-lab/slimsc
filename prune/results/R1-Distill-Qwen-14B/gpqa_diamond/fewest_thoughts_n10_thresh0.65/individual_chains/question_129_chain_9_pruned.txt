Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by breaking down the reaction steps and the given information.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions. Let's go through each step one by one.

First, the reaction scheme:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, gives 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hint b) The IR spectra: A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, E around 1715 cm^-1.

I remember that IR peaks around 1700-1750 cm^-1 usually indicate carbonyl groups, like ketones or aldehydes. So, compound A probably has a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone since the peak is around 1750 which is a bit higher than aldehydes. Then, looking at E, the peak is at 1715, which is lower, perhaps a conjugated ketone or maybe an aromatic ketone, but I'm not sure yet.

Now, looking at reaction 1: A + HCN â†’ B. HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So, if A is a ketone, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin. Wait, but another possibility is that A is an aldehyde. But given the IR, I think it's a ketone. So, HCN would add to the carbonyl, making a cyanohydrin structure. So compound B would have an -OH and a -CN group adjacent to each other on a carbon.

Reaction 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd (which is a catalyst for hydrogenation) to form C. Hydrogenation of what? Well, if B is a cyanohydrin, perhaps it has a double bond somewhere else or maybe an aromatic ring? Wait, or maybe the cyanide group is being reduced. Wait, H2 with Pd would typically reduce triple bonds or aromatic rings, but maybe in this case, the nitrile group (CN) is being reduced. Oh wait, H2 and Pd is usually for hydrogenation of triple bonds to single bonds, but for nitriles, I think H2 with a catalyst like Raney Ni would reduce nitriles to amines. Wait, but palladium is used for hydrogenation of alkenes. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B has a nitrile and an alcohol group. Wait, when you have a nitrile adjacent to an alcohol, upon hydrogenation, maybe the nitrile is converted to an amine. Or wait, maybe I'm thinking of the wrong reaction.

Wait, let's think again. If A is a ketone, and B is the cyanohydrin, then B has a structure where the carbonyl O is replaced by -OH and -CN groups on adjacent carbons
