Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think it through step by step. 

The setup is a bit complex. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So the conductor is like a bigger sphere, and the cavity is inside it, not centered. 

Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. But the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. 

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. For example, in electrostatics, the charges in a conductor redistribute themselves. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, but now there's a charge inside the cavity, I think the conductor might have induced charges. 

Wait, right. When a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge opposite to the enclosed charge. So the inner surface would have -q. But since the conductor itself was neutral, the outer surface must then have +q to balance the -q on the inner surface. 

But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges on the outer surface should reside on the outer part. But in this problem, the cavity isn't centered, so the induced charges might be unevenly distributed. But when considering the field outside the conductor, I think the distribution on the outer surface might still be such that the field depends only on the total charge outside. 

Wait, no, I think the conductors' charges rearrange in such a way that outside the conductor, the field behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. But is that true only when the charge is at the center? Because in this case, the cavity is off-center. 

Hmm, maybe not. Let me think. When a charge is placed inside a cavity that's not at the center, the induced charges on the inner surface will redistribute to cancel the field inside the conductor. So the inner surface's charge distribution will be such that it creates a field that
