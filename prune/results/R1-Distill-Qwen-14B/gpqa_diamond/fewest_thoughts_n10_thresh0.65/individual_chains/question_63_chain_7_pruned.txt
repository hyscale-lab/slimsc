Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. They want to know the momentum of that photon so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. The given data includes the masses of the atoms, bond length, and angular frequency of vibration. 

Wait, the molecule is modeled with the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is the rotational-vibrational model. So the energy levels here are a combination of rotation and vibration, not just one or the other. 

In the quantum mechanical model for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are quantized and given by the formula E = (something with rotational and vibrational parts). For the rigid rotor (which this isn't, since it's non-rigid), the rotational energy is quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But since it's non-rigid, maybe the bond length isn't fixed, so the rotational energy might be a bit different, but I'm not sure how that affects the problem. 

The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (ℏω)(n + 1/2), where n is the vibrational quantum number. For the fundamental state, n is 0. 

Wait, the question mentions the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would correspond to n=0 and J=0 (the lowest rotational state). So the molecule is in the state with n=0 and J=0.

When it absorbs a photon, it jumps to the next lowest energy state. I think the next lowest state would involve the lowest possible increase in energy. So that could be either increasing the vibrational state (n=1) or increasing the rotational state (J=1). But wait, for diatomic molecules, the rotational energy is quantized in terms of J, which is a non-negative integer. So from J=0, the next is J=1.

But wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So the next state could involve either a change in vibration or rotation, but which one has lower energy? Or perhaps the photon causes a transition that combines both? Or maybe the problem is considering the transition from the ground state to the next state, which could be the first excited state either in rotation or vibration.

Wait, but the problem is about the next
