Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let me break it down step by step.

Alright, the question gives a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several steps to form E. There are also some hints provided, so I should pay attention to those.

Starting with the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form E.

Hmm. Let's think about each step.

First, reaction A → B with HCN. HCN is typically used to add a cyanide group. So, in an addition reaction, maybe A is a carbonyl compound. Because when a carbonyl (like a ketone or aldehyde) reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. The IR peak for A is around 1750 cm^-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. So A is likely a ketone because aldehydes usually have higher wavenumbers for their carbonyls, but maybe not. Or maybe it's a cyclic ketone.

Next, B is treated with H2 and Pd, which is hydrogenation. So B has something that can be hydrogenated. B is a cyanohydrin — so if A is a ketone, B would be a secondary alcohol attached to a cyanide group. Wait, no. Wait, when a ketone reacts with HCN, the product is a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol group and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon. So, structure-wise, if A is a cyclic ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin with the nitrile and OH on adjacent carbons.

Then, when we reduce B with H2 and Pd, that's a hydrogenation reaction. But what's in B that can be hydrogenated? The nitrile group (CN) can be hydrogenated to an amine, but under H2 and Pd, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in the cyanohydrin is hydrogenated. Wait, the cyanohydrin doesn't have a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps B is a ketone with a cyanide group attached, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, A is a carbonyl, reacts with HCN to form a cyanohydrin. So the structure would be something like R-C(OH)-CN. So, for example, if A is cyclopentanone, B would be cyclopentane cyanohydrin, which is a cyclopentane ring with an OH and CN group on adjacent carbons.

Then, when B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. The nitrile group (CN) can be hydrogenated to an amine, but in the presence of Pd, maybe it becomes an amine. Wait, but hydrogenation of nitriles typically gives amines. Wait, no, more accurately, hydrogenation of nitriles usually under H2 and a catalyst like Raney Ni
