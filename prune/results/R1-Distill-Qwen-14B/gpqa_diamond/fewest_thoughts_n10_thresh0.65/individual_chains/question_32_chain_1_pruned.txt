Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC colliders accelerate heavy ions to high speeds and then make them collide. The nucleus here is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li-6 has 3 neutrons because Li typically has 3 protons, so 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Li has atomic number 3, so if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 + 3 =6. So it's Li-6. Got it.

So I need to find the energy of the RHIC that gives nucleus X (Li-6) a speed of 0.96c. The options are A to D. I think I should use the relativistic energy equations for this.

First, I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The formula is E = gamma * m0c². So I need to find gamma, the Lorentz factor, for v = 0.96c.

Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's compute that.

v = 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is, let me think, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.571428
