Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can get tricky. But let me take it step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. The general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, X is 0, N is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which is three double bonds or one ring plus three double bonds) but I'm not sure yet.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm (t, 1H), that's a triplet. High ppm, so probably an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. The triplet might suggest coupling with two neighboring protons? Or maybe it's a triplet due to coupling with another proton, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde next to a CH2 group.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). Those look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest adjacent substituents. Also, the 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) â€” broad singlet. Broad usually indicates exchange with something, like an -OH proton or maybe a vinyl proton but not sure. If it's a singlet, maybe two equivalent protons that don't split each other. 

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) is a doublet. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group or something similar.

Putting this together: the compound might have a benzene ring attached to something else. The aldehyde suggests maybe a substituted benzaldehyde. The 3.66 ppm could be a CH2 connected to an oxygen, perhaps part of an ester or ether. Wait, but with the molecular formula C8H9NO, maybe it's a secondary amine or an amide? Or maybe an aldehyde with some substituents.

Wait, looking at the reagents: the first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl. That's a typical nitrous acid condition, used for diazotization. So the starting compound must have a primary amine group because diazotization is done on aromatic amines, usually aniline derivatives. But wait, the molecular formula has one N. So, C8H9NO: that nitrogen is probably in an amine group because the options include things like aldehydes and phenol groups.

Wait, if the starting material has an -NH2 group, then after reaction with NaNO2 and HCl (diazotization), it would form a diazonium salt. Then, the second reagent is H2O. Diazonium salts in water (with H2O) typically undergo hydrolysis. If it's an aryl diazonium salt, under certain conditions, like maybe with heat, it can undergo hydrolysis to form a phenol. But wait, the third reagent is aqueous KOH and heat. That might be a Hofmann elimination or something else.

Wait, let me think again. The initial compound has N, so the starting material probably has a substituent with N. Let's think about the NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 is probably an aldehyde. So maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with another group attached.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows a triplet for the aldehyde. Aldehydes are usually deshielded and appear as singlets, but maybe if it's adjacent to a CH2 group, the aldehyde proton couples with the two protons on the CH2, giving a triplet. So the structure could be R-CH2-CHO, where
