Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that in crystals, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The question gives me the interatomic distance and the angles of the rhombohedral crystal, and asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Wait, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that for a rhombohedral system, all the edges are of equal length, and the angles are all the same, which they are here—30 degrees each. So it's a special case of a hexagonal crystal, maybe? Or is it more closely related to cubic? No, rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems, with all sides equal and angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance—so that's the distance between adjacent atoms along one of the lattice vectors, right? So a is 10 Angstrom. Because in a cubic system, a is the edge length, but here it's rhombohedral.

The interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) in a crystal is given by the formula from crystallography. Oh right, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) )

Wait, wait. Or maybe it's the square root of [h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ]. Wait, no, wait. I think I might have the formula wrong. Let me think again.

Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )

Wait, but wait a minute—rhombohedral systems have all angles equal, so α = β = γ here. So for this crystal, α = β = γ = 30 degrees. That should simplify the formula.

So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt(1² + 1² + 1² + 2*1*1*cos30° + 2*1*1*cos30° + 2*1*1*cos30° )

Wait, wait. Let me check. The general formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )

But since here α = β = γ = 30°, and a is the lattice parameter.

So substituting, we have:

h=1, k=1, l=1, so:

d = a / sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 + 2*1*1*cos30 + 2*1*1*cos30 + 2*1*1*cos30 )

Let me compute that step by step.

First,
