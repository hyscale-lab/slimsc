Okay, so I've got this question about planet transits, and I need to figure out which planet is more likely to transit, so the researchers should observe that one. Let's start by understanding what's given.

Both planets are Earth-like and detected via the Radial Velocity (RV) method. They have the same minimum masses, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1's period is P1, and Planet_2's is P2 = 3 * P1. Wait, no, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter, which means P1 is shorter. So P1 = P2 /3. Or wait, no: if Planet_1 has a shorter period, then P1 is shorter. For example, if P2 is 100 days, P1 would be 33.33 days. Got it.

Both have circular orbits. So that simplifies things a bit because eccentricity doesn't play a role here.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. So M1 = 2 * M2. But both stars have the same radii. Interesting. So R1 = R2.

We're to find which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so higher chance, meaning the researchers should pick that one.

Transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. For a planet to transit, its orbit must be edge-on. The probability of this is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the orbital distance. But wait, more accurately, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a) * (some function based on the distance from edge-on). Wait, let me think.

The probability for a planet to transit is given by (R_star / a) * (1 / (cos i)), but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, the transit probability is (R*/a) / (1 - e²)^½, but since e=0 (circular orbits), it simplifies to (R*)/(a). But wait, I've read that the probability is approximately (R*/a) multiplied by (some factor based on the impact parameter). Hmm.

Wait, the probability for a random orientation of the orbit is roughly (R*/a) multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 + (a/(R
