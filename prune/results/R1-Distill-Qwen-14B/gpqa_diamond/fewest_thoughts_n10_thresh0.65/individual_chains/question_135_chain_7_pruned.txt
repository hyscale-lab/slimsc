Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem talks about the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ_f̄ (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, okay, I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interactions in a quantum field theory context. So the field X is interacting with some fermions ψ_f.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to find which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into, considering conservation laws and energy-momentum constraints.

First, I think about what the interaction term implies. The term ψ_f̄ X ψ_f suggests that the boson X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So X can decay into pairs of these fermions, provided the energy is sufficient.

Wait, but what determines which fermions are allowed? Well, in particle decays, the mass of the boson has to be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair it's decaying into. Because energy and momentum have to be conserved; you can't create a pair if you don't have enough energy.

So the fermions that X can decay into must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV each, since 6 GeV is the mass of X, and the minimum required would be when two fermions are produced at rest, each with mass m, so 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Do I need to consider the mass of the fermions? The problem doesn't specify the masses of the fermions, which is a bit tricky. Oh wait, but in standard model particles, the fermions have known masses, right? So I should probably think in terms of the standard model fermion masses.

So, let me list the fermions and their masses (approximate):

- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV
- Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): around 95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): around 1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): around 173 GeV
- Electron (e): around 0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): around 105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): around 1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos (ν): very light, but we can ignore them since the problem doesn't mention them.

So for X to decay into a pair of fermions f and f̄, each must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Because 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

Looking at the fermion masses:

- e: 0.511 MeV → way below 3
