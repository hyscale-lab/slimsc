Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what the question says. Oh right, the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The formation constant (Kf) tells us how strong the complex is. So the higher the Kf, the more the metal is bound to EDTA. But wait, the question is about the free calcium ion concentration. So if the complex is stable, the free calcium should be low.

The problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. Stoichiometric usually means the molar ratio is exactly as per the reaction. So if the complex is Ca-EDTA, the formula might be something like [Ca(EDTA)]^something. Let me think, Ca is +2 charge, EDTA is usually -4, so the complex would be neutral, right? So the formula is probably CaY²- where Y is the EDTA^4-.

Wait, no, wait. The complex would be [CaY]^0. So the formula is CaY. So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, that's the total concentration of CaY.

So the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ [CaEDTA]^0
