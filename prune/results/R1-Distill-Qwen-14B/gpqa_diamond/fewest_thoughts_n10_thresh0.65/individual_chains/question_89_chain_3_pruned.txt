Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH to give a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided. Hmm. I remember that when dibromides react with a strong base like KOH, elimination reactions can happen, forming alkenes. The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone. Wait, but wait, elimination usually gives alkenes. Oh wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? No, epoxides form from epoxidation, which isn't the case here.

Wait, the product after KOH heating. 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the structure is adamantane with Br atoms on carbons 1 and 3. When KOH is used, especially for vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo), elimination would form an alkene. But 1,3-dibromo isn't vicinal. Hmm, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation but across a longer chain? Or perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, could it be a substitution reaction?

Wait, wait. Another thought: maybe the reaction is a double elimination, leading to the formation of a ketone. Let me think. If each Br is on a different carbon
