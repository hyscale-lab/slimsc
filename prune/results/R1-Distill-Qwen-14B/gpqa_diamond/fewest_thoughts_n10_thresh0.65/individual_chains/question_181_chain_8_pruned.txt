Okay, so I have this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, right? Hmm. Let me think. The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch suddenly stops in the Sun's core. I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produce energy through fusion.

Wait, the pp chain has different branches. Oh right, the main one is the pp-I branch, which is the dominant process. But there's also the pp-II and pp-III branches, which are less significant. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos because it involves heavier elements, maybe like carbon or nitrogen. Or wait, no, the pp-III branch might be a specific part where maybe a proton captures another proton, leading to a certain isotope that decays, releasing a neutron and a positron or something. But I'm a bit hazy on the details.

But the question says that the pp-III branch stops. That would mean that the neutrinos produced by that branch would stop as well. Oh wait, no, the question says it stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Because neutrinos travel at the speed of light, which is about 8 minutes from the Sun's core to Earth. So any change in the Sun's core would be noticeable on Earth only after that time delay. So, in this scenario, the pp-III branch has stopped 8.5 minutes ago, and we're looking at the current flux on Earth.

Now, the flux is the number of neutrinos per cm² per second. The question is asking about the ratio of flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

I think that the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are higher energy. Because the pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the pp-III might produce higher. Or maybe the opposite? Wait, let me think. The pp-I branch produces a proton, a positron, and a neutrino (like in the reaction p + p → ²H + ν⁺). Those neutrinos are lower energy because the Q-value of that reaction is lower. On the other hand, the pp-III branch might involve reactions with higher binding energies, releasing more energy, so the neutrinos would have higher energies.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that. Another approach: In the Sun, the dominant neutrino production is from the pp-I
