Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with velocities at significant fractions of the speed of light, we can't just subtract them normally because of relativistic effects. So, for the relative speed, I think we need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. Suppose astronaut A is moving at u in the positive direction and astronaut B is moving at v in the positive direction from the same frame. So, from A's frame, what's B's speed? It should be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, no. Oh right, the velocity of B as seen from A's frame. So if both are moving in the same direction as per the original frame (say, the Earth frame), then from A's perspective, B is moving at (v - u) divided by (1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So in this case, astronaut 1 has mass 2m and speed 0.6c
