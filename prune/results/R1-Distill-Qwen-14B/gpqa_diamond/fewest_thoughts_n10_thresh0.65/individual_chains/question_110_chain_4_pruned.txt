Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with different parameters, and I need to find which two can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. The key here is understanding the brightness requirements of each spectrograph.

From what I recall, the problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, let me check the question again. Oh right, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO. That means the apparent V magnitude (mV) should be ≤17 because lower numbers are brighter. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So for HIRES, mV must be ≤16.

Wait, no, actually, the way the question is worded is: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Wait, no, because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, its apparent magnitude is less than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with mV ≤17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with mV ≤16. So for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent
