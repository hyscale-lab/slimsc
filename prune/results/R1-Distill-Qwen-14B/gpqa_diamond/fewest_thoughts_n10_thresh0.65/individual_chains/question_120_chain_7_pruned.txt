Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is: If stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, how does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx? The options are A to D, each with different power laws.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So a star with a parallax of 1 pc is 1 parsec away, and if the parallax is 0.5 pc, it's twice as far. So the formula is plx = 1/distance.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So, like, if I have a certain range of parallax values, how many stars are in each such range?

Wait, the stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in what sense? I think it means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume, assuming uniform distribution.

So let's think in terms of distance. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, maybe I can relate the number of stars per parallax range to the number per distance.

Let me consider distance intervals. Suppose I have a small range of distances, say from d to d + dd. The number of stars in this range would depend on the volume. Since the distribution is uniform, the number density n is constant. So the number of stars in that volume is n * (4π d² dd), because the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd.

But we want the number per unit parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's express dd in terms of plx. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Taking the derivative, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Hmm, the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, which makes sense.

Wait, but I'm interested in the number of stars per unit plx. So, the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is N = n * 4π d² dd.

But since d = 1/plx, let me substitute that in
