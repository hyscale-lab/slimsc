Okay, let me try to work through this quantum mechanics problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I hope I can figure it out.

The problem is about finding the probability of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Hmm, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the spin-z operator. So the state is a linear combination of these states.

First, I think I need to normalize this state. Because the coefficients are complex, their squares' magnitudes will give the probabilities. But wait, I remember that to find probabilities, I need to calculate the squared magnitudes of the coefficients, but the state must be normalized first. So the normalization factor is 1 divided by the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient.

Let me compute the coefficients first. The first coefficient is (1+i). The magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. The second coefficient is (2 - i). Its magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the sum is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Wait, but the question says it's proportional to that state. So we have to normalize it as such.

Now, the next part is about the operator whose matrix representation is A_ij, where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. So what's the matrix look like? Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we're dealing with up and down spin states), the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2.

So the matrix A would be:
[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ]

Hmm, that looks like an operator that has eigenstates different from the standard |up> and |down> states. I think this operator might be related to the spin in the x-direction or something else. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the spin operator S_x is (ħ/2) times the
