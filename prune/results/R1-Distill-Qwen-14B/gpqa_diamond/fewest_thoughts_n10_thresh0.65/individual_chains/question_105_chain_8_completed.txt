Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a go. Let me read through the question again and break it down.

The problem is about a star with some spots and how it affects the light curve, comparing it to a planet transit. The question is asking what the radius of an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as the spots are doing. 

So, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, which I know is about 1 R☉, but the exact value might not matter. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler because they have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So, the spots must be at 5000 K. 

When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective. This causes the star's brightness to vary. But if a planet transited the star, it would block some light, causing a dip in brightness. The question is, what planet radius would give the same dip amplitude as the spots.

Wait, no. The problem says that the star's brightness variation due to the spots is similar to an exoplanet transit. So, the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as if a planet were blocking light. We need to find Rpl/Rstar.

I remember that the brightness change when a planet transits a star is given by the formula: ΔF ≈ (Rpl / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But wait, the spots are not the same as a planet. Spots are cooler regions, so when they are on the visible side, the star appears dimmer because those spots are emitting less light. So the star's brightness dip is due to the spots being cooler, not blocking light entirely. 

So the change in flux from the star when the spots are visible should be compared to the change when a planet transits.

Let me think about each part.

First, the star emits a certain amount of flux. When spots are present on the hemisphere facing us, the total flux is reduced. The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the visible hemisphere is spots. Each spot is cooler, so each spot emits less flux per unit area than the rest of the star.

The star's total flux when the spots are visible is F_total = F_normal - F_spots + F_cooler_spots? Hmm, maybe I should model it as the star's flux when spots are present.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractional change in flux due to the spots. 

The star's normal flux is F0 = σ * Teff^4 * (Rstar^2 / (4D^2)) ), where D is the distance to us. But since we are looking for a relative change, maybe D cancels out.

When the spots are present, the flux is F = F0 - (filling factor) * (ΔF per spot) * (area covered). Wait, no, let me think again.

The star's surface has a certain temperature. If a fraction f of the surface is cooler, then the total flux is (1-f) * F_normal + f * F_cool. So the change in flux is ΔF = (1-f) * F_normal + f * F_cool - F_normal = -f (F_normal - F_cool).

F_normal is the flux per unit area of the normal star: σ * Teff^4. F_cool is σ * (Teff - ΔT)^4, where ΔT is 1000 K, so Teff is 6000 K, so T_spot = 5000 K.

So F_normal = σ * 6000^4. F_cool = σ * 5000^4.

So the flux change is ΔF = -f (F_normal - F_cool) * (Area fraction of visible hemisphere).

Wait, but the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, sometimes that hemisphere is visible, sometimes not. At maximum, when the spotty hemisphere is fully visible, the flux is F0 - f*(F_normal - F_cool), I think. 

Wait, no. The total flux from the star as seen from Earth depends on which part of the star is visible. When the spotty hemisphere is the one facing us, the flux is F = (1-f) * F_normal + f * F_cool. Because f is the fraction of that hemisphere covered by spots. But wait, each spot is part of the hemisphere, so the entire hemisphere is being considered. Or maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface. Because the star's surface is a sphere, each hemisphere has half the surface area.

Wait, the problem states that one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is 0.2 for that hemisphere. So the entire star has an area of 4π Rstar². The hemisphere has 2π Rstar². So the spotty area is 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 0.2 of that hemisphere's area, which is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the other side.

So the maximum dip in flux occurs when the spotty hemisphere is visible. So we can model the flux as:

F = (flux from non-spotty parts of the visible hemisphere) + (flux from spotty parts of the visible hemisphere).

The visible hemisphere is either the spotty or the non-spotty one, depending on the star's rotation.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_spotty = (1 - f) * F_normal * (Area of hemisphere / (4π R²)) ) + f * F_cool * (Area of hemisphere / (4π R²)) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the fractional change in flux.

The total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F_visible = (Area of non-spotty parts of hemisphere / (4 π R²)) ) * F_normal + (Area of spotty parts / (4 π R²)) ) * F_cool.

The area of the spotty parts is f * (hemisphere area) = f * 2 π R².

So,

F_visible = [ (2 π R² (1 - f) ) / (4 π R²) ) ] * F_normal + [ (2 π R² f ) / (4 π R²) ) ] * F_cool.

Simplify: each term becomes ( (1-f) * 2 π R² / 4 π R² ) = (1-f)/2.

So,

F_visible = (1-f)/2 * F_normal + f/2 * F_cool.

Similarly, when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, F_visible is (F_normal), because the non-spotty hemisphere's flux is all F_normal.

Wait, no. The non-spotty hemisphere has no spots, so all areas emit F_normal. So when that hemisphere is visible, the flux is just (2 π R² / 4 π R²) * F_normal = (1/2) F_normal.

Wait, no, wait. The star's total flux when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible is (hemisphere area) * F_normal / (4 π R²). Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, the star's total flux is F_total = (4 π R²) * F_surface, where F_surface is the flux per unit area, which is σ Teff^4.

So when a hemisphere is visible, the flux is (2 π R²) * F_surface * (1 if hemisphere is not spotted, or some fraction if spotted).

Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider the star's total flux as F0 = (4 π R²) * σ T_star^4.

When a fraction f of the visible hemisphere is covered by spots, the flux is:

F = F0 * ( (1 - f) * T_star^4 + f * T_spot^4 ) / T_star^4.

Wait, that might not be exactly correct. Let me think again.

Each spot has a lower temperature, so each spot emits less flux per unit area. So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F = ( (1-f) * (Teff)^4 * A_hemi + f * (Teff - 1000)^4 * A_spots ) / A_total.

Wait, A_hemi is the area of the visible hemisphere, which is 2 π R². A_spots is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

But perhaps it's easier to compute the fractional change.

Flux when spots are visible (ΔF) compared to when they're not.

When the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_non_spot = (2 π R² / 4 π R²) * σ Teff^4 = (1/2) σ Teff^4 * 4 π R² / (4 π R²) )? Wait, I'm getting confused, perhaps better to compute the relative flux change.

The relative change in flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible compared to when it's not.

The flux without any spots (assuming no spots) when the hemisphere is visible is F0 = (2 π R²) * σ Teff^4 / (4 π R²) ) = (1/2) σ Teff^4.

Wait, no. The star's total flux is F_total = 4 π R² * σ Teff^4. When only a hemisphere is visible, the flux is 2 π R² * σ Teff^4. So, compared to the full star, it's half.

Wait, but in reality, the flux we receive is the entire star's surface because we see it as a sphere. Wait, no, when we observe a star, we receive light from the entire surface. So perhaps considering the star as a sphere, the total flux is 4 π R² σ Teff^4. When part of the surface is cooler, that part contributes less.

In this case, the star is rotating, so from our perspective, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, that's half the star's surface. So the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotty = ( (1-f) * Teff^4 + f * (Teff - ΔT)^4 ) * (2 π R²) * σ / (4 π R²) )

Simplify the R² and π terms:

F_spotty = ( (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - ΔT)^4 ) * (2) * σ / 4 )

Wait, 2 π R² / 4 π R² = 2/4 = 1/2. So, F_spotty = ( (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - ΔT)^4 ) * (σ) * 0.5.

Similarly, when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, F_non_spotty = (Teff^4) * 0.5 σ.

The change in flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is ΔF = F_spotty - F_non_spotty.

So,

ΔF = [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - ΔT)^4 ) * 0.5 σ ] - [ Teff^4 * 0.5 σ ]

= 0.5 σ [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - ΔT)^4 - Teff^4 ]

= 0.5 σ [ (1-f -1) Teff^4 + f (Teff - ΔT)^4 ]

= 0.5 σ [ -f Teff^4 + f (Teff - ΔT)^4 ]

= 0.5 σ f [ (Teff - ΔT)^4 - Teff^4 ]

So the fractional change in flux is:

ΔF / F_non_spotty = [ 0.5 σ f ( (Teff - ΔT)^4 - Teff^4 ) ] / [ 0.5 σ Teff^4 ]

= f [ ( (Teff - ΔT)^4 / Teff^4 ) - 1 ]

= f [ ( ( (Teff - ΔT)/Teff )^4 ) - 1 ]

Plugging in the numbers:

Teff = 6000 K, ΔT = 1000 K → Teff - ΔT =5000 K.

So,

(Teff - ΔT)/Teff = 5000 /6000 = 5/6 ≈0.8333

(5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 → let's calculate that.

0.8333 squared is about 0.6944. Squared again is about 0.4823.

So, (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So,

ΔF/F_non_spotty = 0.2 * (0.4823 - 1) = 0.2 * (-0.5177) ≈ -0.1035.

So the flux decreases by about 10.35% when the spotty hemisphere is visible.

Wait, but wait, the star's brightness when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F_spotty = F_non_spotty * [ (1-f) + f ( (Teff - ΔT)/Teff )^4 ) ].

Wait, but F_non_spotty is when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, which is F_non_spotty = (2 π R² / 4 π R² ) * σ Teff^4 = 0.5 σ Teff^4.

So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is 0.5 σ [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (5000^4) ].

So the maximum dip is when the spotty hemisphere is in front. The dip would be the difference between that and when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the amplitude of the brightness variation.

When the star rotates, the flux varies between F_non_spotty (when non-spotty hemisphere is visible) and F_spotty (when spotty hemisphere is visible). The amplitude is the difference between these two.

But wait, the problem says that the photometric observations will show periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. So the brightness fluctuates as the spots come into view. The maximum dip is when the spotty hemisphere is fully visible.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between F_spotty and F_non_spotty.

Wait, wait. Actually, when the star isn't spotted, the brightness doesn't vary. So the amplitude is the difference between when the spotty side is visible and the non-spotty side. So the dip is from F_non_spotty (higher) to F_spotty (lower), so the amplitude is F_non_spotty - F_spotty.

Earlier calculation gave that ΔF = F_spotty - F_non_spotty = -0.1035 F_non_spotty. So the amplitude (the drop) is 0.1035 F_non_spotty.

Hmm, but when a planet transits, it blocks some light, causing a dip. The amplitude of that dip is (Rpl / Rstar)^2.

We need to find Rpl such that (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The dip caused by the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 because the area blocked is a circle of radius Rpl, so the area is π Rpl². The area of the star is π Rstar². So the ratio is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but in the case of the spots, the dip is 10.35% of F_non_spotty. So for the planet to cause the same dip, (Rpl/Rstar)^2 should be equal to 0.1035.

So,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

So approximately 0.32, which is option D.

But wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, the fractional dip from the spots is 10.35% (≈0.1035). So the planet's dip would have to be the same. So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rpl = Rstar * sqrt(0.1035) ≈ Rstar * 0.3217. So 0.32, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I found that the dip was F_non_spotty - F_spotty = 0.1035 F_non_spotty. So the dip is 10.35% of F_non_spotty.

But wait, when a planet transits, the dip is proportional to (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So if the dip is 10.35% (0.1035), then Rpl/Rstar is sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier in the calculation. Let me recompute (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333. So:

0.8333^4 = (0.8333)^2 * (0.8333)^2.

0.8333^2 = 0.6944. Then 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

Then,

ΔF/F_non_spotty = 0.2 * (0.4823 - 1) = 0.2 * (-0.5177) = -0.10354.

So the dip is 10.35% of F_non_spotty.

So the planet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

So the answer would be approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Wait, but let's look at the options again.

Options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

So D is the closest.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's and an effective temperature of 6000 K. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K (5000 K). The brightness variation caused by these spots is compared to the dimming caused by a planet transiting the star.

### Step 1: Brightness Variation Due to Spots
The total flux from the star when the spotty hemisphere is visible is reduced due to the cooler spots. The flux from the star can be expressed as:

\[
F_{\text{spotty}} = (1 - f) F_{\text{normal}} + f F_{\text{cool}}
\]

where:
- \( f = 0.2 \) is the filling factor of the spots,
- \( F_{\text{normal}} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \) is the flux per unit area of the normal star,
- \( F_{\text{cool}} = \sigma (T_{\text{eff}} - \Delta T)^4 \) is the flux per unit area of the cooler spots.

The fractional change in flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible compared to the non-spotty hemisphere is:

\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotty}}} = f \left[ \left( \frac{T_{\text{eff}} - \Delta T}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 - 1 \right]
\]

Substituting \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), we calculate:

\[
\left( \frac{T_{\text{eff}} - \Delta T}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx (0.8333)^4 \approx 0.4823
\]

\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotty}}} = 0.2 \left( 0.4823 - 1 \right) = 0.2 \times (-0.5177) \approx -0.1035
\]

Thus, the fractional dip in brightness is approximately \( 10.35\% \).

### Step 2: Brightness Variation Due to a Planet
The brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the radius ratio:

\[
\text{Dip} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]

To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, we set:

\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
\]

Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):

\[
\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
