Okay, so I have this question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when considering high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergent integrals or infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work and get finite, meaningful results. So, it's a method to handle the infinities that appear when you calculate loop diagrams or other processes.

So, which theories actually need regularization? Let's go through each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version. In classical theories, you don't really have the same issues with infinities because you don't have the same mathematical structure as in quantum theories. Like, in Maxwell's equations, you don't get these divergent loop integrals because there's no such thing as loop diagrams. So, classical theories probably don't require regularization. That might be the answer, but let's check the others.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is a quantum field theory where particles like electrons and photons are described. I remember that QED calculations, especially for things like the electron self-energy or the Lamb shift, involve divergent integrals. So, they must use regularization techniques. I think they use methods like the cutoff regularization or dimensional regularization. So QED does require regularization.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, and it deals with things like quarks and gluons. Because of the complexity of the theory, especially with things like asymptotic freedom, I think that QCD calculations also have divergences. So they must use regularization methods too. But wait, because QCD is a non-abelian theory, perhaps the renormalization is more involved, but that doesn't mean regularization isn't needed. So QCD requires regularization.

Option A is Superstring Theory. Oh, superstring theory is a type of string theory that incorporates supersymmetry. String theories aim to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. I remember that string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same
