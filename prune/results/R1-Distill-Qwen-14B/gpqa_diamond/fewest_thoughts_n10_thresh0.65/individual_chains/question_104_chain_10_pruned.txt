Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune in mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected them. 

The key information given is the periodic shift in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The star moves back and forth, and we measure that as a shift in the spectral lines. The velocity of the star's movement is what we get from this shift.

I think the formula for the RV semi-amplitude (K) is something like K = (V) where V is the velocity of the star. But how does that relate to the orbital period?

Oh right, the RV method is based on the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / (P * c) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I'm mixing some equations here. Alternatively, I remember that for a circular orbit (e=0), the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 + (M_p/M_*))^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to simplify since M_p << M_*, which is the case here since Neptune is much less massive than the Sun. So M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and sin i is approximately 1 because the orbit is probably edge-on (as that gives the maximum velocity). So simplifying K:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_*^(1/3)) ) )
