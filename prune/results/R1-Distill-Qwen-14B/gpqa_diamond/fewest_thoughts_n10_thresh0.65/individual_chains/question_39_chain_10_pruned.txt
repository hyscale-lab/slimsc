Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. Okay, so we have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle moving in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Wait, right. The wave function needs to satisfy certain normalization conditions, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

But wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, that's a complex function. So the absolute square would be the wave function multiplied by its complex conjugate.

Hmm. Let me think. The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i.

So the complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Because you negate the imaginary part.

So the absolute square is ψ*ψ = [ (a / sqrt(1+x) ) - 0.5i ] * [ (a / sqrt(1+x) ) + 0.5i ]

Multiplying these out, it's (a^2)/(1+x) + (a * 0.5i)/sqrt(1+x) - (a * 0.5i)/sqrt(1+x) + (0.5i)(-0.5i).

Wait, the middle terms would cancel out, because one is positive and the other is negative. So what's left is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.25 i²) * (-1). Wait, no, let me compute that carefully.

Wait, (a/sqrt(1+x) )^2 is a²/(1+x). Then, the cross terms are (a / sqrt(1+x))*0.5i - (a / sqrt(1+x))*0.5i, which cancel each other. Then the last term is (-0.5i)(0.5i), which is (-0.25 i²). Since i² is -1, that becomes (-0.25)*(-1) = 0.25.
