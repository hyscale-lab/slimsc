Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition. I'll take them one by one.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on a beta position in an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile here because it's an enolate source. The base, NaOEt, would deprotonate the malonate to form an enolate.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. But since it's 3-(p-tolyl), the structure should be CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 connected to the p-tolyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, meaning the substituents on the double bond are the p-tolyl group and the acrylate group. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Oh wait, no, I think the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, so the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. But the substituent is on the double bond in the E configuration. So the structure would be (E)-CH2=CH-CO-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Let me think. The formula for acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, but when substituted at position 3, the structure would be CH2=CH-C-R where R is the substituent. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the
