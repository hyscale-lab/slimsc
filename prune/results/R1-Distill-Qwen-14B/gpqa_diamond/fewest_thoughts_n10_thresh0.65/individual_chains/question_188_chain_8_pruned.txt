Okay, so I've got this problem about crystallography. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are related to the unit cell parameters. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Wait, rhombohedral... I think that's a type of crystal structure where all the edges are equal length, but the angles between them are all the same but not necessarily 90 degrees. Oh right, so it's like a cube that's been skewed, but all sides are the same length.

The given interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, but wait, I'm not sure what exactly that refers to. Oh, wait, in a crystal, the interatomic distance would probably be the edge length 'a' of the rhombohedral unit cell. Because in a simple cubic structure, each atom is at the corner and the edge length is the distance between adjacent atoms. So I'll assume here that 'a' is 10 Angstroms.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. But wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, are all angles equal? I think so. So each angle between the edges is 30 degrees.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. To find that, I remember there's the Bragg's law, but wait, no, Bragg's law is for diffraction. The formula I'm looking for is the interplanar distance formula, which is d = a / sqrt(
