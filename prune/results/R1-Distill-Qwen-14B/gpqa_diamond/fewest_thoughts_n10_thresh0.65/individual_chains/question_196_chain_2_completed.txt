Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so I guess special relativity effects come into play here.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass, given maximum amplitude A. Oh right, in the classical case, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But since this is relativistic, the kinetic energy can't just be (1/2)mv², right? Because at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant.

Wait, relativistic kinetic energy is given by (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, maybe I should relate the potential energy of the oscillator to the relativistic kinetic energy.

In the classical harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement. But wait, in relativity, the potential energy might not exactly be the same, or perhaps we need to adjust the equations of motion.

Wait, the force is F = -kx, but in relativity, the equation of motion would be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can model the system by considering energy conservation, where the total energy is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy.

Wait, hold on. Let me think. The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², right? So at maximum displacement x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². Then the kinetic energy is the total energy minus potential.

But wait, in relativity, the total energy isn't just kinetic plus potential in the same way. Because the rest mass energy is mc², and the kinetic energy is the extra. So perhaps I should set the total energy as the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, which equals the potential energy plus rest energy, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the total mechanical energy in the relativistic case isn't just (1/2)kA² as in the classical case. Or maybe it is because the potential is still (1/2)kA², but the kinetic energy must account for relativity.

Wait, the problem states that the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential energy is the same as before, (1/2)kA². But when the mass is at the equilibrium position (x=0), all the energy is kinetic.

So, the total energy E is equal to the potential energy at maximum displacement, E = (1/2)kA².

Wait no, that's the classical approach. In classical SHM, the total energy is (1/2)kA², and that's equal to the kinetic energy at x=0. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv². So maybe I should set E = (1/2)kA² equal to the relativistic kinetic energy plus rest energy? Or wait, because E is also the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Hmm.

Wait, no. In relativity, the total energy E is the rest energy plus the kinetic energy. So E = mc² + K. But K is the kinetic energy, which is (γ - 1)mc².

Wait, but in the classical case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², which includes both kinetic and potential. So perhaps in the relativistic case, the same condition applies at maximum displacement: the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero there. Then, as the mass moves toward equilibrium, the potential energy decreases and the kinetic energy increases. But wait, that would be the case for the classical oscillator, but in relativity, maybe things are a bit different.

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is not exactly (1/2)kA² in the relativistic case. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator. The force is F = -kx, but when considering relativity, the momentum p is gamma*m*v. So F = dp/dt. Let me write that out.

F = d/dt (gamma m v) = gamma m a + m v (d gamma/dt).

But a is dv/dt, and d gamma/dt = gamma² (v dv/dt) / c² = gamma² (v a) / c².

So F = m gamma a + (m v gamma² a) / c².

But F is given as -k x. So:

m gamma a + (m v gamma² a) / c² = -k x.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Another approach: using energy. At maximum displacement A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential, which is (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium position, x=0, velocity is maximum, so kinetic energy is maximum. The total energy is (1/2)kA², which should equal the relativistic kinetic energy at x=0.

So, relativistic kinetic energy K = (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2)k A².

Wait, but in the classical case, K would be (1/2)mv², so maybe in the relativistic case, it's K = (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2)k A².

So, (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2) k A².

We can solve for gamma. Let's write that:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as a term, say, t. So t = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So, 1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + t)^2.

Then,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + t)^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + t)^2.

Which is,

v^2/c^2 = [ (1 + t)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + t)^2.

Expanding the numerator:

(1 + 2t + t²) - 1 = 2t + t².

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2t + t²)/(1 + t)^2.

Factor numerator: t (2 + t) / (1 + t)^2.

But perhaps I can write this as:

v^2/c^2 = [t (2 + t)] / (1 + t)^2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Let me plug t back in.

t is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). So,

Numerator: (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) * [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

Denominator: [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]².

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Let me compute the numerator:

= (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2) / (2 m c^2) ) ]

Wait, no, wait: 2 + t = 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) = [4 m c^2 + k A^2]/(2 m c^2).

So, putting it all together,

v²/c² = [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) * (4 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2.

Wait, denominator is [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2) / (2 m c^2) ) ] squared.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to just compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Wait, perhaps I can approach this differently. Let me write v_max as a function of t.

We have:

v_max^2 = c^2 [1 - 1/(1 + t)^2 ].

Which becomes:

v_max^2 = c^2 [ ( (1 + t)^2 -1 ) / (1 + t)^2 ) ]

= c^2 [ (1 + 2t + t² -1) / (1 + t)^2 ]

= c^2 [ (2t + t²) / (1 + t)^2 ]

= c^2 [ t (2 + t) ] / (1 + t)^2.

But t is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so substitute back:

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2.

This is getting complicated. Let's factor out terms with m and c².

Let me denote (k A^2) as a variable, say B, for simplicity. Then, t = B/(2 m c^2).

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (B/(2 m c²)) * (2 + B/(2 m c²)) ) ] / (1 + B/(2 m c²))².

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator inside: (B/(2 m c²)) * ( (4 m c² + B) / (2 m c²) ) )

= [ B (4 m c² + B) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Denominator: [ (2 m c² + B) / (2 m c²) ) ]^2 = [ (2 m c² + B)^2 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

So, putting it all together,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ ( B (4 m c² + B) ) / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + B)^2 / (4 m² c^4) ) ]

The denominators cancel out, so:

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ B (4 m c² + B) ) ] / (2 m c² + B)^2.

Substituting back B = k A^2:

v_max^2 = c^2 [ k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2)^2.

Hmm, I need to simplify this expression.

Let me factor out 2 m c² from numerator and denominator where possible.

Wait, the denominator is (2 m c² + k A^2)^2.

The numerator is k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2) = k A^2 (2 m c² * 2 + k A^2).

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor 2 m c² out of the denominator:

Denominator: [2 m c² (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²)) ]^2 = (2 m c²)^2 (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2.

Wait, maybe I can express numerator and denominator in terms of (k A²)/(2 m c²) again.

Let me let t = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). Then, the numerator becomes:

k A^2 (4 m c² + k A²) = (2 m c² t) (4 m c² + 2 m c² t) ) ?

Wait, wait, because t = (k A²)/(2 m c²) → k A² = 2 m c² t.

So,

Numerator:

k A^2 (4 m c² + k A²) = (2 m c^2 t)(4 m c² + 2 m c² t) = 2 m c^2 t * 2 m c² (2 + t) ) 

= 4 m² c^4 t (2 + t) 

Denominator:

(2 m c² + k A²)^2 = [2 m c² + 2 m c² t]^2 = (2 m c² (1 + t))^2 = (2 m c²)^2 (1 + t)^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [4 m² c^4 t (2 + t) ] / [ (2 m c²)^2 (1 + t)^2 ) ]

= c^2 * [ (4 m² c^4 t (2 + t)) ) ] / [4 m² c^4 (1 + t)^2 ) ]

The 4 m² c^4 cancels out:

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ t (2 + t) ] / (1 + t)^2.

So,

v_max = c sqrt( [ t (2 + t) ] / (1 + t)^2 )

= c * sqrt( t (2 + t) ) / (1 + t )

Hmm, but t is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), so let's plug that back in.

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] ) / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

Let me factor this expression. Let me denote s = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Then,

v_max = c * sqrt( s (2 + s) ) / (1 + s )

Wait, let's compute the numerator inside the square root:

s (2 + s) = 2 s + s^2.

And denominator: (1 + s)^2 = 1 + 2 s + s^2.

Hmm, but perhaps I can manipulate this further.

Wait, the square root is sqrt( (2 s + s²) ) / (1 + s ).

Wait, let me factor numerator and denominator:

sqrt( s (s + 2) ) / (1 + s )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( s (s + 2) ) / (1 + s )

Hmm, but perhaps that's not leading me anywhere. Let me express everything in terms of s.

Wait, perhaps I can write s (s + 2) as s^2 + 2s.

Denominator is (1 + s )^2 = s^2 + 2s + 1.

So,

sqrt( (s^2 + 2s) ) / (s^2 + 2s + 1 )

= sqrt( s (s + 2) ) / (1 + s )^2.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire fraction inside the square root.

Wait, v_max = c * sqrt( [s (s + 2) ] ) / (1 + s )

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt( s (s + 2) ) / (1 + s )

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out s from the numerator.

Wait, sqrt( s (s + 2) ) = sqrt( s^2 + 2 s ) = sqrt( s (s + 2) )

Hmm, not seeing a clear simplification. Maybe I should compute the expression numerically with a sample value to see which option matches.

Wait, but the options are:

Option A) v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 m))² )

Wait, that seems off because (kA²)/(2m) would be in units of velocity squared, but in the denominator, it's (1 - something) squared.

Wait, but let me see. Let's consider when (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) is small. That is, when relativistic effects are negligible. So, in the non-relativistic limit, t = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) → 0.

So, v_max should approach the classical result, which is sqrt( (k A^2 ) / m ). Because in the classical case, v_max is sqrt( (k A^2 )/ m ), since (1/2)k A² = (1/2) m v_max^2.

Wait, let me check. In classical case, (1/2) k A² = (1/2) m v² → v = sqrt( (k A^2)/m ), which is option C. So, in the non-relativistic limit, v_max should approach this value.

Looking at the options, let's see which ones reduce to option C when (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) is small.

Option A: when (k A²)/(2m) is small, the denominator (1 - (k A²)/(2m)) approaches 1. So,

sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - ... )^2 ) → sqrt(1 + 1/1) = sqrt(2). So, v_max = c sqrt(2). Which is not matching the classical limit, which is sqrt(kA²/m).

Option B: denominator is (1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) ), which approaches 1, so 1/(1 - ... ) →1.

So, sqrt(1 +1/(1 - ... )) → sqrt(2), so v_max = c sqrt(2), which again doesn't match non-rel.

Option C: it's sqrt(k A² / m), which matches the classical case.

Option D: denominator is (1 + ... )^2. When (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) is small, the denominator is approximately 1, so 1/(1 + ... )² →1. So the sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + ... )² ) → sqrt(0) =0, which can't be right.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the denominator is 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), which is a small addition, then (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 is approximately 1 + (k A²)/(m c^2). So,

the denominator inside the sqrt is 1 - 1/(1 + ... )^2 → 1 - 1/(1 + 2s + s²) ≈ 1 - (1 - 2s) ) = 2s. So, v_max = c sqrt( 2 s ), where s is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ). So,

sqrt( 2 s ) = sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2) ) → which as c is in denominator, but in the classical limit, we have v_max = sqrt( k A^2 / m ), so this would require c to be much larger, which doesn't fit. So option D's limit doesn't match the classical case.

So, only option C matches the classical limit. But wait, the problem is relativistic, so the correct answer should be a relativistic expression, not option C.

Hmm, but wait. I think I made a mistake earlier. Because in the equation I derived earlier, when (k A²)/(2 m c^2) is small, the denominator for v_max is:

v_max^2 = c^2 [ (k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 )) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

If (k A^2) << 2 m c^2, then:

numerator ≈ k A^2 * 4 m c² → 4 m c² k A^2.

Denominator ≈ (2 m c² )^2 → 4 m² c^4.

So,

v_max^2 ≈ c^2 (4 m c² k A^2) / (4 m² c^4 ) )

= c^2 (k A^2 )/( m c² )

= (k A^2 ) / m.

So, v_max ≈ sqrt(k A^2/m ), which matches option C. So, in the non-relativistic limit, it's correct.

But the options have other expressions. So, option C is the non-relativistic case, but in the problem, it's a relativistic oscillator. So, the correct answer should not be option C, unless the others don't fit.

Wait, but the question is asking for the maximum speed. So, in the relativistic case, the maximum speed must be less than c. But looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: inside the sqrt is 1 + 1/(1 - ... )^2. If the denominator is (1 - ... )^2, and (k A^2)/(2m) is large, then the denominator could be <1, making the term inside the sqrt larger than 1, but it's multiplied by c. But is this possible?

Wait, for (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) being a certain value, let's see which options make sense.

Wait, in the expression I derived earlier, v_max is equal to c * sqrt( [ t (2 + t) ]/(1 + t)^2 ), where t = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2).

So, v_max = c * sqrt( [ t (2 + t) ] ) / (1 + t ).

Hmm, let's square both sides:

v_max^2 = c² [ t (2 + t) ] / (1 + t )^2.

Now, considering that t can be any positive value, including t approaching zero (non-relativistic) or t approaching large values.

Wait, but t = (k A² )/( 2 m c² ). So, for very large t, (k A^2) >> (2 m c^2 ), then t is very big.

In that case, t>>1, so:

v_max^2 ≈ c² [ t (t) ] / t² → c² (t^2 ) / t^2 → c², so v_max → c.

Which makes sense, because as t becomes very large, the maximum speed approaches c, the speed limit.

Looking at the options, which ones approach c in this limit?

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m))² )

If t is (k A^2 )/(2 m c² ), and if (k A²)/(2m) is large, then denominator (1 - (k A²)/(2m )) becomes negative, and the expression inside the sqrt would be 1 + [1/(negative number)^2], which is 1 + positive, so sqrt would be sqrt( something >1 ), and multiplied by c. But since t is (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ), when (k A^2)/(2m) is large, but c² is also present, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the approach in this problem is to use energy conservation, where the total energy is (1/2)k A^2, and the kinetic energy at maximum speed is (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, but that's what I thought earlier. So:

(1/2) k A^2 = (gamma -1 ) m c^2.

Then,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Which is:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Let me solve for v.

Let me denote (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) as t again.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + t

Square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + t )².

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + t )².

Thus,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + t )².

= [ (1 + t )² -1 ] / (1 + t )².

Expand numerator:

1 + 2t + t² -1 = 2t + t².

So,

v²/c² = (2 t + t² ) / (1 + t )².

= t (2 + t ) / (1 + t )².

So,

v = c * sqrt( t (2 + t ) ) / (1 + t )

Which is the same as earlier.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c² )) )

Hmm, let's compute the term inside:

1 + 1/(1 - t ), where t is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

= [ (1 - t ) +1 ] / (1 - t )

= (2 - t ) / (1 - t )

So,

v_max = c sqrt( (2 - t)/(1 - t) )

But our expression is v = c * sqrt( t (2 + t ) ) / (1 + t )

Hmm, not matching.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, 1/(1 + t )^2 is present. So,

1 - 1/(1 + t )² = [ (1 +t )² -1 ] / (1 +t )² = (2t + t² ) / (1 + t )².

Which is exactly the same as our expression for v²/c².

Wait, because:

v² = c² * [ (2t + t² ) / (1 + t )² ]

so,

v = c sqrt( [2t + t² ] / (1 + t )² )

= c * sqrt( (2 t + t² ) ) / (1 + t )

But 2t + t² = t (t + 2 ), which is the same as what I have.

Wait, but option D is sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + t )^2 ). Let me compute that:

sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + t )^2 ] ) = sqrt( [ (1 + t )^2 -1 ] / (1 + t )^2 )

= sqrt( (1 + 2t + t² -1 ) / (1 + t )^2 )

= sqrt( (2t + t² ) / (1 + t )^2 )

Which is exactly the same as v/c = sqrt( (2t + t² ) )/(1 + t )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 t + t² ) )/(1 + t )

Which is the same as option D?

Wait, option D is:

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is exactly what I've just found.

Wait, so option D is correct?

Wait, because our derivation shows that v/c = sqrt( (2t + t²)/(1 + t )^2 ), which is sqrt( [ t (t + 2) ]/(1 + t )^2 ), and option D is:

c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + t )^2 )

Which is:

c * sqrt( ( (1 + t )^2 -1 ) / (1 + t )^2 )

= c * sqrt( (2t + t² ) / (1 + t )^2 )

Which matches our expression.

So, the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought the non-relativistic limit for option D gives v_max = 0, but that was a mistake.

Wait, when t is small (non-rel limit), (1 + t ) is approximately 1, so 1/(1 + t )^2 ~ 1 - 2t.

So,

1 - 1/(1 + t )^2 ≈ 1 - (1 - 2t ) = 2 t.

So,

sqrt( 2 t ) = sqrt( (k A^2 )/(m c^2) )

Which is sqrt( (k A^2 )/(m c^2) ) → which is (A sqrt(k/m )) / c.

But in the non-relativistic case, the speed should be sqrt( k A^2 / m ), which is larger than this by a factor of c.

Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me re-express the non-rel limit.

t = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So when t is small, t <<1,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2t + t² )/(1 + t )^2 )

≈ c * sqrt( (2t) / (1)^2 )

= c * sqrt(2 t )

= c * sqrt( 2 (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( (k A^2 )/(m c^2 ) )

= sqrt( (k A^2 )/(m ) ) * (c ) / c )

= sqrt( (k A^2 )/m )

Which matches the classical result.

Ah, I see. So in the non-rel limit, option D gives the correct result. So option D is indeed correct.

Looking back, option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is correct. So the correct answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using energy conservation. The total energy of the oscillator is the potential energy at maximum displacement, \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium position, all this energy is converted into relativistic kinetic energy, which is given by:

\[
K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the total energy to the kinetic energy at equilibrium:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Now, we analyze the options:

- **Option A**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}} \). This does not match the derived expression and fails in the non-relativistic limit.

- **Option B**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}} \). This also does not match the derived expression and fails in the non-relativistic limit.

- **Option C**: \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \). This is the classical result and does not account for relativistic effects, so it is incorrect for the relativistic case.

- **Option D**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}} \). This matches the derived expression exactly and reduces to the classical result \( \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \) in the non-relativistic limit when \( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \) is small.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
