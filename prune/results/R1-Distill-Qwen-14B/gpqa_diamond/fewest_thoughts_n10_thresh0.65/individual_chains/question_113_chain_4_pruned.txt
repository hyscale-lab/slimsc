Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it again.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My job is to determine its chemical formula from the given options.

Let me start by breaking down each piece of information provided.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR typically correspond to O-H stretches. A broad peak often indicates hydrogen bonding, which is common in compounds like alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, another possibility is an alcohol (like an -OH group) or maybe a ketone? No, wait, ketones don't have O-H. So, more likely, an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. The broadness suggests it's a strong hydrogen bond, perhaps a carboxylic acid. But wait, another possibility is a conjugated system, like an enol, but I'm not sure.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Oo, those are important. The peak at 1700 is a strong peak, which is usually a carbonyl group. That's either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. But wait, the peak at 1650 might be another carbonyl or something else. Let me think. 1650 is around where conjugated carbonyl groups (like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl) absorb, or perhaps an amide. But the options don't have nitrogen, so maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. So, maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups or one with a conjugated system.

Wait, the two peaks are 1700 and 1650. So that could suggest maybe a conjugated system. For example, in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, the carbonyl might show around 1680-1700, and the conjugated double bond (C=C) might be around 1650. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a C=C stretch, like in a vinyl group, perhaps.

Wait, but in the IR, the peaks around 1700 are usually for carbony
