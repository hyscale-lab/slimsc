Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that the operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P is a vector operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So P is a vector made up of components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these components is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down the components first to get a clear picture.

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, right, these are the standard Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P is a vector operator, meaning it's like P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z, where n is a unit vector. But the problem states that n lies in the x-z plane. So that means the y-component of n is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

But wait, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. Oh, but the problem is asking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Hmm, because P is a vector operator, its magnitude squared is P_x² + P_y² + P_z². But I think that for a spin-½ system, the eigenvalues of P² would be (ħ/2)^2 * 3, because each Pauli matrix squared is identity. So P² = (ħ/2)^2 (σ_x² + σ_y² + σ_z²) = (ħ/2)^2 * 3 * I. So the magnitude of P is sqrt(3) * (ħ/2). But the eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2, so that can't be the magnitude. Wait, wait, no,
