Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

First, let me understand what's given. We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the total volume becomes 40 mL. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. 

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So I should calculate the new concentration after dilution.

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (M1 * V1) / V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 mL, V2 is 40 mL. So M2 would be (0.05 * 20)/40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid. So when we add NaOH, which is a strong base, it'll react with the acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to find out how much NaOH is added at 25% and then find the resulting pH.

But first, let's think about the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized. At that point, the solution will be the sodium acetate solution. Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, the solution will be basic. The pH at equivalence can be found by calculating the Kb of acetate.

Wait, but let's get back to the initial steps. So the initial concentration of the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. The volume is 40 mL. So the moles of acetic acid before dilution were 0.05 M * 0.02 L (20 mL is 0.02 L) = 0.001 moles. After dilution, same moles, but the concentration is 0.025 M (as I calculated).

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume needed to reach equivalence can be calculated. The moles of NaOH needed would be equal to the moles of acetic acid. Moles of acetic acid is 0.001, so moles of NaOH would also be 0.001. The concentration is 0.1 M, so volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01
