Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, right? Wait, no, wait, wait. No, the Michael addition is actually when a nucleophile attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, leading to a conjugate addition. Oh right, that's the key here.

The problem has three separate reactions, labeled A, B, and C. And I need to find out the products for each, then match them with the options given.

Let's take them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So NaOEt is a strong base, which probably deprotonates something to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH-. So, it's a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of that would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, and the p-tolyl group is attached
