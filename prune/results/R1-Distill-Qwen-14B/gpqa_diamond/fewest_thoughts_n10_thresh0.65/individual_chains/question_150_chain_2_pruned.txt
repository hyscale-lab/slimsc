Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. The NMR data is provided, which should help in figuring out the structure. Then, it's reacted through a series of reagents, and we need to find the final product from the options given.

First, let's break down the NMR data they've given. The 1H NMR shows peaks at:

- 9.72 ppm, a triplet integrating for 1H.
- 6.98 ppm, a doublet for 2H.
- 6.51 ppm, another doublet for 2H.
- 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet for 2H.
- 3.66 ppm, a doublet for 2H.

I remember that aromatic protons typically show up between 6.5-8.5 ppm. The triplet at 9.72 is quite upfield for an aromatic proton; maybe it's something else. Oh wait, aldehydic protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons. Aldehydes are typically deshielded, so maybe that's an aldehyde group.

Looking at the aromatic region: two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests perhaps a para-substituted aromatic ring because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and usually show as a doublet. Wait, but waitâ€”each doublet is 2H, so maybe two different aromatic rings?

Wait, the 6.98 ppm is a doublet (2H), and 6.51 is another doublet (2H). Maybe each is from a different ring. If it's a para-substituted benzene with substituents that cause the ring current, perhaps each ring has substituents that deshield the protons differently.

The broad singlet at 6.27 ppm for 2H could be from an enol proton. Or maybe from an aromatic ring with substituents that cause the protons to be equivalent but broad, like in a conjugated system or with some hydrogen bonding.

The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H: this might be a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe it's part of an ether, or an alkoxy group. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, like in a ketone or aldehyde. Wait, but the triplet at 9.72 is an aldehyde, so perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to the aldehyde.

Putting it all together, the structure might involve an aldehyde group (from the triplet), two para-substituted aromatic rings (from the two doublets), and a CH2 group connected to something else.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is C8H9NO.

Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens, which I don't think are present here
