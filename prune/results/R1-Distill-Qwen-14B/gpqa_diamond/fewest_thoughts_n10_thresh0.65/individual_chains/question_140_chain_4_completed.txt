Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. That's just above freezing, so maybe B is something like ice? Or perhaps another solid that has a melting point around there.

Another clue is that the product of a keto acid reacting with X has two atoms of oxygen. Also, X and its analog are reagents in organic chemistry. Oh, wait, I remember that NaOH is a common reagent used in organic reactions, like for saponification of esters or hydrolysis of amides. Maybe X is NaOH?

Wait, but NaOH is sodium hydroxide. Let me think about the reaction between NaOH and something else. Liquid Y—could that be water? No, because NaOH is usually a solid. Or maybe another liquid like ethanol? Oh, wait, but when NaOH reacts with ethanol, it might form something else. Alternatively, if Y is something like an acid, but then the reaction would be more about neutralization.

Wait, the reaction releases a gas W. Let's think about the gas. If W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, that means for the molecule, the number of H and N are equal. Wait, protons and neutrons in the molecule? No, wait. The molecule as a whole has the same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, wait, no. The question says, "gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." Wait, wait, maybe each molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons in each atom? Or the total number for the molecule? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is of a substance where each molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Wait, maybe the molecule's formula is H2O? Because each molecule has 2 H (each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons) and an O with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So for H2O, the total protons are 2 + 8 = 10, and the total neutrons are 8. That's not equal. Hmm, that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe the gas is CO2? But CO2 has 2 O atoms (each with 8 protons and 8 neutrons) and a C with 6 protons and 6 neutrons. So in CO2: 6 + (2×8)=22 protons, 6 + (2×8)=22 neutrons. Oh, that's equal! So W would be CO2. Hmm, but wait, when would CO2 be released as a gas in a reaction? Maybe in a decomposition reaction.

Wait, but getting back to the reaction between X and Y. If X is NaOH, and Y is maybe something else. Wait, if Y is an acid, like H2SO4, but then the reaction would produce water and a salt. Alternatively, if Y is an alcohol, then the reaction with NaOH would require heating to produce an ether and water, but that's more about elimination.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between X (NaOH) and an acid. Let's say Y is an acid like H2SO4. But that would release SO2 or something else? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate. If X reacts with a carbonate, like NaOH reacting with a carbonate, it would produce CO2 gas. Oh, wait, that makes sense.

So if X is NaOH and Y is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, but wait, Y is a liquid. Hmm, maybe Y is a solution of a carbonate. So when NaOH reacts with, say, Na2CO3, it would form NaOH + Na2CO3 → NaCO3? No, wait, more accurately, the reaction would produce CO2 and water. So the reaction would be:

NaOH + Na2CO3 → Na2CO3 (no, that doesn't seem right) Wait, maybe a different approach. Let me think about the precipitate G.

When X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. If X is NaOH and Y is a salt solution that reacts with hydroxide, like a metal nitrate, then the precipitate would be a hydroxide. For example, if Y is CuSO4, then NaOH would react to form Cu(OH)2 precipitate. Then, when heated, the precipitate would decompose. For Cu(OH)2, heating would give CuO and water. But the product B would be CuO, which has a melting point of around 2222 K, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the precipitate is magnesium hydroxide. Mg(OH)2 has a melting point around 1100 K, which is also too high. Hmm. So I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe when the precipitate G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C, which is just above freezing. So B could be something like water ice, but that doesn't quite fit because water's melting point is at 273 K. 277 K is a bit higher, so maybe another solid that melts around that temperature.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the precipitate is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into something else. For example, if G is calcium carbonate, heating it would produce calcium oxide and CO2. But then B would be CaO, but its melting point is around 2880 K, which is way too high.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate is something else. Let's think about when a metal hydroxide is heated and releases a gas, perhaps water. But then, if X is NaOH and Y is an acid, but that would produce a salt, not a precipitate. Unless Y is an excess of an acid, but then the precipitate might not form.

Wait, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let's think about the product when a keto acid reacts with substance X. The product has 2 atoms of oxygen. A keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like a beta-keto acid. For example, when a beta-keto acid reacts with a base like NaOH, it would undergo hydrolysis. Let me think: the reaction would produce a carboxylic acid and a ketone.

Wait, but the product's formula would have 2 oxygen atoms. Let's consider a specific example. Let's say the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (CH3C(O)CH2COOH). If it reacts with NaOH, it would hydrolyze to form two carboxylic acids and a ketone. Wait, no, perhaps it's the saponification reaction. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces a salt with two oxygen atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diester or something similar, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is something else, like KOH or another base.

Wait, another angle: The product of the reaction of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Let's say the product is something like a sodium salt. For example, if the keto acid is something like HOOCCOCH2CH3 (but that's not a keto acid). Wait, no, keto acids have a keto group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group. So perhaps the product when reacted with a base would form a sodium carboxylate and a ketone. Wait, but how would that lead to a product with two oxygen atoms?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester. Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Maybe the product is a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this part.

Wait, going back to the initial reaction. X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, which upon heating releases B. B's melting point is about 277 K. Let me think about possible compounds that melt around 277 K.

Wait, 277 K is 4°C, which is near the melting point of water (273.15 K). So maybe B is water, but that doesn't make sense in the context of the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like ammonium chloride, but its melting point is around 334 K. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the precipitate G is something like ammonium hydroxide. No, that's not correct because ammonium hydroxide isn't a precipitate—it's a solution. Alternatively, perhaps G is an oxide that upon heating releases water. Wait, but then B would be water, which doesn't fit since melting point is 273 K, but the question says 277 K. Close enough, maybe.

Wait, another approach: If gas W is CO2, as I thought earlier, then the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. So maybe Y is a carbonate. For example, if X is NaOH and Y is a sodium carbonate solution, then the reaction would be:

2 NaOH + Na2CO3 → 2 Na2CO3 + H2O? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the isotopes part. The question says that substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an element with a heavier isotope. Sodium has isotopes like 23Na and 25Na. Wait, but 25Na is rare. Alternatively, maybe the element is chlorine. Cl has isotopes like 35Cl and 37Cl. Or oxygen has various isotopes.

Wait, considering that the answer options are numbers like 35, 25, 31, 29. These might be the sum of atomic masses of elements in X. So perhaps X is a diatomic molecule or a compound containing two elements.

Wait, if X is NaOH, then the elements are Na, O, H. The heavier isotope could be in Na. The lightest elements would be H and O, but wait, O is heavy. Alternatively, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule like Cl2, where Cl has a heavier isotope. If X were Cl2, then the heavier isotope would be 37Cl. But then Y would have to react with Cl2. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NH3, but I don't see the heavier isotope part fitting.

Wait, another thought: X is a metal with a heavier isotope. For example, lead has many isotopes, but perhaps that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe X is a compound like CH3CH2OH (ethanol), but I don't see the heavier isotope connection.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal hydride. For instance, sodium hydride (NaH), but then Y would be water, which would react violently. But in that case, the reaction would produce H2 gas. Let me see the details.

If X is NaH, and Y is water, then the reaction would be:

NaH + H2O → NaOH + H2↑

So the gas W would be H2. Each H2 molecule has 2 H atoms, each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So each molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. But wait, the problem states that W's molecule has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. So H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps W is something else. Let's think of another gas. What about NH3? Each molecule has 1 N (14 protons, 14 neutrons) and 3 H (each 1 proton, 0 neutrons). So total protons:14 +3=17, neutrons:14. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, earlier I thought CO2 might be W. Let me check that again. CO2 has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and 2 O (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 2×8=22, neutrons:6 + 2×8=22. So yes, 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that fits the condition. So W is CO2.

So the reaction between X and Y produces CO2, a precipitate G, which upon heating gives B, which has a melting point near 277 K.

If W is CO2, then perhaps X is a carbonate. Wait, but X is a substance that reacts with Y (liquid) to produce CO2. So if X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, then the reaction would be:

X (carbonate) + Y (acid) → salt + CO2 + H2O.

But then the precipitate G would be the salt. Alternatively, if Y is a base, but that might not make sense.

Wait, but X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. So perhaps X is something like NaOH. Let's think again.

Wait, another approach: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. If B is water (melting point ~273 K), but the question says 277 K, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps B is another compound. But the melting point is close to 277 K, which is about 4°C. So maybe B is something like a hydrate that loses water upon heating, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate G is a bicarbonate, which upon heating decomposes to a carbonate and water. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) when heated gives Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So B could be water or CO2. But the melting point of water is 273 K, which is close to 277 K, but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps B is another compound.

Wait, the reaction when X and Y produce CO2. So if X is Na2CO3 and Y is HCl, then:

Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O.

In this case, the precipitate would be NaCl, which is soluble. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a nitrate, and X is something that reacts with it to produce a carbonate. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaOH and Y is a solution of a sulfide. Then the reaction could produce H2S gas, but that's not CO2.

Alternatively, if X is a carbonate and Y is a strong acid, then CO2 is released, but the precipitate would be the salt, which is soluble.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate is a hydroxide. For example, if Y is a solution of a metal carbonate, and X is a strong base, perhaps the reaction is:

MgCO3 + 2 NaOH → Mg(OH)2↓ + Na2CO3.

In this case, Mg(OH)2 is the precipitate G. When heated, Mg(OH)2 would decompose into MgO and H2O. So B would be H2O, which melts at 273 K. But the question says 277 K, so that's a bit off, but maybe close enough.

If that's the case, then X would be NaOH. So the elements in X are Na, O, H.

Wait, but the question says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within X, considering all isotopes. But wait, perhaps the isotopes are only for the constituent elements. So for X, which is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, and H.

But wait, the question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So for NaOH, Na has isotopes (like 23Na, 25Na, etc.), O has 16O, 17O, 18O, and H has H and D.

But the problem says "if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed." So for each element in X, we sum all lighter and heavier isotopes.

Wait, but that's a bit unclear. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: "Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Hmm, perhaps for each element in X, we have to find the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes, and then sum those for all elements in X.

Wait, but the elements present in X are Na, O, and H.

For each element:

- Na: lightest isotope is 23Na (mass 23), heaviest isotope is 25Na (mass 25). Their sum is 23 +25=48.

- O: lightest isotope is 16O (16), heaviest isotope is 18O (18). Sum is 16+18=34.

- H: lightest isotope is 1H (1), heaviest isotope is deuterium (2). Sum is 1+2=3.

Then, cumulative atomic masses for all elements in X: 48 (Na) +34 (O) +3 (H) = 85.

Wait, that's not one of the options. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps it's the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes for each element, but only for each element once. So for each element, sum their lightest and heaviest isotopes, then add all together.

But I'm getting 48 (Na) +34 (O) +3 (H) =85, which isn't an option. So perhaps I've made a mistake in identifying X.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: If X is NH3. But I don't think NH3 is used as a reagent in organic chemistry in the same way as NaOH.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about the product of a keto acid and X. The product has two oxygen atoms. Let's say the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH). When it reacts with a base like NaOH, it undergoes hydrolysis. The product would be sodium salts of the carboxylic acids and a ketone. Wait, but the product would have more oxygen atoms, but the question says it has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, perhaps the product is a molecule with exactly two oxygen atoms.

Wait, maybe the product is a diethyl ether or something, but I'm not sure how that would come from a keto acid and X.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or a similar structure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester with two oxygen atoms. Wait, esters have the structure R-O-CO-R', so each ester has two oxygen atoms in the functional group. But I'm not sure if that's what the question is referring to.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a molecule like CH3CH2O- (if it's an ether), but that only has one oxygen.

Wait, maybe it's a carbonyl-containing compound. For example, acetone has three carbons and one oxygen. So two oxygen atoms would be something like a carbonate, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone, which has one oxygen. So that's not matching either. Hmm, this part is confusing me.

Let me try another approach. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29. These are all relatively small numbers. So perhaps the elements in X are something with lower atomic numbers.

Wait, perhaps X is Cl2. Because Cl has isotopes 35Cl and 37Cl. So the sum would be 35 +37=72. But that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe X has two elements, and we sum their lightest and heaviest isotopes.

Wait, another possibility: X is a diatomic molecule with two different elements. For example, NO. But NO is not commonly used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Alternatively, perhaps X is something like NH3, but I don't see the heavier isotope fitting.

Wait, think about the product when a keto acid reacts with X. The product has two oxygen atoms. Let's say the product is an ester. Esters have the form R-O-CO-R'. So perhaps the product is an ester with two oxygen atoms in the functional group.

But how would that come from a keto acid and X? Maybe if X is a base, the keto acid would undergo esterification, but that usually requires an acid catalyst. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or another structure. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the isotopes and the elements in X. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes.

So, for each element in X, sum the lightest and heaviest isotopes. Then add all of them together.

If X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H.

Na: lightest 23, heaviest 25. Sum 48.

O: lightest 16, heaviest 18. Sum 34.

H: lightest 1, heaviest 2. Sum 3.

Total: 48 +34 +3 =85. Not an option.

So perhaps X is something else. Let me think of another compound used in organic chemistry as a reagent. Maybe X is KOH? Or maybe something like H2SO4?

Wait, another possibility: X is a halogen, like Cl2. So Cl has isotopes 35Cl and 37Cl. Sum is 35+37=72. But again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule with two identical elements, each having a heavier isotope. For example, if X is H2, but that's just H and no heavier isotope. Alternatively, if X is something like O2, but O has 16O, 17O, 18O. So sum would be (16 +18) for O, and since it's O2, two oxygens, but each O has their own isotopes. Hmm, but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal with a heavier isotope, like Mg (24Mg, 25Mg, 26Mg). The sum would be 24 +26=50. Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule with one element, and that element's isotopes sum to one of the options. Let's see:

Looking at the options: 25, 29, 31, 35.

If X is Cl2, the sum of lightest and heaviest Cl isotopes is 35+37=72. Not an option.

If X is O2, sum for O is 16+18=34. Not an option. But the options don't have 34. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with two different elements, each contributing to the sum. Let's think of a compound with two elements, each having their own isotopes.

For example, H2O. Hydrogen has 1 and 2, sum 3. Oxygen has 16 and 18, sum 34. Total sum 3+34=37, which isn't an option.

Wait, another molecule: CH4. C has 12 and 14, sum 26. H has 1 and 2, sum 3. Total 26+3=29. Oh! 29 is one of the options (option D). Hmm, that's interesting.

So if X were CH4, then the sum would be 26 (C) +3 (H) =29. Which is option D.

But wait, CH4 is methane. Is CH4 used as a reagent in organic chemistry? I don't think so. It's more of a fuel. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another compound: CO. C has 12 and 14, sum 26. O has 16+18=34. Total 26+34=60, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is CO2. Then C is 12+14=26. O is 16+18=34. Total sum 26 + 34×2 =26+68=94. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule like NH3. N has 14 and 15, sum 29. H has 1 and 2, sum 3. Total 29+3=32, which is close to option C (31) but not exactly.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule of an element with two isotopes. For example, chlorine gas (Cl2). Each Cl has 35 and 37. So sum per Cl is 35+37=72. Since it's Cl2, two atoms, but each contributes 72? No, that seems incorrect because each atom has its own isotopes. Wait, no. The question says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So for each element in X, sum the lightest and heaviest isotopes, then add them all.

So for X being Cl2, it's only Cl as the element. So for Cl, lightest 35, heaviest 37. Sum 72. But the options don't have 72. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound with two elements, each contributing. Let's say X is NaCl. Then Na has 23+25=48. Cl has 35+37=72. Total 48+72=120. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a molecule like CH3Cl. Then C:12+14=26. H:1+2=3. Cl:35+37=72. Sum 26+3+72=101. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a smaller molecule. Let me think of the product when a keto acid reacts with X to have two oxygen atoms. Maybe the product is a molecule like CH3COOH (acetic acid), but that has more than two oxygen atoms.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ester with two oxygen atoms, like ethyl acetate (CH3COOCH2CH3). But that's more than two oxygen atoms in the molecule. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a molecule like formaldehyde (HCHO), which has one oxygen. Not matching.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. Let's say the product is acetone (CH3COCH3), which has one oxygen. No, that's not two.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonate, but that's probably not relevant.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the initial reaction. If the substance X reacts with Y to produce CO2, then X could be a carbonate or a bicarbonate. But if X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, and Y is an acid, then the reaction produces CO2. So X is Na2CO3.

But then X's elements are Na and C and O. Let's see the sum.

Na: 23+25=48. C:12+14=26. O:16+18=34. So sum is 48+26+34=108. Not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Elements: Na, C, H, O.

Na:48. C:26. H:3. O:34. Sum:48+26+3+34=111. Not an option.

This is getting frustrating. Let me think of the product of a keto acid and X having two oxygen atoms. Maybe the product is an ester with two oxygen atoms, like methyl acetate (CH3COOCH3). Wait, that ester has two oxygen atoms in the ester group. So the formula is C2H4O2. So the product has two oxygen atoms.

If the product is formed by the reaction of a keto acid with X, perhaps X is an alcohol. For example, if the keto acid is ethyl acetoacetate (but that's an ester, not a keto acid). Wait, no, a keto acid has both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a keto acid and X (like an alcohol) in an esterification reaction. The product would be an ester and water. For example, a beta-keto acid like acetoacetic acid (CH3C(O)CH2COOH) reacting with ethanol (X) would produce ethyl acetoacetate (CH3C(O)CH2COOCH2CH3) and water. But the product here has more than two oxygen atoms.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal, which has two oxygen atoms. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. No, that's only one oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a compound with a geminal diol group, but that's speculative.

I'm stuck on this part. Let me try to think of other possibilities for X.

Another angle: The product of a keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. Let's say the product is a molecule like ethylene glycol, but that doesn't fit with a keto acid and X.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone, but that's two carbonyl groups. Each has one oxygen, so two in total. So the product has two oxygen atoms. How would that form?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reducing agent. For example, if X is NaBH4, which is used in organic chemistry. Then, when a keto acid reacts with NaBH4, it might reduce the carbonyl group to an alcohol. But the product would have an -OH group, which has one oxygen.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like H2O. But that doesn't fit with the initial reaction producing CO2 and a precipitate.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, producing CO2. Then the precipitate G would be salt, but if it's a carbonate reacting, perhaps the precipitate is a metal hydroxide if an excess of base is used.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the options again. The options are 35,25,31,29.

I previously thought that X might be CH4, which gives a sum of 29. But I'm not sure if CH4 is a reagent in organic chemistry.

Wait, another thought: If X is HCl, which is commonly used in organic reactions. HCl has H and Cl. H's isotopes sum to 1+2=3. Cl's isotopes sum to 35+37=72. So total sum is 3+72=75. Not an option.

Alternatively, if X is NH3, N has isotopes 14 and 15, sum 29. H has 1 and 2, sum 3. So 29+3=32. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a diatomic molecule of an element where the sum of lightest and heaviest isotope is one of the options. For example, if X is O2, each O is 16 and 18. Sum per O is 34. But two O atoms, so 34×2=68. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a molecule with two different elements, each contributing their lightest and heaviest isotopes. For example, X is HCl. H's sum is 3, Cl's sum is 72. So total 75, not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule like CO. C's sum is 26, O's sum is 34. 26+34=60, not an option.

Wait, the only option that's close to what I thought earlier (for CH4) is option D (29). So maybe X is CH4. But does CH4 fit the other clues?

Wait, CH4 is a gas, not a liquid. The reaction with Y produces CO2. Hmm, maybe Y is a strong oxidizing agent.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let me think of another approach.

The reaction between X and Y produces a precipitate G. If G is something like a metal hydroxide, and when heated releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K.

Wait, another possibility: If B is ammonium chloride, which has a melting point around 334 K, but that's not close. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like sodium carbonate, which decomposes upon heating. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is water. Then the precipitate G would be something that, when heated, releases water. For example, a hydrated salt. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: If B's melting point is near 277 K, which is 4°C, perhaps B is a compound that's a liquid at that temperature. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like ethyl acetate, but I'm not sure.

This is really challenging. I think I need to make an educated guess based on the information I have.

Given that X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, it's probably something like NaOH, KOH, H2SO4, or another common reagent. Based on the isotopes and the sum of lightest and heaviest elements, the only option that seems to fit is 29, which would be from NH3 (N isotopes sum to 29, H sum to 3, but that's 32, which isn't an option). Alternatively, maybe X is something else where the sum of isotopes is 29.

Wait, if X is a molecule with elements whose sum is 29 when their lightest and heaviest isotopes are added. Let me think of elements with atomic numbers that add up to 29.

Wait, perhaps X is Cl2. Cl has 35 and 37. Sum is 72. No.

Wait, another possibility: X is a molecule with elements like C and O. C's sum is 26, O's sum is 34. 26+34=60. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule like CCl2F2 (dichlorodifluoromethane), but that's probably not relevant.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule of an element where the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes equals one of the options. Let's see:

- For F: isotopes 19 and 21. Sum 40. No option.

- For O: 16 and 18. Sum 34. No.

- For N: 14 and 15. Sum 29. Oh! So if X is a diatomic molecule of N2, then each N has 14 and 15. Sum per N is 29. Since there are two N atoms in N2, but the question says to sum for each element. So for N, sum is 29. So X would be N2.

But does N2 fit the other conditions? Does it react with a liquid to produce CO2, a precipitate, and release B with melting point 277 K? Not sure. Also, N2 is a gas, not a liquid. Hmm.

But if X is N2, then the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes for N is 14+15=29, which is option D. The question asks for the cumulative sum, which in this case would be 29, which is an option.

But I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound.

Wait, another thought: If X is a molecule where each element's isotopes sum up to one of the options. For example, if X is CH3CH2OH (ethanol), the elements are C, H, O.

C: 12+14=26.

H:1+2=3.

O:16+18=34.

Total sum:26+3+34=63. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule with only two elements. For example, CO. C:26, O:34. Sum 60. No.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains only two elements, and the sum of their isotopes is 29.

Wait, if X is NH3, then N:14+15=29, H:1+2=3. Sum 29+3=32. Not an option.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the question again. The correct answer is one of the options, and from earlier, X is likely NaOH. The sum for NaOH would be 48 (Na) +34 (O)+3 (H)=85. Not an option. So perhaps X is something else.

Wait, perhaps X is H2O. Then H:3, O:34. Sum:37, not an option.

Alternatively, X is a carbonate like Na2CO3. Sum would be 48 (Na) +26 (C) +34 (O)= 48+26+34=108. Not an option.

Another thought: The question says "the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen." So perhaps the product is a molecule with exactly two oxygen atoms. Let's say the product is a diketone, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester with two oxygen atoms, like methyl acetate (CH3COOCH3). The formula is C3H6O2, which has two oxygen atoms. So the product would have two O atoms.

So, the reaction of a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid, which has two ketone groups?) No, acetoacetic acid has one ketone and one carboxylic acid group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is esterification. Acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH) reacts with ethanol (X) to form ethyl acetoacetate (CH3COCH2COOCH2CH3) and water. The ester has two oxygen atoms in the ester group. So the product indeed has two O atoms.

So X would be ethanol (C2H5OH). Then the elements in X are C, H, O.

C: 12+14=26.

H:1+2=3.

O:16+18=34.

Total sum: 26+3+34=63. Not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another possibility: X is a diatomic molecule where one element has a lightest and heaviest isotope summing to one of the options. Let's see:

If X is O2: O sum is 34. Not an option.

If X is F2: 19+21=40. Not an option.

If X is Cl2: 35+37=72. No.

If X is N2: 14+15=29. So sum is 29, which is option D.

So if X is N2, then the sum is 29, which is an option. But I'm not sure if N2 fits the other conditions of the question.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements whose sum is 29. For example, if X is a molecule with sodium (Na:23) and oxygen (O:6?), but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, it's possible that I'm missing a key point in the problem. Let me go back to the first paragraph.

Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, for example, X might be a molecule where one of the atoms is a heavier isotope. But the problem says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X", meaning for each element in X, sum the lightest and heaviest isotopes, then add all those sums together.

So for X = NaOH:

Na: 23 (lightest) +25 (heaviest) =48.

O:16 +18=34.

H:1 +2=3.

Total sum: 48+34+3=85. Not an option.

Hmm. Another approach: Maybe X is a molecule with only two elements, and their isotopes sum to one of the options. For example, if X is CO (carbon monoxide), the sum would be 26 (C) +34 (O) =60. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule like H2. H's sum is 3. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a molecule like O3 (ozone). O's sum is 34. Not an option.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, the only one that makes sense in the context of isotopes is option D) 29. That's the sum of N's isotopes (14 +15=29). So perhaps X is NH3, which is used in organic chemistry as a reagent. Then, the sum would be 29 (N) +3 (H) =32. But 32 isn't an option. So perhaps X is N2, giving a sum of 29.

But I'm not confident. Maybe the correct answer is D) 29.


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts with Liquid Y to produce Gas W, Precipitate G, and ultimately releases B upon heating. Key details include:

1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. CO₂ fits this description, as it has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in total.

2. **Precipitate G**: When heated, G releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (~4°C). This suggests B could be water (H₂O), as its melting point is close to 273 K.

3. **Reaction with a Keto Acid**: The product of this reaction contains 2 oxygen atoms. This implies a molecule like an ester (e.g., CH₃COOCH₃) or a similar compound with exactly two oxygen atoms.

4. **Isotopes in X**: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (35)**: This could correspond to an element like chlorine (Cl), where the lightest isotope is ³⁵Cl and the heaviest is ³⁷Cl. However, chlorine alone does not fit the context of X being a reagent in organic chemistry.
  
- **Option B (25)**: This could correspond to sodium (Na), where the lightest isotope is ²³Na and the heaviest is ²⁵Na. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a common reagent in organic chemistry, but the cumulative sum for NaOH (Na: 23 + 25 = 48, O: 16 + 18 = 34, H: 1 + 2 = 3) totals 85, which is not an option.

- **Option C (31)**: This does not align with any clear elemental or isotopic sum discussed in the problem.

- **Option D (29)**: This corresponds to nitrogen (N), where the lightest isotope is ¹⁴N and the heaviest is ¹⁵N. If X is nitrogen gas (N₂), the sum of isotopes for nitrogen is 14 + 15 = 29. This fits the context of X being a reagent in organic chemistry, though less directly than NaOH.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the isotopic sums, the most plausible answer is **Option D (29)**, corresponding to nitrogen's isotopic sum. While NaOH is a strong candidate for X, its isotopic sum does not match the options provided, making nitrogen the best fit based on the given data.

Answer: D
