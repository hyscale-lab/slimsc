Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. So, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull, which makes the star wobble. The bigger the Doppler shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, I think.

So, there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune in mass. Both planets are in circular orbits, so that might simplify things.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1?

Hmm, I remember that the RV method relates the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift (K) to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I think is K = (v * sin i) where v is the velocity. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relation. Oh right, the semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2)) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ). Wait, no, I think the formula is K = ( (27 * pi * G ) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / P )

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the Doppler shift formula. The RV semi-amplitude K is related to the star's velocity. The star's velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

Wait, another approach. The RV method's formula for semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( (P * (1 - e²)) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2 pi c) )

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, a simplified version because the problem states that the stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0. So, e doesn't matter.

So, the formula for K (the semi-amplitude) is:

K = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

K = ( (27 * pi * G ) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )

But since e=0, and M_p is much smaller than M_star (since M_p is Neptune mass, which is about 17 Earth masses, and M_star is Sun-like, about 333,000 Earth masses), so M_p << M_star. So (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star.

So the formula simplifies to something like:

K ≈ ( (27 * pi * G ) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P ) )

Wait, but perhaps another approach: the RV method's K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Let me think about the relation between K and P.

I think the relation is that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3) ). Wait, maybe more accurately, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3} * (P/(1 year))^(1/3} ) ). Wait, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P ) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/ (2 pi c) )

Wait, maybe I should look for the dependence of K on the period P.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, another way: since both stars have the same mass, M_star is the same for both. And the planet masses are similar (so M_p is the same for both). So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), because when M_p and M_star are the same, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So, K1 = (some constant) / (P1)^(1/3)
K2 = (same constant) / (P2)^(1/3)

So, the ratio K2/K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)

Wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K2/K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3) if all else is same.

Wait, let's say K = C / (P)^(1/3), where C is some constant that includes other factors (like M_p, M_star, etc., which are same for both planets). So, K2 = C / (P2)^(1/3)
K1 = C / (P1)^(1/3)
So, K2/K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)

But in the problem, K2 is 7 milliangstroms, K1 is 5. So the ratio K2/K1 is 7/5 = 1.4.

So, 1.4 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)
To find P2/P1, which is the ratio we're looking for. Let me rearrange:

(P1/P2)^(1/3) = 1.4
Take both sides to the power of 3:
P1/P2 = (1.4)^3
Calculate 1.4^3: 1.4 *1.4 = 1.96; 1.96 *1.4 = 2.744.

So P1/P2 = 2.744 → which implies P2/P1 = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.365.

So the period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter by a factor of ~0.36.

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. Oh wait, no: the question is, how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than planet #1's.

Wait, the question says: How many times longer is planet #2’s period than planet #1’s? So if P2 is longer, then the ratio would be P2/P1.

Wait, but according to our calculation, P2 is shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 ≈ 0.365 → so planet #2 has a shorter period, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be ~0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait but let me make sure.

If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then higher K means shorter period. Because if K increases, P must decrease to keep the product K * P^(1/3) constant.

So, Planet #2 has a higher K (7) than Planet #1 (5), meaning P2 is smaller than P1. So P2 is shorter, so when the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1, it should be less than 1. So the correct answer is approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) ≈ (28.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3}) ) * ( (1 year) / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Alternatively, the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1 / (2 pi) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the Doppler shift formula.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1)/(P) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1/(2 pi c) )

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the relation between K and P is K ∝ 1 / (P^(1/3)}.

So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then 7 = (5 * (P1 / P2)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 must be smaller than P1.

So, K2 = (C) / (P2)^(1/3)
K1 = (C) / (P1)^(1/3)
So, K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

We have K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4 → (P1/P2)^(1/3) = 1.4 → P1/P2 = (1.4)^3 ≈ 2.744 → P2 = P1 / 2.744 → so P2 is about 0.364 times P1.

So, the period of planet #2 is ~0.36 times longer than planet #1's. Wait, no. Wait, P2 is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's shorter, so the factor is less than 1.

But the options are:

A) ~ 0.36 → which would mean P2 is about 0.36 times P1's period.

So the answer should be A.


The problem involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given that both planets cause Doppler shifts in their host stars' spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, while planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune, with circular orbits.

The Radial Velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), assuming the planet-to-star mass ratio and other factors are constant. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \), the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
\]

Since \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the ratio of the periods \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \) can be derived as:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^{3}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.36
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times longer than that of planet #1. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
