Okay, so I have this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Let's try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

First, let's look at the information given. The compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's go through each piece of data one by one and see what they tell us.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The key peaks mentioned are a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹, and two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. I remember that IR spectroscopy is useful for identifying functional groups. So, the broad peak at 3000 likely indicates an -OH group, because O-H stretches usually show up around there, and they tend to be broad. So maybe this compound has a hydroxyl group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch, but so do alcohols. Hmm, but wait, I think another point: alcohols have a broad peak, but maybe a bit lower in wavenumber than carboxylic acids. Or maybe not, I'm not too sure. But I'll keep that in mind.

The two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. I'm trying to recall what functional groups absorb in those regions. The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a classic region for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 might be something else. Wait, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation? Or maybe an amide? No, wait, amides have lower carbonyl absorption frequencies, like around 1650 maybe. But wait, if there's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with adjacent double bonds, that could shift the peak. Alternatively, maybe an ester or a conjugated carbonyl group. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if there are two carbonyl peaks, that's a bit confusing. Or perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is something else. Like maybe an aromatic ring with a C=C. So, the 1650 might be a C=C stretch. Oh wait, aromatic C=C is usually around 1600-1450 cm⁻¹. 1650 is a bit higher than that. Could it be a conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone next to a double bond? Alternatively, maybe an ester where the carbonyl is at 1700, and the other peak is from somewhere else.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let's move on and see what other data we have.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So, that suggests the compound has a double bond, probably in a vinyl group. So, the structure might have an alkene somewhere. The presence of vinyl protons in the NMR means that the compound has a double bond, so maybe an alkene group.

Then, the mass
