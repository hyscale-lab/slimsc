Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully again.

Alright, the question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes (no spots vs. spots). The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and LTE is assumed.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that in stellar atmospheres under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k T)), where g is the statistical weight and E is the energy difference.

Wait, but wait, the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels. Oh, but wait, in this case, the problem is about when the star has spots and when it doesn't. So, when there are spots, the overall photospheric temperature changes, which affects this ratio.

Wait, but in this scenario, I think the spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall observed Teff goes down. So, the star's average Teff is 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. Let's think about the Boltzmann factor. The ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(- (E2-E1)/(k T)).

Wait, but wait, when the temperature changes, this ratio changes. At higher temperatures, the exponential term is less negative, so the ratio would be higher because the denominator's exponent is lower. Wait, let's see: When T increases, the exponent -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes a smaller negative number. So, exp of a smaller negative is a larger number. So, if the temperature goes up, exp term is larger, so n1/n2 increases when T increases if E2 > E1. Or wait, no, wait: n1 is the lower energy level, right? So if E2 is higher than E1, then E2-E1 is positive. So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases. So n1/n2 increases as T increases because the denominator's term (for n2) is exp(ΔE/(k T)), but I'm a bit getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should write the formula properly. The Boltzmann factor says that the ratio of the number of particles in two states is (
