Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem gives me X as a meson resonance. The parameters provided are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The question is about finding the mean decay distance, and there are four options given.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime. Decay length is how far the particle travels before decaying, so it depends on its speed and lifetime. Oh right, the formula should be something like L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is the velocity over c, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime tau from the given width Γ_X? Oh, right! The width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So the mean lifetime τ is approximately ħ / Γ. But wait, the natural line width is Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ/(Γ).

So putting that together, the lifetime tau is hbar divided by Gamma. But Gamma is given in MeV, and hbar's units are in eV·seconds? I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, let me get the constants straight. Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. But when working with particle physics, it's often easier to use hbar (ħ) which is h/(2π). And in terms of units, I think ħc is a useful quantity, but maybe I don't need that here.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can convert everything into standard units.

So first, compute the lifetime tau.

Given Γ_X = 320 MeV. Hmm, but how do I convert MeV into units compatible with ħ?

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 10^9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 J. But perhaps I can remember that 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J, but wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Let me think, 1 GeV = 1e9 eV = 1e9 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.602e-10 J.

But ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So in terms of GeV·s, ħ would be 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 GeV / 1.602e-10 J) ) ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (1.602e-10) GeV·s. Let me calculate that.

1.0545718e-34 / 1.602e-10 ≈ 6.586e-25 GeV·s. So ħ ≈ 6.586e-25 GeV·s.

So Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Γ_X = 6.586e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV. Let's compute that.

6.586e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.0578e-24 seconds.

Wait, 6.586e-25 divided by 0.32. Let me do the division: 6.586 / 0.32 is about 20.578, then multiplied by 1e-25, so 2.0578e-24 seconds. So tau ≈ 2.0578e-24 s.

Okay, got the lifetime.

Next, I need to find the speed of the meson. For that, I can find the velocity from the energy and mass. The production energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, but the rest mass is 1.2 GeV.

Wait, the meson is a resonance, so it's virtual. Hmm, wait, but maybe I can treat it as a relativistic particle. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, which is much larger than the rest mass (1.2 GeV). So it's definitely ultra-relativistic.

The energy E is the total energy, so E = gamma * m c^2. Wait, but in natural units, c=1, so E = gamma m.

Wait, but when considering units, perhaps I should compute gamma as E/(m c^2), but since in natural units, c=1, gamma is E/m.

So gamma = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So gamma is 6.6667.

Beta is v/c. For a relativistic particle, we can approximate beta as sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)), but wait, more accurately, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Given gamma is about 6.6667, 1/gamma^2 is (1/44.444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute beta more accurately.

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6666667.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) → 1 - beta^2 = 1/gamma^2 → beta^2 = 1 - (1/gamma^2) → beta = sqrt(1 - (1/( (20/3)^2 )) ).

Compute 1/( (20/3)^2 ) = 1/(400/9) )= 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887.

Alternatively, exact calculation: 0.9775 is 391/400. sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(391)/20. sqrt(391) is about 19.774, so 19.774/20 ≈ 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887.

So gamma is 20/3, beta is approximately 0.9887.

Now, I need to find the mean decay length L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, but wait: the proper lifetime is tau, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma*tau. So the time the particle lives as seen in the lab is t = gamma * tau. Then, the distance is v * t, which is beta c * gamma tau. So yes, L = gamma beta c tau.

So compute L.

We have gamma = 20/3 ≈6.6667.

Beta ≈0.9887.

c is the speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.

Tau is approximately 2.0578e-24 s.

Putting it all together:

L = gamma * beta * c * tau

= (20/3) * 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0578e-24 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute all the constants:

gamma * beta ≈ (20/3) * 0.9887 ≈ (6.6667) * 0.9887 ≈ approximately 6.591.

Wait, 6.6667 * 0.9887. Let's calculate that more accurately.

6 * 0.9887 =5.9322; 0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ approx 0.6591. So total is 5.9322 + 0.6591 ≈ 6.5913.

So gamma beta ≈6.5913.

Then, multiply by c, which is 3e8 m/s.

6.5913 * 3e8 = 1.9774e9 m/s. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, 3e8 m/s times 6.5913 is 1.97739e9 m/s.

Wait, but wait a second, L is (gamma beta c) multiplied by tau.

So, L = (gamma beta c) * tau.

So, 1.9774e9 m/s * 2.0578e-24 s.

Multiply 1.9774e9 by 2.0578e-24.

1e9 *1e-24 is 1e-15.

So 1.9774 *2.0578 ≈ let's calculate that.

1.9774 *2 =3.9548.

1.9774 *0.0578≈ around 0.114.

So total approx 4.0688.

Then, 4.0688e-15 meters.

Wait, but wait, 1.9774e9 *2.0578e-24 is (1.9774 * 2.0578) * 1e9 * 1e-24.

Which is (4.0688) * 1e-15 = 4.0688e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Wait, my approximate calculation gives about 4.068e-15 m, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15 m). So I think option B is the answer.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations for gamma and beta. Maybe I approximated too much.

Let me re-calculate gamma beta more precisely.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

gamma^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444444.

1/(gamma^2) = 9/400 =0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 =0.9775.

Beta = sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.

I know that sqrt(0.9801)=0.99, because 0.99^2=0.9801.

Wait, that's perhaps not helpful. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

Let me use a calculator approach.

Compute 0.9887^2: 0.9887 * 0.9887.

0.9887 * 0.9887:

Compute 0.9887 * 0.9887:

= (0.9887)^2.

Let me compute 9887 * 9887. But perhaps it's easier to compute (a-b)^2 where a=0.99, b=0.0013.

Wait, 0.9887 is 0.99 - 0.0013.

So (0.99 - 0.0013)^2 =0.99^2 - 2*0.99*0.0013 + (0.0013)^2.

0.99^2 is 0.9801.

2*0.99*0.0013= 2.577e-3=0.002577.

(0.0013)^2=1.69e-6.

So 0.9801 - 0.002577 =0.977523.

Plus 1.69e-6 is negligible, so approximately 0.977523.

But we're looking for sqrt(0.9775) which is approx 0.9887 because 0.9887^2≈0.9775.

So beta is about 0.9887.

So back to gamma*beta: 6.6666667 * 0.9887.

Compute 6.6666667 * 0.9887:

Let me compute 6.6666667 *0.9887.

6.6666667 * 0.9887 = ?

We can compute this as 6 *0.9887 =5.9322.

Then 0.6666667 *0.9887.

0.6666667 is 2/3, so 2/3 *0.9887 = approx 0.6591.

Adding 5.9322 + 0.6591=6.5913.

So gamma*beta=6.5913.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=2.0578e-24 s.

So L= gamma*beta*c*tau =6.5913 *3e8 *2.0578e-24.

Compute 6.5913 *3e8 =1.97739e9 m/s.

Then multiply by 2.0578e-24 s:

1.97739e9 * 2.0578e-24 = (1.97739 *2.0578) *1e-15.

Compute 1.97739 *2.0578:

1.97739 *2=3.95478.

1.97739 *0.0578 ≈ (approx 0.1141). So total is approx 4.0689.

So 4.0689e-15 m.

Which is about 4.0689e-15 meters. Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, very close. Perhaps the approximation in beta introduced some error.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta more accurately.

Let me compute beta more accurately. So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

gamma=20/3=6.6666667.

gamma squared is (20/3)^2=400/9≈44.444444.

1/gamma²≈0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225=0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775).

What's sqrt(0.9775)?

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute sqrt(0.9775):

Let me think, 0.9887^2=0.9775 (as earlier approximated), so beta=0.9887.

But perhaps I can get a better approximation.

Compute using more precise method.

Let me use the Newton-Raphson method to compute sqrt(0.9775).

We can compute sqrt(0.9775) by iteration.

Let me take an initial guess of x0=0.9887.

Calculate x0^2=0.97750169.

Which is a bit higher than 0.9775.

We want x where x^2=0.9775.

Compute next iteration:

x1 = (x0 + (0.9775)/(x0)) / 2.

x0=0.9887.

x0 squared is 0.97750169.

0.9775 is 0.97750000.

So (0.9775)/(x0) = 0.9775/0.9887 ≈ 0.9865.

Average: (0.9887 + 0.9865)/2 = (1.9752)/2=0.9876.

So x1=0.9876.

Compute x1^2: 0.9876^2.

0.9876 *0.9876:

Compute 9876^2: but perhaps easier to calculate as (0.98 +0.0076)^2.

= 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0076 +0.0076^2.

=0.9604 + 0.015176 + 0.00005776 ≈0.9604 +0.01523376=0.97563376.

Wait, but that gives 0.97563376, which is less than 0.9775. So x1^2=0.97563376 <0.9775.

Need to adjust.

So, x1=0.9876.

x1^2=0.97563376.

The target is 0.9775.

Compute the next iteration.

Compute x2 = (x1 + (0.9775)/(x1)) / 2.

0.9775 / 0.9876 ≈ approximately 0.9899.

So x2 ≈ (0.9876 +0.9899)/2 = (1.9775)/2=0.98875.

So x2=0.98875.

Compute x2^2: 0.98875^2.

0.98875 *0.98875.

Compute 0.98875 *0.98875.

Again, perhaps expand:

= (0.988 + 0.00075)^2.

= (0.988)^2 + 2*0.988*0.00075 + (0.00075)^2.

= 0.976144 + 0.001482 + 0.0000005625≈ 0.9776265625.

Which is just a bit over 0.9775. So x2^2=0.97762656.

Which is slightly higher than 0.9775.

So the next iteration.

x3 = (x2 + (0.9775)/x2)/2.

x2=0.98875.

0.9775/0.98875 ≈ 0.9895.

So x3≈ (0.98875 +0.9895)/2 = (1.97825)/2=0.989125.

Compute x3^2: (0.989125)^2.

= approx 0.97836.

Wait, that's a bit higher than 0.9775.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that beta is approximately 0.9887, and proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps using more precise calculation, but perhaps the initial approximation is sufficient.

So back to L=4.068e-15 m, which is close to option B's 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma beta.

Let me recompute gamma beta.

Wait, gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20/3≈6.6666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

gamma squared is (20/3)^2 =400/9≈44.4444444.

1/(gamma^2)=0.0225.

1 -0.0225=0.9775.

Beta = sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887 (approx as before).

So gamma * beta =6.6666667 * 0.9887≈6.5913.

So L=6.5913 *3e8 m/s *2.0578e-24 s.

Compute 6.5913 *3e8 =1.97739e9.

Multiply by 2.0578e-24:

1.97739e9 *2.0578e-24 = (1.97739 *2.0578) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.97739 *2.0578.

Let me compute this accurately.

1.97739 *2 =3.95478.

1.97739 *0.0578 = ?

Compute 1.97739 *0.05 =0.0988695.

1.97739 *0.0078= approx 0.015419.

Sum: 0.0988695 +0.015419≈0.1142885.

So total is 3.95478 +0.1142885=4.0690685.

So 4.0690685e-15 meters. Which is approximately 4.069e-15 m.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

So why is there a discrepancy? Maybe because I used approximate values for beta.

Wait, perhaps using more precise beta would bring it closer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in my steps.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate gamma*beta.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach should use a different formula.

Wait, another approach: the decay length L = (gamma * c * tau) * beta.

Wait, but that's the same as gamma*beta*c*tau.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute gamma * c * tau first and then multiply by beta.

Let's see:

gamma = 20/3≈6.6667.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau= hbar/(Gamma).

Earlier calculation: hbar is 6.586e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau=6.586e-25 /0.32 = 2.0578e-24 s.

So gamma * c * tau =6.6667 *3e8 *2.0578e-24.

Compute 6.6667 *3e8 =2.0e9.

Wait, 6.6667 *3e8 = approx 2.0e9.

Wait, exactly: 6.6666667 *3e8 =2.0e9 m/s? Wait, 6.6667 *3 is 20, so 3e8 *6.6667 =20e8=2e9 m/s.

So 2e9 m/s *2.0578e-24 s =4.1156e-15 m.

Then multiply by beta (0.9887) to get L=gamma beta c tau.

So 4.1156e-15 *0.9887 ≈4.077e-15 m.

Wait, that's about 4.077e-15 m. Still, option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, but perhaps I should compute everything with more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for hbar.

Let me look up the precise value of ħ in GeV·s.

I think ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s.

So let me recalculate tau.

Tau = ħ/Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) *1e-25 s.

6.582 /0.32 = approx 20.56875.

So tau =20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s.

That's a bit more precise.

Now, recomputing L.

gamma=20/3=6.6666667.

beta= sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

gamma squared is (20/3)^2=400/9≈44.444444.

1 -1/(44.444444)=0.9775.

Beta= sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887.

So gamma beta=6.6666667 *0.9887≈6.5913.

c=2.99792458e8 m/s (approx 3e8).

Tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L=6.5913 * 2.99792458e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.5913 *2.99792458e8 = ?

First, 6 *3e8=1.8e9.

But more accurately:

6.5913 *2.99792458e8 = let's compute 6.5913 * 2.99792458 = ?

6.5913 *3=19.7739.

But since 2.9979 is 3 - 0.00207542.

So 6.5913 *2.9979 =6.5913*(3 -0.00207542) =19.7739 - (6.5913 * 0.00207542).

Compute 6.5913 *0.00207542.

0.00207542 *6 =0.0124525.

0.00207542 *0.5913 ≈approx 0.001227.

Total ≈0.01368.

So 19.7739 -0.01368=19.76022.

So 19.76022e8 m/s.

Wait, no. Wait, 6.5913 *2.99792458e8 = 6.5913 *2.99792458 *1e8.

So 6.5913 *2.99792458 ≈19.7602.

So 19.7602e8 m/s.

Now, multiply by tau=2.056875e-24 s.

L=19.7602e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Which is 19.7602 *2.056875 *1e-16 m.

Compute 19.7602 *2.056875.

19.7602 *2=39.5204.

19.7602 *0.056875≈ approx 1.117.

So total approx 40.6374.

So 40.6374e-16 m =4.06374e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.0637e-15 m.

Looking at the options again.

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

So 4.0637e-15 is very close to option B.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Let me see what the options are:

A)5.0223 *1e-16 m

B)4.0655 *1e-15 m

C)5.0223 *1e-15 m

D)4.0655 *1e-16 m.

So option B is the closest, 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer is B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Compute the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the width \( \Gamma_X \) by the uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X}
\]

Given:
- \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),

we calculate:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X}
\]

Given:
- \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \),

we calculate:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the decay length \( L \)
Substituting into the formula \( L = \gamma \beta c \tau \):

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau = (6.6667)(0.9887)(3 \times 10^8)(2.057 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, compute \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
\gamma \beta = (6.6667)(0.9887) \approx 6.5913.
\]

Next, compute \( \gamma \beta c \):

\[
\gamma \beta c = (6.5913)(3 \times 10^8) \approx 1.9774 \times 10^9 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Finally, compute \( L \):

\[
L = (1.9774 \times 10^9)(2.057 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 4.069 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated decay length \( L \approx 4.069 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).
