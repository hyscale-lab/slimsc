Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given info is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. They used spectroscopy to find the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest, and those are the same. The radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. They assume the stars are black bodies and want to find by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is probably about the luminosity of black body radiators. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh wait, and the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max ≈ b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K).

The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So λ_max for both is the same. From Wien's Law, that would mean their temperatures are inversely proportional to the wavelength. Since the wavelengths are same, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, no, because λ_max is the same, so T should be same. Because T = b / λ_max. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait. The radial velocities are given. Oh, right, radial velocity can cause a shift in the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So the observed wavelength might be different from the actual emitted wavelength. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest (λ_max) are the same. So I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, for a star moving towards us with a high radial velocity, the light shifts. If Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, perhaps that affects the observed wavelength. But the problem mentions the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is same, but their actual emitted λ_max might differ due to their velocities.

So, the actual emitted wavelength (λ_emit) would be different because of Doppler shift. So for Star_1, its velocity is 0, so its observed λ_max is the same as emitted. For Star_2, it's moving at 700 km/s. Wait, but wait, which direction? Because if it's moving away, the wavelength would be redshifted (longer), and if moving towards, blueshifted (shorter). The problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700. So Star_1 is stationary, Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But which direction? I think the radial velocity is the component along the line of sight, so if it's 700 km/s, but I don't know the direction. However, the problem says their observed λ_max are the same. So perhaps Star_2 is moving away, which would cause its λ_max to be longer. But that would
