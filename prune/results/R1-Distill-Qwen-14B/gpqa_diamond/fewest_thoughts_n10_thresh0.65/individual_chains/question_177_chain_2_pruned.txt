Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully again. 

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities: Star_1 is stationary (0 km/s), and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. We're supposed to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. Okay, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I recall is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity scales with radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem says both stars have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. I think that the peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same, right? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ_max is same, T1 = T2.

Ah, so both stars have the same temperature. That simplifies things. So L is proportional to R² T⁴. But since T is the same, L is proportional to R squared. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Wait, R1 is 1.5 times R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. But wait, that's not considering anything else. Oh, wait, there's radial velocity mentioned. How does that factor in? 

Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait! So Star_2 is moving towards us or away from us, which would shift the observed wavelength. So perhaps the actual wavelengths emitted are different, but due to
