Okay, I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. From spectroscopy, they measured their radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what factors affect the luminosity of a star. I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where L is luminosity, R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the effective temperature. Oh right, because stars are approximated as black bodies in this context.

But wait, what about the Doppler shift here? The radial velocities are given. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a star's emission (as a black body) is determined by its effective temperature. The wavelength at which the star emits most intensely (the peak) is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898×10^-3 m·K).

But wait, if the star is moving towards or away from us, that would cause a Doppler shift, which would change the observed wavelength. However, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. But each star's actual (rest) temperature would affect this.

Wait, let me think. Let's denote the rest frame λ_max of Star_1 as λ1 and Star_2 as λ2. But the observed λ_max could be different due to their velocities. Oh, but the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both. So I need to account for the Doppler shift in their wavelengths.

So, the Doppler effect for light is given by the formula:

λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt(
