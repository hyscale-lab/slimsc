Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that causes a transition to the next lowest energy state.

Alright, let me start by understanding the given data. The molecule is made of atoms X and Y. Their masses are given as Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. Oh wait, I should probably convert those units into something more useful.

First, I remember that the quantum rotation-vibration model, or the non-rigid rotor model, is a model that considers both rotational and vibrational energy states. But in this problem, the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the ground state. So we're looking for the photon that causes a transition when absorbed, probably from the ground state to the next higher state.

Wait, but what's the lowest possible energy transition? The fundamental state in vibration is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be the first excited state. But also, for rotation, the ground state is when the rotational quantum number is 0, I think. Or wait, no, actually for a diatomic molecule, the rotational states are quantized, and the energy levels are given by E_rot = B * J*(J+1), where B
