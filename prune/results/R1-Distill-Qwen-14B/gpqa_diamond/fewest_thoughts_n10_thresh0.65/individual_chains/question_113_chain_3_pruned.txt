Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the FTIR data: there's a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in FTIR often indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have a very broad and strong O-H peak. Also, if there's another peak at 1700 cm^-1, that could be a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 peak might be due to conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with some substituents, like an aromatic ketone or something else.

Looking at the NMR: there are peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl refers to CH2 groups in alkenes, so the compound probably has a double bond. So maybe there's an alkene present. Also, the presence of O-H would suggest maybe an alcohol or another functional group with an O-H.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, what's a common fragment with mass 45? I remember that (CH3)2CO, which is acetone, has a molecular ion at m/z 58, but I'm not sure about fragments. Alternatively, a fragment of 45 could correspond to something like (CH3)2O, but wait, that would be 45 as well? Let me think: CH3OH is 32, so maybe not. Or perhaps a fragment from an ester or something else.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula is among four options: C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So the possible functional groups would fit into these. Let's consider each option.

Option B is C6H10O. That would have a degree of unsaturation. Let's calculate that. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, so (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14 -10)/2=2. So DoU is 2, which could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds,
