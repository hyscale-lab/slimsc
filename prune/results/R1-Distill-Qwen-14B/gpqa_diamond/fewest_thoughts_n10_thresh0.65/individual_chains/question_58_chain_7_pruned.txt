Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Let's break this down.

First, what's regularization? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergent integrals or infinities that pop up when you calculate things like loop diagrams. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a temporary 'cutoff' or some other method to handle these infinities, and then you take the cutoff to infinity or remove it in the end.

Now, the question is asking which theory never needs this regularization. So, the correct theory must be one where these divergences don't appear, at least in its basic form.

Looking at the options:

A) Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a bit different because it deals with strings instead of point particles. String theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity, right? And I remember that in string theory, the higher-order terms (like loops) might not have the same kind of divergences as in other quantum field theories. Or maybe they have different types of divergences which are handled differently. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure whether string theory requires regularization. I think string theories often use methods like the sigma model approach, but maybe they don't need the same kind of divergent regularization as say, QCD or QED. Or perhaps they do, but in a different way.

B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that in QCD, you have issues with things like the running coupling constant, where the force gets weaker at lower energies (confinement) and stronger at high energies (asymptotic freedom). But when you do loop calculations, you probably get divergent integrals. So you have to regularize it, maybe using methods like dimensional regularization or lattice regularization. So QCD definitely requires regularization.

C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. I remember that QED has things like the electron self-energy, which leads to divergences in loop diagrams. These are handled using renormalization techniques, which involve regularization. So QED must require regularization methods.

D) Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, wait, this is the classical version, not the quantum one. Classical theories don't involve the same kind of infinities because they're not quantized. So in classical electromagnetism, the Maxwell equations are finite and don't have the same divergent loop integrals. So in classical ED, you don't need regularization because there are no divergences in the first place. So this theory might be the one that doesn't require regularization.

Wait, but wait. The question is about high energies. At high energies, quantum effects become important. So if we're talking about the theory's behavior at high energies, but the theory itself is classical, then maybe it's not applicable. Oh, but the question is which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So if a theory doesn't have the divergences, regardless of energy, then it doesn't need regularization.

Wait, but the options are about the theories as they are. So for example, Quantum Electrodynamics requires regularization because it's a quantum theory,
