Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something (A) to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different reagents for A and B.

Hmm. Let me think about each reaction separately.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let's draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a nitrile source. I think this is a nucleophilic addition reaction. Normally, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition with something like HCN or CN-.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in the presence of an acid catalyst, perhaps? Because I remember that for the addition of HCN to ketones, you typically use an acid catalyst like H2SO4 or H3O+ (which is what H3O+ is). So in the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and H3O+ would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. The CN- would attack, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin.

Wait, what's a cyanohydrin? Oh right, it's when a nitrile group (-CN) adds to a carbonyl group, with a hydroxyl group (-OH) also adding. So the product would have both OH and CN groups attached to the same carbon that was the carbonyl carbon.

So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me check the structure.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN.
