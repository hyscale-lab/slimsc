Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y, which is given as A = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, the matrix S is given as first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Right, so A_y is c times this matrix. Since c = h/(4π), then A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.

I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix like S are usually ±ħ/2. Wait, but S here might not be the standard Pauli matrix. Let me think. The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Each of them has eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by ħ/2. So for example, sigma_y is:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

Which is exactly the matrix S here. Oh wait, but in our case, S is σ_y itself. So S is the Pauli matrix σ_y.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin operator S for spin-1/2 particles is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So the actual spin operator would be (ħ/2)σ. So maybe our A_y is c times σ_y, which is (h/(4π)) σ_y.

Wait, no. Because c is h/(4π), and A_y = c S. Wait, but S is given as the matrix [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is σ_y. So A_y = c * σ_y. Since c is h/(4π), then A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Wait, what's the usual eigenvalue equation for spin components? For the spin operator S_y, which is (ħ/2)σ_y, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. So for A_y, which is c times σ_y, what's c?

c is h/(4π). So A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

So the eigenvalues of A_y are (h/(4π)) multiplied by the eigenvalues of σ_y. Since σ_y has eigenvalues ±1, the eigenvalues of A_y should be ± (h/(4π)).

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. S is σ_y, so A_y is c σ_y. So the eigenvalues of A_y are c multiplied by the eigenvalues of σ_y. Since σ_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1, A_y would have eigenvalues c*1 = h/(4π) and c*(-1) = -h/(4π).

Wait, but wait a second. I remember that sometimes the spin matrices are defined with a factor. Let's think about angular momentum. The intrinsic spin angular momentum for a spin-1/2 particle is S = (ħ/2)σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So the eigenvalues of the spin component S_y would be ±ħ/2. So in this problem, A_y is given as c * S, where S is σ_y. Wait, no: the matrix S in the problem is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is σ_y. So S is σ_y. So A_y is c * S, which is c * σ_y.

But in quantum mechanics, spin matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So when you have S = σ_y, and A = c S, then A's eigenvalues are c times ±1. So c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues of A_y are (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π))* (-1), so ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Option A says imaginary parts ±2π h etc. Hmm, none of the options directly match ± h/(4π). So maybe I made a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the eigenvalues directly from the matrix. Let's try that.

The matrix A_y is c * S. So let's write it out:

A_y = c * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Which is:

[c*0, c*(-i)],
[c*i, c*0]

So it's:

[0, -i c]
[i c, 0]

The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix like this can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix A_y - λ I is:

[ -λ, -i c ]
[ i c, -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i c)(i c) = λ² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Wait, let's compute (-i c)(i c). (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) =1. So 1 times c^2. So determinant is λ² - (i c)(-i c) → wait, no, the product is (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) (c^2) = ( (-i^2) ) c^2. i^2 is -1, so (-i^2) is 1. So (-i c)(i c) = (i * c) * (-i c) )? Wait, no, it's (-i c) * (i c) = (-i)(i) c^2 = ( (-i^2) ) c^2. i^2 is -1, so (-i^2) is 1. So it's (1) c^2.

So determinant is λ^2 - (c^2) = 0 → λ^2 = c^2 → λ = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are ±c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Looking at the options, none of the options A or B match that. Option A says imaginary parts are ±2π h, which doesn't make sense because our eigenvalues are real. Option B says imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1, which doesn't match either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the matrix S. Let me re-express the problem.

Wait, A_y is given as c times S, where S is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So S is the Pauli matrix σ_y. So A_y = c σ_y.

In quantum mechanics, the spin component operator S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, so its eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. But in this problem, A_y is c σ_y. So if c is h/(4π), then A_y's eigenvalues are c * (±1) = ± h/(4π).

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Looking at the options, option C. It says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Well, in quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of a component of angular momentum (like A_y) are eigenfunctions of the square of the angular momentum (since A^2 commutes with each component), but not necessarily of another component (like Az). So eigenfunctions of A_y are eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. So option C is correct in that sense.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the eigenfunctions of A_y would form a basis, but they are specific to A_y. So D could be correct, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, I can say that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. But I'm not fully certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the eigenvectors. Let me try to find them.

The matrix A_y is:

[0, -i c]
[i c, 0]

We're looking for eigenvectors [x, y] such that A_y [x y]^T = λ [x y]^T. So:

0 * x - i c y = λ x → -i c y = λ x → equation 1.

i c x + 0 * y = λ y → i c x = λ y → equation 2.

From equation 1: x = (-i c y)/λ.

Substituting into equation 2: i c * (-i c y/λ) = λ y.

Let me compute the left side: i c (-i c y/λ) = (i*(-i)) c² y / λ.

i*(-i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So left side is (1) c² y / λ.

Equation: (c² y)/λ = λ y.

Assuming y is not zero (otherwise trivial solution), we can divide both sides by y:

c² / λ = λ → λ² = c² → λ = ±c, which matches earlier result.

So, for λ = c:

From equation 1, -i c y = c x → x = (-i y).

So eigenvalues are ±c, and the eigenvectors can be written as x = (-i y) for λ = c, and x = i y for λ = -c.

So the eigenvectors are [ -i y, y ] and [i y, y ] for y ≠ 0.

We can take y=1 for simplicity, so the eigenvectors are [-i, 1] and [i, 1].

So now, looking at the options.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the operator Ay. Well, the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, so this would be correct. But option D says they are the basis functions of the matrix operator, which is a bit ambiguous. But generally, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the space, so D could be correct.

But looking back at the options, let's check option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Well, since A^2 is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with Ay, the eigenvectors of Ay are also eigenvectors of A^2. But they are not eigenvectors of Az, because the different components of angular momentum don't commute. So option C is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps C is correct.

Alternatively, let's look back at the options. Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors must form a basis for the space, so D is also correct perhaps. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but for matrix operators, the eigenvectors (if they form a basis) can diagonalize the matrix. So, yes, the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the operator Ay. So D is correct.

Wait, but the option says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and its eigenvectors form a basis for R² (or C² in this case), so yes, they are the basis functions. So D is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors (if distinct) would form an orthogonal basis. So option D is correct.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about option D. But I think option C is correct because the eigenfunctions of a component of angular momentum are also eigenfunctions of the square of the angular momentum but not of another component.

So, going back to the question. Which option is correct during the calculation?

The eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), but none of the options mention that. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, what if the matrix S is not σ_y but something else? Let me recheck. The matrix S is given as first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So S is indeed σ_y. So A_y = c σ_y. So the eigenvalues are c*(±1) = ±c.

Wait, but maybe there's a mistake in the setup. Let me compute c. c = h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

Looking at the options again, none of the options A or B match this. So perhaps I need to think differently.

Another thought: Maybe the matrix Ay is actually the spin operator divided by something. Wait, in the standard spin-1/2 system, the spin matrices Sx, Sy, Sz are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So perhaps S in the problem is actually (ħ/2)σ_y. Then A_y = c * (ħ/2) σ_y.

Wait, the problem says S is a 2x2 matrix, and the matrix is given as the first row (0 -i), second row (i 0), which is σ_y.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of units. Let's compute the eigenvalues again. So A_y is (h/(4π)) * σ_y, and the eigenvalues are ± (h/(4π)).

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which can't be correct because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That also doesn't fit.

So perhaps the correct answer is option D or C.

Wait, perhaps I should consider whether the eigenfunctions of Ay are the same as the eigenfunctions of A^2. A^2 is (A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2) or in this case, since we're dealing with spin, perhaps A^2 is the square of the spin component. Wait, no, the square of the operator would be A_y^2, which is (c S)^2. Wait, no, A is the component, so A^2 would be the square of that component.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing A with the total angular momentum. Let me think again.

In quantum mechanics, the square of the angular momentum operator is the sum of the squares of its components. But each component, like A_x, A_y, A_z, when squared, is part of that sum. So for a spin-1/2 particle, the total angular momentum squared is (ħ^2)( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) = (3/4) ħ^2. But each component, like A_y, when squared, is (ħ/2)^2.

Wait, but in any case, the eigenfunctions of A_y (a component) are eigenfunctions of A^2, because A^2 commutes with each component. So option C is correct.

So the correct statement is option C.


The problem involves determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \), given by:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Matrix Representation of \( A_y \):**
   Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the operator \( A_y \) becomes:
   \[
   A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). The determinant calculation yields:
   \[
   \lambda^2 = c^2 \implies \lambda = \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
   \]
   Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers.

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).
   - **Option B:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are not shared. However, \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \) commute, meaning the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \).
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, this statement is ambiguous and less precise than Option C.

4. **Conclusion:**
   The correct statement is Option C, as it accurately reflects the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
