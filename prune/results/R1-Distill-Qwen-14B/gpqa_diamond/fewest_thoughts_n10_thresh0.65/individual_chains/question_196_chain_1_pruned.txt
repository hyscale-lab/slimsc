Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed, but since this is relativistic, I guess we have to consider the effects of special relativity.

The problem states that it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, so the force is F = -kx. The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max.

Wait, in the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, the potential energy U is (1/2)kA². Kinetic energy K is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv², which gives v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, the question is relativistic, so maybe we can't use that approach directly.

In relativity, energy isn't just kinetic energy plus potential; we have to use relativistic energy equations. The total energy E of a particle is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So maybe the total energy combines the rest mass energy and the potential energy.

Wait, in the oscillator, the potential energy is maximum at amplitude A. So the total energy E would be the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativistic terms, the total energy is also the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum kinetic energy occurs when the oscillator is at the equilibrium position, where all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. But then, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², right? So the total energy E is gamma mc², which equals the sum of rest energy and kinetic.

Wait, so at maximum displacement (x=A), all energy is potential, so E = mc² + (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, so E = gamma mc². So setting these equal: mc² + (1/2)kA² = gamma mc². So, gamma =
