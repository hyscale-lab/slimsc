Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms in their atmospheres relates to the temperature. So, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, I think the key here is to use the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution tells us how the population of different energy levels in a system relates to temperature. The equation is something like the ratio of populations of two energy states. Oh right, the formula is n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE / (k*T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) will depend on their respective temperatures.

Let me denote the two energy levels as level 2 (excited) and level 1 (lower). Then for star 1, the ratio is n2_1 / n1_1 = 2. For star 2, the ratio is n2_2 / n1_2 = 1 (since it's half as excited, wait no, wait the problem states star_1 is twice as excited, so star_2 would have half that ratio. Wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as in star_2. That means the population ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, n2_1 / n1_1 = 2*(n2_2 / n1_2).

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased: "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So star_1 has twice the population in the excited state compared to star_2. So for each star, the ratio of excited to ground (say) is:

For star 1, ratio r1 = n2 / n1 = 2 * (n2_star2
