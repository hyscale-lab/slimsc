Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, it mentions iron atoms in the photosphere of two stars, star_1 and star_2. The problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. 

Wait, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in different energy states follows the Boltzmann distribution. So the number of particles in a higher energy state compared to a lower one depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the states.

The formula for the Boltzmann distribution is something like n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Oh right, where n2 is the number of particles in the higher energy level, n1 the lower, E2 and E1 their energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T the temperature.

In this case, the iron atoms are twice as excited in star_1. So for star_1, the number is higher. Let me think: the ratio n1/n2 (where maybe n1 is the excited state and n2 is the ground state, but I need to get the ratio right). Or wait, the problem says the excited level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, n1 is twice as large as the same level in star_2. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio between the excited and lower states. Hmm.

Wait the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So for each star, the ratio of excited to non-excited (ground state) would be different.

Let me denote the excited state as E2 and the lower as E1. Then for each star, the ratio is n2/n1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). 

But wait, the problem states that for star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. So maybe n2_1 / n1_1 = 2 * (n2_2 / n1_2). Or wait, no. Let's think: the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. But that's not directly the ratio (because the total number might differ?), but perhaps the ratio of excited to lower in each star is what's given.

Wait, the question says the atoms are twice as excited, so the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So perhaps (n2_1 / n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2 / n1_2). Or maybe the absolute numbers are twice. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But that could depend on the total number
