Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question says that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions. 

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, right? So the reaction must be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for this reaction. K is given, so I can use that to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions.

The formula for the formation constant K is K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). Since the complex is 0.02 M, that means the concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 M. But wait, in solution, EDTA is usually in different forms because it can lose protons. Oh, but the question says the pH is ideal, so maybe EDTA is already in the form needed for the complex formation. Oh right, at the right pH, EDTA is in the Y^4− form, so we don't have to worry about other forms. 

So, let me think. Since the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant is 5e10, which is pretty large, the complex is very stable. That means that most of the Ca and EDTA is tied up in the complex, so the free [Ca²+] should be very low. 

In the expression for K, if I assume that the EDTA is in excess, then the concentration of EDTA^4− is approximately the same as the concentration of the complex divided by the formation constant? Wait, no, let me think again. 

Wait, initially, without any complex, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− would be zero, but when they form the complex, we have some amount of each. But the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial assumption is that [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. 

But wait, in solution, the complex dissociates a little. So, the dissociation is CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−. The K for this
