Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, parallax is related to distance, right? So I need to connect parallax to distance and then see how the number of stars changes with distance.

Wait, what's parallax again? Oh right, parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star due to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So d = 1 / plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The problem states that the number of stars N varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is inversely proportional to distance, maybe I can express this in terms of distance.

Let me write down the relationships:

1. plx = 1/d (in parsecs)
2. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5

Substituting plx from equation 1 into equation 2: N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that exponent. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, so it's the number of stars per unit distance. Hmm, because when you talk about the number of stars in a region, it depends on the volume that you're considering. Wait, no, the problem might be phrased in a way where N is the number of stars per unit of something else.

Wait, no, perhaps I need to think about it differently. Let me clarify. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx^5). So for each plx, the number of stars is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, that means N ∝ d^5. 

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. But wait, that doesn't make sense
