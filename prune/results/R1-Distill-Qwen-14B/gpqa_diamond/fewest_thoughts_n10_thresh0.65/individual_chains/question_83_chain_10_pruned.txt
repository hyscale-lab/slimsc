Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. Let me read it again.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Alright, first step: figure out the concentration after dilution. I remember the dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So initial concentration is 0.05 M, volume is 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 40 cm³.

So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let's calculate that. 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, the titration part. The NaOH is 0.1 M. So when we reach 25% titration, how much NaOH have we added?

Wait, I think I need to calculate the equivalence point first. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equals moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid in diluted solution: Molarity * Volume. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) equals 0.001 moles. Because 0.025 * 0.04 is 0.001.

NaOH is 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence: 0.001 moles. Volume of NaOH needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So equivalence point is at 10 mL of NaOH added.

Now, 25% titration means adding 25% of that volume. 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 mL of NaOH.

Wait, but I think I should double-check. Titration percentage is sometimes based on the volume added relative to equivalence volume. So yes, 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL. So 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH has been added.

So total solution volume at 25% is initial volume (40 mL) plus 2.5 mL NaOH, making 42.5 mL.

But wait, for the 25% point, the solution will be a buffer solution because only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So it's a buffer of acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate.

So to find the pH, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

But first, let's find out how much acetic acid and acetate we have.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in the diluted solution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

Moles of NaOH added: 2.5 mL is 0.0025 L, 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Reaction: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 moles.

So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log(1/3).

pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is approximately 4.733. Wait, wait. Wait, 1.85 is 1.85, so 1.85e-5 is 1.85 * 10^-5. So pKa is 4.733? Because 1e-5 is 5, 1.85 is 1.85, so log(1.85)=0.267, so 5 - 0.267=4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(1/3). Log(1/3) is negative. Log(3)=0.477, so log(1/3) is -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Rounded to two decimal places, 4.26
