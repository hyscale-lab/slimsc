Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of an operator. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when a linear operator is applied to them. The problem gives me the components of the operator P along the x, y, and z axes. The operator is for a muon, which is like a heavier version of an electron, but I think the specifics of the particle might not affect the calculation here.

The problem says the eigenvector is for an eigenvalue of +ħ/2. Wait, so the operator P has components in x, y, z directions, and the overall operator is P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, I think, where σ's are the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, because each component is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So each P component is (ħ/2) times a Pauli matrix.

Wait, let me think. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So looking at the given P components:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] which is exactly (ħ/2) σ_x.

Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]] which is (ħ/2) σ_y.

P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] which is (ħ/2) σ_z.

So the operator P is given by P = (ħ/2)(σ_x x + σ_y y + σ_z z), where x, y, z are components of a vector n in the x-z plane. Wait, because the direction is arbitrary but in x-z plane, so the vector n is (x, 0, z), I think. So the operator is P = (ħ/2)(x σ_x + z σ_z), since y component is zero.

Wait, no, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the vector n is (a, 0, b), but it's a unit vector, so a² + b² = 1. So the operator P is proportional to (
