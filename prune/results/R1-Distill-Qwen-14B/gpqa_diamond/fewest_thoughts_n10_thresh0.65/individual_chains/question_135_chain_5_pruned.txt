Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the decay of a boson X. Let me read it again.

The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. And the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion pairs.

Hmm, right. So first, I need to figure out what particles X can decay into. Since X is a boson, its decay products must be fermions (because the interaction is with fermions). The Lagrangian tells me the possible fermions involved. Looking at the term, it's ψ_f, so f must be a type of fermion. The interaction term is -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think the standard form for Yukawa interactions is something like L = g ψ̄ ψ X, which would correspond to a coupling between the fermion ψ and the boson X.

But in this case, the term looks like it's part of a mass term. The usual mass term is (m) ψ̄ ψ, which comes from the Higgs mechanism when the Higgs gets a vev (vacuum expectation value). So in this case, maybe the υ is the vev, and X is the fluctuation around it. So X couples to fermions which have a mass term when X is replaced by its vev. So the interaction term would be like X ψ̄ ψ. Therefore, the coupling is proportional to X ψ̄ ψ.

Now, the decay of X would proceed via this interaction. So the possible decay products would be any fermions that the X can couple to. But wait, because X is a boson, it's a spin-0 particle, so it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. So for each possible fermion f that X can couple to, X can decay into f and f-bar.

But wait, also, the mass of X must be at least twice
