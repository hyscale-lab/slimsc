Okay, let's try to tackle this physics problem. Hmm, so the question is about the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let me read it again carefully.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system.

Wait, the system is isolated, right? So, the energy we're calculating should be the potential energy because kinetic energy isn't a factor here since the masses are negligible. Oh, and they're asking for the minimum energy, so maybe that relates to how the charges are arranged to minimize the potential energy.

Wait, but all the 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is at P. So, the 13th charge is at the center, and the others are arranged around it. Or perhaps they're all on the same point, but the problem says 12 are constrained at 2m, so maybe they are all at 2m distance from P, which has the 13th charge.

Wait, no, in an isolated system, the potential energy is calculated based on the configuration of the charges. So, the 13th charge is fixed, and the others are each 2 meters away. So, the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges.

But
