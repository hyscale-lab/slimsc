Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember from my studies that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs, but they have different capabilities.

The question gives me a bunch of stars with various parameters. Let me break down what I need to figure out. Each star has RA and DEC, but I think those might not be too important here because the question says to disregard the pointing limits and altitudes. So I can probably focus on the magnitudes and distances.

The key points are the apparent V magnitudes that each spectrograph can observe. ESPRESSO can handle stars brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES up to 16 mag. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, the way it's phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO" and similarly for HIRES. So, if a star's apparent magnitude is less than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Likewise, if it's less than 16 mag, HIRES can see it.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Because apparent magnitude works such that lower numbers mean brighter. So, when it says "brighter than 17 mag", that's m_v < 17. Because apparent magnitude is lower for brighter objects. So for a star to be observable, its apparent V magnitude should be less than 17 for ESPRESSO, and less than 16 for HIRES.

So a star that can be seen by both must have m_v <16, because that's more restrictive. Because if m_v is less than 16, then it's also less than 17. So which stars have apparent V magnitudes â‰¤16?

Wait, looking at the stars:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent magnitude is m = M +5 +5 log10(d) + extinction. Wait no, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_v. But I need to check if each star has extinction. Hmm.

Wait, Star1: no E(B-V) given. So perhaps no extinction. Wait, Star3 has E(B-V)=0.6, Star4 E(B-V)=0.4, Star5 has none (
