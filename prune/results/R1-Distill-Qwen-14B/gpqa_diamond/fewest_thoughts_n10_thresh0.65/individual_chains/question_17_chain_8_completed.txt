Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see... The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given K for the complex is 5x10^10, and the pH is ideal at 25°C. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant K is involved in these kinds of problems.

Wait, so the Ca-EDTA complex is 1:1, right? So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The formation constant Kf is given as 5x10^10. But wait, the problem says K is 5x10^10, so I think that's the formation constant.

The solution's concentration is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I think the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. Since it's a 1:1 complex, when it dissociates, it will release Ca²+ and EDTA^4− in equal amounts.

But wait, the dissociation is probably minimal because K is so large. Oh wait, no, K is the formation constant, which is very large, meaning the complex is very stable. So the reverse reaction (dissociation) would have a small K, which is 1/Kf. But I'm not sure if that's the way to go.

Alternatively, I think the dissociation can be considered as: CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−. The K for this dissociation would be Kd = 1/Kf. So Kd is 1/(5e10) which is 2e-11. That seems really small, so the dissociation is minimal. Therefore, the concentration of Ca²+ should be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex.

So let's set up the problem. Let’s denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since the dissociation is CaEDTA²− → Ca²+ + EDTA^4−, each mole of complex that dissociates produces one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−. So at equilibrium, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4−] = x, and [CaEDTA²−] ≈ 0.02 - x. Since Kd is very small, x should be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the expression for Kd is [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] / [CaEDTA²−] = Kd.

Plugging in the values, (x)(x) / 0.02 = 2e-11. That simplifies to x² = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.

Taking the square root gives x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? No, wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, but 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.3e-7. Oh, that's option C: 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, let me double-check the numbers. 2e-6.5? Let me compute sqrt(4e-13) properly. 4e-13 is 4x10^-13. The square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5=3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7, which rounds to 6.3e-7, so option C is correct.

I think that makes sense. Because the formation constant is so large, the complex doesn't dissociate much, hence the concentration of Ca²+ is really low, which is why the answer is so small.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by \( K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} \). Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated calcium ions be \( x \). At equilibrium, the concentrations are:
- \([Ca^{2+}] = x\),
- \([EDTA^{4-}] = x\),
- \([CaEDTA^{2-}] \approx 0.02 - x \approx 0.02\) (since \( K_d \) is very small, \( x \ll 0.02 \)).

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[CaEDTA^{2-}]}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
