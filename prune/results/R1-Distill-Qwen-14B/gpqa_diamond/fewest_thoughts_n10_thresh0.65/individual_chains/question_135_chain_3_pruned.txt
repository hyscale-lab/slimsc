Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question gives me a Lagrangian that describes the interaction between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). I'm a bit rusty on my Lagrangian notation, but I remember that the interaction terms usually involve the fields interacting with each other.

Wait, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is asking about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I think kinematically allowed means that the decay products have enough energy and the conservation laws are satisfied. And since it's the lowest order, probably tree-level Feynman diagrams are considered, meaning no loops or higher-order terms.

So the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because the interaction term seems to involve X coupling to fermions. Let me look at the Lagrangian again. It looks like the interaction is X ψ̄ ψ, so X couples to fermions. So, the decay X → f f̄ should be possible.

Now, the fermions involved are probably the ones listed in the options. Let me think about the possible fermions. The fermions in the Standard Model are quarks (like up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top) and leptons (like electron, muon, tau, and their neutrinos). But wait, the neutrinos are very light, so maybe their mass can be neglected, but in this case, X is 6 GeV, which is more than enough for some of the heavier fermions.

But wait, the problem says that the interaction is with fermions f. So the mass of X determines which fermions can be produced. Because for a decay X → f f̄, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion f, right? Because each fermion carries half the mass (since they're produced in pairs). So, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so each fermion must have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Wait, let's think about the masses of the fermions. The quark masses are: up and down are around a few MeV, so definitely way below. Strange is about 95-110 MeV, charm around 1.5 GeV, bottom around 4.5 GeV, top is around 173 GeV. For leptons, electron is about 0.5 MeV, muon ~105 MeV, tau ~1.78 GeV. Neutrinos are negligible, but the question's options include tau pairs, so maybe neutrinos are not considered here.

So, the possible fermions that X can decay into would be those with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let's list the fermions:

- Up quark: way below 3 GeV. So u and ū can be produced.
- Down quark: same as above, d and d̄.
- Strange quark: 0.1 GeV, s and s̄.
- Charm quark: around 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 GeV, which is exactly the limit. So c and c̄ can be produced.
- Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5=9 GeV. That's way more than 6 GeV, so can't decay into b b̄.
- Top quark: way too heavy, so no t t̄ decay.
- Electron: 0.5 MeV, so e+ e- decay is allowed.
- Muon: ~105 MeV, so mu+ mu- allowed.
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV, 2*1.78=3.56 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. Wait, because X is 6 GeV, 3*3.56 is 3.56*2=7.12 GeV? Wait no, wait. The X mass is 6 GeV. For a decay X → tau tau, each tau is ~1.78 GeV. So 2 * 1.78 is about 3.56 GeV. But 3.56 is less than 6 GeV. Oh wait, wait, no—wait the fermions in the decay each have mass m_f, so for X to decay into f f̄, the mass must be at least 2 m_f. Because the rest mass of X is 6 GeV, so 2 m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2
