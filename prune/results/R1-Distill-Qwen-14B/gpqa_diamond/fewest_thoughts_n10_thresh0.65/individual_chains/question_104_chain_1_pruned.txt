Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and that causes the spectral lines to shift slightly.

The question says that two stars with the same mass each have a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the first thing I note is that the stars are identical in mass, and the planets are similar in mass too. But the RV shifts are different: 5 milliangstrom for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2.

Wait, RV shift depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period, right? Or maybe it's about the velocity of the star. Because the star's velocity is what causes the Doppler shift. So the formula for the RV method involves the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit, and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term is 1. And since the planet masses are similar to Neptune, which is much smaller than the star (Sun-like), M_p is negligible compared to M_star. So the denominator becomes M_star^(2/3), and M_p is approximately the same for both planets.

Wait, but in this question, the RV shifts are given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms. RV shift is the semi-amplitude K multiplied by the wavelength factor. Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is in velocity units, and the actual Doppler shift in wavelength is related to K via the formula Δλ/λ = K / c, where c is the speed of light. Or wait, the Doppler shift in wavelength is calculated using (Δλ / λ) = (v / c), where v is the velocity. So the actual shift in wavelength (in units like milliangstroms) is proportional to the velocity.

So, if planet #1 causes a 5 mA shift and planet #2 a 7 mA shift, their velocities (as measured by K) are in the ratio 5:7. Because if the same star is involved, their masses are the same, and the same spectral line, so the shift is directly proportional to the velocity. But in this case, the stars are identical, so same M_star. So K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3))? Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for the RV semi-amplitude.

The formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / (4 π²) ) * ( (1) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) )^(1/P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (P)^(−1/3)

But since e is 0, and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (27 pi G ) / (4 c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (P)^(-1/3)

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Doppler shift formula. The observed Doppler shift (Δλ) is proportional to the velocity (v). So, if we have two Doppler shifts, their ratio is the same as the ratio of their velocities.

So, for the same star, same inclination, same planet mass (since both are Neptune-like), the RV semi-amplitude K is same? No, because the period and velocity would change based on the orbit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the relation between the Doppler shift and the orbital period. The RV method tells us that K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is given by:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) P^(1/3) ) )

Again, since M_p is much smaller than M_star and e=0, this becomes approximately:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But in this problem, M_p for both planets is similar (Neptune-like), and M_star is same for both stars. So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1 / K^(3)

Wait, that might be the key. Because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K^3)^(1/1) → P is proportional to (1/K)³? Wait, let me get that right.

If K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), then:

K ∝ P^(-1/3)

Taking both sides to the power of 3:

K^3 ∝ P^(-1 )
