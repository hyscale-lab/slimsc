Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, I guess I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. First, relative speed. I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the two speeds normally. Because that's only valid at non-relativistic speeds. So, I think the formula for relative velocity is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Or wait, is it (u' - v')/(1 - (u'v')/c²)? Let me get that right.

Wait, no. The correct formula for the relative velocity of two objects moving at u and v (both in the same direction) is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Suppose I'm in a frame where one astronaut is moving at speed u, and the other at v. To find the speed of the second as seen from the first's frame, I should use the velocity addition formula.

Oh right, from the perspective of the first astronaut (mass 2m moving at 0.6c), the other is moving at (v') where v' is calculated using u = 0.6c, and v = 0.5c, so v' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c² ). Let me compute that.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The velocity addition formula is u' = (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c² ). Wait, no, wait. Hmm. Maybe I should look up the formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up; I need to remember.

Wait, the formula is: when an object is moving at speed v in a frame S, and S' is moving at speed u relative to S, then the speed of the object in S' is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/(c²)). So in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c in the positive direction. So, from A's frame, astronaut B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c)(0.6c)/c²).

Let me compute that numerator first: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.142857c. But since speed is a scalar, the magnitude is about 0.142857c. So approximately 0.14c.

Looking at the options, option C and D have v_rel = 0.14c. So that narrows it down to options C and D.

Next, I need to find the total energy of the system. Total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and D says E=5mc². So the correct energy would be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to be sure. Maybe I made a mistake with the gamma factors.

Gamma1: v = 0.6c. (v^2/c^2)=0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma1 is 1.25. Correct.

E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c². Correct.

Gamma2: v=0.5c. (v^2/c^2)=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660. So gamma2 is 1/0.8660≈1.1547. Correct.

E2 = 1.1547 *3m c² ≈3.464 m c². Sum is 2.5 +3.464≈5.964. So about 5.96 mc². That matches option C.

So the relative speed is 0.14c and energy is 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (speed of the first astronaut) and \( v = 0.5c \) (speed of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
\]

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

Taking the magnitude, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \). This matches the values in options C and D.

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the First Astronaut
For the first astronaut with mass \( 2m \) and speed \( 0.6c \):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the Second Astronaut
For the second astronaut with mass \( 3m \) and speed \( 0.5c \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

This is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \), which matches the energy in option C.

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( 5.96m c^2 \). Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: C**
