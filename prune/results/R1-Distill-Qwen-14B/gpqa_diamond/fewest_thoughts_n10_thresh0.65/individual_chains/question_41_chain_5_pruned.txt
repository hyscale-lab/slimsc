Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, okay, let me try to work through this step by step.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Okay, let's start by recalling what I know about the speed of light in a medium. I remember that when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed decreases. The formula I know is v = c/n, where v is the speed in the medium, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and n is the refractive index. So in the glass, the speed is 1/n since c is given as 1 here.

But wait, this is when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. In this case, the glass is moving. How does that affect the speed of light observed?

Hmm, right, when the medium is moving, we need to consider the motion relative to the observer. So this is a problem involving the addition of velocities, perhaps using the Lorentz transformation or classical addition? Wait, but the velocities involved here might be non-relativistic since the speed of light is always c in a vacuum, and the glass is moving at v, which is probably much smaller than c.

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction
