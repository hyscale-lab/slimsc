Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. We start by diluting 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, they react in a neutralization reaction to form acetate ions and water. The pH changes depending on how much base has been added.

First, let's figure out the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be half of 0.05 M, which is 0.025 M. Because concentration is moles/volume, and since the volume doubles, the concentration halves.

Next, when we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. So at 25% titration, that means 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized. I need to calculate the moles at that point.

Wait, let me think about the equivalence point first. That might help. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, so we'll have the acetate ion in solution. Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic. The pH at equivalence can be found using the Kb of acetate.

So, step by step:

1. Calculate initial moles of acetic acid after dilution.
2. Find the volume of NaOH needed to reach 25% titration and equivalence.
3. For 25% titration, determine the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion, then use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.
4. At equivalence, calculate the concentration of acetate ion and find pH using Kb.

Let me start with the initial moles of acetic acid.

The initial volume is 20 cm³ (
