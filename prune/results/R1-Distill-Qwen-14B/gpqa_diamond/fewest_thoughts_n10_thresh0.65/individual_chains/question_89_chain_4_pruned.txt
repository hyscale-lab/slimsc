Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question involves several reactions, so I'll break them down one by one.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid and has four rings. The molecule has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons, probably in a bridged position.

When heated with excess KOH at 240°C, elimination reactions typically occur, especially with vicinal dihalides. Vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) under strong base like KOH usually undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. Since there are two bromines, maybe two elimination steps happen, but wait, in this case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the positions are 1 and 3 on the adamantane structure. Adamantane is a fused structure, so 1 and 3 might be on adjacent positions, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, leading to a possible elimination.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. From what I recall, when vicinal dihalides eliminate, they form alkenes. The NMR spectrum of product 1 shows some peaks. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). Oh wait, wait, but elimination would form an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, another possibility is that elimination forms a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Or maybe I should think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. The positions 1 and 3 are likely on adjacent bridgeheads, perhaps. So, when KOH is added, maybe each Br is eliminated with a neighboring H, forming a double bond. Wait, but that would form an alkene, but the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the reactions. If KOH is used with a dihalide, another possibility is dehydrohalogenation leading to an epoxide? No, I don't think that's right. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-elimination, but that's not straightforward.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But with two bromines and KOH, perhaps it's a double substitution, but that would form a diol. So an adamantane diol? But hydroxyl groups would lead to broad peaks in NMR, which the question says to exclude. Hmm.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 is strong, so that suggests a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. How would that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Oh! Maybe it's undergoing a double elimination, where each Br leaves, but what's in between them is a bridge, and the elimination forms a carbonyl group. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Dieckmann cyclization or some kind of intramolecular elimination. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon heating with KOH, could lose two equivalents of HBr. If the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, then eliminating two HBr molecules would form a double bond. But if they're on non-adjacent carbons, perhaps elimination isn't possible, and another reaction occurs.

Wait, another thought: if two adjacent Brs (vicinal) are present, eliminating two HBr would form an alkene. But in the IR, there's a C=O, so maybe the product is a ketone. Oh wait! Maybe it's a Claisen or Aldol condensation? No, I don't think so because that would require carbonyl groups already.
