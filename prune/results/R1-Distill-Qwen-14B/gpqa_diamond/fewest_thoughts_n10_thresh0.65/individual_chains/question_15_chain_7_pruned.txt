Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should observe that one. Both planets were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, their orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radii, but the star with Planet_1 is twice as massive as the one with Planet_2.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit. The formula for the transit probability is something like R_planet / R_star, but wait, maybe it's more about the orbital plane's alignment. Oh right, the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. But how do the other factors come into play?

Wait, the important factors for transit probability are the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital inclination. But since we can't control the inclination, the probability is based on the chances that their orbital planes are aligned such that we see a transit. The probability is given by the formula (R_p / R_s)² * (a / (a ± something)) — no, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability can be approximated by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - e²))^(1/2). But since both orbits are circular, e=0, so the probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s)^2. But wait, I think that's not the whole story. Oh, right, another factor is the size of the star and the planet's orbital distance. Wait, no, the planet's distance from the star (semi-major axis) isn't directly in the transit probability formula, but it affects the alignment.

Wait, the transit probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_p / a)^2)) ), but I might be getting that wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2)) ). No, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_p/R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a * (1
