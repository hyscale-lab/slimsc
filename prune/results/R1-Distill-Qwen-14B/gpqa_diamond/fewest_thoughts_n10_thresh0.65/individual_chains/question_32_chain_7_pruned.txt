Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. 

First, I need to figure out what the mass of this nucleus is. Lithium typically has an atomic number of 3. The isotope Li with 3 neutrons would make it Li-6, because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which is carbon-12's isotope? Wait, no, carbon is Z=6. Li has Z=3, so Li-6 is the isotope.

Now, the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Wait, I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass number, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact value. Alternatively, I think I can calculate the mass using the atomic mass of lithium-6.

Wait, but perhaps there's a simpler way. The mass of a nucleus is approximately equal to its mass number times the mass of a nucleon. The mass of a nucleon is about 1 atomic mass unit (u). But wait, 1 u is approximately 1.6605 x 10^-27 kg. However, I think in particle physics, energy is often calculated using the rest mass energy, which is mc². 

Wait, but the problem is about relativistic energy. So the energy of the nucleus in the collider is given by the relativistic energy equation. The total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (m c²). 

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma first.

Calculating gamma:
v = 0.96c
beta = v/c = 0.96
gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²)
beta squared is 0.96^2 = 0.9216
1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
sqrt(0.0784) is sqrt(7.84e
