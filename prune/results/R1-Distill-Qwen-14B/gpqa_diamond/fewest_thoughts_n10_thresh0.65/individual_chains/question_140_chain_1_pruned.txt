Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is about 4°C. 

Next, the problem mentions that the product of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Hmm, I've heard that things like KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7 are strong oxidizing agents and used in organic reactions. But wait, the question says the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Let me think about that.

The main goal is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So I need to figure out what elements are in X.

Let's break down the information:

1. Gas W: Its molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule of W has equal number of p and n. The only gas that comes to mind is CO2? Wait, no. Wait, CO2 has a molecule with 22 neutrons (carbon has 6, oxygen 8 each; wait, that's 6*1 + 8*2 = 22? No, wait, each molecule has 1 carbon and 2 oxygens. So 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44 g/mol. But gas properties are more important here. Alternatively, maybe it's H2O? No, H2O has 2 H and 1 O. Alternatively, could it be a noble gas? Like Argon (Ar), but that's monoatomic. Wait, but the question says 'molecule' which implies multiple atoms. Alternatively, maybe it's NH3? No, NH3 has 14 (N) and 3*(1 H each), but that's a molecule. Let's think about the neutron and proton counts.

Wait, each molecule of W has same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think of possible molecules. CO2: each molecule has C (6
