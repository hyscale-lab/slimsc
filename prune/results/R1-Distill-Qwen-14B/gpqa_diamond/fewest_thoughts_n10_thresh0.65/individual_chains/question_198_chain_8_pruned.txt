Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. There are stability constants given for the complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, so I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. The complexes here are Co(SCN) with different numbers of SCN- ions attached. So, the first complex is Co(SCN), the second is Co(SCN)2, and so on up to Co(SCN)4.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions. But wait, which complex corresponds to that? Oh, the first complex might be monomeric, like Co(SCN), and the fourth is tetrameric, Co(SCN)4. So, the blue one is probably a specific complex, maybe the one with two SCN- ions? Or perhaps another one.

Wait, the options are percentages, so I need to calculate the distribution of each complex and then find what percentage the blue one contributes.

I think the approach is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex, considering their stability constants. Since the solution is in equilibrium, we can model the concentrations using the stability constants.

The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because normally, β is the formation constant for the complex. For example, βn is for the complex with n SCN- ions. So, for each n, βn = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co][SCN]^n).

But wait, the given βs might correspond to each step. Let me think. Maybe β1 is for CoSCN^2+ (n=1), β2 for Co(SCN)_2^2+ (n=2), and so on. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the βs are cumulative. Like, the overall stability constant for the first complex is β1, for the second it's β1*β2, etc. Wait, no, I think each βn is the stepwise formation constant. So, the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of the βs up to n.

So, for example, the overall β for Co(SCN)_2^2+ would be β1 * β2. Similarly, for Co(SCN)_3^+, it's β1*β2*β3, and for Co(SCN)_4^+, it's β1*β2*β3*β4.

Wait, but the problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, each βn is the stepwise constant.

But to find the fractions, I think I can model the distribution using the formation constants. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex based on their stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal ions.

The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M, which is the sum of all the Co species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4].

But since the ligand (SCN-) is in much higher concentration (0.1 M), which is 1e-1, compared to Co (1e-2), we can assume that the ligand concentration doesn't change much and can be approximated as constant.

So, the approach is to calculate the distribution of each complex, considering their formation constants.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is given by:

fraction_n = (β1 *
