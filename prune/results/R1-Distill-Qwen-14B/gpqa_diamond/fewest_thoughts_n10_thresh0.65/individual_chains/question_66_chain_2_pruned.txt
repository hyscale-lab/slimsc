Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible operators respecting the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry. So the operators in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the SM, except for the ones we're modifying.

Wait, what are the underlying symmetries of the SM? I think the SM is based on gauge symmetries, like SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1). But the question is about other symmetries, like Lorentz, Poincare, etc.

Lorentz symmetry: I know that the SM is Lorentz invariant. So SMEFT, which is built upon the SM, should also respect Lorentz symmetry. All operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars, meaning their tensor structures have to form singlets under the Lorentz group. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely one of them.

Poincare symmetry: Hmm. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if a theory respects Poincare, it's also Lorentz invariant. Wait, but SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. But is it Poincare-invariant? Because SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, which usually includes all possible terms consistent with the underlying symmetry. But for effective theories, do they need to respect Poincare symmetry? Or is it more about the gauge symmetries?

Wait, the Standard Model is a Poincare-invariant theory, so SMEFT, being an effective theory that reduces to the SM at low energies, should also respect Poincare. So Poincare symmetry (2) must be respected. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

CP symmetry: The SM doesn't have a global CP symmetry, but some of its operators may violate CP. For example, the CKM matrix has complex phases leading to CP violation. So CP symmetry isn't a symmetry that all operators in SMEFT must respect. In fact, SMEFT includes operators that can violate CP. So option 3 (CP symmetry) isn't a must-respect symmetry; it's possible to have operators that break it. So
