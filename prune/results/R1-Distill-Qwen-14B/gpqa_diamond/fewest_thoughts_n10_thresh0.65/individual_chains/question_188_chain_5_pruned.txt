Okay, so I have this question about crystallography. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. The given data are the interatomic distance (which I think is the lattice parameter a) of 10 angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees.

Wait, wait. Rhombohedral crystals... so all edges are equal, and all angles are equal. Oh right, that's a rhombohedral or cubic crystal? No, wait. Cubic is a special case of rhombohedral where all angles are 90 degrees. So here, since the angles are 30 degrees, it's a rhombohedral structure.

The interplanar distance formula for a plane (hkl) in a crystal is given by the formula 1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cosα + hk cosβ + hl cosγ)/(a²), but wait, I might be mixing up the formula. Or maybe it's the reciprocal of d squared equals the sum of (h²)/(a²) plus some terms involving the cosines of the angles. Wait, perhaps I should recall the correct formula.

I remember the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is derived from the Bragg's law setup. For a crystal with lattice vectors a, b, c, and angles between them, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

1/d² = (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) - 2(hk cos γ)/(a b) - 2(hl cos β)/(a c) - 2(kl cos α)/(b c)

But wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, all the edges are equal, so a = b = c. Also, the angles between each pair of vectors are the same, right? So α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

So substituting a = b = c = a, and all angles equal, let's plug into the formula. Let me write that out:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2[ hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α ] /
