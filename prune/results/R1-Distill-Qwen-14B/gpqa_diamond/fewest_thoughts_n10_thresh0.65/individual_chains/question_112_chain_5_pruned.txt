Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about.

The question says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first off, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which makes sense. Since the state is proportional, we'll probably need to normalize it because the coefficients given are (1+i) and (2-i). 

So the first step is to normalize |alpha>. To do that, I need to calculate the norm of the state. The norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients. Let's calculate each part.

The coefficient for |up> is (1+i), so the absolute square is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Wait, because |1+i|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Right. 

The coefficient for |down> is (2 - i), so |2 - i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. 

So the norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> . So |alpha> is equal to that.

Next part: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator A. The operator A has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that matrix? So in the computational basis (|up>, |down>), the matrix is 2x2. Let me write the matrix out.

The diagonal elements (i=j) are zero. The off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, because for a 2x2 matrix, i and j go from 1 to 2. So A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2, and A_11=0, A_22=0.

Hmm, so this operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 on the off-diagonal. I remember that such an operator might be related to spin in another direction, like the x or y direction, but perhaps not exactly since the form is different. Alternatively, it's a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable, and its eigenstates are probably the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, let me think about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix A. The matrix is:

[ 0   a ]
[ a   0 ]

where a = hbar/2.

The eigenvalues for such a matrix can be found by solving (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (a)(a) = 0. So λ² - a² =0 → λ = ±a.

So the eigenvalues are ±a, which is ±(hbar/2). So the operator A has eigenvalues hbar/
