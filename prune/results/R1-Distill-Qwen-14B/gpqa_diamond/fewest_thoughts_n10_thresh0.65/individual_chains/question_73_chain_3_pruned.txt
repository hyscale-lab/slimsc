Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving a different v_rel and E.

Wait, wait. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Like, if you have two objects moving in the same direction, you can't just subtract their speeds to find the relative speed because that would sometimes give you something faster than light, which isn't possible. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving along the same line is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait, is that correct? Or is it (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²) ?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Suppose the first object is moving at v1 relative to the second, which is moving at v2 relative to the observer. So from the observer's frame, the first object's speed is v1, and the second is v2. The relative speed of the first as seen by the second would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Yes, that sounds right.

So in this problem, since both are moving in the positive x-direction, and the second astronaut is moving at 0.5c, the first at 0.6c. So from the second astronaut's perspective, what is the speed of the first? Let's plug into the formula.

So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) )

Simplify numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²)
