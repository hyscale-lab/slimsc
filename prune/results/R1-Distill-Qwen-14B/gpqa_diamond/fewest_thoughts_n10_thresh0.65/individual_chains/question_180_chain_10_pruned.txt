Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again.

Alright, the problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. But wait, the masses are negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. Hmm, so the setup is like this: one charge is at the center, and 12 are arranged in some way around it at a distance of 2 meters. I think the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, which is where the 13th charge is.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. I remember that the potential energy of a system of point charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But because the system is isolated, maybe we need to consider the potential due to each charge as we place them.

Wait, but here all the charges are identical and positive? Wait, wait, the problem says they are each with charge 2e. So e is the elementary charge, which is positive, so each charge is positive. So we have 13 positive charges. Wait, but wait, if the 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P, then each of those 12 is 2 meters away from the fixed charge at P. But what about the potential energy between the 12 charges among themselves?

Wait, the system's potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But if the 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P, perhaps their arrangement is such that they form a regular configuration, like maybe a regular dodecahedron or something, but maybe for simplicity, the problem assumes they are placed symmetrically, but perhaps the exact positions don't matter because all are at the same distance from the central charge. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, let me think again. The problem is about the potential energy of the system. Since the system is isolated, the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. So for all the charges, each pair contributes to the total potential energy.

So, the total potential energy U is the sum over all pairs of (k * q_i * q_j) / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between the i-th and j-th charge.

In this case, we have 13 charges: one at P (let's call it Q) and 12 charges (q's) at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from Q. But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at 2 meters from each other? No, that can't be, because in 3D space, you can't have 12 points all equidistant
