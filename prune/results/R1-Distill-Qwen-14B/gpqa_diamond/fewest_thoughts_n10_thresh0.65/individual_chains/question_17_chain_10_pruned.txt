Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on EDTA complexes. Let me think. EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like Ca²+ to form a complex. The formation constant (Kf) tells us how strong the complex is. So Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

The problem says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So, assuming that the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, all the calcium is bound by EDTA. So the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions. Because in the solution, some of the Ca-EDTA might dissociate, releasing Ca²+ ions. But the Kf is large, so the dissociation should be minimal. But I need to calculate it.

So, the reaction is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So Kf = 5e
