Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these spectrographs have different brightness limits. Let me think through this.

First, I should figure out the apparent magnitude of each star because both instruments have different V magnitude limits. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can observe up to 16 mag. So the star needs to be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO (wait, no, wait. Wait, if the limit is brighter than 17 mag, that means stars with V mag less than 17 can be observed, right? Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is V=16, both can see it. If it's V=17, only ESPRESSO can see it. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight: the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, so that means if a star's V is less than 17, it's brighter than 17 mag. So for ESPRESSO, the apparent V must be <17. For HIRES, it must be <16.

So the star must have an apparent V magnitude less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES. Wait, wait, no. Let's clarify. The question
