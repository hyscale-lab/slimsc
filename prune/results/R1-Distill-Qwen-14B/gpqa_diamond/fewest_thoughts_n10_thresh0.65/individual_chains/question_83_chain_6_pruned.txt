Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out how to approach it. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Oh right, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they form acetate and water.

The problem states that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is diluted with 20 cm³ of water. So first, I think I should calculate the new concentration after dilution. Dilution, right, using the formula M1V1 = M2V2.

Wait, so M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. And after adding 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So M2 would be (0.05 * 20) / 40. Let me calculate that. 0.05 * 20 = 1. 1 divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next step is titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Oh right, 25% means one quarter of the equivalence point volume has been added.

But wait, first I need to find out the equivalence point volume. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So let's calculate the moles of acetic acid initially.

Molarity is moles per liter, so moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). The volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So moles of acetic acid = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid has moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then when you dilute with 20 cm³, the total volume is 40 cm³, so the concentration becomes 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M, which matches earlier. So yeah, the diluted solution is 0.025 M.

So moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. Since it's a 1:1 reaction with NaOH, the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but 25% doesn't directly translate to volume here, but in this case, since the equivalence is 10 cm³, 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So yeah, that's correct.

So, first, what's the pH at 25% titration?

At 25% titration, the amount of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³. Let me convert that to liters: 0.0025 L. Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So initially, we have 0.001 mol CH3COOH.
