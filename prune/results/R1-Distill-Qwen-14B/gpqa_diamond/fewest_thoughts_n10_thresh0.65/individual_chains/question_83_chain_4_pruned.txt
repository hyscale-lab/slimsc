Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. We're diluting 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

First, I think I need to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula. 

So, the initial volume is 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 liters). 

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So, M2 would be (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging in the numbers: (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L. Let me calculate that. 

0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001, divided by 0.04 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait, wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we dilute it, its dissociation increases a bit. But for the initial calculations, maybe we just need the concentration for the titration.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Let me think about the equivalence point first. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

Moles of acetic acid initially in the diluted solution: Molarity * Volume = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

So, moles of NaOH needed for equivalence point is also 0.001 mol. Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but when we titrate, we're adding 25% of that. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added at the 25% point. Hmm.

Wait, no. Let's clarify: the problem says "25% titration." That usually refers to when 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added. So, yes, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added to reach 25% of the equivalence point.

But wait, let me confirm. Titration % is usually the percentage of the equivalence point volume that has been added. So 25% means a quarter of the required NaOH volume has been added.

So, the first part is to find the pH at 25% of the equivalence point. The second part is at the equivalence point.

So, starting with the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate ions (CH3COO^-). So the solution will consist of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

To find the pH, I need to calculate the concentration of acetate ions in solution. Let's see.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added are 0.001 mol, which is the same as moles of acetic acid present initially. The total volume at equivalence is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (10 cm³), so 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

The concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So, it will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me calculate that precisely. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Since Kb is very small, the hydrolysis is slight, and we can approximate using the formula:

[OH^-] ≈ sqrt(Kb * C)

So, plug in the numbers:

sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is approximately 3.288e-6 M. Then, pOH is -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485. So pH is 14 - 5.485 ≈ 8.515, which is around 8.52. Looking at the options, option A says 8.52 as the equivalence point pH, and option D says 6.92. So perhaps option A or D.

Wait, let me check the calculations again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. The Kb is 5.405e-10. The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]. Let's let x be [OH^-], so [CH3COOH] is x, and [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² ≈
