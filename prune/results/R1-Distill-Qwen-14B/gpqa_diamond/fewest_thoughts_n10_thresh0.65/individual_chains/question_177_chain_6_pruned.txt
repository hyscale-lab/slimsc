Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again and jot down what I know.

So there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured their radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. The options are all around 2.2 to 2.35, so I'm guessing the factor isn't too large.

Hmm, right. The problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but how do the temperatures of the two stars compare? The problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest (their peak wavelengths) are the same. Oh, right! That's about blackbody radiation. The peak wavelength λ_max is related to the temperature by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K).

If both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T would be the same (since T = b / λ_max). So T1 equals T2. Oh, that's a key point. So even though the stars have different masses and radii, their temperatures are the same.

Wait, but wait. The problem mentions radial velocities. Oh, right, radial velocity is about how fast the star is moving towards or away from us. If Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, does that affect anything? Hmm, maybe because of the Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, which would affect the observed wavelength. But the problem says they
