Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So the closer a star is, the larger its parallax, and vice versa.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So if I think about it, as parallax increases (which means the stars are closer), how many stars would I expect in a given range of parallax? But wait, the options involve how the number changes with plx. So I need to find a relationship between the number density and the parallax.

I think it's a question about how the number of stars in a certain volume relates to distance. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume should depend on the volume available. But wait, parallax is related to distance. For a given parallax range, what is the corresponding distance range?

Parallax (p) is in arcseconds, and distance (d) in parsecs is given by d = 1/p. So when parallax increases, distance decreases. So, if I have a small range in p, say from p to p + dp, what is the corresponding range in distance?

Let me think of differentials. p = 1/d, so dp = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = - d² dp. But since we're dealing with ranges, perhaps the negative sign isn't important here. So, the change in distance is proportional to d squared times the change in parallax. Or wait, maybe it's better to express it as a differential in terms of d.

Wait, maybe I should consider the density as a function of distance. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (number per unit volume) is uniform. So the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + dd would be 4π (d² dd) * n, where n is the number density.

But I'm trying to relate this to parallax. Parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. Let me substitute that in. So, the volume element in terms of p would be d^3 in terms of p. Wait, let me think again. The volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/p, then dd = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting, volume element is 4π (1/p)^2 * ( -1/p² dp) ). The negative sign just indicates direction, but since we're considering the magnitude, we can ignore it. So the volume element becomes proportional to (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp, which is 1/p^4 dp.

Wait, no, wait. Let me redo that. The volume element is 4π d² dd. Since d = 1/p, then dd = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting, the volume element becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p² dp). The negative is just because of the direction, so when we take absolute value, it's 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number of stars in a thin shell at parallax p is 4π n (1/p^4) dp. So
