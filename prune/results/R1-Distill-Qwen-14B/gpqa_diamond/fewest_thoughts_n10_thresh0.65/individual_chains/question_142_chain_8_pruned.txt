Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try my best.

The question is about finding the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. The matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). The options are A to D, each giving a point in a 3D space with coordinates (x,y,z). 

Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. For a qubit, the state can be represented as a point in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation in 3D space, right? So each density matrix corresponds to a point on or inside the Bloch sphere.

Let me recall how to convert a density matrix into Bloch sphere coordinates. The general form for a qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (x, y, z). So, if I can express the given ρ in this form, I can find the r vector, which gives the coordinates.

The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute this. |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 in the top left and 0 elsewhere, and |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 0 and 1 in the bottom right. So when you add them, you get a matrix [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then multiply by 1/2, you get [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal.

Now, I need to express this ρ in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (I)/2 would be [[0.5, 0],[0, 0.5]]. 

Wait a minute, looking at that, ρ is exactly (I + 0·σ_x + 0·σ_y + 0·σ_z)/2. Because the identity matrix is part of the expression, and the other terms are zero. So the vector r would be (0, 0, 0). Because r·σ is 0
