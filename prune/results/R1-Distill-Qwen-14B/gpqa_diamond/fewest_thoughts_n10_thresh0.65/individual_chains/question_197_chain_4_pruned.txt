Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of a nitrile group. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, nitrile groups with HI and red phosphorus usually lead to the formation of an amine. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, red phosphorus with HI is used in the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amine. Or maybe more accurately, the reaction of a nitrile with HCl and PCl5 or something else? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Oh, right, maybe it's the Stephen reduction? No, Stephen uses H2S and HgSO4. Wait, another approach: nitrile + HI and P → amine. I think that's the right pathway. So if Compound X has a nitrile group, then the product would be an amine.

Wait, but let me check the reaction. Nitrile (R–C≡N) when treated with HI and red phosphorus becomes an amine. The reaction is probably converting the nitrile to a primary amine. So R–C≡N → R–CH2–NH2. So the product
