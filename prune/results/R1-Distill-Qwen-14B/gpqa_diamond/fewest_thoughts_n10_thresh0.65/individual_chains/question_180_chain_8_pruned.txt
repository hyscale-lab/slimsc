Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum energy of this system. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Since e is the elementary charge, each charge is 2 times that. The particles are considered to have negligible mass, so I don't need to worry about their kinetic energy or anything like that. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P has the 13th charge, and the other twelve are all located on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is important. Since the system is isolated, we don't have to worry about any external fields, just the interactions between the charges themselves.

Wait, the potential energy for a system of point charges is given by the formula U = (1/(4πε₀)) * sum over all pairs (q_i q_j / r_ij). But that's a lot of terms to calculate. Oh, but wait, all the charges are identical, and the configuration is symmetric. Maybe I can find a smarter way to compute this without calculating each pair.

Let me break this down. There are two groups of charges: the one at point P (let's call it charge Q) and the twelve charges each at a distance of 2 meters from P.

Each of the twelve charges is at a distance of 2 meters from Q. So, each of them contributes to the potential energy of the system due to their interaction with Q. Also, each of the twelve charges interacts with each other, so their mutual repulsion contributes to the potential energy as well.

So, the total potential energy U is the sum of two parts: the potential energy due to the interactions between Q and the twelve charges, and the potential energy due to the interactions among the twelve charges themselves.

Wait a minute. But wait, since Q is fixed at P, the charges cannot move. So the system is already in a state where no movement is possible, which might mean that the potential energy is at its minimum or maximum. Wait, but the question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, but if the charges are constrained, maybe they can't move. So is this the only possible
