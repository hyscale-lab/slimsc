Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux in two different energy bands. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The problem says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago, and we need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, with various numbers.

Wait, I remember that the pp chain is a major source of energy in the Sun. The pp-III branch is one of the steps. So if that stopped, what happens to neutrino production?

Neutrinos are produced in various reactions in the Sun. The main ones are from the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle. Oh right, the pp chain produces neutrinos through the process where a boron-8 decays into carbon-14 and emits a positron and a neutrino. So if the pp-III branch stops, that probably affects the production of those neutrinos.

Wait, but the question says all other reactions remained as they were. So only the pp-III branch is stopped. So the CNO cycle is still going, I suppose. But I think the CNO neutrinos are a minor contributor compared to the pp chain. So if the main pp neutrino production stops, the neutrino flux from that source would drop.

But the neutrino flux we detect on Earth is a result of all the neutrinos produced by all reactions in the Sun. So if the pp-III stops, the pp neutrinos (like the ones from boron-8 decay) would stop, but other sources (like the CNO cycle) would continue.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of fluxes in two specific energy bands. So I need to think about which reactions contribute to each energy band.

The neutrinos from the pp chain have certain energy spectra. The boron-8 decay produces neutrinos with energies around 15-20 MeV, but wait, that's way higher than the bands given (which are in the hundreds of keV). Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another thought: the pp chain produces lower-energy neutrinos compared to other processes. Because, for example, the main neutrinos from the Sun are the pep and the boron-8 neutrinos. The pep reaction produces lower-energy neutrinos (~1.4 MeV) and the boron-8 produces higher (~7-14 MeV). But wait, the energy bands in the question are 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV, so like ~700-900 keV. So they're in the range of the pep neutrinos?

Wait, the pep reaction produces neutrinos with energies around 1.4 MeV. So 0.7-0.9 MeV is lower than that. So perhaps the neutrinos in those bands are from other sources, like the CNO cycle or other parts of the pp chain?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think that the pp chain's main neutrino production (like the boron-8) is in higher energy ranges. The CNO cycle also produces neutrinos, but I'm not sure about their energy
