Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about solving higher dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. Hmm, I need to figure out what the key factor is when converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. Let me think through this.

The question mentions the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation. I remember that matrix exponentials often come up in solving systems of linear differential equations, which is relevant here since heat equations are PDEs that can be discretized into systems of ODEs.

In sequential algorithms, each step is computed after the previous one, so it's time-consuming for large systems. Parallel methods aim to compute parts of the solution simultaneously. How does that tie into matrix exponentials and fractional approximations?

I think about the methods used for parallelization. One approach is splitting the time interval into smaller parts or using different approximations that allow for concurrent computation. Fractional approximation methods, like those using Padé approximants, are used to approximate the matrix exponential more efficiently, perhaps allowing for parallel computation.

The options are A to D. Let's go through them.

Option A: Stability analysis. That's important for ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up or produce incorrect results. But is it the key factor for converting to a parallel algorithm? Maybe not directly. It's more about the method's reliability.

Option B: Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal conditions can complicate the problem, but I'm not sure how they directly tie into parallelization. Maybe in some cases, but not sure.

Option C: Complex roots of fractional approximation. Wait, fractional approximations... like Padé approximants. These are rational functions that approximate the exponential function. If the method relies on a Padé approximant, the roots of its denominator could affect the stability or the need for certain decompositions. But how does that relate to parallelism?

Option D: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Linear partial fractions are used to decompose rational functions into simpler terms, which can make matrix operations more manageable. If the approximation can be broken down into parts that can be computed in parallel, this might be the key. Like, each term in the partial fraction decomposition could be handled by a different processor, thus speeding things up.

Wait, matrix exponentials can sometimes be split into products of exponentials of certain matrices, which can be computed in parallel if they commute. So if the fractional approximation decomposes into a sum of exponentials that are linear combinations, each part can be computed in parallel and then combined.

In the context of fractional approximation, like using a Padé approximant, the method might involve a partial fraction decomposition. Each term in this decomposition can be exponentiated separately and then added together. Since each exponentiation is a separate operation, they can be computed in parallel, making the algorithm faster.

So the key factor would be the ability to split the approximation into linear partial fractions, each of which can be computed concurrently. That would make option D correct.

Alternatively, complex roots might affect the stability of the approximation, but I think the decomposition is more directly related to parallelism. Because if you can break it into several terms that are linear fractions, each can be handled in parallel.

So the correct answer should be D.
