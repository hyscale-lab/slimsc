Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their radii and masses are both 1.5 times larger for Star_1 compared to Star_2. Interesting. The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, that must relate to their temperatures somehow because the peak wavelength of a black body's emission depends on its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! Wien's displacement law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same.

Wait, but if the stars are black bodies, their luminosity should depend on both their radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since σ is a constant, we can ignore it for the purpose of comparing the luminosities.

So, if Star_1 and Star_2 have the same temperature, then the ratio of their luminosities would be (R₁ / R₂)². Because L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is the same for both stars. So R₁ is 1.5 times R₂. Therefore, (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So Star_1 is 2.25 times more luminous than Star_2. But wait, the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So the factor would be 2.25. But wait, looking at the options, option A is 2.25, which would seem to be the answer. But wait, I might be missing something else.

Wait, the problem also mentions that their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Oh, does that affect the observed luminosity? Hmm. Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. If a star is moving towards or away from us, it causes a Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength would be affected by this. But in this problem, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, the peak emission wavelength is the same as observed, right?

Wait, but if a star is moving towards us (positive radial velocity), it would have a blueshift, meaning the observed wavelength is shorter than the emitted. Conversely, if moving away, redshift, longer wavelength. So if both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, but their rest frame wavelengths might be different.

Wait, but how does that play into this scenario? Let me think. Let's say Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted (rest frame). Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So we'd have to calculate the shift in Star_2's peak wavelength due to its velocity. But wait, the problem says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found they are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same.

So, the observed wavelength for Star_1 is the same as the observed wavelength for Star_2. But Star_1's velocity is zero, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength. For Star_2, which has a velocity of 700 km/s, we have to calculate the Doppler shift.

Wait, but we know that their observed peak wavelengths are the same. So the rest frame wavelength of Star_2 is different from Star_1? But according to the problem, the observed ones are the same. So let's model this.

Let me denote λ1 as the observed wavelength of Star_1, and λ2 as the observed wavelength of Star_2. Since Star_1's radial velocity is zero, λ1 = λ_rest_1. For Star_2, which is moving with velocity v=700 km/s, we have to compute λ2.

But wait, the problem says λ1 equals λ2. So λ_rest_1 = λ_observed_1 = λ_observed_
