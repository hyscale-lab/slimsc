Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar in radius to the Sun. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when we observe the star, the brightness changes as it rotates, similar to how an exoplanet transit would cause a dip in brightness.

The question is asking: To produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve, what would be the radius of an exoplanet compared to the host star? The options are A to D.

Hmm. So two scenarios are being compared here: one with spots causing brightness variations and another with an exoplanet causing a dip. The amplitude of the light curve in both cases should be the same. I need to find Rpl/Rstar.

Wait, the problem mentions that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same signal. That implies I need to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same variation.

I remember that the flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σT^4. But when parts of the star are cooler (spots), they contribute less flux. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing the observed brightness to vary.

So for the spotted star, the total flux when the spots are on the side we see (i.e., when the spots are facing us) is lower than when the spots are on the other side. The variation in flux will depend on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

The problem states the filling factor is 20% (or 0.2). The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, I need to account for that.

Let me think about the flux variation. The star's total flux without any spots would be F0 = σTeff^4 * (4πRstar²), but since we're considering relative variations, maybe we can think in terms of the fractional change.

When the star is in a position where the spots are visible, the total flux is less. The flux from the spotted area is (T_spot^4) * (area of spots) / (area of star). The rest of the star is at Teff.

But wait, the filling factor is 0.2, which is the area of the spots in one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

The area of the hemisphere is 2πR² (since the area of a sphere is 4πR², a hemisphere is half that). So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, but that's the area of the spots on one hemisphere. So the total area of spots on the star is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R²? Or is the filling factor 0.
