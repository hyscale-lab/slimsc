Okay, so I'm looking at this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux in two energy bands after the pp-III branch suddenly stops. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several steps, including the proton-proton chain, and the pp-III branch is part of that. 

Wait, the pp-III branch must be one of those steps in the proton-proton cycle. Oh right, the main proton-proton reactions. The pp-III branch involves the fusion of two helium-3 nuclei into carbon-12, but I think that's part of the overall process. So, if the pp-III stops, what happens?

The question says the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, which is roughly the time it takes for sunlight to reach Earth. So the neutrinos produced before that time would have already reached us, and after that, the neutrinos would be from other reactions still happening.

Neutrinos are produced in various steps. The main ones are the Beryllium-7 neutrinos (like the pep and hep branches) and the dominant pp I believe are from the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-1 branch, which produces a helium-4 and two positrons and neutrinos.

Wait, the pp-III branch is part of the process where two protons combine to form a deuterium, then another proton, making tritium, and then another to helium-4. Oh wait, no, that's the pp-I branch. Or is it the pp-II?

Wait, no. Let me think
