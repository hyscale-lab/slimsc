Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to figure out what Compound X is first, then determine the reaction.

First, looking at the spectral data provided. The IR and NMR data should help me identify the structure of Compound X.

Starting with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably due to O-H or N-H stretches. But looking at the options, they are all benzoic acids or substituted benzenes. Benzoic acid derivatives have a strong O-H stretch around 3000-2500, which would explain this region. The other IR peaks: 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl group (C=O). 1610 and 1450 might be aromatic C=C stretches.

So I'm thinking the compound has a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group. Since the 1720 cm-1 is present, maybe it's an ester or a ketone or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 3400-2500 region might also indicate an alcohol or another acidic proton. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad around 2500-3000, which fits. But if it's an ester, the O-H would be from an alcohol somewhere else.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. Because in NMR, a broad singlet around 10 ppm is typical for -COOH protons. So that suggests the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The protons on the aromatic ring are split into two doublets, which would happen if there are two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but wait, for a para-substituted benzene, the protons are usually either two doublets (if there are two substituents in para positions) or perhaps a quartet or something else if there's more substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, but that would require two groups in the para positions.

Wait, but the integration here is 2H each. So maybe it's a mono-substituted benzene with two protons on each adjacent carbon. No, wait, for a para-substituted benzene, each pair of protons would be equivalent, so maybe two doublets for each pair. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted benzene with substituents at the para positions.

But wait, the substituent with the carbonyl is likely at the para position relative
