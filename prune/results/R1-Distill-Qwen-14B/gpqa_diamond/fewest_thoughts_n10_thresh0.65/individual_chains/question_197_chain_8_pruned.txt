Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then predicting its reaction product with red phosphorus and HI.

First, let's look at the IR data. The IR shows strong peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually suggests the presence of either an -OH group or an alkyne. But wait, if it's an alkyne, another peak around 2100 cm-1 would be expected, right? Since that's not present, it's probably an -OH group. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic rings, probably C=C stretching. So putting this together, the compound likely has an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an -OH group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that's probably an acidic proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm, so that fits. Then at 8.0 ppm, a doublet integrating for 2H suggests aromatic protons. Similarly, 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – aromatic. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring? Because the protons are in pairs as doublets, which makes me think of two substituents across from each other. 

Looking further, there's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That's probably a methine proton adjacent to an oxygen or maybe part of a CH2 group. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – maybe a CH2 next to another CH2 or part of a chain. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a methyl group attached to something, perhaps an oxygen or a carbonyl. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a terminal methyl group, like from an ethyl chain.

Putting the NMR together: The aromatic part is para-substituted. There's a methyl group at 1.4 ppm as a doublet, which might be attached to something else, maybe a carbonyl. The 2.9 ppm could be a CH adjacent to the carbonyl. The 1.7 is maybe a CH2 between the CH and another group. The 0.9 t suggests an ethyl chain, perhaps connected to the benzene.

Wait, let me try to sketch a possible structure. So benzene ring with substituents at para positions. One substituent is a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or a carboxylic acid. The other substituent is a chain. The NMR suggests the substituents are a carbonyl group and a chain with a methyl and ethyl parts.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is probably a carboxylic acid proton. So the substituent would be -COOH. Then the other substituent would be a group attached to the benzene, maybe like a CH2CH2CH(CH3) group or something similar.

Looking at the substituents: The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl attached to something, perhaps a CH2 group. Let me think, maybe it's a -CH2-C(O)OH group? But then how does the rest fit.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm methyl is a triplet or multiplet. Oh, perhaps it's part of a longer chain. Let me consider the substituent as a propyl group or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group.

Wait, let's go back to the IR. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1. Here it's at 1720, which is a bit higher, which might suggest a ketone or maybe an ester. But wait, the 10.5 ppm in NMR is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid, as other carbonyl-containing groups like esters or ketones don't usually have protons in that region. So maybe the IR 1720 is actually the carboxylic acid carbonyl. Or perhaps the compound has both a carboxylic acid and another carbonyl group? But that seems less likely.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the 1720 is an ester. But the 10.5 ppm is a broad peak, which is more characteristic of a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe the compound
