Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives the molecular formula C8H9NO. Oh wait, that's an important starting point. The compound's structure must fit that. Then there's the NMR data. I remember that NMR gives information about the structure based on the environment of the protons.

The NMR data is as follows:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, trying to interpret these. Let's break them down.

The 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's probably a proton that's deshielded, maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the compound.

Then, 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each with 2H. Those could be from aromatic protons. The 6.98 is likely para-substituted aromatic protons, maybe like a para-substituted benzene ring. The 6.51 could be another set of aromatic protons, perhaps in a different substitution pattern or environment.

The 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad signals could indicate exchange with something, like an acidic proton, maybe in an enol form or something with OH groups. Or perhaps it's a vinyl proton that's not very deshielded. Wait, but since it's a singlet, maybe it's adjacent to something that makes it not split much.

Then the 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's probably some CH2 group, maybe next to an electronegative atom or oxygen. Or perhaps it's part of an ether or ester group.

Now, the reagents. The reaction sequence is:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH, Heat

Wait, what's that? NaNO2 and HCl are typically used for diazotization, especially for aromatic amines. Oh, but wait, our molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. 

Degree of unsaturation: Each degree is a ring or a double bond. The formula is C8H9NO. So for CnHmOxNp: degrees = (2n +2 - m - x + p)/2. Wait, I think the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, since X is halogens, but in this case, no X. So for C8H9NO:

n=8, m=9, O=1, N=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2= (10)/2=5 degrees. So that's 5 rings, double
