Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three separate reactions labeled A, B, and C. Each involves a Michael addition, and I need to determine the major products. Then, I'll match them with the options provided.

Let me start by recalling what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. This is a 1,4-addition. The enolate acts as a nucleophile in this process.

So, for each reaction, I need to identify the enolate and the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, then determine where the addition occurs.

First reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH.

Dimethyl malonate is a good donor in the Michael reaction. It's a diethyl ester of malonic acid, so when deprotonated by a base like NaOEt, it forms an enolate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the structure would be CH2=CHCO2Me with a p-tolyl group on the beta carbon? Or wait, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be the substituent on the acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)CO2Me? Hmm, wait no. Let me think again. The general structure for acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the middle carbon. So the substituent is on the beta carbon.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=CH–C(p-tolyl)–CO₂Me. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is on C3? No, wait: perhaps it's CH₂–C(p-tolyl)=CH–CO₂Me. Oh wait, wait, the numbering may be different.

Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-3-p-tolylacrylate, so the structure is CH₂=C(C₆H₄Me)-CO₂Me. Wait, no, the acrylate is CH₂=CH-CO₂Me. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the CH₂ group? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH₂=C(C₆H₄Me)-CO₂Me. So the substituent is on the double bond's second carbon. So the structure is:

CO₂Me

CH₂–C=C–C6H4Me
Wait, but that might be the structure. So, in this case, the alpha-beta unsaturated carbony
