Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down what's given.

The problem says that Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. Gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Hmm, that sounds familiar. Wait, I remember that ammonia (NH3) has 14 neutrons and 14 protons? Or wait, no, maybe another gas. Oh wait, the molecule where protons equal neutronsâ€”could that be water? No, water has H and O. Alternatively, maybe methane? No. Wait, perhaps the gas is something like CO2? Let me think. Wait, CO2 has 12 protons (from C) and 16 from O, but that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe it's not the same as that.

Wait, maybe the gas W is carbon dioxide. Let me calculate. Carbon has 6 protons, oxygen has 8. So CO2 would have 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons. The number of neutrons would be the mass number minus protons. Carbon is usually C-12 (6 neutrons) and O is O-16 (8 neutrons). So CO2 would have 6 + 16*2 = 38. So protons are 22, neutrons 38? No, that doesn't match. So W's molecule's protons equal neutrons. So protons = neutrons.

Wait, maybe W is something like CH4. CH4 has 6 protons (from C) + 4 (from H) = 10 protons. The number of neutrons would be the sum of each isotope. If C is C-12 (6 neutrons) and H is H-1 (0 neutrons), then total neutrons is 6 + 0*4 =6. So protons are 10, neutrons 6. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's H2O. Water has H (1 proton each) and O (8). So H2O has 2+8=10 protons. Neutrons: O is 8, H has 0 each, so 8. 10 protons vs 8 neutrons. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe it's a different gas. Let's think of
