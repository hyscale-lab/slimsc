Okay, so I've got this question here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question involves two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but different orbital periods and host stars. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. Let me break down what I know.

First, the given data:
- Both planets have the same mass.
- Orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1's period is P1, Planet_2's is P2 = 3*P1.
- Both have circular orbits.
- Host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting, since same radius but different masses, I guess Planet_1's star is more massive but same size. Wait, but more massive stars are usually bigger. Oh, but maybe it's slightly evolved? Or perhaps it's a main-sequence star with higher mass but similar radius. Hmm, maybe not too relevant for the transit probability but could affect other factors.

The transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is closer to our line of sight. The formula I recall is P = (R_star) / (a * (1 - e²)^(1/2)), but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so it simplifies to P = R_star / a, where a is the semi-major axis (which for circular orbit is just the orbital radius). Alternatively, since a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law, maybe I can find a in terms of the period and the star's mass.

Wait, the formula for the probability is actually the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet from the star, right? So P ≈ (R*) / a. But since Kepler's third law relates a^3 to (P^2 * M*) for a given system, perhaps I can express a in terms of P and M*.

Kepler's third law: (a^3) / (P^2) = (G(M*) )/(4π²). So a^3 = (G M* P^2 )/(4 π² ), so a is proportional to (M* P²)^(1/3). 

So, a1 = (G * M1 * P1² )^(1/3) / (4 π² )^(1/3)
a2 = (G * M2 * P2² )^(1/3) / (4 π² )^(1/3)

Given that M1 is twice M2 (M1 = 2 M2), and P2 is three times P1 (so P1 = P2/3, or P2 = 3 P1). Let me substitute that.

For Planet_1: a1 = (G * (2 M2) * (P1)^2 )^(1/3)
For Planet_2: a2 = (G * M2 * (3 P1
