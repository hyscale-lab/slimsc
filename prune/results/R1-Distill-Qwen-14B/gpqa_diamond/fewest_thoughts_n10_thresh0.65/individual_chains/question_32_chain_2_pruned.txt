Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons, which I think is Li-6 because Lithium usually has 3 protons and 3 neutrons making it Li-6. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me think. Lithium has an atomic number of 3. So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons, right? So the mass number is 6. So X is Li-6.

So I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm. I remember that relativistic energy is involved here. Oh right, because when speeds are a significant fraction of c, you can't use classical mechanics; you have to use special relativity.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, I need to calculate the kinetic energy, or is it the total energy? The problem says "the energy of the RHIC," which I think refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the nucleus. Or does it mean the total energy? Hmm, sometimes in these contexts, energy refers to the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, wait, I think the RHIC's energy is usually given as the kinetic energy, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's the total energy, including rest mass. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the problem. The question states: what is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. So the speed is given, and I need to find the energy. So the energy is the total energy, because speed affects gamma, which is part of the total energy. So E = gamma * m c². So I'll proceed with that.

First, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a single Li-6 nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.017 atomic mass units (
