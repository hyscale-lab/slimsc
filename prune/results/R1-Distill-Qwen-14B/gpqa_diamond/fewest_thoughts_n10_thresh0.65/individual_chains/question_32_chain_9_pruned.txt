Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, okay, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So the isotope must be Li-6 because it has 3 neutrons (since lithium has 3 protons normally). Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Lithium has atomic number 3, and if it has 3 neutrons, that adds up to 3+3=6 nucleons, so it's Li-6. So the mass number is 6.

The problem is about relativistic energy. So I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times m c squared. But wait, the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, so I need to find gamma first.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. v is 0.96c. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2 which is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Hmm, wait, 1/0.28 is the same as 100/28 ≈3.5714. Yeah, that's right.

Wait a second, but wait. Let me check that calculation again. So 0.96 squared is 0.96 * 0.96. 96*96=9216, so 0.9216. Subtract that from 1, 1 - 0.9216=0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Now, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c². Same for neutrons, approximately the same mass as protons, around 939 MeV/c². Let me remember the exact values: protons are about 938.272 MeV, neutrons around 939.565 MeV. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the total rest mass energy would be (3 * proton mass) + (3 * neutron mass). Let's compute that. 3 * 938.272 = let's see, 3 * 900 is 2700, 3*38.272 is 114.816. So 2700 + 11
