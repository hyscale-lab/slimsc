Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is about 3 degrees Celsius. So B is likely a solid at room temperature.

Another part says that when a certain keto acid reacts with Substance X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Also, X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

So, the question is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. If there are multiple instances, sum all heavier and lighter isotopes. The options are numbers, so I think it's summing two atomic masses.

Hmm. Let's break it down.

First, I think about what Substance X could be. Since it reacts violently with a liquid (Y) and produces a gas, and considering that X is used in organic chemistry as a reagent, perhaps X is a strong base like NaH or something similar. Wait, another possibility is that X is a metal like sodium, which can react with water or another liquid. But if Y is liquid, maybe it's water, but then the reaction with sodium would be violent, producing H2 gas. But the gas is W, with equal protons and neutrons in its molecule. Let's check what that could be.

If W is a molecule with same number of neutrons and protons, possible options are H2 (each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, but that's not equal). Or maybe another diatomic gas. Wait, let's think about other possibilities. For a molecule, each atom in it should have same number of p and n? Or the molecule as a whole has same number of p and n.

Wait, the question says the molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. So for example, like O2: each O has 8 p and 8 n. So O2 would have 16 p and 16 n, so same. That's a possibility. Or maybe something else.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is CO2? No, because CO
