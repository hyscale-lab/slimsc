Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit unusual. I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime. But here, it's given in terms of x and y coordinates, which makes me think it's in 2D, maybe a 2-dimensional spacetime.

Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But how does that relate to the metric? I think the metric's form can tell us about the curvature. Let me recall: in 2D, the metric can be written in different forms, and the presence of a function multiplying the flat metric (dx² + dy²) often indicates curvature.

So, the given metric is conformally flat because it's just a scalar function times the flat metric. The scalar here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Conformal metrics are easier to analyze for curvature because the Gaussian curvature can be found from the conformal factor.

I remember there's a formula for the Gaussian curvature K of a conformal metric. The formula is something like K = - (1/(2f)) * Laplacian of ln(f), where f is the conformal factor. Or maybe it's the other way around; I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh
