Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it carefully and think through each piece of information given.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different formulas, all with six carbons, varying in hydrogens and oxygen counts.

First, let's go through the FTIR data. It says there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in the IR around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So that suggests the compound has either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid group. But wait, the presence of a broad peak could also be from an -OH group in something like a ketone or maybe an ether, but those usually aren't that broad. Or maybe an alcohol. So the compound probably has an -OH group.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl. Wait, 1650 is around where conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl could absorb. For example, in a conjugated ester or something like that. Alternatively, it might be an aromatic ring with a substituent, like an aromatic carbonyl or maybe an amide, but there's no mention of NMR peaks for amines, so maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Oh, wait, the NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. So that suggests the compound has a double bond, like a vinyl group.

So combining FTIR: O-H (3000, broad) and two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one carbonyl and another functional group. Wait, two strong peaks: 1700 and 1650. So maybe two different carbonyl groups. Or perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is something else. Wait, 1650 could be an aromatic ring's stretching, like C=C in an aromatic ring. But the presence of peaks for vinyl hydrogens in NMR suggests a double bond, possibly isolated or conjugated.

Wait, but if there's a carbonyl at 1700 and another peak at 1650, maybe it's an ester (since esters have strong carbonyl peaks around 1700) and maybe another group. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring. Let me think.

Looking at the NMR data: several peaks including those for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are typically in the range of δ 4.5-7 ppm, but depending on substitution. So the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests the compound has a double bond, perhaps as part of a ring or as a substituent.

Now, the mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let's think about possible fragments. For example, the methyl group (15) and something else? Or maybe a carbonyl group. Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is 45 (15*3=45? Wait, no: CH3-O-CH3 is  (12 + 1*3)*2 + 16 = (15*2)+16=30+16=46... no, that's 46. Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2CHOH? No, wait, 45 is C2H5O? Wait, 45 is 29 (C2H5+) plus 16? No, wait, 45 is 16 + 29? 16 is O, 29 is C2H5+. So 29 is (12*2 +5*1)=24+5=29. So 29 (C2H5) plus 16 (O) makes 45. So a fragment of C2H5O-.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene or something else, but more likely, the fragment is an ethoxy group or something similar. Alternatively, another possibility: the base peak at 45 could be a CH3CO+ ion, which would be 43 (12*2 +3*1 +16=43?), no wait, CH3CO+ is (12*2)+(1*3)+16=24+3+16=43, that's m/z=43. So that's not fitting. Alternatively, maybe 45 is the tropylium ion (C7H7+) but that's 91. Hmm, maybe I'm going down the wrong path here.

Let me think about each step.

First, the FTIR. Broad peak ~3000: -OH group. So the compound is either an alcohol or possibly a carboxylic acid, but the presence of another carbonyl might rule out the acid (since they usually have a very strong, broad peak around 2500-3300 for the -OH stretch, but that's similar to an alcohol. Hmm, but the question says a broad peak at 3000; that could be either. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with an -OH group? Not sure.

The two strong peaks: 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a carbonyl. 1650 could be an aromatic C=C stretch (around 1600-1680). So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring. But wait, the options given don't have benzene rings. Wait, the options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So six carbons, but how many rings or double bonds?

Wait, another possibility. 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So the compound has a double bond next to a carbonyl, that would cause the carbonyl peak to be around 1700 and the conjugated double bond to absorb around 1650. So maybe the structure has something like an enone (conjugated enol).

So combining all that, the compound has an -OH group, a carbonyl, and a conjugated double bond (so a vinyl group). So perhaps the structure is something like an allyl alcohol with a ketone or ester group.

Wait, but let's look at the options again. The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So the degrees of unsaturation can help. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H -X +N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen here.

For each option:

A) C6H12O2: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=2/2=1.

So one degree of unsaturation: could be one ring or one double bond or one triple bond.

But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So the compound must have at least one double bond. So for option A, DoU is 1, which could be a ring or a double bond. Since there's a double bond (vinyl H), that would fit.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU: (14 -10)/2=4/2=2. Two degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU: (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond.

Option D: C6H12O.

DoU: (14-12)/2=1. So again, one double bond or ring.

But the NMR has vinyl H, so we need at least one double bond. So all options except perhaps those with only single bonds (but all options have either one or two DoU, which would include at least one double bond or ring).

Now, the IR suggests a carbonyl (1700) and an aromatic ring (1650?), but wait, I'm not so sure. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl.

Let me think about possible structures.

If the compound has an ester group (which would have a carbonyl around 1700), an -OH group, and a double bond (vinyl), then perhaps it's a vinyl ester with an alcohol group.

But looking at the options, which ones have O2? Options A and C have two oxygen atoms.

Wait, the FTIR shows two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650. If the compound has two carbonyl groups, that would require two O's. But how?

Wait, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl and something else. Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 is an O-H bend from the alcohol. Wait, no, O-H bend (stretching is around 3000, bending is around 1500-1200). So the 1650 is probably a C=C or C=O.

Wait, another thought: if the compound has a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, then the carbonyl would be around 1700, and the conjugated double bond (C=C) would be around 1650. So that fits.

So the structure would have something like CH2=CHCOOR, where R is an alcohol group? Or perhaps the ester is part of a ring. Hmm.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are on a double bond. So if the structure has a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl (like an enone), then the NMR would show those vinyl protons.

Now, looking at the options, which have the right number of oxygens.

Option A: C6H12O2. That would be something like an ester (O2) and perhaps an alcohol? Or maybe a ketone and an ester? But the molecular formula would have to fit.

Alternatively, the compound could be a diethyl acetal or something else, but perhaps more likely, it's an ester with an alcohol group.

Wait, but the option has varying H counts. So for example, if the structure has a conjugated enol ester, perhaps the formula would have fewer hydrogens because of the double bonds.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z=45. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could be (CH3)2CHO+? No, that's 12*3 + 1*5 +16= 36+5+16=57. No.

Wait, wait, 45 is the molecular weight of methyl isocyanate? No, that's 59. Alternatively, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O which is 45. So perhaps the fragment is an ethoxy group, (CH2CH3O)+ but that would be 45? Let me calculate: C2H5O+ would be (12*2)+(5)+(16) =24+5+16=45. Yes. So that would be a fragment where an ethoxy group is lost or something. So perhaps the compound has an ethoxy group.

Wait, but looking back, the options don't have ethoxy groups necessarily. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester, so when fragmented, the ester group breaks, producing a carbonyl and an alkyl group. For example, an ester RCOOR' would break into RCO+ and R'O-. Wait, but RCO+ would have a higher mass. Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks at the carbonyl, leading to a fragment with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, thinking about the options, perhaps the molecular formula can help.

Option C is C6H10O2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: (6*12) + (10*1) + (2*16) =72 +10 +32=114. So the molecular ion would be at m/z=114.

In the mass spectrum, fragment peaks are at lower masses. So the fragment at 45 would be from a part of the molecule. So possible that the molecule has an ethoxy group (C2H5O) which would contribute 45, as discussed earlier.

Wait, but in the options, which ones have O2? Options A and C.

So if the fragment is from an ethoxy group, then the parent molecule must have an ethoxy group. So option A is C6H12O2. So maybe formula is something like ethyl propionate, but with an additional oxygen. Wait, perhaps an ester with an additional hydroxyl group or something else.

Alternatively, the fragment at 45 could be a ketone group. Let me think: 45 could be (CH3)2CO+ (acetone ion). Acetone has a molecular weight of 58, but when fragmented, perhaps it breaks into a smaller ion. Wait, no, the acetone ion would be 58, not 45.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track. Let me think again.

Another possibility: the compound contains an ester group. Ester groups usually have a carbonyl (1700 cm⁻¹) and an ethoxy group. If the molecule breaks after the ester oxygen, the ethoxy group would carry a charge as (C2H5O)+ with m/z=45.

So if the parent formula is C6H10O2, that's option C. Let's see: C6H10O2 has a molecular weight of 6*12 +10 +32=72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion is at 114.

If the molecule is, say, methyl vinyl benzoate (but wait, that's more carbons?), or perhaps something like methyl propenoate. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but that might not have the ethoxy fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an ester with an ethyl group. For instance, ethyl something. So the ester group would be O-CO-O, but wait, no, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if R is ethyl, then the ethoxy part would be in the fragment.

Wait, but let's think about the molecular formula for option C: C6H10O2. That could be an ester with formula R-O-CO-R', where the total carbons are 6.

For example, methyl propionate is CH3COOCH2CH3, which is C3H6O2. So for 6 carbons, perhaps something like ethyl something. Let's see: if R is ethyl (2 carbons) and R' is another 3, like CH2CH2COO... wait, maybe ethyl butyrate is CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. Let me count: ethyl butyrate is CH2CH2COOCH2CH3? Wait, but that's 2 (ethyl) +3 (butyryl) =5 carbons, so that's not 6. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with a vinyl group. So, for example, ethyl acrylate: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. That would have 6 carbons. So the formula would be C6H10O2. Let's count: acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- (3 carbons), ethyl is 2, so total 5? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-: 3 carbons (CH2, CH, COO). So ethyl acrylate would be 3 (from acrylate) + 2 (ethyl) =5 carbons, not 6. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe it's a cyclic ester, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: looking at the degrees of unsaturation for each option.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2.

So two degrees of unsaturation: could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc.

If the structure has a ring and a double bond, that would fit with the vinyl H in NMR.

IR shows a carbonyl and maybe another double bond.

So putting it together, the structure could have a ring (like cyclohexane) with a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a double bond (vinyl group). But wait, the IR shows two carbonyl peaks. Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Wait, another angle: the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, so O-H. Then, the 1700 is a carbonyl, perhaps ester or ketone. The 1650 could be a conjugated double bond.

So perhaps the structure is an allyl alcohol ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. But let's check the formula: that would be 7 carbons. Hmm, but our options are 6 carbons.

Wait, another possibility: it's an orthoester or something else. Alternatively, the structure could be a cyclic hemiacetal or something.

Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, methyl acrylate: CH2=CHCOOCH3. That's 5 carbons. So to get 6 carbons, maybe it's ethyl something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the formula is C6H10O2. So, with two oxygen atoms. The O-H (from the broad peak) and a carbonyl (ester or ketone). Then, the DoU is 2: perhaps one from a double bond and another from a ring.

So, let me think of a structure with a ring, a double bond, and an O-H group. Maybe a cyclohexene ring with an ester group and an alcohol. But that seems a bit complicated.

Wait, another approach: looking at the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z=45 could be a common fragment. Another possibility is a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, 45 is 12*3 + 1*3 + 16 = 36+3+16=55? No. Hmm, maybe it's a CH2O group (30) plus something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a ketone. For example, the (CH3)2CO+ ion is 58, which is higher than 45. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a smaller molecule, like an ethylene fragment. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the parent molecule has a methyl group that breaks off, but that's usually a lower mass.

Wait, another thought: 45 could be the molecular ion of a smaller molecule, like CH3CH2OH (ethanol, which is 46). No, that's 46. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's the loss of a fragment. For instance, if the parent molecule loses an ethyl group (C2H5), which has a molecular weight of 29. So if the parent is at 114 (option C), 114-29=85. But the question says the fragment is at 45, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule undergoes cleavage to form a smaller ion. For example, if the ester group breaks, the ethoxy part could be a fragment. So if the parent is an ethyl ester, the ethoxy (C2H5O+) would have mass 45.

So, option C: C6H10O2. If the structure is an ethyl ester with a double bond and an O-H group, that might fit.

Wait, let me try to imagine the structure. Suppose it's an ester like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's count the carbons: CH2=CHCH2 is 3, COO is 2, CH2CH3 is 2. Wait, that adds up to 3+2+2=7 carbons. Hmm, but our options are six.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH3, but that doesn't have a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a diester? Not sure.

Another idea: let's consider the molecular formula. Option C is C6H10O2. The possible structure could be ethyl vinyl carbonate? Or perhaps more likely, a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond and an O-H group. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is an orthoester, but I'm not familiar enough with that.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that the compound has a CH2=CH group. So the structure has at least one double bond.

The IR has a carbonyl at 1700, so likely an ester or ketone. But what about the 1650 peak?

If the compound is an ester with a conjugated double bond, the conjugation would lower the carbonyl peak to around 1700, and the double bond would have a peak around 1650. So that fits.

So the structure would have an ester group (O-CO-O), a conjugated double bond, and an -OH group.

Wait, but how to fit all that into the molecular formula.

Let me consider option C: C6H10O2.

If the structure is something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2OH. Wait, no, that doesn't have the double bond.

Alternatively, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. That would be 6 carbons: CH2=CH (2), COO (2), CH2CH2OH (2). Wait, that's 2+2+2=6. Hmm. But that would be 6 carbons. Let me check the formula.

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH: the formula would be:

CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2, CH2CH2OH is C2H5O. So the total is C5H9O3. Wait, that doesn't match any option. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Maybe the structure is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structures for each option and see which fits.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Degrees of Unsaturation: 1.

So either one ring or one double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond is present. So that would account for the DoU. So the structure could have a double bond and an ester group.

But the IR has two carbonyl peaks, which suggests two carbonyl groups. So maybe it's not possible with option A, which has O2.

Wait, no. If it's a cyclic ester (lactone), it would have one O. So perhaps option A is not the case.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester with an additional carbonyl group, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a ketone and an ester, but with O2. That would fit option A and C.

Wait, but option A has O2 and a formula of C6H12O2. If the structure is a diester, like a compound with two ester groups, but that would require more oxygens. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something else.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to summarize the clues again:

- FTIR: broad peak ~3000 (O-H), strong at 1700 (carbonyl), strong at 1650 (~C=C or conjugated carbonyl).
- 1H NMR: has vinyl H, so a double bond.
- Mass spec: fragment at 45, which is likely C2H5O+ (ethoxy group).

Putting it together: the compound is an ester (since 1700 is a good ester carbonyl) with an ethoxy group (since fragment is 45). Also, it has an -OH group (from the broad peak). Additionally, a conjugated double bond (so the 1650 peak is the conjugated C=C).

So the structure would be an ethyl ester with a conjugated double bond and an -OH group.

Let's try to imagine the structure. Perhaps something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. Wait, that would be C6H10O3, not matching any option. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with an allyl group. For example, allyl acetate: CH2=CHCH2OAc. Wait, Ac is OAc, so that's CH3COOCH2CH=CH2. Formula: C5H8O2. Not matching any option.

Wait, the options are all C6, so maybe a longer chain.

Alternatively, a cyclopentene ring with an ester group and an OH. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, considering the molecular formula of option C: C6H10O2.

If the structure is an ester with a double bond and an -OH group, perhaps like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2OH, but that's 6 carbons but not sure about the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an allyl ester with a hydroxyl group. For example, CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Wait, that would be 7 carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a vinyl ester with an additional hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's an allyl ester with an OH group. Let me count: CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That's 3 (allyl) + 3 (ester) =6? No, allyl is 3, ester is (COO CH2CH3) which is 4, so total is 3+4=7. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is cyclohexene with an ester substituent and an OH group.

This is getting a bit too vague. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Option C is C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So two rings, or one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

If it's an ester with a double bond and an O-H group, that would require at least one ring or another double bond.

Wait, but the compound has an O-H (broad peak), a carbonyl (ester), and a vinyl group (double bond). So that's one DoU for the double bond, and another for the ester? Hmm, no. Ester has a double bond in the carbonyl. So each carbonyl is one DoU.

Wait, perhaps the FTIR peaks at 1700 and 1650 are both carbonyl groups. But that would require two carbonyl groups and two oxygens. So the formula would need O2, which fits options A and C.

Wait, but two carbonyl groups would imply two DoU. So the total DoU would be 2. So looking at the options, which ones have two DoU?

Option C: DoU=2.

Option B: DoU=2.

Wait, let me recalculate.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU= (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU= (14-10)/2=2.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU= (14-10)/2=2.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU= (14-12)/2=1.

So options B and C have two DoU.

If the FTIR shows two carbonyl peaks, that suggests two carbonyl groups, which would require two DoU. So the correct option must have two DoU, which are options B and C.

Wait, but what about the O-H? Option B is C6H10O. So O is present as an alcohol. So the compound has an O-H group and two carbonyl groups? No, because that would require three oxygens. Or perhaps, wait, no, in option B, O is present as an alcohol.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me re-express.

If the compound has two carbonyl groups, then it would have two DoU, but each carbonyl is one DoU. So the total DoU would be two (for two carbonyls) plus any rings or other double bonds.

Wait, but each carbonyl (C=O) is one DoU. So two carbonyl groups would account for two DoU. So the compound would have two carbonyls, plus maybe a double bond or ring.

But then the DoU would be higher than two.

Alternatively, perhaps the two IR peaks are from two different carbonyl groups. For example, one ketone and one ester.

Wait, but in that case, the compound would have O from both groups. So for two carbonyls (like a ketone and an ester), the formula would need to have O2. So that would fit option C (C6H10O2) and A (C6H12O2).

Wait, but in option B, O is only one, which can't support two carbonyl groups (since each would need an O). So options A and C are possible.

But looking back, the FTIR has two strong peaks in the carbonyl region. So two carbonyls. So the formula must have O2 (since each carbonyl requires an O). So options A and C have O2.

So the options are A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2).

Now, between these two, which fits the NMR and mass spec.

The NMR has vinyl H's. So the structure must have a double bond. Mass spec shows a fragment at 45, likely an ethoxy group (C2H5O+).

If the structure is an ester, it would have the ethoxy group. So let's say the parent molecule is an ethyl ester. So, for example, an ethyl ester with a conjugated double bond and a hydroxyl group.

So the formula would be R-O-CO-R', where R is ethyl (C2H5O-) and R' is something with a double bond and an -OH group.

What would that look like? Let's say R' is CH2=CHCH2OH. Then the ester would be CH2=CHCH2O-CO-OCH2CH3. Wait, no, that's a carbonate, not an ester.

Wait, no. Esters are R-O-CO-R'. So R is ethyl, R' is CH2=CHCH2OH. Then the formula would be C2H5O-CO-O-CH2=CHCH2OH. Wait, that's a bit complicated, but let's count the carbons: R is 2 carbons (ethyl), R' is 3 carbons (CH2=CHCH2OH). So total is 2 +3 =5, plus the COO, which is 2. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, perhaps R' is a three-carbon group with a double bond and an -OH. For example, R' is CH2=CHCOOH, but that's a carboxylic acid, which would have a different IR.

Wait, perhaps R' is CH2=CHCH2-OH, making the ester ethyl (CH2=CHCH2O)COOEt.

Wait, let's count the carbons:

COOEt is 2 carbons (OEt is ethyl, 2 carbons). The R' is CH2=CHCH2OH, which is 3 carbons. So in total, the ester would be (CH2=CHCH2O)COOEt. Wait, no, that's incorrect. The ester structure is R-O-CO-R'. So R is ethyl, R' is CH2=CHCH2OH.

So the formula would be C2H5O-CO-O-CH2=CHCH2OH. Wait, but that's getting too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an allyl ester with an additional hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is methyl acrylate with an additional hydroxyl group. But that would change the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond and an -OH group. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester linkage and a double bond nearby.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the mass spectrum again. If the fragment at 45 is an ethoxy group, then the parent molecule must have an ethoxy group. So the formula must include an ethoxy group (C2H5O). So the parent molecule must have this as part of its structure.

So looking at the options, let's see which include an ethoxy group.

Option C: C6H10O2. Suppose it's an ester like ethyl something. The ethyl group contributes 2 carbons and 5 H. The rest would be 4 carbons and 5 H (since total H is 10). Wait, perhaps the structure is ethyl propionate, but that's C3H6O2. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a longer chain. Wait, but let me calculate for option C: C6H10O2.

If it's an ethyl ester, then the R' part is C4H9O. Wait, because the ester is R-O-CO-R', so R is ethyl (2 carbons), R' is C4H9O? Wait, no, R' would be the acid part, which would contribute the carbons. Let me think: for ethyl R'COOEt, the formula would be Cn+2 H2n+3 O2.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the molecular formula.

Suppose the ester is RCOOEt (ethyl ester). Then the formula would be RCOOEt = (R)COO(C2H5). So RCOO(C2H5) = RCOOEt.

The formula of RCOOEt is (R is CxHyOz) plus C3H5O2.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the entire formula.

The molecular formula is C6H10O2. An ethyl ester would have the formula RCOOEt, where R is C4H9O. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because RCOOEt would be (R = C4H9O) would give C5H11O2, which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a ring. Maybe a cyclic ester, a lactone. But lactones would have fewer oxygens.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a diester. Hmm, but that would require more oxygen.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is an ester plus a vinyl group and an -OH group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. Let me count the carbons: CH2=CHCOO is 3 carbons, CH2CH2OH is 2, so total 5. But our options are 6. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2OH. That's 3 (CH2CH2COO) +3 (CH2CH2CH2OH) =6. But that's a glycol ester, perhaps.

Wait, but the formula would be C6H12O3, which doesn't match any options. So that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with a vinyl group and a hydroxyl group attached.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That would be C6H10O2. Let's check:

CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3:

- CH2=CHCH2: 3 carbons
- COO: 2 carbons
- CH2CH3: 2 carbons
Total: 3+2+2=7? No, that's 7 carbons. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me recount:

The structure is ethyl acrylate: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. That's 3 (acrylate) + 2 (ethyl) =5 carbons. So that's C5H8O2.

But our options are C6H10O2. So that's one carbon more.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is methyl vinyl benzoate, but that would have more than six carbons.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene with an ester and an -OH group. For example, a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent and an -OH group. But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Wait, another angle: the fragment in the mass spectrum is at m/z=45, which is likely (CH2CH3O)+. So the parent molecule must have an ethyl group attached to an oxygen. So the structure must have an ethoxy group.

Thus, looking at the options, which include O2, it's option A (C6H12O2) and option C (C6H10O2).

If the structure is an ethyl ester, then the formula would include the ethoxy group. Let me think about option C: C6H10O2. If the structure is an ethyl ester with a (CH2=CHCOO) group, then the formula would be:

Ethyl ester: C2H5-O-CO-R.

If R is CH2=CHCH2-, then the formula would be C2H5-O-CO-CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, but that would make the R group as 3 carbons. So the ethyl ester part is C2H5-O-CO (2 carbons), and R is 3 carbons (CH2=CHCH2). So total carbons: 2 (ester) +3 (R) =5. But the formula is C6, so perhaps the R is longer.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. Let me count:

CH2=CHCOO: 3 carbons

CH2CH2OH: 2 carbons

Total: 5. No, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is an ester with a vinyl group and a hydroxyl group, but it's not clear.

Given the time I've spent and the information, perhaps it's better to make an educated guess.

The IR indicates two carbonyl groups (since two strong peaks), which suggests O2. So options A and C.

The mass spec indicates an ethoxy fragment (45), so the parent must have an ethoxy group. So ethyl ester.

Thus, the formula would be an ethyl ester (C2H5O) plus another group.

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's an ethyl ester, the rest would be C4H11O. That doesn't seem to fit a structure with a double bond and an -OH.

Option C: C6H10O2. If it's an ethyl ester, the remaining would be C4H9O. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is ethyl propionate with a double bond and an OH group. But that would have more oxygens.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester plus an alcohol group.

Wait, maybe it's a hemiacetal ester, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diethyl ester with a ring.

This is taking too long, and I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to make a decision.

Considering that the IR has two carbonyl peaks, the compound must have two carbonyl groups, which would require two oxygens. So options A and C.

The presence of a vinyl group (from NMR) suggests a double bond, which is one DoU. The two carbonyls are two DoU, so total DoU would be three, but that doesn't make sense because options A and C have DoU of 1 and 2, respectively.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me recount:

Each carbonyl is one DoU. So two carbonyls = two DoU.

The vinyl group (double bond) is another DoU. So total DoU would be three. But none of the options have three DoU.

Ah, that's a problem. So perhaps my initial assumption that there are two carbonyls is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the two IR peaks are not both carbonyls. Maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring.

So the 1700 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl, and 1650 is an aromatic ring (C=C stretch).

In that case, the compound has a carbonyl (like an ester or ketone), an aromatic ring, and an -OH group.

But then the NMR shows vinyl protons, which would be on a double bond, perhaps in the aromatic ring.

Wait, but the options don't include benzene rings, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, the 1650 peak is a conjugated carbonyl, not an aromatic ring.

So perhaps the structure has a conjugated double bond next to a carbonyl (enone structure). So the 1700 is the carbonyl, 1650 is the conjugated double bond.

In that case, the structure has one carbonyl (one DoU), and the conjugated double bond (another DoU). Plus, the O-H group.

So total DoU would be two (from carbonyl and double bond), which matches options B and C.

But the IR shows two strong peaks in the carbonyl region, which is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 is an overtone or a bending vibration, but that's less likely.

Given all this, perhaps the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2.

Because:

- It has two oxygens, which could account for the O-H and a carbonyl group.

- The DoU is two, which could be a carbonyl and a double bond.

- The mass spectrum shows a fragment of 45, likely from an ethoxy group, which would fit an ester.

So I think the answer is option C.


The unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The following observations and deductions were made:

1. **FTIR Analysis**:
   - A broad absorption peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol.
   - Two strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated double bond or an aromatic ring. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is consistent with a carbonyl group, while the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could correspond to a conjugated double bond (C=C).

2. **¹H NMR Analysis**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond in the structure.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is observed. This is consistent with a C₂H₅O⁺ ion, suggesting the presence of an ethoxy group in the compound.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1. This could correspond to a single ring or double bond. However, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR and two strong IR peaks suggest the need for at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the carbonyl and one for the double bond). Thus, this option is unlikely.
   - **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 2. This could correspond to a combination of a ring and a double bond. However, the presence of two strong IR peaks in the carbonyl region suggests the need for two oxygen atoms, which this option lacks. Thus, this option is also unlikely.
   - **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 2. This could correspond to a carbonyl group and a double bond. The two oxygen atoms align with the IR peaks (one for the carbonyl and one for the O-H group). Additionally, the mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45 is consistent with an ethoxy group, which fits an ester structure. This option is the most plausible.
   - **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1. Similar to Option A, this does not account for the two strong IR peaks or the need for two degrees of unsaturation. Thus, this option is unlikely.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The compound must have two oxygen atoms to account for the O-H group and the carbonyl group. The presence of a conjugated double bond aligns with the IR and NMR data. The mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45 further supports the presence of an ethoxy group, consistent with an ester structure. Therefore, the most likely chemical formula is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.
