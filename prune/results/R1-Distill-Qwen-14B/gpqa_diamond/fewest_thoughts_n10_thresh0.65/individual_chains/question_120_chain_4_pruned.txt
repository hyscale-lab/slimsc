Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about stars' distribution in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm. Let me think step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that the distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax, so d = 1 / plx. Oh right, so as plx increases, the distance decreases because you can only measure the parallax accurately for closer stars.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So it's about the density of stars in terms of parallax. The options have different dependencies on plx: 1/plx^4, 1/plx^2, 1/plx, and 1/plx^3.

Wait, I think this relates to how the volume of space changes with distance. Because stars are spread out in space, the number of stars you can observe depends on the volume of the sphere with radius d (distance). The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πd³. So if I'm considering a thin shell between d and d+Δd, the volume would be approximately 4πd²Δd. Oh, wait, because the derivative of (4/3)πd³ is 4πd². So the volume per unit distance (Δd) increases with the square of the distance.

But wait, how does this tie into parallax? Since d = 1/plx, then as plx increases, d decreases. So I can express everything in terms of plx.

Let me think about the number of stars in a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dd. The volume of that shell is 4πd²dd. So the number of stars in that shell depends on the volume. But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So I need to find how many stars are there per unit change in parallax (like per 0.1 parsecs of plx).

Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because plx is in the denominator, so when plx increases, d decreases. But the exact sign might not matter here since we're dealing with absolute changes in counts.

So the number
