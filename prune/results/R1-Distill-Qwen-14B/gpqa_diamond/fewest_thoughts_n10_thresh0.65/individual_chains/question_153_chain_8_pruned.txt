Okay, so I've got this Michael addition problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has three different reactions, each labeled A, B, and C. I need to find the major products for each and match them with the options provided. The options are A, B, C, and D, each giving possible products for (A), (B), and (C).

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate under NaOEt and EtOH conditions. From what I remember, the Michael addition involves a nucleophile (enolate) attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

So, dimethyl malonate has two ester groups and can form an enolate. The enolate would be the nucleophile here. The other reactant is an acrylate, which is the Michael acceptor because it has the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

In the Michael reaction, the enolate attacks the beta position of the acceptor. But wait, since the acrylate is E, the geometry would have the substituents on opposite sides. The p-tolyl group is on the beta carbon. When the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) attacks, it should add to the beta carbon.

Wait, but wait. Dimethyl malonate is a good enolate source because it's a diester, so when deprotonated, it becomes a strong base, right? Deprotonation occurs at the alpha position, making the enolate, which attacks the beta position of the acrylate.

So the acrylate is CH2=CH(C6H4-4Me)-CO2Me, and the enolate from dimethyl malonate would be CH2(COOEt)2- attacking the CH2 part. The addition would lead to a new carbon-carbon bond between the alpha of malonate and the beta of the acrylate.

Wait, no, actually, in Michael addition, the enolate (from a donor) attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. So, the malonate enolate (which is a strong base) would attack the acceptor's beta position. Once the attack happens,
