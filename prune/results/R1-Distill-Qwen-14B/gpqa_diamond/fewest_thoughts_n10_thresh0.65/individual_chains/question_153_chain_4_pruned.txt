Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reaction, and honestly, I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about Michael additions.

From what I remember, the Michael reaction is a 1,4-conjugate addition where a nucleophile (like an enolate) attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The result is a new carbon-carbon bond, adding across those conjugated positions.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition. I need to find out the major products for each and match them with the options given.

Starting with part A: Reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH as the conditions. NaOEt is a strong base, so I think it deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. The enolate will then attack the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, wait. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form a strong enolate. The acrylate is the Michael acceptor. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is a dienolate, but in this case, maybe it's just the one at the alpha position) will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3, but wait, no: the formula is CH2=C-O... Hmm, maybe it's CH2=C(O2CMe2)-OCH3? Or wait, no, methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3, but wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but in this case, the substituent is at the 3 position. So structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, numbering: for acrylate, it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is on the third carbon. Wait, but acrylate is three carbons: CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So the substituent is on the middle carbon.

Wait, maybe (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? Or is it CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Hmm, I'm a bit mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)prop-2-enoate, which would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but with the (E) configuration. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, with the p-tolyl group on C2 and the ester on C3.

So when the enolate of
