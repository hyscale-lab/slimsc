Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O. I need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

First, looking at the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak is typical for alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 peak is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 could be another carbonyl group, perhaps conjugated or another type like a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with some substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated ester or maybe a conjugated ketone. Wait, or maybe the 1650 is a C=C stretch? Because vinyl groups have C=C around 1650-1600 cm⁻¹. So, the FTIR suggests possible carbonyl groups and possibly some sort of conjugated system.

Now, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are typically the protons on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond somewhere. Also, the presence of multiple peaks indicates perhaps a substituted alkene, maybe with different types of protons (like trans or cis, or different substituents).

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. Let me think about what fragment would give m/z 45. Wait, 45 is (CH2O) or maybe (CH3O- something). Or, wait, 45 is the mass of a methyl group attached to something else? Let me calculate: 45 could be (CH3)2O? Wait, (CH3)2O would be 31 + 16 = 47? No, wait. Let me think again. The molecular ion might break into smaller fragments. Alternatively, perhaps a common fragment is a ketene or something else. Wait, another angle: 45 is equal to (CH2O) which is 12 + 2 + 16 = 30? No, 45 is 45. Oh, wait, the molecular formula for methoxy group is OCH3 (31?), but 45 is higher than that. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like (CH2)2O, which would be 44, but that's not 45. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH3CO+ ion, which would be (CH3CO) has a mass of 59 (12*2 + 1*4 + 16 = 59? No, 12*2=24,
