Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

So the problem says we've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing because usually stability constants increase with the formation of more stable complexes, but here β3 is higher than β2 and β4 is lower. Maybe the order of the complexes isn't strictly by stability?

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. I think blue refers to the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is usually the one with two SCN- ligands. Oh wait, but wait, which complex is which? I remember that the [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) complexes have different colors. For example, [Co(SCN)]^+ is pink, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is blue, [Co(SCN)_3]^0 is green, and [Co(SCN)_4]^4− is maybe another color. So the blue one is the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}.

So they want the percentage of that specific complex. To find that, I think I need to calculate the fraction of Co(II) that is in the form [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}.

Stability constants, β, are for the formation of the complexes. So each β_n is the formation constant for the nth complex. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^0, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{4-}.

Wait, stability constant β is typically expressed as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. For example, for the second complex, β2 would be:

Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN
