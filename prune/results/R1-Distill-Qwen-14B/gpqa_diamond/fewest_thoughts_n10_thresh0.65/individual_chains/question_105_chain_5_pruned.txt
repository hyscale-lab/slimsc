Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how it would mimic an exoplanet's effect on the light curve. Interesting.

Alright, the star has the same radius as the Sun, right? So R_star is about the same as our Sun. The effective temperature is 6000K, which is a bit hotter than our Sun actually (since the Sun is around 5778K). But that's maybe a minor detail for now.

The star has one hemisphere covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor, I think that refers to the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So 20% coverage, meaning 0.2 of the hemisphere's area is spots. But wait, since it's one hemisphere, the total area covered by spots would be 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere. Hmm, but perhaps that's not directly needed yet.

The spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. Oh, so the spots are cooler, I suppose. Because dark spots on a star are usually cooler regions. The star's Teff is 6000K, so the spots must be at 5000K? Because 6000 minus 1000 is 5000. Or wait, maybe the spots are hotter? No, no, because dark spots are cooler. Like sunspots on our Sun are cooler. So spot temperature is 5000K.

The key point is that when the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view, causing variations in the observed brightness. The problem states that this situation can resemble an exoplanet's transit effect. So the brightness dip when the planet transits in front of the star. But in this case, it's the spots modulating the brightness as the star rotates.

Now, the question is, to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as a hypothetical exoplanet, what would be the planet's radius relative to the star's radius?

Wait, the star is not covered by spots in the other hemisphere, right? So only one hemisphere has these spots. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then goes away.

So the star's brightness varies because
