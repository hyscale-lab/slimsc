Okay, so I have a chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. We're given stability constants for different cobalt thiocyanato complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution.

Hmm, I think I remember that stability constants (formation constants) are used to determine the distribution of metal complexes in solution. The higher the stability constant, the more stable the complex is, so it should form more readily.

So, the complexes are probably Co(SCN)n^2- or something similar. The stability constants given are for different n values. Wait, the β values usually represent the formation constant for each step. Typically, β1 is for the first ligand binding, β2 for the second, etc. So for Co(SCN)^n, the overall formation constant for each step would be the product of the β's up to that point.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So that suggests that each β is the formation constant for adding each successive SCN- ligand. So Co^2+ can form [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)2]^0, [Co(SCN)3]^- , and [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

But wait, wait. The problem says "dithiocyanato cobalt(II)" complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^{0} perhaps, because Co^2+ with two SCN^- (each -1) would make zero charge. But I'm not entirely sure about the charge.

But the main point is, the problem is asking for the percentage of the Co with two SCN ligands. So we need to find the fraction of Co^2+ that is present as [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, but the solution also has free Co^2+
