Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows specific peaks, and there's an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent.

Hmm, okay, let me break this down reaction by reaction.

First Reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Heating with KOH usually suggests an elimination reaction, like dehydrohalogenation. Since 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons (since adamantane is a diamondoid structure), heating with KOH would likely lead to the formation of a double bond. So probably, the two bromides are eliminated, and an alkene is formed. Wait, no, wait: 1,3-dibromo on adamantane. Oh, but in adamantane, the structure is such that each carbon is bonded to three others in a diamond lattice. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines in positions that are not adjacent but maybe across a bridge. Hmm, not too sure, but the reaction with KOH is probably an elimination to form an alkene. 

Wait, but when you have two bromides on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. But in this case, are the bromines on adjacent carbons? Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead carbon is connected to two other bridgeheads. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two bridgeheads that are three carbons apart? Or perhaps on adjacent bridgeheads? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe when
