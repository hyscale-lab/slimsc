Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. All of them except one are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, and the answer should be correct to three decimal places.

Hmm, I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Since the charges are identical, they're likely either all positive or all negative. Regardless, the potential energy between them should be calculated based on their charges and distances.

Wait, so the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge. But wait, are those 12 charges all at the same point, or are they arranged in some other configuration?

Oh, I think the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 is at 2 m from P. But since they're identical charges, they'd tend to repel each other. But wait, the problem says they're constrained, so maybe they're all fixed on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m around P. So the 12 charges are arranged around point P, each 2 m away.

So the system consists of a
