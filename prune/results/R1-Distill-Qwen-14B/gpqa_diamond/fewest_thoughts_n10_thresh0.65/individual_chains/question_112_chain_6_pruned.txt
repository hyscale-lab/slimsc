Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The up and down are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so Sz, I think. The problem has two parts: first, find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of some operator A, and second, find the average value of that operator.

Wait, the operator A has a matrix representation where Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Oh right, so it's a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that out.

Matrix A would look like:
[ 0, (hbar/2) ]
[ (hbar/2), 0 ]

Because the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2.

Wait, but what's the operator A? It looks like it's the spin in the x-direction. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the spin operator Sx is (hbar/2) sigma_x, so yeah, A must be proportional to sigma_x. So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of Sx, which are |+x> and |-x> states.

So the problem reduces to finding the probabilities of the state |alpha> being in |+x> and |-x>, and then finding the expectation value of A, which is Sx in this case.

But first, let's normalize |alpha>. The state is given as proportional, so we need to find the normalization factor. Let me compute the coefficients.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2. Because |a|^2 + |b|^2 when the states are orthonormal.

Calculating |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2 (since |a+ib|² is a² + b²).

|2 - i|²: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So total norm squared is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the eigenstates of A (or Sx) are |+x> and |-x>, which can be written in terms of |up> and |down> as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, let me double-check that. The eigenstates for Sx are indeed superpositions. Let me write:

Sx = (hbar/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]

So the eigenvalues are ±hbar/2. The eigenvectors are:

For +hbar/2: (1,1)/sqrt(2
