Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The Doppler shift tells us about the movement of the star towards or away from us.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have planets detected. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so their masses are probably about the same. Wait, but the RV method measures the star's velocity, and the Doppler shift relates to that velocity. So the shift in the spectral lines depends on the star's velocity, which in turn depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period, I think.

Planet #1 has a spectral line shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 is 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, but the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, right? So the formula I recall is the velocity semi-amplitude K = (v) which is given by ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / ( (P) * (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think about a simplified version. Since both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets are similar to Neptune, which is much less massive than the Sun, so M_* >> M_p. So we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. Also, the planets are in circular orbits, so e=0. So the formula simplifies.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * c) )

Wait, maybe another approach. The RV method equation is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3)
