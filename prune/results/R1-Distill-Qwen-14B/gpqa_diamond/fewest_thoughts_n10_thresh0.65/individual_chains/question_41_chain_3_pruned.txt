Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. The setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Hmm, okay. So I'm a bit rusty on my relativity and optics, but I'll think. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, where n is the refractive index. So in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light would be 1/n. But since the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, but wait. The observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards them. So we're dealing with a situation where a medium is moving relative to the observer, and we need to find the speed of light in that medium as observed in the lab frame.

I think this is a problem involving the addition of velocities, but perhaps relativistic? Because if velocities are significant compared to the speed of light, we need to use special relativity. But wait, the options don't look like they're using relativistic formulasâ€”so maybe it's non-relativistic? Or perhaps it's just treating the velocities classically.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light is always c in vacuum regardless of the source's motion. But in this case, the light is inside a medium, so the speed is 1/n in the medium's rest frame. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Let me think. Suppose the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Wait, no, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is in the same direction as the beam and the glass's motion. So the light is moving towards the observer, same direction as the glass's velocity.

Wait, maybe I should model this using frames of reference. The glass's rest frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. In the glass's frame, the speed of light is 1/n. So to find the speed in the lab frame, I need to transform the velocity.

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add linear
