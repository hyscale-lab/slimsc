Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on how exactly their representation works in terms of geometry.

The question gives me a specific density matrix: ρ equals 1/2 times (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). So I need to find where this sits in the qubits space. The options are vectors in three dimensions, like (1,1,0) or (0,0,1), etc. But wait, I thought qubits are two-dimensional. Oh wait, maybe this refers to the Bloch sphere representation?

Wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states, right? But this is a mixed state because the density matrix is a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ states. Oh right, pure states have density matrices like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, which are rank 1. But here, ρ is a sum of two projectors, so it's a mixed state.

So, how do mixed states fit into the Bloch sphere picture? I think for mixed states, the density matrix can be represented as a point in the Bloch sphere, but maybe that's only for qubits. Wait, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit confused.

I remember that any density matrix for a single qubit can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ
