Okay, so I've got this question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that a density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So this ρ is a density matrix for a qubit.

Wait, I think I should first write out what this ρ looks like in matrix form. The basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ correspond to the standard computational basis vectors. So |0⟩ is [1, 0]^T and |1⟩ is [0, 1]^T. The outer products would be:

|0⟩⟨0| = [[1,0],[0,0]]
|1⟩⟨1| = [[0,0],[0,1]]

Adding those together gives [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then multiply by 1/2, so ρ becomes [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

But what's the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space? I remember that for qubits, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

Wait, the Bloch vector representation. Oh right! A single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, but I think I might have gotten that formula wrong. Let me think again. The density matrix for a qubit can be written as ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, where r_x, r_y, r_z are the components of the Bloch vector r.

Wait, no, maybe it's ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. That sounds familiar. So in that case, if I can express the given ρ in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices, then I can find the components of r.

Let me compute ρ. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So as a matrix, that's [[1/2, 0], [
