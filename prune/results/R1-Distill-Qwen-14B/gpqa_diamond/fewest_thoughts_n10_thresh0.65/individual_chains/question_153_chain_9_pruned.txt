Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about Michael additions. Hmm, I've studied a bit about this, but I need to think carefully. Let's take it step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them with the options given.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that in a Michael addition, a nucleophile (like an enolate) attacks an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the other compound, which is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Wait, let me draw their structures. 

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has a structure like CH2=CH-(p-tolyl), but wait, no. The formula: methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=C-(CH2-p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-p-tolyl attached to COOCH3? Or is it CH2=C-(something else). Hmm, maybe it's CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl) for the acrylate part. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-p-tolyl with a COOCH3 group. Wait, noâ€”probably it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group at the beta position. Wait, no, the name is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon. Wait, the structure would be CH2=CH-C-O-p
