Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, specifically about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through it.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator Ay is given as a 2x2 matrix, and it's equal to c times S, where c is h/(4π). The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, let me jot down what I know. The matrix S is given as:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π), so Ay is c multiplied by this matrix. So first, let me write out Ay.

Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So, the matrix Ay - aI would be:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0 - a      (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i             (h/(4π))*0 - a ]

Which simplifies to:

[ -a       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ] = a^2 - [ (i * -i) * (h^2)/(16π²) ) ]

Wait, i times -i is -(i²) = -(-1) = 1. So, the determinant is a^2 - (1 * h²)/(16 π²) ) = 0.

So equation: a² = (h²)/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, I don't immediately see this. Let me check the options.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, but my eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts are zero. That can't be right. So option A is wrong.

Option B says imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. That also doesn't make sense because our eigenvalues are purely real, right? Because the matrix Ay is hermitian? Wait, is it? Let me think. The matrix S is an anti-hermitian matrix maybe? Because S^dagger would be [0, i; -i, 0], which is -S. So S is anti-hermitian, which means c*S is also anti-hermitian because c is real. Wait, but the angular momentum operators are hermitian, right? Oh wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Because the intrinsic angular momentum operator should be hermitian, so perhaps S is hermitian? Wait, let me recompute S. Oh wait,
