Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work it out.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between these levels is known. The problem is about finding the correct equation relating their temperatures, T1 and T2.

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor, yeah, which depends on temperature and the energy difference between levels.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is equal to the Boltzmann factor. The formula is something like n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So, let's denote the populations as n1 and n2 for star_1 and star_2. The question says n1 = 2 * n2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower). No, no. Wait, more accurately, the excitation level is the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state (or some lower state). So, for star_1, the excitation ratio is 2 times that of star_2.

Wait, the problem states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, perhaps it's the ratio of excited to unexcited that is twice. So, for each star, the ratio is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = 2 for star_1, and (n_upper)/(n_lower) =1 for star_2? No, wait, no. Wait, no, the problem says the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, for star_1, the ratio is 2 times star_2's ratio.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's say for star_1, the ratio is R1, and for star_2, it's R2. Then R1 = 2 * R2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, R = (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

So, R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, the energy level difference is ΔE. Oh, wait, wait no. The higher energy level is higher by ΔE, so the exponent would be negative because higher energy is less populated.

So, R = (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, for star_1: R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait, no. The question says that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So, R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait, but that's not correct because R is the excitation ratio. So if R1 is twice R2, then:

R1 = 2 R2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So, 2 R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

Wait, wait, no. Let me restate:

The problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So, the ratio n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is twice that for star_2.

So, R1 = 2 R2.

But from Boltzmann, R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), R2= exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So, substituting:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for the temperatures.

Taking ln on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE)/(k T2)

Let me rearrange that:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

(ΔE)/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, so ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. But we're looking for the equation relating T1 and T2.

Wait, the equation we have now is:

(ΔE)/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

But wait, what's the value of k (Boltzmann constant)? It's approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, the ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So, ΔE = k * something.

Wait, let's compute ΔE/(k). Since k is 1.38e-23 J/K, and ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, then ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1/K, right?

So, ΔE/(k) = 1 / (same as 1 K). So, the equation becomes:

(1/(k)) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, no. Wait, ΔE/(k) is 1/(K) because:

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, ΔE = k * (1 K). So, ΔE/(k) = 1 K, right?

Wait, yes, because ΔE = k T where T is the temperature difference. So, ΔE/(k) = T.

Wait, but in our case, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. And k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE = k * 1 K. So, ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So, going back to the equation:

(ΔE)/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

But since (ΔE)/(k) = 1 K, we can write:

(1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the K unit would complicate things, but since we're just looking at the equation, perhaps it's more about the relation between the temperatures.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me re-express the equation without units.

We have:

(ΔE) / (k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So, the equation becomes:

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, this would give K multiplied by (something) equals ln(2), which is dimensionless. That can't be right. Hmm. Maybe I made an error in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the equation is:

[ ΔE/(k) ] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But [ΔE/(k)] is (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So, 1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But 1 K is a unit, so that would make the left side have units of K * (1/K^2) ), because (T1 - T2) is K, and T1 T2 is K^2. So (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) has units of 1/K.

So, 1 K * (1/K) = 1/K. But the right side is ln(2), which is dimensionless. That's a problem. So I must have messed up the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me go back.

We have:

R1 = 2 R2.

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1 = 2 R2 → exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, that's the same as before. But with the substitution that ΔE/(k) = 1 K, the equation becomes:

(1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but that unit-wise doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should think about taking the ratio of the two equations.

Let me write the two Boltzmann equations.

For star_1: R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) → R1 = n1_upper / n1_lower

For star_2: R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) → R2 = n2_upper / n2_lower

Given that R1 = 2 R2 → exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = 2

Take natural log:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ] = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

(ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2)

Since ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K

So,

(1 K) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But this leads to units of K * (K) / (K^2) ) → K^2 / K^2 = unitless, so it's okay.

Wait, because (T1 - T2) is in K, and T1 T2 is K^2. So denominator is K^2, numerator is K. So (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) is 1/K.

Multiply by 1 K (from ΔE/(k)), that gives 1/K * K = unitless, which matches the right side (ln(2)).

So, the equation is:

( T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2 ) = ln(2) / (ΔE/(k))

Which is:

( T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2 ) = ln(2) / (1 K)

Wait, but since ΔE/(k) = 1 K, it's ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) = ln(2) / (1 K) → ln(2) * (1/K) )

Wait, that's getting a bit confusing, but perhaps I should not get stuck on units and focus on the equation.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the equation as:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) = (ln(2) ) * (k) / ΔE )

But since ΔE is given, and k is known, but the problem doesn't require numerical computation. So looking at the options, which one matches this structure.

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, no. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) ln(2) = [ T2 / T1 ]

B) ln(2) = [ (T1 + T2) / (T1 T2) ]

C) ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)^2 ]

D) ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ]

So, from our equation, the left side after substituting is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ( ln(2) ) * (k) / ΔE )

Wait, but in our equation, the left side is ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ), multiplied by (ΔE/(k)) ) is equal to ln(2).

Wait, no: from earlier,

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ( ln(2) ) * (k) / (ΔE )

But the problem says that ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So,

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J → ΔE = k * 1 K → so k = ΔE / (1 K)

Wait, perhaps that's complicating things, but in any case, we can say that k/ΔE is 1/K.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ( ln(2) ) * (k/ΔE )

Which is ( ln(2) ) * (1/K )

But wait, in our derived equation, it's (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So, substituting ΔE = k * 1 K, as earlier, because ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k * 1 K.

So, ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So,

(1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But this is giving us:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K)

But that would imply that the left side has units of 1/K, and the right side is ln(2) divided by K (which is 1/K), so the units match. But the equation would be:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But in the options, the left side is ln(2), and the right side is one of the options. So which option matches the structure where the right side is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) multiplied by a constant?

Wait, none of the options have a multiplicative constant like (ΔE/k). So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the setup.

Wait, maybe I should forget the actual values and just look for the structure of the equation.

Our derived equation is:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So, if I rearrange it,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But looking at the options, which one could this be?

Looking at option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So, if (ΔE/(k)) is a constant, but in our case, ΔE/(k) is 1 K (since ΔE = 1.38e-23 J and k is 1.38e-23 J/K).

Wait, so (ΔE/(k)) is 1 K. So the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But K is unit, so that would make the right side have units of K * (1/K²) ) → 1/K.

But ln(2) is dimensionless, so the units don't match. Hmm, this suggests I might have made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, maybe I should start over.

Given that the excitation ratio R is twice for star_1 compared to star_2.

R1 = 2 R2.

Using Boltzmann:

R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp[ (-ΔE/(k T1) ) + (ΔE/(k T2)) ] = 2

Take ln of both sides:

(-ΔE/(k T1 ) + ΔE/(k T2 )) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2)

Which is,

(ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Yes, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So, the equation is:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Now, considering that ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, and k = 1.38e-23 J/K, then ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So, substituting,

(1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

This gives:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K )

But this introduces a unit of 1/K, which doesn't fit because the right side is dimensionless (ln(2) is just a number).

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the excitation ratio being twice as much is incorrect.

Wait, another way to approach this: perhaps the problem is about the ratio of the populations, so R1 = 2 R2.

But R = (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So,

R1 = 2 R2 → exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

(ΔE/(k T2)) - (ΔE/(k T1)) ) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/k:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2)

Which is,

(ΔE/(k)) ( ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) ) = ln(2 )

Which again brings us back to the same equation.

But since ΔE = k * 1 K (because ΔE =1.38e-23 J, and k =1.38e-23 J/K → ΔE = k * (1 K) ), then ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So,

(1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, but ln(2 ) is dimensionless, so the left side must also be dimensionless.

But 1 K multiplied by (something in K)/(something in K²) ) → 1 K * (K) / (K^2) ) → 1 K * (1/K) ) = 1.

Yes, it would be dimensionless. So the equation is correct.

So,

(1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But wait, K is a unit, so perhaps this should not be part of the equation. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating with units. Let me just write the equation without units.

We have:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 ) / (ΔE/(k))

But since ΔE/(k) =1 K, as before, which is a unit, but perhaps in the equation, the units are accounted for, leading to a dimensionless equation.

So, going back, the equation with the units is correct, and the key is that the equation is:

ln(2 ) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But the options don't have any constants in them. So perhaps I have to think differently. Wait, perhaps the options are expressed in terms of the temperatures, and the equation is rearranged without the constants.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (ln(2 )) * (k) / ΔE )

But since k and ΔE are given, perhaps the equation can be simplified.

Wait, since ΔE = k * 1 K, then k/ΔE = 1/K.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (ln(2 )) * (1/(K)) )

But that introduces a unit, which is probably not part of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the constants cancel out, and the equation simplifies.

Wait, what if I write the equation as:

ln(2 ) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But since ΔE/(k) = 1 K, it becomes:

ln(2 ) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But that's not one of the options, as the options don't have the K factor.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Maybe the ratio is inverted.

Wait, perhaps the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, which would mean that R1 = 2 R2.

But if R = exp(-ΔE/(k T)), then higher T leads to higher R (since exp(negative) is smaller when T is higher. Wait, no, wait: higher T makes the exponent less negative, so R increases.

Wait, let me think: for higher T, the exponent (-ΔE/(kT)) is a smaller negative number, so R = exp(...) is a larger number. So higher T means higher excitation (higher R).

So, if star_1 has higher excitation (R1 = 2 R2), then star_1 must have higher temperature than star_2.

So, T1 > T2.

Now, the equation is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (ln(2 )) / (ΔE/(k))

But (ΔE/(k)) =1 K, so:

(T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 ) / (1 K )

Wait, but that would mean the left side has units of 1/K, but right side is ln(2 )/K, which is also 1/K.

But the options don't include the K, so perhaps the constants are considered as part of the equation, but since the options don't show any constants, perhaps the equation is assumed to have (ΔE/(k)) included as a factor.

Wait, perhaps the equation is:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is option D, because option D is ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 )

But without the (ΔE/k) factor.

Wait, but that would imply that I have to ignore the constants. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is dimensionless, and I should proceed under the assumption that the given ΔE and k are such that (ΔE/(k)) =1.

Wait, let me see. If I set (ΔE/(k)) =1, then the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is exactly option D.

So, the correct equation is option D: ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 )

So, the answer is D.


The problem involves determining the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of two stars, \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation governs the distribution of atoms in energy levels under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The excitation ratio \( R \) is given by:

\[
R = \frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratio is related as \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \). Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) \) gives:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

The problem specifies \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the Boltzmann constant \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus, \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \), simplifying the equation to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the structure of option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \) does not match the derived relationship.
- **Option B**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{T_1 T_2} \) introduces an incorrect additive term.
- **Option C**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{(T_1 T_2)^2} \) introduces an incorrect squared denominator.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
