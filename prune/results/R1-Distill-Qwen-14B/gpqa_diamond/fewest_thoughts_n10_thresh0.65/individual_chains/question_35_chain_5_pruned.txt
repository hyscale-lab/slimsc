Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix. It's given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, I have to look at the options given and see which statement is correct.

Wait, eigenvalues for a matrix... Right, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix. So first, let's write out the matrix Ay.

Since c = h/(4π), and S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], multiplying each element by c gives Ay = (h/4π) * S. So,

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So the matrix is:
Row 1: 0, (-i h)/(4π)
Row 2: (i h)/(4π), 0

To find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of Ay - a I. The matrix becomes:

[ (-a), (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), (-a) ]

Wait, no, because Ay - a I would subtract a times the identity matrix. So the diagonal elements are each (Ay's diagonal element minus a). But looking at Ay, the diagonal elements are zero, so subtracting a gives -a.

So the matrix is:

[ -a , (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

So determinant is a² - [ ( (-i)(i) * h² ) / (4π)^2 ) ]

Wait, compute (-i)(i) = (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So the second term becomes (1 * h²) / (4π)^2.

So the determinant is a² - (h²)/(16 π²).

Setting this equal
