Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics. I think I need to use special relativity here.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let's tackle the relative speed. Wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add like in classical mechanics. I recall the velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u and v are the speeds relative to some frame. But wait, here both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So the relative speed of astronaut 2 from astronaut 1's frame would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²).

Wait, let me compute that. The numerator is 0.5 - 0.6, which is -0.1, so -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c², which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
