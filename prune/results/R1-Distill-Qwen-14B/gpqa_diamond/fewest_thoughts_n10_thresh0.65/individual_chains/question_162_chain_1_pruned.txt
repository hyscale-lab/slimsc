Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2 using the given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in geometry, often associated with hyperbolic geometry. I think it's also called a tractricoid or something like that. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics. Oh wait, I think the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Right, that rings a bell.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, so this looks like a 2-dimensional metric in terms of x and y coordinates. Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. So the metric tensor is diagonal here, with the coefficients depending on x and y. 

I need to find the area of the pseudosphere when the radius r is 2. Wait, does the radius in the pseudosphere relate to the curvature? Oh yeah, the Gaussian curvature K is related to the radius of curvature R by K = -1/R². So if the radius is 2, then K would be -1/(2²) = -1/4. 

But wait, how does that tie into the metric? The given metric has 32 in the numerator. Let me see. The general form for a metric in 2D can sometimes be expressed as ds² = E dx² + G dy², but in this case, it's a product of a function and (dx² + dy²). So it's
