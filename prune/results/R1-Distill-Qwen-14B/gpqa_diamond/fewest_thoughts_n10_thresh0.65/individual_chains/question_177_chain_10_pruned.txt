Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s, respectively. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. Okay, so first, I need to remember the formula for luminosity of a star as a black body. I think it's the Stefan-Boltzmann law, right? Luminosity L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. So L = 4πσR²T⁴. Since 4πσ is a constant, the luminosity depends on R squared and temperature to the fourth.

Wait, but the question says that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. The peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's law. Wien's law says λ_max ≈ b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Oh, because if λ_max is same, then T must be same because T is inversely proportional to λ_max.

Wait, wait, but wait. Wait a second. The radial velocities are different. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. So does that affect the observed wavelength? Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its spectrum shifts due to Doppler effect. But the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe the problem is referring to their rest wavelengths, not the observed ones. Or perhaps the radial velocities affect the measured luminosity somehow.

Wait, but the problem states that the astronomers "determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest." So if the stars are moving, their observed λ_max would be different due to Doppler shift. But the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same. So maybe we have to correct for the Doppler effect to find their actual temperatures.

Wait, that's
