Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S has the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). So the matrix Ay would be c times S.

Wait, what's the form of matrix S? Let me write it down. S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So multiplying by c, Ay becomes:

c * [ 0  -i ]
    [ i   0 ]

But c is h/(4π), so Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by that matrix.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The options are given, and I have to pick the correct statement regarding this process.

Hmm. I remember that eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and a is the eigenvalue.

So let's compute the characteristic equation. Let me denote a as the eigenvalue.

The matrix Ay is:

[ (h/(4π))*0    (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i    (h/(4π))*0 ]

So that's:

[ 0        -i * (h/(4π)) ]
[ i * (h/(4π))   0      ]

So the matrix Ay is:

0              -i c
i c             0

Where c = h/(4π). Wait, no. Wait, c is h/(4π). So the elements are 0 and -i c in the first row, and i c and 0 in the second.

To find eigenvalues, compute the determinant of (Ay - a I), which is:

| -a        (-i c)       |
| (i c)      -a         |

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - ( (-i c)(i c) ) = a² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Wait, (-i c)(i c) is (-i)*(i) * c^2. Let me compute that. (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So the product is c² * 1. So the determinant is a² - c² = 0.

So the equation is a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are a = c and a = -c.

Wait, c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly state this. Let me look again.

Option A: Im part is ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). That doesn't seem right because eigenvalues are real or imaginary? Wait, wait, no, in this case, the matrix Ay is a 2x2 matrix. Let me think about the matrix.

Wait, the
