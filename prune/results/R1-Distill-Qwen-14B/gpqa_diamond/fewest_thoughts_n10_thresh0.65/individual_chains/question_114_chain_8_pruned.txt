Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two parts, right? So, there are two reactions happening, and I need to find the right reagents for each step. The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing reagents A and B in different combinations.

First, let's look at the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. It's reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, that product has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group on the same carbon. Oh wait, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it forms a cyanohydrin. So that makes sense because a cyanohydrin is where you have an alcohol and a nitrile group added to the ketone.

But how does that happen? I think the mechanism involves the nucleophilic addition of the cyanide ion to the carbonyl carbon. The cyanide is a good nucleophile. So NaCN provides the CN- ion. But wait, the reaction conditions would probably need some acid, because in the formation of cyanohydrins, I remember that an acid catalyst is used. Oh right, because the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So the CN- attacks, then water comes in as a nucleophile to form the hydroxyl group.

So for the first step, reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ (which is sulfuric acid in aqueous solution, maybe), or perhaps another acid like H2SO4. Looking at the options, options A and B have H3O+ as reagent A. Options C and D have NaHSO3 for A. Hmm.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes in such reactions, you might use a different catalyst, like H2SO4, but H3O+ is a possible source of H+ ions. So reagent A is likely H3O+.

Now, moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. And the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-h
