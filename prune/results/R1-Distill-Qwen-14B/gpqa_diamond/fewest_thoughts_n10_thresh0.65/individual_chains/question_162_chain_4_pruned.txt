Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about finding the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I think this looks like a line element in two dimensions. So this is a 2D metric, and we're probably dealing with some sort of surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space, maybe like a sphere but for hyperbolic space?

Wait, no, the term pseudosphere makes me think it's a surface of constant negative curvature. Oh right, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a horn or something. But how does that relate to the metric?

I remember that in differential geometry, the area element dA in a metric is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy. So for a metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2 g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy², the area element is sqrt(g_{xx} g_{yy} - (g_{xy})²) dx dy.

Looking at the given metric, it's written as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So that means g_{xx} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_{yy} is the same. The off-diagonal terms g_{xy} are zero because there's
