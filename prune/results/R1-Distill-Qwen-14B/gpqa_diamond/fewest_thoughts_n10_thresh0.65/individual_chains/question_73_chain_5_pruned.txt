Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down. The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, right.

Alright, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Wait, actually, wait—wait a second. Oh, right, wait. In relativity, the mass might refer to rest mass. Oh, but when they say "masses 2m and 3m," I think that's their rest masses. So their rest masses are 2m and 3m, respectively.

They are moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. So one is moving faster than the other—0.6c is faster than 0.5c.

The question asks two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. So I need to calculate both.

First, let's think about the relative speed. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds divided by (1 + (v1*v2)/c²), from the velocity addition formula in special relativity. Wait, no—actually, the formula for relative velocity u' when one object moves at v1 and another at v2 relative to the same frame is u' = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Let me get this straight. The relative velocity u of the second object from the first's frame is u = (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Oh, because if the first is moving at v1, and the second at v2 in the same direction, then in the first's frame, the second is moving at v2 - v1, but we have to apply the Lorentz transformation.

Wait, no: the formula for the relative velocity of an object moving at velocity u in one frame, say S, observed from another frame S' moving at velocity v relative to S. So in S, the object's velocity is u. Then in S', its velocity u' is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So in this problem, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction. Let's say astronaut A
