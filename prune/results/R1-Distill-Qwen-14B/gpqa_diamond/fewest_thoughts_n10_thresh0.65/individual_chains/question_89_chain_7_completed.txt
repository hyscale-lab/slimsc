Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH to form a product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

Hmm, okay, I need to break this down step by step.

First, let's think about the first reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is quite rigid. Dibrominated at the 1 and 3 positions. KOH is a strong base. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a base, they undergo an elimination reaction to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—those are not adjacent carbons. Oh wait, no, in adamantane the numbering is such that 1 and 3 are next to each other in some way, maybe? Or perhaps the structure allows for a different kind of elimination.

Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on carbons that are two apart. So they're not adjacent. So, perhaps this is an example of the Hofmann elimination or some kind of elimination that forms a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a neighboring group elimination.

But wait, KOH is a strong base, so perhaps it's an E2 elimination. Adamantane rings are known for their stability. So when KOH is heated with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps it leads to dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but 1 and 3 are not adjacent, so elimination to form a double bond would require breaking two C-Br bonds, which might not be possible in a single E2 step. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't an elimination but a substitution. But with excess KOH, it's more likely elimination.

Wait, but if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, maybe it leads to the formation of an epoxide? No, epoxides form from dihalides via a different mechanism, like using a peracid or something else. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to an allene or some other diene? Or maybe the reaction forms a cyclopropane ring? No, that doesn't fit with the product description.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 is a diol. Because KOH can cause hydrolysis of alkyl halides. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane would undergo hydrolysis in a nucleophilic substitution. However, since it's a vicinal dihalide, maybe it forms an epoxide? Wait, no, I think that's not the case. Vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromoethane) can form epoxides upon treatment with aqueous acid, but with a base like KOH, perhaps elimination is more likely.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides react with a strong base, they can form alkenes via dehydrohalogenation. But in this case, the dihalide is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the two bromines are on carbons that are two apart, not adjacent. So perhaps the elimination isn't possible in a single step. Alternatively, maybe the two bromides are on the same face, allowing for an elimination to form a double bond across the two carbons.

Wait, the product 1 is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), which might be a -O- group, like an ether or an epoxide. The IR shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That suggests the presence of a ketone or an ester.

Wait, so product 1 has a carbonyl. How does that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? Oh, wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization or some kind of intramolecular elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond but also perhaps leading to a ring structure that includes a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: the reaction conditions are KOH and heat. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes two E2 eliminations, removing two HBr molecules. Each elimination would form a double bond. But where? Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with each carbon bonded to three others. So 1 and 3 positions—assuming they are on adjacent carbons in a way that allows for two eliminations.

Wait, maybe the product is an adamantane with a double bond and an epoxide. No, that doesn't fit with the IR data. Alternatively, perhaps the two Br groups are on adjacent carbons but on opposite faces, allowing for elimination to form a carbonyl group. Wait, no, that doesn't immediately make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but the IR doesn't show a broad peak for O-H, which would be expected in a diol. But the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is an epoxide? No, because epoxides have a different IR region (around 1200-1300 cm-1 for the C-O-C stretch). Alternatively, a ketone.

Wait, another thought: if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base like KOH, perhaps two dehydrohalogenation steps occur, each eliminating HBr, leading to a conjugated diene. But then where would the carbonyl come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring. No, cyclopropanes don't have carbonyls.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. If KOH provides hydroxide ions, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But in a vicinal dihalide, it might lead to an exchange. But that seems unlikely to form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Fittig reaction, but that usually involves aryl halides and forms a metal bridge. Not applicable here.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the NMR data for product 1. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm integrating for 2H. That's a region where you might see an -OCH2- group, perhaps. The other peaks are between 2.41-2.23 (10H), which could be the adamantane ring protons, and 1.94 (2H), maybe another set of equivalent protons.

Wait, in the IR, 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. So product 1 is likely an adamantane derivative with a ketone group. How does that form from a dihalide?

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is treated with a base, leading to a double elimination to form a carbonyl. Oh! If two dehydrohalogenation steps occur, each losing HBr, perhaps forming a carbonyl group. Wait, in such cases, the base could deprotonate adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a double bond, but if another elimination occurs, maybe a conjugated system forms, leading to a carbonyl via some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is converted into a ketone via a double elimination. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the hydroxide attacks one Br, leading to a bromide intermediate, which then eliminates another Br, forming a double bond. But that would form an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: the base induces an elimination, forming an alkene, and then an oxidation occurs. But the question doesn't mention any oxidizing agents, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to each Br, leading to a conjugated diradical or something, which then forms a carbonyl. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product structure. Since the IR shows a carbonyl, maybe product 1 is an adamantane with a ketone group. How?

Wait, if the reaction is elimination of two HBr molecules, each elimination forming a double bond. But wait, to form a carbonyl from two elimination steps, perhaps a geminal dihalide would eliminate, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't geminal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a neighboring group elimination. For example, the base deprotonates a hydrogen adjacent to one Br, which leads to the formation of a bromide carbanion, which then eliminates the other Br in a conjugate elimination, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, that makes sense. If the structure is such that the two Br atoms are on carbons that are separated by one carbon (1 and 3 positions), perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another, so when the base abstracts a proton from the carbon next to Br-1, it forms a carbanion, and then that carbanion can eliminate Br-3, leading to a double bond. But wait, how does that form a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination isn't giving a double bond but a carbonyl. Oh! Wait, if two adjacent Br atoms are in a position where their elimination forms a carbonyl. Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, leading to a conjugated diene, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the formation of an epoxide, but with a ketone group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure composed of four cyclohexane rings. Each carbon in the adamantane structure is part of the diamond lattice. The 1,3 positions would be on carbons that are two apart. So, if each has a Br, perhaps their elimination would form a double bond, but that would require the two Brs to be on adjacent carbons. Wait, maybe this is a case of a 1,2-dibromide but in a different numbering.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about the product 1. Its 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 (2H), which could be an -OCH2- group, but the IR has a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH could form a diol via hydrolysis, but then how does the carbonyl come into play? Unless it's an epoxide that then undergoes some ring-opening, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of the formation of a conjugated diene, but how would that give a carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an adamantane with a substituted ethylene group, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, I'm stuck on this first step. Let me think about the next steps, maybe that will help.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 has a carbonyl group, so maybe it's undergoing some kind of acylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydration reaction.

Wait, product 1 has a carbonyl, and when treated with a Lewis acid, maybe it undergoes some kind of enol formation or cyclization. Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing a Claisen or aldol condensation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, which then reacts with the Lewis acid. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, let me think about the third step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So product 2 must contain a double bond.

So the reaction sequence is:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with carbonyl, perhaps a ketone) → product 2 (which has a double bond) → product 3 (result of ozonolysis of the double bond in product 2).

So, putting it together: After the first step, product 1 has a carbonyl. Then, product 2 has a double bond, which upon ozonolysis breaks and forms carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps during the second step, product 1's carbonyl leads to the formation of a double bond in product 2.

Wait, so in the second step, product 1 (with a carbonyl) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid. Maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or some conjugated diene.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step is a dehydration of product 1 to form an alkene. For example, if product 1 is a diol, then in the presence of a Lewis acid, it could lose water to form a double bond. But product 1's NMR doesn't show broad peaks that would correspond to OH protons, so maybe it's not a diol.

Wait, product 1's NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet. That might suggest an -OCH2- group, but it's a singlet, meaning no neighboring protons. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen. But the IR's carbonyl suggests a ketone or maybe an ester.

Alternatively, product 1 might be a bromoalkene, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should try to think of the overall structure.

Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon treatment with KOH, perhaps it eliminates two HBr molecules, forming a conjugated diene. Then, the diene might undergo some reaction. But wait, but the IR of product 1 has a carbonyl, so maybe it's an enol or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a ketone via some mechanism. Wait, maybe via a pinacol-like rearrangement? No, pinacol rearrangement involves a 1,2-diol undergoing elimination to form a carbonyl, but that doesn't fit here.

Alternatively, the initial reaction forms an epoxide, which then is opened by the base. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the first reaction again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Maybe it's a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules. Each elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps the structure allows for a conjugated diene.

But then, product 1 would have a conjugated diene, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So that can't be right.

Wait, if two HBr are eliminated, perhaps each from adjacent carbons, leading to a ketone. Hmm, but how?

Wait, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons (maybe I got the numbering wrong), then elimination would form a double bond. But if the structure is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Wait, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, and the elimination leads to a cyclopropane ring opening to form a ketone. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl via the formation of a geminal dihalide. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a geminal dihalide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms an alpha diketone. But I'm not seeing how.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a benzophenone-type structure, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the hydroxide attacks one of the Br atoms, leading to an alkoxide which then eliminates the other Br, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me think. Suppose the hydroxide ion attacks one Br, forming a bromide intermediate. Then, perhaps the adjacent Br could be eliminated as Br-, leading to a carbonyl group. So the structure would lose two HBr, forming a ketone.

In such a case, the product would be 1,3-diketone adamantane? But wait, the NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm, which is a 2H singlet. Hmm, that doesn't fit a ketone. Or maybe another functional group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a geminal diol, but that's not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't a ketone but a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group. Or maybe it's an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic carbonate or something else, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe I should think about the IR. A peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. The NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester, but if there's a carbonyl, perhaps it's an ester. For example, an ester group would have a carbonyl and an adjacent oxygen. So maybe product 1 is an ester.

But how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? Maybe via a substitution reaction, but with two Brs, perhaps forming a cyclic ester.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks near 2 ppm that would correspond to a carbonyl-adjacent CH2.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm peak is due to an -OCH2CH2- group, but that's speculative.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the first step is a double elimination, forming an alkene. Then, the second step with aluminum isopropoxide could be a Friedel-Crafts acylation or something else. But product 2 then undergoes ozonolysis, which breaks double bonds, so product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps in the second step, product 1 (which has a carbonyl) forms a conjugated alkene via some acid-catalyzed rearrangement. For example, a keto-enol tautomerism, but that usually involves enol formation, which might not form a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and in the presence of a Lewis acid, it undergoes an elimination to form an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, introducing a double bond next to the carbonyl.

So, product 1: ketone (carbonyl group, IR peak). Product 2: alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (double bond adjacent to carbonyl). Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond and form two carbonyl groups.

After ozonolysis and workup with dimethyl sulfide (which is a reductive workup, not oxidative), the ozonide would break into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But the question is about the NMR of product 3. Specifically, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with D2O.

Wait, perhaps the deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group. In the ozonolysis product, the carbonyl groups would deshield nearby protons.

But let's think about the structure. If product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, the structure would be:

R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-... but no, wait. More accurately, it would be R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-..., but that's not conjugated. Alternatively, R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2- would not be conjugated. Wait, more accurately, the structure would be R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-... perhaps with a double bond between the carbonyl and another carbon. So, R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-... no, that's not conjugated. Wait, maybe it's R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-... which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enone, like R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2- is not right. Wait, perhaps it's R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond between the carbonyl and the next carbon, making it R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2- is not conjugated.

Wait, no, the correct structure for an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone would be R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-… no, wait. Let me think again. An alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone has the structure R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-… but that's not conjugated. Wait, no: the structure should have the double bond between the carbonyl carbon and the adjacent carbon. So, R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-… isn't correct. The correct structure is R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-… no, wait, perhaps it's R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-… no, that's not right. Oh wait, the correct structure is R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-… no, I'm getting confused. Let me correct this. An alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone would have the structure where the carbonyl is at position alpha, and the double bond is between alpha and beta carbons. So it's R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-… no, wait, that can't be. The correct structure is R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-… no, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that product 2 is an enone, which upon ozonolysis would cleave into two carbonyls. So, during ozonolysis, the double bond is broken, and each end forms a carbonyl group. So product 3 would have two new carbonyl groups.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. So, perhaps in product 3, after ozonolysis, there's a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 has neighboring protons.

Wait, let's imagine the ozonolysis of product 2. If product 2 is an enone, say, R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-… no, perhaps something like R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-… no, perhaps it's better to think of product 2 as having a double bond next to a carbonyl. For example, something like:

O
||
C-R-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-... with a double bond between the R and CH2.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, so the structure is:

R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-… no, perhaps more accurately, it's R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-... no, I'm getting stuck on the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a dienone, with a conjugated diene. But ozonolysis would break each double bond. But given that product 3 is formed by ozonolysis, which is a single reaction, perhaps product 2 has only one double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a structure like:

R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-… no, I think I'm getting too tangled here.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction produces a ketone, and the second reaction converts it into an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone via elimination. Then, ozonolysis would break that double bond into two carbonyls.

So, after ozonolysis, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The protons adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded and appear downfield in the NMR.

Now, looking at the coupling pattern. The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say each end of the ozonolysis produces a carbonyl, so the adjacent CH2 groups would each have two protons. Each of these protons would be split by neighboring protons.

If each CH2 group is next to a carbonyl, the protons on the CH2 would be split by neighboring groups. For example, if each CH2 is between two carbonyls, then each proton would couple with two different sets of protons.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis product, each end would form a carbonyl. So, the structure before ozonolysis was R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R', and ozonolysis would break the central double bond. Wait, no, perhaps the structure is R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R'. No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps product 2 is a diene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enone, like R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R', but that doesn't make sense. Maybe product 2 is a simple alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, like cyclohexenone.

Wait, but the starting material is adamantane, so the product would retain the adamantane structure with some substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a substituted cyclohexene derivative.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the ozonolysis product. Ozonolysis of a double bond R1R2C=CR3R4 would typically form two carbonyl groups: R1R2CO and R3R4CO (if reductive workup, like with dimethyl sulfide, which gives aldehydes and ketones instead of carboxylic acids or ketones).

So, if product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, say, R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R, then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls, but in reality, the structure would be different.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a simple alkene, like R-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-R, but that's just a straight chain.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the coupling pattern.

The question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. In the ozonolysis product, these would be the protons closest to the carbonyl groups. Let's say each CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each of these protons would have neighboring Hs.

If the structure after ozonolysis is something like:

O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-R-C=O

Wait, no, that's not possible. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, for example, if the double bond was between carbons 2 and 3, ozonolysis would form carbonyl groups on each side.

So, the product after ozonolysis would have two carbonyl groups. Each of the CH2 groups adjacent to these carbonyls would have protons that are deshielded.

Now, considering the coupling. Each CH2 next to a carbonyl would have two protons. Let's say each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. So, for example, the structure could be:

O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-R-C=O

Wait, but that's a straight chain. Each of the middle CH2 groups would have neighboring protons. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like:

O=C-R-CH2-CH2-

and

-CH2-CH2-C=O-R

Wait, no, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is two carbonyl groups connected by a chain. So, for example, the original double bond was in the middle of a chain, and ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyls, each at the end.

So, perhaps in product 3, we have two carbonyl groups, each connected to a CH2 group. Each of these CH2 groups has two protons.

Each of these protons would couple with their adjacent protons. For example, the CH2 next to the carbonyl (let's call it CH2a) would be next to another CH2 (CH2b). Each proton in CH2a would couple with the two protons in CH2b, leading to a triplet pattern.

Wait, but what if each CH2a is next to a CH2b, which is next to another CH2c? Then, the coupling would be more complex.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, each proton in CH2 would see two neighboring protons (from the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet.

Wait, no, each proton in CH2a would be adjacent to two protons in CH2b. So each would be a triplet.

But wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O-R. Then, the middle CH2 would be between two CH2 groups, leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, let's say the structure is:

O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O-R'

Then, the central CH2 would be between two CH2 groups. The protons on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl (CH2a) would have neighboring protons from the next CH2 (CH2b). Each proton in CH2a would couple with two protons in CH2b, leading to a triplet.

So the most deshielded protons (on CH2a) would be a triplet.

But wait, another possibility: if each CH2 is connected to another CH2, which is connected to another CH2, then each proton would have coupling with two neighboring protons on either side. For example, a CH2 group in the middle would have two neighboring CH2 groups, leading to each proton coupling with four others. But that would be a quartet. Alternatively, if each CH2 is coupled with two on one side and two on the other, it might be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in the case of a three-carbon chain, such as O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, the middle CH2 would be between two CH2 groups. Each proton in the middle would have two neighboring protons on each side, leading to a splitting pattern of triplet of triplets (each proton would couple with two on the left and two on the right, but that's actually a more complex splitting).

Wait, no, each proton in the middle would have two neighboring protons on each adjacent CH2. So each proton would split into a triplet from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in reality, the splitting would be more like a triplet of triplets, but that's a higher multiplicity. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets or another pattern.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Each proton in the middle CH2 group would be next to two protons on each adjacent CH2. So each of these protons would couple with two others on each side. That would lead to a splitting pattern of a triplet from each side, resulting in a triplet of triplets. But that's a higher multiplicity, which might not be one of the options.

Wait, the options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

So, considering this, if each CH2 has two neighboring groups, each with two protons, the coupling would be a triplet. But wait, perhaps each CH2 is only coupled with one neighboring group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the CH2 groups would be CH2a (next to carbonyl), CH2b (middle), and CH2c (next to carbonyl on the other side). So, the protons on CH2a would only be adjacent to CH2b, and the protons on CH2c would only be adjacent to CH2b. The protons on CH2b would be adjacent to both CH2a and CH2c.

So, for the CH2a protons: each is adjacent to two protons in CH2b. So, each would be a triplet.

For the CH2b protons: each is adjacent to two protons in CH2a and two in CH2c. So each would be a quartet (coupling with two on each side), but wait, that's a quartet from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2b proton is coupled with four others, leading to a pentet. But that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is only adjacent to one CH2 group, leading to a simpler splitting.

Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis product is two separate carbonyl compounds. For example, if product 2 was a simple alkene like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, then ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes or ketones. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis product has a single CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the central CH2 groups would each have two neighboring CH2 groups, leading to more complex splitting.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

The most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl.

If each of these CH2 has two neighboring protons (from an adjacent CH2 group), then each would be a triplet.

So, the answer would be triplet, which is option A.

But wait, another possibility: if each of these CH2 groups is connected to another CH2 group on both sides, then each proton would couple with two on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets. But that's option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is only adjacent to one CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

I think I need to conclude based on the information.

Given the options, the most likely answer is a triplet, option A.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to product 3 after ozonolysis. The goal is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

### Reaction Analysis:
1. **First Reaction (1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH):**  
   The reaction likely involves a double elimination of HBr, forming a product with a carbonyl group (as indicated by the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹). This suggests product 1 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or a related structure.

2. **Second Reaction (Product 1 + Aluminum Isopropoxide):**  
   Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates the formation of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (product 2) via elimination, introducing a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group.

3. **Third Reaction (Product 2 + Ozonolysis):**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming two carbonyl groups in product 3. The structure of product 3 likely includes CH2 groups adjacent to carbonyls, with protons on these CH2 groups being the most deshielded.

### NMR Analysis:
- The most deshielded hydrogens in product 3 are on CH2 groups adjacent to carbonyl groups.  
- Each proton on these CH2 groups couples with two protons from an adjacent CH2 group, resulting in a **triplet** coupling pattern.

### Conclusion:
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.
