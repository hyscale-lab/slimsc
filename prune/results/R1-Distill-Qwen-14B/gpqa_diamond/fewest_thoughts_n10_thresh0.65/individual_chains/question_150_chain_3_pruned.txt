Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky, especially when reactions are involved. Let me take it step by step.

The compound's molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 → (9)/2 = 4.5. Wait, that can't be right because degrees of unsaturation should be whole numbers. Oh wait, wait. Let me recalculate. Maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So substituting into the formula: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 because N is 1. Or wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is 0 here, so (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 → (18-9+1)/2 → 10/2 =5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That makes sense. Five could be, say, a ring and some double bonds.

Now, the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H). That looks like
