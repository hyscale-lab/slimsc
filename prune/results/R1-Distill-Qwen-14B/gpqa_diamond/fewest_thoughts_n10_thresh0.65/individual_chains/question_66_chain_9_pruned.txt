Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible operators that can be formed with the Standard Model fields, respecting certain symmetries. The idea is they're organized by dimension. So, the operators are classified as to which gauge symmetry they respect.

Wait, but what about the bigger symmetries like Lorentz, Poincare, etc.?

Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics are the same for all observers, and includes things like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like how physics is the same everywhere in space and time). But wait, in a field theory, Poincare symmetry includes the entire spacetime symmetry group. So if a theory respects Lorentz symmetry, does it automatically respect Poincare? I think so, because if you have a Lorentz-invariant theory, adding translation invariance (which is part of Poincare) would make sense. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no. Lorentz symmetry is a subgroup of the Poincare group. So if a theory respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. But does SMEFT require Poincare?

Wait, I think that SMEFT is built from Lorentz-invariant operators. Because the Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant, and the SMEFT operators are constructed from SM fields, so they must preserve Lorentz symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if a theory is Lorentz symmetric, is it necessarily Poincare symmetric? Well, translation symmetry (like shifting all coordinates by the same amount) is a separate thing. In the SMEFT, I think the operators are local, so they should respect translation symmetry. Because if you shift all your coordinates, the physics doesn't change. So SMEFT operators must be Poincare symmetric as well. So options 1 and 2 must be correct.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetry? CP is charge conjugation combined with parity, and CPT is
