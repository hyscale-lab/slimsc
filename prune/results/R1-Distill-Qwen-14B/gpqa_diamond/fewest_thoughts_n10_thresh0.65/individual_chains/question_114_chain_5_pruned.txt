Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let's see what the reactions are.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's a ketone. And the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group and a methyl group on the same carbon. Oh wait, that sounds like a cyanohydrin formation.

Cyanohydrins are typically formed when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, like from NaCN. But wait, under what conditions does that happen? I remember that the formation of cyanohydrins usually involves an acid catalyst. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the cyanide attacks, and then water leaves, forming the alcohol part. So for the first step, A must be an acid. Looking at the options, A options are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, while NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid but can also act as a source of sulfites.

Wait, but sometimes in cyanohydrin formation, HCN is used without a strong acid, but I think in some cases, like when using NaCN, you might need an acid to help. So A should be an acidâ€”so in the options, either H3O+ (which is option A and B) or NaHSO3 (options C and D).

Now, the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B in the presence of H2O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is converting into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen? I think that converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid typically involves hydrolysis. For that, you can use strong acid or strong base conditions.

Wait, the nitrile to acid reaction can be done using a strong acid like HCl with heating, or using a
