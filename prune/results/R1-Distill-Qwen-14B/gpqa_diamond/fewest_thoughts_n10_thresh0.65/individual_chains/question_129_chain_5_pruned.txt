Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out what compound E is. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the reaction steps and the information given.

The question gives me a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several transformations to end up at E. There are also some hints provided, so I'll need to use those to deduce the structures.

First, let me outline the steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is typical for a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde). E has a peak at around 1715 cm^-1, which is a bit lower, suggesting maybe a different carbonyl, perhaps a ketone again but maybe in a different environment.

Looking at the options, they are all cyclic ketones, so E is a cyclic ketone.

Let me think about each reaction step.

Step 1: A + HCN â†’ B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, reacting with HCN would form a cyanohydrin. But wait, the product would be a geminal diol with the cyanide attached. Alternatively, maybe A is an aldehyde, but the IR peak at 1750 is more like a ketone. So A is a ketone. Then, reacting A (a ketone) with HCN would form a cyanohydrin (B), which is a compound with an alcohol and a cyanide group attached to the same carbon.

Wait, but in the case of cyclohexanone, for example, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a CN group. So B would be a secondary alcohol with a CN group attached.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. So what does that do? Well, if B has a nitrile group (CN), reducing it would typically convert CN into CH2NH2, but under certain conditions, perhaps it's hydrogenated to CH2OH or even CH2NH2. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, if B is a cyanohydrin, it's a secondary alcohol and a nitrile. But when you hydrogenate under Pd, maybe the nitrile group is reduced. Let me think: nitrile (RCN) upon hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would become RCH2NH2, but wait, that's under certain conditions, maybe in acidic conditions? Alternatively, sometimes nitriles are reduced to amines, but another possibility is that they are hydrogenated to primary amines. But wait, another pathway: perhaps the reduction is partial.

Wait, another thought: Wait, if B is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group, maybe
