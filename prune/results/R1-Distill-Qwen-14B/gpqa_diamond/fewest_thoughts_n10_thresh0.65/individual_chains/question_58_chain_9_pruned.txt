Okay, so I have this physics question here about which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics. I need to figure out which one never needs regularization. Regularization is usually a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle the infinities. But if a theory is already finite, meaning it doesn't have these divergences, then it wouldn't need regularization.

Wait, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory. I think QED is renormalizable, but does that mean it doesn't require regularization? No, wait, renormalization is a procedure where you absorb the infinities into physical parameters like mass and charge. But regularization is a step before renormalization, right? So QED must still have divergences that require regularization before renormalization happens. So C) QED is out as the answer.

What about Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)? QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's also a quantum field theory and it's asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes small. But I believe QCD does have issues with things like confinement and requires certain methods like lattice QCD for calculations, but does it require regularization? Well, because it's a renormalizable theory, I think it does deal with divergences and thus uses regularization techniques. So B) QCD is probably not the answer either.

Classical Electrodynamics (C) is the non-quantum version. Since it's classical, it doesn't involve the same divergences as quantum theories. For example, in Maxwell's equations, you might have issues with point charges leading to infinite fields, but in practice, classical E&M deals with these through methods like considering charge densities with distributions rather than point charges. But wait, in the classical theory, do you need regularization? I'm not sure. It's possible that classical E&M doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory where divergences are a problem in calculations. So D) Classical Electrodynamics might not need regularization.

Superstring Theory is a quantum theory, a type of string theory. String
