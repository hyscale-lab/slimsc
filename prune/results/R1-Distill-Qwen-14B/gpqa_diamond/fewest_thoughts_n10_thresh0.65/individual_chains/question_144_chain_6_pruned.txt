Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. I remember that decay properties are related to something called the mean lifetime, which depends on the particle's width. 

The given data: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. Wait, units here are in GeV and MeV, so I should probably convert them all to the same unit system to make calculations easier. Since the answer options are in meters, I'll need to handle some unit conversions.

I recall that the mean lifetime τ of a particle is related to its width Γ by the equation τ = ħ / Γ. Oh wait, but that might be in natural units. Because in particle physics, people often use units where ħ = c = 1. But when converting to meters, I need to use the actual values of these constants. 

So the steps I think I need to take are:
1. Calculate the lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Then find the velocity of the meson since decay distance depends on how fast it's moving.
3. Use the formula for mean decay distance: cτ times velocity (v), or perhaps (v * cτ), but I need to get the exact expression right.

Wait, another approach: the mean decay length is given by (γ * v * c * τ), where γ is the Lorentz factor
