Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decays. Hmm, let me try to think this through. Alright, the question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not entirely sure how that plays into the decay possibilities, but maybe the key is the mass and the particles it can decay into.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψf(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψf(y). Oh, right, that's like a Yukawa coupling term. So the boson X interacts with fermions, and the lambda is the coupling constant. But for decay, what's important is the mass of X and the masses of the fermions it can decay into.

So X has a mass of 6 GeV. The possible decays would be into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because bosons can decay into fermions if the mass allows. So for each possible fermion pair, the sum of their masses (times two, because each particle and antiparticle) must be less than the mass of X.

Wait, but also, in particle physics, when a boson decays, the total energy of the decay products must be less than the mass of the boson. So for a fermion and its antiparticle, their combined rest mass has to be less than or equal to the mass of X.

Let me list the possible fermions. The fermions would be quarks and leptons. Let's think about their masses:

- Up quark (u): around 2 MeV. So 2 * 2 =4 MeV, way less than 6 GeV. So u and anti u can be produced.

- Down quark (d): similar, maybe around 4-5 MeV. So 2*5=10 MeV. Still way less. So d and anti d are possible.

- Strange quark (s): about 95-100 MeV. 2*100=200 MeV. So 0.2 GeV, which is way below 6 GeV. So s and anti s can be produced.

- Charm quark (c): mass around 1.2-1.5 GeV. 2*1.5=3 GeV. Which is less than 6 GeV. So c and anti c can be produced.

- Bottom quark (b): mass around 4-5 GeV. 2*5=10 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So b and anti b can't be produced as their combined mass would be 8 GeV or higher, which is more than X's mass.

- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So no way for X to decay into t or anti t.

Now for leptons:

- Electron (e): negligible mass, so 2m_e ~ 0, so e+ e- is allowed.

- Muon (μ): about 0.1 GeV each, so 0.2 GeV total. Well within 6 GeV. So μ+ μ- is allowed.

- Tau (τ):
