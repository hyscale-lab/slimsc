Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Let's break it down step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I remember means that the conditions are such that the gas can be treated as being in equilibrium with a local thermal bath, so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

Hmm, Boltzmann distribution... Right, the probability of a particle being in a certain energy state is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)), where E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So, if the energy difference is ΔE, then the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the lower state is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The ratio n_upper/n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). Because the higher energy level has less population.

Wait, but in the question, star_1 has iron atoms twice as excited. Does that mean the number of excited atoms is twice that of star_2? Or wait, maybe it's the excitation level that's twice. So in star_1, the excited state population is higher than in star_2 by a factor of two.

So let me clarify: Let's say both stars have the same lower energy level (ground state) and an excited state. The ratio n_upper/n_lower is what the Boltzmann factor tells us.

For star_1, n_upper1/n_lower1 = exp( -ΔE/(kT1) )

For star_2, n_upper2/n_lower2 = exp( -ΔE/(kT2) )

But the problem states that the upper level is twice as excited in star_1 compared to star_2. Wait, no, the question says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps that means the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or maybe the excitation is
