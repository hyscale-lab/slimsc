Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. There's a small cavity inside, and the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the conductor's center. Oh wait, the cavity's radius is r, and r is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside. The angle between l and s is theta. 

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different expression for E. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, but it has a cavity, the charges might redistribute.

Wait, I think about the concept of electrostatic shielding. If the conductor is a conductor, the charges inside the cavity wouldn't affect the electric field outside the conductor. But wait, that's if the conductor is a conductor and it's a spherical shell. Oh right, because for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges reside on the surface. But in this case, the conductor is uncharged, so any induced charges would have to balance.

Wait, but here's a charge +q inside the cavity. So how does that affect the conductor? Well, the conductor is initially neutral. So when you put a charge inside the cavity, the conductor will respond by inducing charges on its inner and outer surfaces. But since the conductor itself is neutral, the total induced charge must be zero. So the inside surface will have an induced charge of -q (because it's opposite to the charge inside), and the outer surface must have +q to balance, since the conductor as a whole is neutral. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. The conductor is uncharged, so the sum of all induced charges must be zero. So the inner surface must have -q (because it's induced by the +q in the cavity), and the outer surface must have +q? Because the conductor's total charge is zero, so -q (inner) + outer = 0. So outer must be +q.

Wait, no, wait. If the conductor is initially neutral, and you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor would have -q as induced charge. But the outer surface must then have +q, because the total conductor charge is zero. So the conductor's net charge is +q (outer surface) + (-q inner) = 0. Oh wait, no, wait: the conductor's own charge is zero. So any induced charges must sum to zero. So the inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q, because -q + (+q) = 0. Okay, that makes sense.

So, for points outside the conductor, like point P, the electric field would be due to the charges outside the conductor. Because Gauss's law tells us that the field outside a conductor is due to the net charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface outside. So the Gaussian surface at P would enclose the conductor, so the total charge enclosed is +q (the outer surface charge). So the field should
