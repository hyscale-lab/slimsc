Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on angular momentum, but let's think through this.

The question gives me that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is equal to c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h over 4π. And S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh yeah, S here must be the Pauli matrices. The Pauli Y matrix, right? So the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and each corresponds to a component of the spin operator.

So the setup is that Ay is c times the Pauli Y matrix. Let me write out what Ay looks like. So c is h/(4π), so:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Wait, but wait. Pauli matrices are usually represented as σx, σy, σz. Yeah, the σy matrix is exactly that—so S is σy. So Ay is (h/(4π)) * σy.

Now, the problem asks about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay, and see which of the options is correct.

Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So let's compute that. The matrix Ay is:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0      (h/(4π)) * (-i) ]
[ (h/(4π)) * i      (h/(4π)) * 0 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0, -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), 0 ]

So the matrix is:

[ 0, a ]
[ a*, 0 ]

where a = -i h/(4π). Wait, no, a is -i times (h/(4π)). So the matrix is:

0   (-i h/(4π))
i h/(4π)  0

So to find the eigenvalues, I set up the equation:

| Ay - λ I | = 0

Which is:

| (-λ  )       (-i h/(4π)) |
| (i h/(4π))   (-λ)       | =
