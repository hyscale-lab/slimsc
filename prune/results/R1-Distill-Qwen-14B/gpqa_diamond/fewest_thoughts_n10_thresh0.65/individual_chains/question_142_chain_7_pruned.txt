Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question is about the density matrix ρ given by (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubit space. The options are A to D with different r vectors. 

Wait, I remember that a density matrix is a way to represent the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix, right?

So the given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me compute what this matrix looks like. 

Each term |i⟩⟨i| is a projector matrix. |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1, 0], [0, 1]], which is the identity matrix. Then multiply by 1/2, so the density matrix is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. 

Oh wait, that's the maximally mixed state. Because it's completely unpolarized—it treats |0⟩ and |1⟩ equally. So this should correspond to the completely mixed state in the Bloch sphere representation.

Wait, what's the Bloch sphere? Right, any single qubit state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The
