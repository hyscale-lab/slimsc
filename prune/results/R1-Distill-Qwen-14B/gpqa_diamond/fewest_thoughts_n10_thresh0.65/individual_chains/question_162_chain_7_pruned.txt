Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2 using the given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to work through this step by step.

First, the question gives me the metric:

ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²)

I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor determines the geometry of the spacetime. But this seems to be a two-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy. Wait, but pseudosphere usually refers to a two-dimensional surface embedded in three dimensions, but perhaps here it's treated in 2D spacetime? Or maybe it's a different kind of geometry.

Wait, pseudosphere—oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But more importantly, the area in such a metric would involve integrating the area element over the surface.

So, the area element in a metric is found by taking the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor components. Let me recall how that works.

The metric in this case is written in terms of dx² and dy². Let me represent it in matrix form. The metric tensor g has components g_xx, g_yy, and the off-diagonal terms. Since the cross terms (like dxdy) aren't present, the off-diagonal terms are zero.

So, g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²)
g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²)
g_xy = 0
g_yx = 0

The determinant of the metric tensor g is then g_xx * g_yy, since it's diagonal. So determinant g = (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

The area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So,

dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy

Wait, because sqrt of (32/(4-x²-y²)) squared is just 32/(4 - ...). So the area element is 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Wait, but wait a second. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So this would mean that the metric is only defined where 4 - x² - y² > 0, to avoid division by zero or negative values, which would complicate things. So the domain is x² + y² < 4, meaning the radius is less than 2. Hmm, but the radius we're considering is 2. So maybe that's the boundary.

Now, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. But wait, in the given metric, I'm not sure if it's a pseudosphere or a regular sphere. Or maybe it's a hyperbolic space?

Wait, pseudosphere refers to a surface with constant negative curvature. Let's think about the metric given. The standard metric for a sphere in 2D is ds² = (r²/(1 + (x² + y²)/r²))^{-1} (dx² + dy²), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the metric for hyperbolic space in isometric coordinates is something like ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(something with r²), but I'm not exactly remembering.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature to see what kind of geometry this is. The Gaussian curvature K can be found from the metric. For a metric ds² = E (dx² + dy²), where E is a function, the curvature is K = - (1/(2E)) * [ (E_xx + E_yy) ] , but I'm not sure about that formula. Alternatively, I might have to compute the Ricci scalar, but for 2D, the Gaussian curvature is sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the Gaussian curvature from the metric. For a metric given as ds² = a(x,y)² (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - (1/(2a²)) [ a_{xx} + a_{yy} ] 

Wait, let me make sure. Another approach: the Gaussian curvature for a metric in
