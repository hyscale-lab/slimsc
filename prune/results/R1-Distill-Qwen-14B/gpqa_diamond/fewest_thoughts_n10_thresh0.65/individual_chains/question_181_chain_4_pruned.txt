Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain branch of reactions in the Sun's core stops. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutesâ€”oh, that's the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So, if the pp-III reactions stopped, the effects would be noticed here only after that time delay. Interesting.

So, the problem is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). We need to find the ratio of their fluxes after the pp-III branch stops.

Wait, first, I should remember what the pp-III branch is. I think the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, then pp-II goes to helium-3, and pp-III is about the fusion of two helium-3 nuclei into helium-4, releasing two protons. Oh wait, but the neutrinos in the Sun come mainly from the pp-III branch, specifically the beta plus decay steps.

So if the pp-III stops, that would mean that the main source of those neutrinos is gone. But wait, how does the pp-III process relate to neutrino emission?

In the pp-III process, two He-3 nuclei (each made of two protons and one neutron) fuse to form He-4. But during this process, each He-3 has a proton that is a beta-plus decay product, right? So each He-3 comes from a H-3 (tritium) which decayed into He-3 via beta-plus decay. And each H-3 decay emits a neutrino. So each He-3 has a neutrino associated with its creation.

Wait, more accurately, in the pp-I process, a proton and a neutron combine to make a deuterium nucleus, emitting a positron and a neutrino. But in the pp-II and pp-III processes, I think the main neutrino emission is from the beta decay of boron-8 (I might be mixing things up). Or wait, maybe the main solar neutrinos are from the decay of beryllium-7 into lithium-7, which releases a neutrino. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the standard solar neutrino production: the main source is the pp-III branch. So, in the pp-III branch, each He-3 nucleus is formed by the decay of H-3 (tritium), which undergoes beta-plus decay, producing a He-3 and emitting a neutrino. So each He-3 has a neutrino emitted when it's created. Then, when two He-3 nuclei fuse into He-4, they release two protons. But wait, does that produce neutrinos? Or are all the relevant neutrinos from the initial creation of He-3?

So, the neutrinos from the Sun are mostly from the decay of H-3 into He-3, which happens in the pp-I branch, right? Or is that the case?

No, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let's think again. The pp chain starts
