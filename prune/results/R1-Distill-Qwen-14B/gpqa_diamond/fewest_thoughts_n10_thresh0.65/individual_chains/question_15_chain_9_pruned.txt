Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Wait, the question says that both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and their stars have the same radius, but the star for Planet_1 is twice as massive. Interesting.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. The formula I think is something like the probability P is proportional to (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by something else? Or maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius?

Wait, no, more accurately, the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, they might approximate it as R_star / a. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective) is actually based on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. So the probability increases when the star is larger or the planet's orbit is smaller because it's more likely to block our view.

Wait, no, no, more precisely, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), right? Because the area of the star is πR², but the geometric probability is (R_p + R_star) / a. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the transit probability formula is (R_star / a) * (R_p / R_star)^2, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, I think I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up right now, so I'll have to recall. The probability that a planet transits its star as seen from Earth is approximately R*/a, where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (assuming a circular orbit). Because the planet needs to pass in front of the star's disk. So the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance.

Wait, but actually, I think it's (R_star / a) squared? No, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think of it
