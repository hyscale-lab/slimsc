Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is about which symmetries all operators in the SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. I remember that SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model, preserving some symmetries.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is fundamental in relativity. All the terms in the Lagrangian should respect Lorentz symmetry because that's a basic requirement for any relativistic quantum field theory. So operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is correct.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. Wait, but SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning it respects Lorentz symmetry, which is part of Poincare. But do the operators necessarily respect the full Poincare symmetry? Or maybe they don't need to because the SMEFT is effective, and perhaps some terms could break translation symmetry? Wait, no, the effective theory still lives in a Lorentz-invariant spacetime, so translation symmetry should hold. So operators must respect Poincare. So option 2 is correct as well.

CP symmetry is another thing. I think the SMEFT doesn't necessarily have to preserve CP symmetry. Because some of the operators could be CP-odd. For example, the dimension-six operators include things like (Hâ€  H)^2, which is CP-even, but others might not be. Wait
