Okay, so I've got this question about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because orbital period depends on the distance and the star's mass. 

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So even though one star is more massive, their sizes are the same. 

I think the probability of a transit depends on the inclination of the orbit relative to us. The formula I remember is that the probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (R_planet / R_star), but wait, no. Wait, the transit probability is roughly (R_star / a), where R_star is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because for a circular orbit, the planet has to be in the right plane so that its path crosses our line of sight. 

Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is roughly (R_star / a) multiplied by the probability of the orbital inclination being just right. But I think the exact formula is (R_star / a) * (1 / (1
