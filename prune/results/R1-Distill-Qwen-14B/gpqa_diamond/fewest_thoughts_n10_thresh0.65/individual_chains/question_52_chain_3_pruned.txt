Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels.

Alright, so the star has certain parameters: 1.5 solar radius, 1.1 solar masses. But maybe those details aren't directly important for this particular question. The main points are about the effective temperature when spots are present and absent.

So, when the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does temperature drop? I remember that sunspots are cooler regions on the Sun's surface. So when parts of the star are covered by spots, they're emitting less flux, which lowers the overall effective temperature.

But wait, the effective temperature is a measure of the total emitted radiation. So when spots cover part of the surface, the star's emission is reduced, hence the Teff goes down. Ok, that makes sense.

Now, the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we're to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

The key here is probably the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of different energy levels in
