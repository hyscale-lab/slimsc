Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate. The solution has a cobalt concentration of 1e-2 M and thiocyanate concentration of 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants relate to the formation of complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is. So, the complexes with higher β will form more, right?

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue ones are the ones with two SCN- ions attached. So, that would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, right? Because I remember that Co with two SCN- is blue, whereas with one (pink) or more might be different colors.

So, the complexes are Co(SCN)_n^(2-n), where n is the number of SCN- attached. The stability constants βn are given. Wait, I'm a bit confused about how the stability constants are defined. Oh right, the stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. For example, for the first complex:

Co²+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ CoSCN^(+), with β1 = 9.

Then the second complex would be CoSCN^+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₂^(2+), with β2 = 40.

Wait, but wait, I've read that sometimes the overall β for the n=2 complex is the product of β1 and β2. Or maybe each β represents the formation from the previous complex. So the overall β for Co(SCN)_2^2+ would be β1 * β2.

Wait, no, maybe each β is the stepwise formation. So the total formation constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of β1 to βn. So for n=1, it's β1; for n=2, β1*β2; for n=3
