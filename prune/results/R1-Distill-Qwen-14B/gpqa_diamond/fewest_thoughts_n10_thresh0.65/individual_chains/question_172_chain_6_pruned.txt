Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's think. The question is about the excitation of iron atoms in two stars and how that relates to their temperatures. I remember that when atoms are excited, it's about their energy levels. Oh right, this probably involves something called the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. Right, the equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ). 

In this case, the problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, let me parse that. For a specific transition, the excitation level in star 1 is twice that in star 2. So the ratio n1/n2 is 2. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around? No, no, in star_1, the excitation is higher, so n1 (the number in the higher energy level) is higher than n2. Oh wait, wait. Wait, noâ€”actually, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So I think it's referring to the population of a specific energy level. Let's say the higher energy level is level i and the lower is level j. So for each star, we have n_i and n_j. But the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited, so probably the population of the excited state in star_1 is higher than in star_2.

Wait, the exact wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Oh, so for a specific energy level, which I'll call level i, the population in star_1 (n1_i) is twice that in star_2 (n2_i). So n1_i = 2 * n2_i.

But wait, wait, in the photosphere, the excitation is about the distribution of atoms in different energy levels. The Boltzmann equation equates the ratio of populations to a function of temperature.

Assuming LTE (local thermal equilibrium), so the distribution should follow the Boltzmann factor.

So for each star, the population ratio between two energy levels is given by
