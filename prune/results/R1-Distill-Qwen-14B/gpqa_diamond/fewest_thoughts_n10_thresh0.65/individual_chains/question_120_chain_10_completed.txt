Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and we're to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power laws.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, and if a star has a parallax of 0.5 parsecs, it's twice as far.

Now, stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that the number density of stars is the same everywhere. So the number of stars in a volume depends on the size of that volume.

Wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So I need to find how N, the number of stars, relates to plx when plx changes by a small amount, say dplx.

Let me think about the volume. For a given distance d (or equivalently, parallax plx = 1/d), the volume of a spherical shell at that distance with thickness dr would be 4πd² dr. But since plx is 1/d, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of plx.

So, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. Then, dr = derivative of d with respect to plx. Let's compute that. dr/dplx = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx. That would be -1/(plx²). Hmm, so dr = -dplx/(plx²). Wait, but since plx is positive and increasing as distance decreases, maybe I should consider the thickness in terms of plx.

Alternatively, since plx is 1/d, as plx increases, d decreases. So for a small change in plx, d changes by dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Because plx increases with decreasing d.

Now, the volume element in terms of plx. The shell at parallax plx has a thickness dplx. What's the volume? The radius is d = 1/plx, so the shell's volume would be 4π (d)^2 * dr. Substituting d = 1/plx and dr = -dplx/(plx²), the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-dplx/(plx²))).

Wait, that gives 4π (1/(plx^2)) * (-dplx/(plx^2)) ) = 4π (-dplx)/(plx^4). Hmm, but the negative sign just indicates direction; since we're considering the change as plx increases, the volume is positive. So the volume is proportional to dplx/(plx^4).

But wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think about the number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + dplx. The volume of that shell is 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * (d d), where d d is the change in distance. But d d = derivative of d with respect to plx times dplx. Since d = 1/plx, dd/dplx = -1/(plx²). So dd = - (1/(plx²)) dplx.

Putting it all together, the volume is 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * ( - dplx / (plx²) ) ) = -4π dplx/(plx^4). But since we're looking for the absolute value, the volume is (4π dplx)/(plx^4).

Wait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me think again. The shell volume is 4π r² dr, where r is the radius (distance d), and dr is the change in radius. So if plx is small (so d is large), dr is the change in distance. So r = 1/plx, and dr = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx times dplx. The derivative is -(1/plx²), so dr = -dplx/(plx²).

Therefore, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-dplx/(plx²)) = -4π dplx/(plx^4). The negative sign shows that as plx increases, the distance decreases, but the volume is positive. So the volume is proportional to dplx/(plx^4).

But wait, the number of stars in that volume depends on the number density. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is constant, say n. So the number of stars in the shell is n * volume.

So number of stars N = n * [4π (d)^2 * dr] → substituting d = 1/plx and dr = -dplx/(plx²), so N = n * [4π (1/plx²) * (-dplx/(plx²)))] = n * [ -4π dplx / plx^4 ].

But since we're considering a small increment dplx, the number of stars in that small range is proportional to dplx / plx^4.

Wait, the question asks for the number per unit range of plx, which is the number per dplx. So N is proportional to (1/plx^4) * dplx. But when considering per unit plx (i.e., per dplx=1), N would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would mean the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. But looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So that's one of the choices.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.

Alternatively, maybe the approach is to find the differential number of stars dN as a function of plx. Since the number density is constant, n.

dN = n * (volume) = n * 4π (d)^2 * dd, where dd is the change in distance. But since plx = 1/d, dd = -d^2 dplx. So substituting d = 1/plx, dd = -(1/plx)^2 dplx.

So dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * [ - (1/plx^2) dplx ] = n *4π (-1) (1/plx^4) dplx.

But the number of stars in a small interval is positive, so dN = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of plx is (dN/dplx) = n *4π (1/plx^4).

Wait, but wait. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So for a given plx, how many stars are in a range dplx. So, the number per dplx would be proportional to 1/plx^4 times dplx. So the number per unit plx (i.e., when dplx=1) would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer would be option A, 1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the way the distribution works, the number might depend on 1/plx squared. Let me think of another approach. Maybe using flux or something else. No, the question is about distribution in space, not how they appear in the sky.

Alternatively, consider that the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume. So for a fixed number density, the number in a shell is proportional to the volume of the shell.

The volume of a shell is 4π r^2 dr. Since r = 1/plx, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 dr.

But dr is the change in r, which is (change in d) as plx changes. And dr = (dr/dplx) dplx. dr/dplx is derivative of (1/plx) which is -1/(plx^2). So dr = -dplx/(plx^2).

Putting it all together, volume is 4π (1/plx^2) * ( -dplx/(plx^2) ) → 4π (-dplx)/(plx^4). The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, r decreases, but the volume is positive.

So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to 1/plx^4 times dplx. So when we look at the number per unit plx (i.e., dplx=1), it's proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct option should be A, ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. For a uniformly distributed population of stars, the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself.

The volume of a spherical shell at a distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 dr.
\]

To express \( dr \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \), we use the relationship \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \), where the negative sign accounts for the fact that \( d \) decreases as \( \text{plx} \) increases. Substituting this into the volume expression:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = -\frac{4\pi d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction of change, but we are interested in the magnitude. Thus, the volume is proportional to \( \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Since the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume, the number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) (i.e., \( d\text{plx} = 1 \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
