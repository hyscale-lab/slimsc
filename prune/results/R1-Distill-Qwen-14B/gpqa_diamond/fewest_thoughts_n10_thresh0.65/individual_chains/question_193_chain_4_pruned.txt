Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what it's asking. Okay, the question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx is small, the star is far away, and if plx is big, the star is nearby.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So they're asking for the relationship between the number of stars and the distance r, per unit range of distance. Let's break it down.

First, the given relationship is number varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let's express plx in terms of distance. Parallax plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs, I think). So distance r is 1/plx. That means plx is 1/r.

So substituting plx into the equation: number of stars N is proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that would be r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait a second, how does that translate into the change per unit distance? Because the question says, how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range. Oh, so maybe I need to think about the differential number of stars as r changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr would be proportional to r^4, because the volume of the shell is 4πr² dr, but multiplied by the density which depends on r. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of density.

Wait, if N is proportional to r^5, that's the total number up to a certain distance. But the question is about per unit distance, which would be the derivative of N with respect to r. Let's see.

Wait, no, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So it's about the rate of change, perhaps the number per unit distance. So N is proportional to r^5, so dN/dr would be 5 r^4. So per unit distance, it's increasing with r^4. But looking at
