Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) with higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond the SM physics. Effective theories usually maintain the symmetries of the underlying theory, which in this case is the SM. So what symmetries does the SM respect?

The SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all its operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Since SMEFT includes the SM, it should also respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is correct.

Wait, what about Poincare symmetry? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The SM is Poincare-invariant because it's a relativistic theory. So the SMEFT operators should also obey Poincare symmetry because they extend the SM. So option 2 must be correct too. So looking at the options, options A and C include 1 and 2.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetries. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in general because of CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. However, SMEFT's operators can include terms that violate CP. So CP symmetry is not necessarily required for SMEFT operators. Some operators in SMEFT might violate CP. So option 3 isn't a must.

What about CPT symmetry? I remember that in quantum field theory, all theories are required to respect CPT symmetry because it's connected to the unitarity and consistency of the theory. So SMEFT, being an effective field theory, must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

So putting it together: the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4), but not necessarily CP (3). Wait, waitâ€”wait. Wait, does SMEFT necessarily have to respect Poincare symmetry?

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. In effective theories, operators are classified by their dimension, and the theory is built such that the symmetries are respected. But wait, SMEFT is constructed to maintain the same symmetries as the SM. The SM is Poincare symmetric, so SMEFT must also be Poincare symmetric. So 2 is correct.

So which options include 1
