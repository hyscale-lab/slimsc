Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The question gives the components Px, Py, and Pz as specific 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. That means the direction vector n can be represented as (n_x, 0, n_z), since it's in the x-z plane. So any direction in that plane can be parameterized with an angle θ from the z-axis, maybe. But I'm not entirely sure about the parametrization yet.

The eigenvector we're looking for corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I need to find a vector |v> such that when the operator P acts on it, it's multiplied by ħ/2. 

First, I should probably express the operator P in terms of its components. Since P is a vector operator, it should be the sum of the components multiplied by their respective unit vectors. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given that n_x and n_z are direction cosines, they might relate to the angle θ that n makes with the z-axis. For instance, if θ is the angle between n and the z-axis, then n_x = sinθ cosφ, but since n is in x-z plane, φ would be zero or something? Hmm. Wait, no, because in x-z plane, any direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is measured from the z-axis. Yeah, that makes sense.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Because if θ is 0, the direction is along +z, and if θ is 90 degrees, it's along +x. So I can express P as (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z.

Wait, actually, the direction vector n could also have magnitude 1. So n is a unit vector, so n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, with θ between 0 and π/2 perhaps, but I think it can go beyond if allowed. But for now, let's just say n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ.

So the operator P is proportional to sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z. But each of these P components is given as ħ/2 times a matrix.

Wait, let me write down each P component:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So when I construct P
