Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

The problem says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix and it's given by c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/(4π), and S has specific entries. The first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So I should write down what Ay looks like.

Let me calculate c first. Since c = h/(4π), when I multiply that by the matrix S, the elements will be scaled by this factor. So, Ay would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by each element of S. So the matrix Ay is:

[ 0*(h/(4π)) , (-i)*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)) , 0*(h/(4π)) ]

Simplify that, it becomes:

[ 0 , (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π) , 0 ]

So Ay is this 2x2 matrix. Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. I remember that to find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

Let me set up that equation. The matrix Ay - λI is:

[ -λ , (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π) , -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

So determinant = λ² - [ (-i)(i) * (h²/(4π)^2) ) ]

Wait, let me compute that cross term. (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes (h²/(4π)^2) * 1.

So determinant equation is λ² - (h²)/(16π²) = 0.

Solving that: λ² = h²/(16π²), so λ = ± h/(4π). Wait, but that's the same as c, which is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are c and -c, so a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but that's the real part. Wait, wait, no, no, wait. Wait a minute! Oh wait, no, in the matrix, the elements are complex, but the eigenvalues might be real or complex? Or are they? Wait, the matrix is Hermitian? Because S seems like the Pauli Y matrix. Oh wait, the S matrix given is:

[0, -i]
[i, 0]

Which is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i, because the standard Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is exactly what S is. Wait, no, the standard Pauli Y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], right? So S is the Pauli Y matrix. So Y is Hermitian because Y† = Y. So when you multiply by a real constant c, Ay = c Y should also be Hermitian. Because c is real. So Ay is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues should be real. Because all Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues.

Oh wait, that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion. Because when I solved for λ, I got ± h/(4π), both real. So the eigenvalues a are real. So the options that mention imaginary parts are wrong. So looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh or similar. That can't be right because the eigenvalues are real. So options A and B which mention imaginary parts are incorrect. So options C and D are left.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the determinant.

The matrix Ay is:

[ 0 , (-i h)/(4π) ]

[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

The characteristic equation is (λ^2) - [
