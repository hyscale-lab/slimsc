Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be tricky. But let me take it step by step. 

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. I need to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector from the given options.

Hmm, let me recall. The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be represented in spherical coordinates. Since it's in the x-z plane, the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, right? And φ would be the angle in the x-y plane, but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π? No, wait, no, the problem says it's an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so φ can vary, but maybe it's not needed here because the operator is along n. Hmm, not sure yet.

The operator P is a vector operator, so it would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction unit vector. So P = n · (Px, Py, Pz), where n is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But wait, in this case, since n lies in the x-z plane, φ is either 0 or π? No, wait, no. Because in the x-z plane, the direction can point anywhere between the x and z axes. So φ is 0, but wait, no, wait. The x-z plane is the plane where y=0. So the point on the unit sphere would have coordinates (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, the direction is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). If φ is 0, then the x component is maximum, and if it's π, it's negative. But for directions in the x-z plane, φ can be any value, but wait, wait, no. Because the x-z plane is where y=0, so the direction vector is (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ)? No, wait, no, because if y=0, then the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ is 0 or π, but that's only for the x-axis. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, any direction in the x-z plane can be described with a single angle θ from the z-axis. So the unit vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but that's only if φ=0. Wait, no, actually, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the angle φ is 0 or π, depending on whether it's in the positive x direction or negative. Hmm, but the problem says "arbitrary direction in the x-z plane", so perhaps φ is 0. But maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just considering an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so the vector n can be parametrized as (x, 0, z), but normalized. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), assuming θ is the angle from the z-axis.

So the operator P along n would be P = n · (Px, Py, Pz) = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Given that, let me write down the expressions for each component.

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

So n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ, since the unit vector in x-z plane is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), with θ being the polar angle from the z-axis.

Therefore, the operator P along n is:

P = (sinθ)(Px) + (cosθ)(Pz)
= (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix.

Each term is a matrix. Let me compute:

First term: sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives:
[[0, sinθ],
 [sinθ, 0]]

Second term: cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] gives:
[[cosθ, 0],
 [0, -cosθ]]

Adding these together:

The combined matrix is:
[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

And this is multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator is:

P = (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]]

We are to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

So, let's write the equation (P - (+ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

Let me compute P - (ħ/2) I:

(P - (ħ/2) I) = (ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]] - (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,1]]

Factor out ħ/2:

= (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
            [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ - 1 ] ]

The eigenvector equation is this matrix multiplied by the vector [a, b]^T equals zero.

So, the equations are:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

We can write these as two equations:

(1) (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
(2) sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Let me see if these are multiples of each other.

Let me check equation (1) multiplied by sinθ:

sinθ (cosθ -1) a + sin^2θ b = 0

Equation (2) multiplied by (cosθ -1):

sinθ (cosθ -1) a + (-cosθ -1)(cosθ -1) b = 0

Wait, maybe it's easier to find a ratio between a and b from the first equation.

From equation (1):

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b

=> a / b = - sinθ / (cosθ -1 )

Hmm, but (cosθ -1) is negative when cosθ <1, which is for θ not zero. Let me note that.

But another approach: since the two equations are linearly dependent, so I can just use the first equation.

So, equation (1):

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

Let me solve for a in terms of b:

a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Simplify the denominator: cosθ -1 = -2 sin^2(θ/2), using the identity cosθ = 1 - 2 sin^2(θ/2)

Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So,

a = [ - (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) / ( -2 sin^2(θ/2) ) ] b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The negatives cancel, and 2 sin^2 cancels with 2 sin.

So,

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] / [ 2 sin^2(θ/2) ) ] * b

Which simplifies to:

a = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * b = cot(θ/2) b

So, a = cot(θ/2) b

Let me write the eigenvector as [a, b]^T = b [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]^T.

But to make it a vector, we can choose b=1 (or any scalar multiple), so the eigenvector is proportional to [cot(θ/2), 1]^T.

But I should check if this works in equation (2).

Let me plug a = cot(θ/2) and b=1 into equation (2):

sinθ * a + (-cosθ -1) * b = 0

a = cot(θ/2) = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ]

So,

sinθ * [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] + (-cosθ -1) * 1 = 0

Let me compute each term:

sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)
So:

sinθ * [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) * [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] = 2 cos^2(θ/2)

Then the other term is (-cosθ -1). Let's compute cosθ:

cosθ = 1 - 2 sin^2(θ/2)

So,

- (1 - 2 sin^2(θ/2) ) -1 = -1 + 2 sin^2(θ/2) -1 = -2 + 2 sin^2(θ/2)

Putting it all together:

2 cos^2(θ/2) -2 + 2 sin^2(θ/2) = 0 ?

Wait, 2 cos^2 + 2 sin^2 = 2 (cos^2 + sin^2) ) = 2*1=2.

So,

2 - 2 =0. Yes, that works. So the solution from equation (1) also satisfies equation (2). So the eigenvector is correct.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [cot(θ/2), 1]^T.

But wait, sometimes when a factor is in the denominator, it's better to write in terms of sine and cosine.

Alternatively, let's express it as:

a = cot(θ/2) = [cos(θ/2)]/[sin(θ/2)]

So, the vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] / sin(θ/2)

Wait, let me see. Let me set the vector as [a, b] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] multiplied by 1/sin(θ/2). Because:

If a = [cos(θ/2)/ sin(θ/2) ] = cot(θ/2), then the vector is [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

So, another way to write this vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] multiplied by some scaling factor.

Wait, but let me compute the normalization. The eigenvector must be normalized.

The vector before normalization is [ a, b ] = [
