Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is represented by Ay, which is a 2x2 matrix. The setup is that Ay equals c times S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. Oh right, the matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0).

The question is asking which statement is correct when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. There are four options, A to D.

First, I think I should figure out what the matrix Ay looks like. Since Ay = c * S, and c is h/(4π), I can compute the matrix by multiplying each element of S by c. Let me write that out. So the first row of S is (0, -i), so multiplied by c, it becomes (0, -i c). The second row is (i, 0), which becomes (i c, 0). So the matrix Ay is:

[ 0        -i c ]
[i c       0 ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - λ I) = 0. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d] is ad - bc.

So let's set up the matrix (Ay - λ I):

[ -λ     -i c ]
[i c     -λ ]

The determinant would be (-λ)(-λ) - (-i c)(i c) = λ² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Wait, let's compute (-i c)(i c). Multiplying them: (-i)(i) = -(i²) = -(-1) = 1. So (i c)(-i c) = (i * -i) c² = (1) c². Wait, wait, maybe I should compute it correctly. Let me recompute that. So the product is (-i c)*(i c) = (-i)(i) * c². 

-i * i is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So that product is (1) c². So the determinant becomes λ² - c².

So the characteristic equation is λ² - c² = 0 → λ² = c² → λ = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are c and -c. Let's substitute c with h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait, no, wait: because the equation is λ² = c², so λ can be ±c. So the eigenvalues are c and -c. So for Ay, the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). Wait, wait, because c is h/(4π), so a can only be ±c, which is ±h/(4pi). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, right?

Wait a second, that's interesting because S is a Pauli matrix, and perhaps it's related to spin in the y-direction. Wait, the Pauli matrices usually have eigenvalues
