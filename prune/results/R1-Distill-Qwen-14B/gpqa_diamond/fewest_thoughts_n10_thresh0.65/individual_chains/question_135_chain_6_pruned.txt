Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to work through it. The question is about the decay modes of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, so I need to figure out the allowed decay products based on that.

First, I remember that the decay products of a particle depend on its mass and the available energy. Since X is a boson here, and the Lagrangian describes how it interacts with fermions, I should look at the possible fermion-antifermion pairs it can decay into.

Looking at the Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. The term probably involves a Yukawa coupling between the boson X and fermions. The general form of a Yukawa interaction is something like L = g ψ ψ X, where ψ is a fermion field and X is the boson. So here, the interaction term is probably proportional to X times a fermion bilinear.

So the interaction would allow the boson X to couple to fermion-antifermion pairs. So when X decays, it can produce any fermion and its antiparticle as long as the energy is sufficient.

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to remember the masses of the known fermions. Let's list them:

Leptons:
- Electron (e): about 0.511 MeV (so negligible compared to 6 GeV)
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, like 173 GeV, so way above 6 GeV.

So for a fermion pair production, the sum of the masses must be less than the mass of X. Because in the rest frame of X, the total energy is the mass of X. Each fermion and antifermion must each have a mass less than half of 6 GeV, because 6 GeV has to split into two particles. Wait, actually, the threshold is when the sum of the two fermion masses is less than the mass of X. But for a fermion and antifermion, each has mass m, so the combined rest mass is 2m. So 2m < 6 GeV → m < 3 GeV.

So each fermion must have a mass below 3 GeV. Let me check:

Electron: way below. So e+ e- is allowed.

Muon: ~0.1 GeV, so 2*0.1 is 0.2, which is way less than 6. So μ+ μ- is allowed.

Tau: each is 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78
