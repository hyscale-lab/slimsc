Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should prioritize observing that one. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet 1's period is three times shorter than Planet 2's. So, if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. Also, the host stars have the same radius, but the star for Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. 

Wait, wait. Oh, right, transit probability depends on several factors. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the formula P = R_star / a, where R_star is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, actually, the formula I recall is P = (R_*/ a) * (1 / (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3))) ), but wait, no, maybe that's for Doppler shift or something else. Hmm.

Wait, no, I think the transit probability is roughly proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by some factors. Let me think. The transit probability for a planet is the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the orbit, considering the inclination. But since the orbits are random, the probability depends on whether the planet's orbit is edge-on enough. 

Wait, the formula I remember is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 -
