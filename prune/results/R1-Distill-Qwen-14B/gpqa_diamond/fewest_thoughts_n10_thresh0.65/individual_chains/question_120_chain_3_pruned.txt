Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax value itself. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think about what I know regarding stars and parallax.

Parallax is a measure of how much a star appears to shift in position relative to more distant stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. The formula I remember is that the distance to a star (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of its parallax (plx) in arcseconds. So, distance d = 1 / plx.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution usually means that the number of stars is the same in a given volume. Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's about the number per unit range of parallax. So maybe it's considering how stars are distributed in terms of their distances, which relates to parallax since a higher parallax means a closer star.

Let me think about the volume of space where stars are located. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (number per unit volume) is constant. Let's say n is the number density. So in a small volume dV, the number of stars would be n * dV.

Now, parallax plx is related to distance. So plx = 1/d. So, as distance increases, parallax decreases. Let me think about how the parallax relates to the volume.

If I consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d with a thickness dd, the volume of that shell would be the surface area of the sphere multiplied by the thickness. The surface area is 4πd², so the volume is 4πd² dd.

But since d = 1/plx, substituting that in, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 (d plx). Wait, because if d = 1/plx, then dd (a small change in d) would be - (1/plx²) d plx, but since we're dealing with positive volumes, maybe I can ignore the negative sign for now. So the volume of the shell is approximately 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx), where d plx is the small change in parallax.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify. If I have a parallax plx, then the corresponding distance is d = 1/plx. If we consider a small range of par
