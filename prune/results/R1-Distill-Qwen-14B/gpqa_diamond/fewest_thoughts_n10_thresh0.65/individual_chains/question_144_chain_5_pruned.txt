Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember from my studies that mesons are subatomic particles, but I'm not exactly clear on all the details. Let me see what the question says.

The question states that X is a meson resonance with given parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. We need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A through D, each with different values, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Wait, mean decay distance... I think that has to do with how far the particle travels before decaying. I remember something about the particle's lifetime and velocity. The formula I think is something like mean decay length equals velocity multiplied by lifetime. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula.

Let me think. The mean lifetime τ of a particle is related to its width Γ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but I think for the mean lifetime, τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). Or wait, is it τ = ħ/(Γ) multiplied by some factor? Because I've heard that Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the inverse of the lifetime.

So the formula should be τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). Then, the lifetime τ determines how long the particle lives on average. But to find the mean decay distance, I also need the velocity of the particle because it's moving during that time. So the mean distance L would be v * τ.

But wait, L = v * β * c * τ, where β is v/c and c is the speed of light. Oh right, because v is in terms of c, so beta is v/c. So combining everything, L = beta * c * tau.

Wait, but how do I get beta? Beta is the velocity of the particle divided by the speed of light. I can find beta using the energy and mass. The energy of the particle is given as E_X = 8 GeV. So the energy E is related to the rest mass m and the velocity beta via the relativistic energy equation: E = gamma * m c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²).

So gamma = E/(m c²). Wait, but the units here
