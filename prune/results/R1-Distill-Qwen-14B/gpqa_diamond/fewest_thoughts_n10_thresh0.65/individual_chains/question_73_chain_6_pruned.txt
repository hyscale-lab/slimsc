Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. Wait, wait, but when you're dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract them normally, right? Because in special relativity, velocities don't add like regular numbers. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities relativistically.

Oh right, the velocity addition formula! The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Since both are moving in the same direction, I think I subtract their speeds. So v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. Let me plug those in.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Now the denominator: 1 minus (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let's compute that. 0.6*0.5 is 0.3, and c squared over c squared is 1. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7. Let me compute that: 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857... so about 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now, the next part is the total energy. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, right? The total energy would be the sum of their energies. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c squared. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me calculate each astronaut's gamma.

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

v = 0.6c. So v²/c² is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is
