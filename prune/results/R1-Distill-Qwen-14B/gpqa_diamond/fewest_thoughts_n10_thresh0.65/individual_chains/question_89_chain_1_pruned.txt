Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Okay, the question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-like molecule. So 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the cage.

The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction, probably an E2 mechanism. Since there are two bromine atoms, maybe it undergoes dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but in this case, with two Br atoms, maybe it will form an epoxide? No, wait, KOH can lead to elimination to form an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure, so where would the elimination happen?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane probably has two adjacent Br atoms on the adamantane structure. When heated with KOH, it's likely to eliminate HBr twice, forming a conjugated diene or maybe an allene? Alternatively, perhaps it forms an epoxide, but I think elimination is more likely. So each Br is on adjacent carbons, so eliminating two HBr would form a double bond between those two carbons and maybe another double bond if possible.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. The NMR data is given: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.2
