Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet orbits. The shift tells us about the star's wobble due to the planet's gravity.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both are in circular orbits. So the key here is the Doppler shift measurements—Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused 7 milliangstroms. We need to find how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. But how exactly?

I think the formula is K = (v) which is equal to ( (G * (M_p) ) / (4 * pi^2) )^(1/3) * (1 / (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, maybe that's not the exact formula. Alternatively, I recall that K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )... Hmm, but wait, since both planets have similar masses and both stars have the same mass, and the orbits are circular (so e=0), maybe some terms cancel out.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula: K = [ ( (G * M_p^3 ) / ( (M_*)^2 + M_p )^2 ) * (1/(4 pi^2)) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of another approach. Since both stars have the same mass (M*) and the planets have similar masses (M_p), the ratio of their K values should relate to the inverse cube root of their periods. Because K is inversely proportional to
