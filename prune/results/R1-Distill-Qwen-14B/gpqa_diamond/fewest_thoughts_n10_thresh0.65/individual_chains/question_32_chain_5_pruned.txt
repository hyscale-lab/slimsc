Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativity stuff. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6, and it's a Li nucleus.

So first, I think I need to find the rest mass of the Li nucleus. The rest mass energy of a nucleus can be found using the mass of its constituents. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the approximate rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Wait, I remember that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². Since Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be (3 * 938) + (3 * 939). Let me calculate that.

3 * 938 = 2814 MeV
3 * 939 = 2817 MeV
Total rest mass energy is 2814 + 2817 = 5631 MeV. Oh wait, that's 5.631 GeV, since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV.

Wait, but wait a second. The actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of its parts because of binding energy. Oh right, that's the mass defect. So maybe I shouldn't just add them directly because the actual rest mass is a bit lower. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe they are asking us to ignore that and just use the sum? Or perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.013 atomic mass units (u). Since 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c², the rest mass energy would be 6.013 * 931
