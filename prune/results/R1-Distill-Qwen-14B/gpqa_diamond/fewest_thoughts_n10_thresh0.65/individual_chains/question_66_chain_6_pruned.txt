Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries all operators must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, I remember that the SMEFT is an effective theory, meaning it's built from the Standard Model but with higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension. But what about the symmetries?

I think all operators in a consistent effective theory have to maintain the same symmetries as the original theory. Oh right, because the SMEFT should reduce to the Standard Model when the new physics is at a high scale. So what symmetries does the Standard Model have?

The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry. That's a given because it incorporates special relativity, right? So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. So point 1 is definitely in.

Then there's Poincaré symmetry. Wait, Poincaré includes Lorentz and translations. Does SMEFT require operators to respect Poincaré? Because the Standard Model does, so any effective theory should as well. I think operators in SMEFT are constructed to be Poincaré invariant. So yes, point 2 is also required.

What about CP symmetry? The Standard Model doesn't have a CP symmetry, though many of its operators preserve it. Wait, no, the Standard Model actually has CP violation in the CKM matrix. So not all operators in the SM respect CP. But wait, the SMEFT includes all possible operators, including those that might
