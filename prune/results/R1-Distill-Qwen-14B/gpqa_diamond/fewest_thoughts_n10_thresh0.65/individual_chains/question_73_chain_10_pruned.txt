Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. So, astronaut A is 2m at 0.6c, and astronaut B is 3m at 0.5c.

The question asks for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are given, so I need to calculate both values and match them.

Let me tackle the relative speed first. I remember that when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract their speeds like in classical mechanics. Because according to Einstein's theory, velocities don't just add linearly when they're close to c. So I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), right? Because the relative speed when one is moving at u and the other at v from our frame. Wait, but wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So from the perspective of one astronaut, what is the speed of the other?

Wait, let me think again. If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) but that's not right because of relativity. So I should use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, no, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the speed of B in the stationary frame and v is the speed of A. Or wait, I might have the formula backward. Let me get the exact formula.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)), but that's when the frame is moving at v relative to the original frame. Wait, no, wait. Suppose I'm in frame S, and frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. Then, the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So
