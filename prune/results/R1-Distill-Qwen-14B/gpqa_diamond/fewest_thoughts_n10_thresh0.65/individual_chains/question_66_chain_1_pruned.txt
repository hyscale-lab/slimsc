Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices given are combinations of these.

Let me try to break this down. I think Lorentz symmetry is a big one. The SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? So all the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. So that includes things like rotational and boost symmetries. So option 1 is a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's a bigger symmetry group. But isn't Poincare symmetry automatically part of any relativistic theory? Because SMEFT is a relativistic effective theory, so operators must respect Poincare. So option 2, Poincare, must also be respected. So options 1 and 2 are in, looking at the choices, that's option A: 1,2 or option C:1,2,4.

Wait, but I thought that SMEFT could have operators that break certain discrete symmetries, like CP, but maybe not. Or do they have to respect CPT? CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. I remember that the Standard Model respects C
