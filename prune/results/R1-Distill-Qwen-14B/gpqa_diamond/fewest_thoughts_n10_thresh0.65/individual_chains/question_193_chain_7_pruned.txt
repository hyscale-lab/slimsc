Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, that's an unusual relation. I remember that usually, the number of stars you can see is related to their distance and brightness.

Parallax, plx, is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit. The formula I remember is that distance r is approximately 1 divided by plx, but wait, in parsecs. So r ≈ 1 / plx.

The problem says the number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since r is inversely proportional to plx, plx is inversely proportional to r. Let me write that down.

If plx = 1/r, then 1/plx = r. So substituting into N: N ∝ (1/( (1/r) ))^5. Wait, no, let me think again. Since N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/r, then 1/(plx)^5 is (r)^5. 

Wait, let me clarify. Let's express everything in terms of r. If plx = 1/r, then 1/(plx) = r. So 1/(plx)^5 would be (r)^5. Therefore, N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, does that mean the differential number, like how many stars are there per unit distance? I think so. Because the question says, "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So perhaps the question is about the rate of change, dN/dr.

Wait, but if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to r^4. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have an r^4. Oh wait, let me check the options again.

Options are A: r^3, B: r^5, C: r^4, D: r^2. Oh, option C is r^4. Wait, but I thought if N is proportional to r^5, then the number per unit distance would be dN/dr = 5 r^4, which is proportional to r^
