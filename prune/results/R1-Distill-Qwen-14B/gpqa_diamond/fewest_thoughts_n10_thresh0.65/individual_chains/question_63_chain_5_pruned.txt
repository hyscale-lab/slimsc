Okay, so I have this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm. I remember that in such models, the molecule can absorb photons which cause transitions between energy states. The question is about finding the momentum of a photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the state with the lowest possible energy. So when it absorbs a photon, it goes to the next state with the lowest energy. But wait, what's the structure of these energy states?

I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and have both rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state would be the first vibrational state with the lowest rotational state, probably the ground state for both vibrations and rotations.

Wait, no. Wait, the fundamental vibrational state is v=0, right? So the molecule is in its v=0, and maybe rotational state J=0 as well. Or maybe it's in the first rotational state? I'm a bit confused.

But the question says, when it absorbs a photon, it goes to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, right, the next state would be the first excited state, which I think is the next higher energy level. So the photon must supply the energy difference between these two states.

So I need to calculate the energy difference between the current state and the next possible state. But I'm not sure if it's a vibrational transition or a rotational one. Or maybe both?

Wait, the problem says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which probably means that
