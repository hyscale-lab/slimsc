Okay, I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about mitochondrial function and a drug's effect on it. Let's break down the question step by step.

So, the question is about an anti-diabetes drug and whether a particular experiment would help determine its effect on mitochondria. The experiments involve various techniques, and I need to figure out which one won't help.

First, I'll recall what each of these techniques does, as they're all methods used to study cellular components, especially mitochondria.

Option A: Differential centrifugation is a common method to isolate organelles like mitochondria. After extracting mitochondria, they're using a Glucose Uptake Assay. Wait, glucose uptake... Well, mitochondria are involved in energy production, but do they directly take up glucose? I remember that in eukaryotes, glucose is typically processed in the cytoplasm, broken down into pyruvate, which then enters the mitochondria. So maybe this assay measures glucose transport into the cells or mitochondrial function indirectly. But wait, if the drug affects mitochondrial energy production, maybe it would affect how much glucose the cell takes up, or how the mitochondria process it. So this assay might show a change if the mitochondria's function is altered. So A might be a valid experiment.

Option B: Transformation with recombinant luciferase and adding luciferin. Hmm, luciferase is an enzyme used in reporter assays, like for measuring gene expression. But wait, if the cells are transformed with luciferase, maybe they're using it to measure something like ATP levels, since firefly luc
