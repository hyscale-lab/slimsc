Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with interplanar distances in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that the crystal is rhombohedral, which I remember means all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are the same. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no—rhombohedral is actually a type of hexagonal crystal system, I think. Or wait, maybe it's part of the cubic system? No, rhombohedral is a separate system where a = b = c, but the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all equal, but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, all the angles are 30 degrees, which is quite small.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait. Is that the lattice parameter 'a'? Because in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell has parameters a, b, c, but in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, right? So the interatomic distance is the same as 'a' in this case. So a = 10 Angstrom.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh yeah, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula for calculating interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2
