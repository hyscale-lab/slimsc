Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations given are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I think dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^2+? But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the structure. Cobalt can form different complexes with different numbers of thiocyanate ions. The stability constants (β values) indicate the stability of each complex relative to the ions. A higher β means a more stable complex.

So, the stability constants are given for β1 to β4. I guess βn is the stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So β1 is for CoSCN^+ (monodentate?), β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]²+ (dithiocyanato), β3 for [Co(SCN)₃]^- maybe, and β4 for [Co(SCN)₄]^2-? I'm a bit unsure about the charges, but I think the key is that each β represents the complex with n SCN-.

The problem is to find the percentage of the blue complex, which is the dithiocyanato complex, so that's the one with two SCN- ions. So, I need to calculate the fraction of Co in the form [Co(SCN)_2]²+.

I remember that when dealing with such complexes, the fraction of each species can be found using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The general approach is to use the formation of each complex step by step, considering the successive addition of SCN- ions.

Wait, but how do the stability constants work here? The stability constant (β) for a complex is given by the equation:

β_n = [Complex] / ([Co^(n-)][SCN^-]^n)

Wait, no, wait. Let's think. For a complex like [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge}, the stability constant β_n is defined as:

β_n = [ [Co(SCN)_n] ] / ( [Co^{2+}] [SCN^-]^n )

So each β_n represents the equilibrium for the nth step. But in reality, the complexes form in a stepwise manner. So, the formation of the first SCN- is governed by β1, the second by β2 (but considering the first complex), and so on.

Wait, no. I think the overall stability constant for each complex is cumulative. For example, the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]²+ would involve first forming [CoSCN]^+, then adding another SCN- to form [Co(SCN)_2]²+.

So the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]²+ would be β1 * β2, right? Because each step's β multiplies to get the overall formation.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each step is a separate equilibrium. Let me think again. The stability constants for each step are given as β1, β2, etc. So for the first complex [CoSCN]^+, the β1 is the equilibrium constant for Co²+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+.

Then, for the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]²+, it forms from [CoSCN]^+ plus another SCN^-: [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]²+. The equilibrium constant for this second step is β2.

So the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]²+ would be β1 * β2. Because each step is multiplied. Similarly, the overall β
