Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts involved, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate ions. The goal is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. Hmm, I remember that dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So we're looking for Co(SCN)₂²+ maybe?

The given data includes the total cobalt concentration [Co] as 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants are for the formation of complexes, right? So each β represents the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ions.

So the complexes would be:

- Co²+ (aq) with no SCN: just Co²+.
- Co(SCN)²+ (which is [Co(SCN)]^2+), which is the first complex, with β1=9.
- Co(SCN)₂²+ (the second complex, β2=40).
- Co(SCN)₃^+, maybe, but wait, what is the charge? Wait, each SCN- is -1. So for Co²+, each SCN- would add a -1, so for n SCN-, the complex would have charge 2 - n. So Co(SCN)_n^(2-n).

Wait, the complexes given are β1, β2, β3, β4. So I think the complexes are:

Co²+ → β1 is the first step, so maybe Co(SCN)²+ has β1=9. Then Co(SCN)₂²+ with β2=40, and so on. Wait, but β3 is 63 and β4 is 16. Hmm, maybe the complexes are Co(SCN), Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃, and Co(SCN)₄? Or perhaps some other order. Wait, let me think: the stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands, but that's not always the case. Like, sometimes adding more ligands
