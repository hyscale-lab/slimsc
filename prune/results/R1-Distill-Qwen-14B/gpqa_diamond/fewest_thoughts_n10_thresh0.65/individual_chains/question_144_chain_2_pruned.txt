Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I remember from my studies that mesons are subatomic particles, and when they decay, their mean decay distance is related to their lifetime and speed. But wait, how exactly do I calculate that?

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas, but I think I need to find the mean lifetime first and then use that to get the distance.

Wait, right! The mean lifetime (τ) of a particle is related to its width Γ by the equation τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh yeah, that makes sense because Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime. But wait, I should make sure about the units here.

The width Γ is given in MeV, so I need to convert that into energy units compatible with ħ. Oh, right, ħ is often expressed in units of GeV·s or similar. Let me recall the value of ħ. I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, first, I'll convert Γ into GeV. Since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So Γ_X is 0.32 GeV. Now, τ
