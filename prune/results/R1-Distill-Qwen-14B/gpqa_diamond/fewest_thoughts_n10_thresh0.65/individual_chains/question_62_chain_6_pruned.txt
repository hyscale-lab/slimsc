Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, the question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a mouthful, but I'll break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the structure of the target molecule. The main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. Then, there's a substituent on carbon 1. That substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, it's a methyl group connected to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, let me draw this mentally. The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde would have the aldehyde at position 1. The substituent at position 1 (since it's 1-substituted) is a methyl group that's attached to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So, the structure would be something like cyclohexane with an aldehyde group on one carbon, and on the adjacent carbon (or same?), a CH(OH) group connected to another cyclohexane ring.

Wait, no, maybe the substituent is on the same carbon as the aldehyde. So the aldehyde is at position 1, and the substituent is on that same carbon. So the structure would be like:

O=CH-C(cyclohexyl)(OH)-cyclohexane ring.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methyl group with a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl attached. So, the main chain is cyclohexane, with an aldehyde at position 1, and the same position has a CH2 group that is connected to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl. Or maybe the CH2 is between the cyclohexane and the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let's think.

The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So "methyl" means a CH2 group? Wait, no, methyl is CH3. So, perhaps it's CH(OH)(cyclohexyl), but that's not a methyl. Wait, wait, the substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So it's a methyl group (CH2-) but substituted with a hydroxy and a cyclohexyl. So, the methyl is CH2- but with two substituents: one hydroxyl (OH) and one cyclohexyl (C6H11-). So, the group would be -CH(OH)(C6H11). Wait, but that's a branching. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde at position 1, and a CH(OH)(C6H11) group attached to that same position.

So, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Now, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So
