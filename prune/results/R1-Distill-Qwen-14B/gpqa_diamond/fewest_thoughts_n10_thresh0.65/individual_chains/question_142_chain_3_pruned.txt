Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (not a pure state). 

Wait, so first, I should probably figure out whether this is a pure state or a mixed state. Because the density matrix representation changes based on that. A pure state is a rank-1 matrix, and a mixed state has higher rank.

Looking at ρ, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. So each term is a projector, and when you add them, you get a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. Because |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere, and similarly for |1⟩⟨1| which has 1 at (2,2). Adding them gives a diagonal matrix with [1,0; 0,1], multiplied by 1/2 gives [0.5, 0; 0, 0.5]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements 0.5.

I remember that the density matrix must be positive semi-definite and trace equal to 1. Let me check: trace is 0.5
