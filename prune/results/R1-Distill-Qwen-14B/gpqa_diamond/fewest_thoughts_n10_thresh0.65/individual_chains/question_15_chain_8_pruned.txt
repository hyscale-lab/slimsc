Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit. Hmm, I remember that the transit method detects planets when they pass in front of their host star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But the probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period. Oh wait, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since period is shorter. 

The host stars have different masses but same radii. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. Since both stars have the same radius, their sizes are similar, so the transit probability might depend more on the orbital distance and the star's size.

I think the probability of a transit is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the orbital semi-major axis, assuming circular orbits. But wait, actually, the formula I remember is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + m_planet/m_star)), but since the masses are same and the stars have known masses, maybe it's just the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, more accurately, the probability P is approximately (R_*/a) * (1/(1 + (M_planet/M_star))^(1/3)), but since the planets have same mass and M_star varies, but maybe for Earth-like planets, the planetary mass is negligible compared to the star. So perhaps it's roughly (R_*/a).

But wait, the formula I found earlier is P â‰ˆ (R_*/a) * (1/(1 + (m_p/m_*)))^(1/3)). But since both planets have the same mass and the stars' masses are different, this term will affect the probability.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: the probability of transit is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by (1/(sqrt(1 + (M_p/M_* )^2 ))), but I'm not too sure. Maybe I should think about it in terms of the geometry.

In any case, the main factors are
