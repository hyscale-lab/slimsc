Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Michael addition problem. I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, the nucleophile, usually an enolate, attacks the beta carbon, which is the less substituted one in the conjugated system. The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond and leads to a resonance-stabilized intermediate.

The problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate are the reactants, and the conditions are NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH. So NaOEt is a strong base, which would deprotonate the malonate to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it has two ester groups, which stabilize the enolate. The other compound is the acceptor, an alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-C-OEt, but wait, actually, it's 3-(p-tolyl), so maybe it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OEt? No, wait, I think I got that wrong. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt? Hmm, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)propenoate methyl ester. So structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. But wait, the numbering might be different. If it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, then the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt, but substituting at the 3 position would be on the middle carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait, that doesn't make sense because acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, methyl ester. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait, but that would make the double bond between 1 and 2, with the substituent on the 3? So the structure is CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl)-OEt. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt, but that would place the substituent on the same carbon as the ester group. Or perhaps it's CH2=C-(p-tolyl)-COOEt. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OEt with a p-tolyl group on the middle carbon, which would make it CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt. Either way, the key is that the
