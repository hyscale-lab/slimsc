Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says: What's the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5×10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, so I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, right? And the formation constant K is given. K is for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine to form the complex.

So the reaction is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this is K_Ca-EDTA.

I think K is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So K equals [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but in this solution, we're told that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Because the complex is at that concentration, right?

But wait, the problem says "stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex." Hmm, stoichiometric usually means that the ratio is exact as per the
