Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break it down.

First, the initial reaction: heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkene via the E2 mechanism. So, the product here should be an adamantane with a double bond. Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. Oh, right, elimination usually gives alkenes, which can have some color, maybe from conjugated dienes or something, but not sure about the yellow part. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone? No, KOH is more of a base, so elimination is more likely.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons (since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1 and 3 are across each other? Or wait, no, 1 and 3 in adamantane are actually not adjacent. Wait, no. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4. So 1,3 positions are not adjacent, but across. Oh! So maybe it's 1-bromo
