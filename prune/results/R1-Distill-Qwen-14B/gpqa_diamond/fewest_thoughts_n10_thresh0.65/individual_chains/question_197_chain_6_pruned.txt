Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find out what the final product is. The options are four different compounds, so I should probably figure out what Compound X is first, and then see what reaction it undergoes.

The data given is the IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let me look at the IR first. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably from an -OH stretch or maybe an N-H. But then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1—that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound likely has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which makes me think it's an -OH proton. Could be from a carboxylic acid or maybe an aldehyde proton, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but aldehyde protons are typically a triplet or something else due to coupling, but here it's a broad singlet, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid -OH. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton like in a phenol, but phenols usually are around 5-7 ppm. Hmm, but wait, if the compound is a phenol, then the broad peak would be around that region. But here it's 10.5, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). Those are typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring. The downfield peak (8.0) might be from a substituent that's electron-withdrawing, like a carbonyl group. So perhaps we have a benzene ring with a substituent at the para position. The coupling between the two doublets suggests that they are para to each other.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)—that's probably a CH next to an electronegative group, maybe adjacent to a carbonyl or an aromatic ring. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group, maybe part of an ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of triplets (or a doublet) which would be a CH(CH3) group, like in an isobutyl or something. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group from an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the compound is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group, and a side chain. Let me think—maybe the substituent is a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Wait, the IR has a 1720 cm-1 peak, which for a ketone would be
