Okay, so I've got this science question here about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor that converts a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, and it involves matrix exponentials approximated by a fractional approach. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, I remember that when solving partial differential equations numerically, especially using methods like finite differences, you often end up with systems of linear equations. These systems can be represented using matrices. For instance, the heat equation might lead to a matrix that represents the discretized version of the Laplacian operator or something similar.

In sequential algorithms, you might solve these systems step by step, maybe using iterative methods or direct solvers. But when you want to parallelize the algorithm, you need to break down the problem into parts that can be computed simultaneously. One way to do this is through matrix splitting or domain decomposition. Oh wait, like the parallel splitting mentioned in the question.

Matrix exponential functions are used in methods like exponential time integration. These methods compute the solution by exponentiating the system matrix, which can be efficient for certain types of problems. But exponentiating a large matrix directly is computationally intensive, so approximations are used, especially fractional approximations. Fractional approximation methods, like those using Pad√© approximants, approximate the matrix exponential in a way that's computationally feasible.

Now, the question is about the key factor in converting the sequential algorithm to a parallel one. The options given are A to D. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Stability analysis. Stability is crucial in numerical methods to ensure that the errors don't grow uncontrollably. But how does that tie into making the algorithm parallel? Stability analysis might be a part of verifying the method works, but I don't think it's the key factor for parallelism.

Option B: Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal boundary conditions are those where the boundary depends on values from other parts of the domain, like integral conditions. But I'm not sure how this directly affects the ability to split the algorithm into parallel parts. Maybe it complicates the problem, but I'm not sure it's the key factor here.

Option C: Complex roots of fractional approximation. Fractional approximation methods, such as those used for matrix exponentials, might involve rational functions that have roots. If these roots are complex, does that affect the parallelization? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Maybe complex roots influence the stability or the accuracy of the approximation, but how does that tie into making the algorithm parallel?

Option D: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Partial fraction decomposition is a method used to break down complex rational functions into simpler terms. If the fractional approximation can be decomposed into a sum of simpler fractions, each part could potentially be handled in parallel. That is, each term might correspond to a different part of the matrix that can be exponentiated separately and then combined. That sounds plausible because linear partial fractions would allow the matrix to be split into components that can be processed in parallel.

Wait, so if you can express the matrix exponential approximation as a sum of terms that can be computed independently, then each term can be handled by a different processor. So the key factor here is how the fractional approximation allows for such a decomposition. That would make option D the right answer.

But let me think again. When you do matrix exponentials with a fractional approximation, sometimes you're approximating e^A as a fraction, like P(A)/Q(A), where P and Q are polynomials. If you can split this into partial fractions, each part would be a simpler matrix function. Each of those functions might correspond to a part of the matrix that's diagonal or can be handled in parallel.

Alternatively, maybe the parallel splitting refers to the ability to split the matrix into submatrices, each handled by a different processor. But how does the fractional approximation allow that? If the approximation can be represented as a linear combination, perhaps each term corresponds to a different submatrix, enabling parallel computation.

Another thought: the matrix exponential's parallelization might involve whether the matrix can be decomposed in a way that allows each part to be exponentiated separately. For example, if the matrix
