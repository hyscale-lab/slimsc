Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer at speed v, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab's perspective, how does this affect the light's speed?

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But since the glass is moving, maybe there's some relativistic effect here. Or maybe it's more about relative velocities.

Wait, but light's speed in a medium is already adjusted by the refractive index. So when the medium is moving, how does that combine with the speed of light?

I think this is a case where the speed of light in the medium (from the lab's frame) isn't simply c/n, because the medium itself is moving. So perhaps I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, but velocity addition is for when you have objects moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. The problem says the speed is v, but I don't know if it's relativistic or not. Let me think. The problem gives n as the index of refraction, which is greater than 1 for glass. So the speed of light in glass
