Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation A_y φ = a φ. The matrix A_y is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). Oh wait, and S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0).

So, my goal is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y, and then figure out which statement among the options is correct.

First, I think I should write down the matrix for A_y. Since A_y = c * S, I can compute that. Let me note that c is h/(4π), so let's keep that in mind.

The matrix S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Multiplying each element by c, A_y would be:
[ 0*c   (-i)*c ]
[ i*c    0*c ]

Which simplifies to:
[ 0    -i c ]
[ i c    0 ]

Because c is h/(4π), so substituting that in:
A_y = [ 0    -i*(h/(4π)) ]
       [ i*(h/(4π))   0 ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of A_y, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

The matrix (A_y - a I) is:
[ -a    -i c ]
[ i c    -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - [ (i c)(i c) ] but wait, let's compute that term correctly.

Wait, the product of the off-diagonal terms is (-i c)*(i c) = (-i)(i) c². Let me compute that: (-i)(i) = -(i²) = -(-1) = 1. So, the product is (1) * c² = c².

So the determinant becomes a² - c² = 0. Therefore, a² = c² → a = ±c. So the eigenvalues are plus and minus c, where
