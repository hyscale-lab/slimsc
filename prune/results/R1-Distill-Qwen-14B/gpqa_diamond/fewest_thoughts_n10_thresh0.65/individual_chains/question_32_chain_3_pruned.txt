Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium has an atomic number of 3. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, Li is lithium, which has an atomic number of 3. So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So lithium-6 has 3 neutrons. So nucleus X is lithium-6.

So the next step is to find the rest mass of lithium-6. Because when dealing with relativistic speeds, the rest mass plays a big role. I remember the rest mass energy of a nucleus is calculated as the sum of the rest masses of its protons, neutrons, and electrons, but wait, no. Wait, for a nucleus, electrons are part of the atom, not the nucleus. So the nucleus is made of protons and neutrons. So I should calculate the rest mass based on that.

Each proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², right? And a neutron is about 941 MeV/c². So for lithium-6, it's 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So let me compute that.

3 protons: 3 * 938 = 2814 MeV.
3 neutrons: 3 * 941 = 2823 MeV.
Total rest mass energy: 2814 + 2823 = 5637 MeV. Oh wait, 5637 MeV is 5.637 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second: is that accurate? Because I think the actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of its parts due to binding energy, but in this case, since we're dealing with the rest mass of the nucleus, I think we can use the sum of the individual rest masses. Or maybe they give the mass as the sum, so perhaps I should proceed with that.

Okay
