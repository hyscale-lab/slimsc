Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs, but they have different capabilities. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various properties. I need to figure out which of these can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

First, let me recall the key points from the question. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. That means anything with V mag <=17 is observable by ESPRESSO. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so any star with V mag <=16 can be seen by HIRES.

Wait, but some stars have apparent magnitudes given, while others have absolute magnitudes. Oh right, because apparent magnitude is how bright they appear from Earth, while absolute magnitude is how bright they would appear at 10 pc. So I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for the stars that have absolute magnitudes and distances given.

Let's go through each star one by one.

Star1: RA=15, DEC=-75, absolute V=15.5, distance=10 pc. Since distance is 10 pc, the apparent magnitude is the same as the absolute magnitude. So apparent V =15.5. Now, can it be detected by both?

ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so 15.5 is okay. HIRES requires V <=16, so 15.5 is also okay. So Star1 can be detected by both. Wait, but the options don't include Star1 in any of the answer choices except option D, which includes Star1 and Star4. Let me check Star4.

Star4: absolute V=15.5, distance=10 pc. So again, apparent V is 15.5. Same as Star1. So it can be detected by both. So Star1 and Star4 would both be visible by both instruments. So option D is a possibility.

Wait, but let me check all stars to be thorough.

Star2: RA=30, DEC=55, apparent V=16.5, distance=5 pc. Hmm, wait, Star2 has an apparent magnitude given. So
