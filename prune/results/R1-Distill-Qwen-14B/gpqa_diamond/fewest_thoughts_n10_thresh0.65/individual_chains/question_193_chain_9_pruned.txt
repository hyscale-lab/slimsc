Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the power of 5. So the number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, because parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

So, the number of stars N = k/(plx)^5, where k is some constant. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we get N = k/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So 1 divided by that is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Oh wait, no, wait. Because if N = k/( (1/d)^5 ), that's the same as k*d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question isn't asking about the number of stars at a certain distance. It's asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I think they're asking about the density of stars as a function of distance. Or maybe the number per unit volume, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, think about it. If N is proportional to d^5, then for each incremental increase in distance, how does the number change? Wait no, wait. Because the number of stars in a given volume increases with d^5, but when you consider per unit distance, you have to think about how many stars you encounter as you move further out. 

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential number with respect to distance. Like, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr. Because the total number up to a distance r would be integrated, but here they're asking about per unit distance.

So, let me model it. Let's say N is the number of stars within a certain volume. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. But wait, the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume, but if the number density (stars
