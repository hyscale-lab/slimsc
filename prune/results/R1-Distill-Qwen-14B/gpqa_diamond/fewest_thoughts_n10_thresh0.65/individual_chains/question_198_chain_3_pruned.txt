Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. Hmm, let's see what I remember about stability constants and complex ions.

Alright, the problem states that the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. So there are four different complexes forming here.

I think the stability constant, β, tells us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So the complex with β4=16 must be the least stable, and β3=63 is the most stable. Wait, but what does each β represent? I recall that βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ions attached to Co. So β1 is [Co(SCN)]^2+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]), and similarly for the others.

The problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I assume are the complexes with two SCN- ions, maybe [Co(SCN)₂]^2+. Or wait, the question says "dithiocyanato", which would imply two SCN ligands. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached, so that's the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ complex.

So the complexes are:

1. Co²+ (the free ion)
2. [Co(SCN)]²+ (monosubstituted)
3. [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ (disubstituted)
4. [Co(SCN)₃]^2-? Or maybe [Co(SCN)₃]^2- or another charge? Wait, I think Co²+ typically forms complexes with SCN- as [Co(SCN)_n]^(2 - (n-1)) ), but maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, each SCN- is -1, so for each added, the charge changes. Co²+ binds n SCN-, so the complex charge is 2+ - n*(
