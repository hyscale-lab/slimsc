Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm. Let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, especially in its core. The pp chain (proton-proton chain) is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. Oh wait, the pp chain has different branches. The pp-I branch is the dominant one, I think, and then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches. Oh right, the pp-III branch is one of the less significant branches in the proton-proton chain. 

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped. What does that mean for the neutrino flux? Well, neutrinos are produced in different reactions, and the pp-III probably contributes a certain amount of neutrinos. So stopping it would reduce the flux in a particular energy range.

The question is about the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the pp-III stopping affects these two bands.

Wait, what kind of neutrinos are produced in the pp-III branch? I think the pp-III branch involves the fusion of a proton with a helium-3 nucleus. The reaction is p + ²He³ → ⁴He² + a positron and a neutrino. Right, that's the process that produces neutrinos, specifically electron neutrinos.

The
