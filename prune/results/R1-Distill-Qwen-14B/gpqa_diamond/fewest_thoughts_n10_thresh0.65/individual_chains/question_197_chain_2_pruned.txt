Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of compound X and then determine the product formed when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me take it step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The IR spectrum has peaks around 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates the presence of either O-H or N-H stretches. But since the options include benzoic acids and isobutyl benzene derivatives, I'm thinking it's more likely an O-H stretch, probably from a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, which fits with a carboxylic acid (since they typically have a carbonyl around 1700 cm⁻¹). The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ might be from aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound likely has a benzene ring.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad peak, which is typical for an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually broad, so this might be the -COOH proton.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are the aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. So substituents are in the para positions. Let's say the substituents are on the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is around where a methylene (CH2) adjacent to an electronegative group might appear. Or perhaps a CH in a branch.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another set of methylene protons, possibly adjacent to a branch or part of a chain.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of methylene or perhaps a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Wait, no, a triplet would be more like two neighboring protons. But this is a doublet. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group attached to a CH. Oh wait, in a structure like CH(CH3)2, the methyl would be split into a triplet, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, like the end of an ethyl chain. So maybe a CH2CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring has substituents in the para positions. One substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) based on the IR and NMR data. The other substituent would be a branch—maybe an isobutyl group or something similar.

Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be the CH that's connecting the benzene to another part. For instance, in a structure like Ph-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH, but wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, another approach: the substituent on the benzene might be a chain with branching. Let's consider the substituent as CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something else. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR peaks at 2.9 ppm (1H), 1.7 (2H), 1.4 (3H, d), and 0.9 (3H, t). Let's see if that's a butyl group. Let's think about the splitting.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3. So maybe it's part of a longer chain. Let me try to draw the structure.

The 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which is a CH3. So perhaps it's attached to a CH2 group. Wait, but the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet (2H), so maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to a branch. Let me think of a structure where we have a CH(CH2CH3) group attached to another CH2.

Wait, maybe it's a pentyl group? Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. Let's think: a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, a sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3) attached to something else.

Wait, let's map the NMR:

- The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is the end of a CH2CH2CH3. So the chain is at least -CH2CH2CH2- something. But how does that fit with the other peaks?

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let's say the substituent is CH2CH(CH2
