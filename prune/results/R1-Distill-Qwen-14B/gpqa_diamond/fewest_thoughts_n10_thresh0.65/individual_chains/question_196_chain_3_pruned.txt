Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that harmonic oscillators are systems that experience a restoring force proportional to their displacement, like a mass on a spring. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so I think special relativity comes into play here. 

The question asks for the maximum speed of the mass. Okay, in the classical case, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But since this is relativistic, the kinetic energy equation is different. Oh right, in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. It's (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²).

So the setup is a 1D oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, which is Hooke's law. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². At maximum displacement, all the energy should be potential, and at the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic.

Wait, but does that hold in relativity? I'm not so sure. Because in relativity, the energy expressions are a bit different. Let me think. The total energy in special relativity for a particle is γmc², which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. But when the particle is at rest, the energy is just mc². So when it's moving, the kinetic energy would be the total energy minus mc².

In the classical case, the maximum kinetic energy is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, maybe that's not the case. Or perhaps the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², but the kinetic energy is now relativistic.

Wait, but the question gives options that involve a square root with factors involving kA² and mc². So perhaps I should start by considering the conservation of energy, but with relativistic expressions.

So, the total energy of the oscillator should be the sum of kinetic and potential energies. But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is conserved. In the relativistic case, I'm not sure if that still holds, but maybe for small velocities, but wait, the problem is about maximum speed, which could be significant.

Wait,
