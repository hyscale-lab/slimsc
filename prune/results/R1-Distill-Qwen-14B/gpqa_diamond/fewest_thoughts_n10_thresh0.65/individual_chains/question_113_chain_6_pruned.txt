Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to determine which one fits the given FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data.

Let me start by looking at each piece of data one by one.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in the IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak could also be an N-H stretch, but I don't see any options with nitrogen here. So, O-H is probably the case. Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, those are in the range for carbonyl groups. The 1700 is likely a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or ester. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps an amide or a conjugated carbonyl like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl. Wait, but I don't see any options with amide groups. Let me think.

Looking at the options, they have O and sometimes O2. So possibilities include esters, ketones, aldehydes, maybe acids. But for an acid, the O-H would be a broad peak, but the carbonyl would be around 1700 as well. But if there were two carbonyl peaks, maybe it's an ester (which has a carbonyl) and something else.

Wait, another thought: 1700 could be an ester or a ketone, and 1650 might be an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Oh wait, no, aromatic C=C is usually around 1450-1600, but 1650 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So maybe the compound has two
