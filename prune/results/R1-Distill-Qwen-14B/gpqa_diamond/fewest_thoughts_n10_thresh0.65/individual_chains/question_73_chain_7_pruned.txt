Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in special relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. There's a specific formula for adding velocities relativistically. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). But wait, I need to make sure I got the order right. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the faster one from the slower's perspective is (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²).

Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c. So about 0.14c, which matches some of the options. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c.

Next, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma * mc². But wait, the masses here are 2m and 3m, so their energies would be gamma1 * 2m c² and gamma2 * 3m c². So the total energy E_total = gamma1*(2m)c² + gamma2*(3m)c².

I need to calculate the gamma factors. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For the first astronaut (2m) moving at 0.6c: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. So sqrt(1 - 0.36) = sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. So gamma1 = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

For the second astronaut (3m) at 0.5c: v²/c² = 0.25. Sqrt(1 - 0.25) = sqrt(0.75) = approximately 0.8660. So gamma2 = 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

Now compute each energy:

First astronaut: 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².
Second astronaut: 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 mc².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which seems lower. So option C seems correct. But wait, let me double-check the relative velocity calculation.

Wait, the formula I used was (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1v2)/(c²)). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed from the perspective of the slower astronaut (0.5c) should be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Wait, no, actually, the relative speed is the speed of the first astronaut as seen by the second. So v_rel is (v1 - v2
