Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and they're massless, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters away from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given in Joules, so I need to compute the potential energy and that should be it, right?

Wait, energy in an isolated system—since the charges are fixed in place except for maybe moving relative to each other, but wait, 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P. Hmm. So the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. But wait, are they arranged in some way around P? Like, maybe in a circle or something? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I can assume they're all at the same point, but that doesn't make sense because they can't all be at the same spot without overlapping. Maybe it's a spherical arrangement? Or maybe it's just that each is at 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other aren't specified.

Wait, but since the problem is about the potential energy of the system, and potential energy is about the potential energy between each pair of charges, maybe it's the sum over all pairs. So I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair of charges.

Wait, but the system is isolated, so all charges contribute to each other's potential. Since each charge is 2e, the total potential energy would come from all the interactions.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So the 13th charge (at P) interacts with each of the 12 charges at 2m. Also, the 12 charges would interact with each other because they're all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances depend on how they're arranged.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are all at a radius of 2 meters from P. But their distances from each other vary. So if all 12 are equally spaced on a circle of radius 2m, then the distance between any two adjacent ones would be something else. But wait, without knowing the exact arrangement, maybe the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are at the same point, but that can't be possible because then the potential energy would be infinite. So perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are such that each is as far as possible? No, wait, maybe the mutual distances don't matter because the problem is only considering the potential due to the charge at P and the other 12?

Wait, the question says the 13th charge is fixed at P. The other 12 are each 2m from P. So each of those 12 is at a distance of 2m from the 13th charge. But each of the 12 is also at some distance from the others. So the total potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, but the problem is about minimum energy. So perhaps to minimize the total potential energy, I need to arrange the 12 charges such that their mutual repulsion potential energy is minimized. Wait, no—wait, wait. Charges are all positive because each is 2e, which is positive. So the potential energy between any two positive charges would be positive (because the potential energy is positive when the charges are like that). So the total potential energy is the sum of all the individual potentials.

But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. Hmm. So maybe I'm supposed to arrange the charges in a way that the mutual potential energies between them are as low as possible. But wait, since all the 12 are at 2m from P, maybe they are arranged on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m. But the arrangement affects the mutual distances between the 12 charges. For example, if they are placed as far apart as possible, the mutual potential energies would be as small as possible (since U = k q1 q2 / r; for larger r, smaller U). But wait, no, because the potential energy is positive for like charges, so if you have a larger r, each pair contributes less positively to the total U. So to minimize the total potential energy (i.e., make it as small as possible, which would be the least positive), you would arrange the 12 charges as far apart as possible from each other.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the arrangement, so maybe the 12 charges are all at the same point. But that's impossible because then the potential energy due to their mutual interactions would be undefined, a singularity. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and not considering the mutual interactions between the 12. That seems unlikely because in a system of charges, you have to consider all pairwise interactions.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, but not the mutual interactions among the 12. Hmm, but the question is about the "minimum energy of the system." So to find the minimum, perhaps we should include all interactions, but maybe the mutual interactions would contribute a positive amount, so including them would make the total energy higher. But wait, the question is about the minimum energy, so perhaps the mutual interactions are not considered, or perhaps the problem is designed such that their mutual potential can be considered negligible or in a way that doesn't affect the answer.

Wait, but the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So their positions are fixed relative to P. But their positions relative to each other are not specified, and their mutual distances would vary based on the arrangement. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the mutual potential energies are to be ignored, or perhaps the problem expects us to calculate only the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and not the mutual potential between the 12.

Wait, but that seems a bit odd because the mutual potential would contribute to the total. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the mutual potential energies of the 12 are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energies sum up to a minimum. But without knowing the arrangement, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute only the potential between the 13th charge and the other 12.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential contributions are zero, which doesn't make sense. Or perhaps because the problem says they are each at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other are not given, so maybe the mutual potential energy is considered zero, but that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again. The problem is about the minimum energy of the system. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at 2m from P. The 12 are constrained to remain at 2m, but their arrangement among themselves isn't specified. So the mutual potential energies between the 12 would depend on their arrangement. However, the problem is asking for the minimum energy, so perhaps the minimum occurs when the mutual potential energies are as small as possible, which would be when the charges are as far apart as possible. But without knowing the arrangement, I can't compute that. So perhaps the problem is designed such that we only consider the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and ignore the mutual potential between the 12.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energies sum to zero. But that's unlikely because all the charges are positive, so their mutual potentials would be positive, contributing to the total.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the potential energy as the sum of the interactions between each 12 charges and the 13th, plus the interactions among the 12 charges. But since the problem says 12 are constrained to 2m from P, their positions are all at radius 2m from P. So the mutual distances between the 12 would depend on the arrangement, such as whether they are placed on a circle or a sphere. But without knowing, perhaps the problem expects me to compute only the potential between the 13th and the 12, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's look at the options. The options are in the order of 1e-26 J or similar. Let me think about the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12.

Each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, so the distance between the 13th charge (at P) and each of the 12 is 2m. The potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. Since all charges are 2e, and each pair is (13th and 12th), so each U is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). Let's compute that.

But wait, each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy with the 13th. So that's 12 individual terms.

Wait, but wait: the 13th charge is fixed. So the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is (2e)*(2e)/(2m), multiplied by k. So each U is (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2m). But wait, when you have multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Wait, but let's compute for each 12 charges: each contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). So that's (k*(4e²))/(2m) for each.

Wait, but wait, the 13th charge is fixed, so the potential energy for each of the 12 is between themselves and the 13th. So each of the 12 has an interaction with the 13th. So the total for this part is 12 * (k * (2e)^2)/(2m).

Wait, let me compute that. Let's plug in the numbers.

e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602e-19 coulombs.

So 2e is 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

k is Coulomb's constant, about 8.988e9 N m²/C².

r is 2 meters.

So each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of U = k*(2e)^2 / (2m) = k*(4e²)/(2m) = (k * 4e²) / (2m) = (k * 2e²)/m.

Wait, so for each, U = (8.988e9) * (2 * (1.602e-19)^2) / 2.

Wait, let me compute that.

First, compute e squared: (1.602e-19)^2 = approx (2.566e-38) C².

Multiply by 2: 5.133e-38.

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 5.133e-38 = let's compute that.

8.988e9 is approx 9e9, so 9e9 * 5e-38 is ~4.5e-28.

But let's be precise.

8.988e9 * 5.133e-38 = ?

Let me compute 8.988 * 5.133 = approximately 45.98.

Then, 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29.

Wait, no, 8.988e9 is 8.988 * 1e9, and 5.133e-38 is 5.133 * 1e-38.

So multiplying them gives 8.988 *5.133 = let's compute that.

8 * 5 =40. 8*0.133=1.064, 0.988 *5=4.94, 0.988 * 0.133≈0.131.

So total is approximately 40 +1.064 +4.94 +0.131 → 46.135.

So 46.135 * 1e9 *1e-38 → 46.135e-29 = 4.6135e-28.

But that's for each pair (13th and one of the 12). So each contributes 4.6135e-28 J. Then, since there are 12 such pairs, the total is 12 * 4.6135e-28 = 5.536e-27 J.

Wait, but wait, that's the potential energy contribution from the 13th charge and each of the 12. But wait, what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Since all the 12 are at 2m from P, their mutual distances vary. Let's say the 12 are arranged in a regular icosahedron around P, but without knowing the exact arrangement, I can't compute their mutual distances. But perhaps the problem is designed so that the mutual potential is zero, which doesn't make sense because the charges are all positive, so their mutual potential is positive. Alternatively, maybe the mutual potential is considered negligible, but that's unlikely.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others, not the mutual interactions. Let me check the options. The options are:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26

B) 2.822 x 10^-26

C) 7.056 x 10^-27

D) 122.330

Wait, my calculation for the 13th and 12 charges gives 5.536e-27 J, which is approximately 5.536e-27. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher, and option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times higher. Option A is 5.645e-26, which is even higher.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation. Let's recheck.

Wait, the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * q1 q2 / r.

Each of the 12 charges has charge 2e, so q1=2e, q2=2e. So U per pair is k*(2e)*(2e)/r = 4 k e² / r.

Wait, but wait, when you have multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of all pairs. So between the 13th and each of the 12, it's 12 pairs, each contributing 4 k e²/(2m).

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute.

Each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, so r=2m for each. So the potential energy for each pair (13th and a 12th) is:

U = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m) = (4 k e²) / (2m) = (2 k e²) / m.

So for each of the 12, U is (2 k e²)/m.

So 12 * U = 12 * (2 k e²)/m.

Wait, but wait, wait, that's not correct. Because each 12th charge is interacting with the 13th, so the number of interactions is 12, each with U per pair as (2e)^2 * k / (2m) = 4e² k/(2m) = 2 e² k/m.

Wait, wait, maybe I should compute it correctly.

Let me compute it step by step.

Each charge is 2e.

Each is at a distance of 2m from P.

So U for each pair is (k) * (2e) * (2e) / (2m) = (4e² k) / (2m) )= (2 e² k) / m.

Since there are 12 such pairs (13th charge with each of the 12), total is 12 * (2 e² k) / m.

Wait, let me compute this numerically.

Compute 2 * e² * k = 2 * (1.602e-19)^2 * 8.988e9.

First, e squared: (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

Multiply by 2: 5.133e-38.

Multiply by k (8.988e9): 5.133e-38 * 8.988e9 ≈ 4.613e-28.

Divide by m (2m) → Wait no. Wait, in the formula, it's 2e² k / m. Wait, m is 2 meters.

So 2e² k is 5.133e-38 * 8.988e9 = approx 4.613e-28.

Then, 4.613e-28 divided by 2 meters is 2.306e-28 J per pair.

Wait, no, wait, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, U per pair is (2e^2 * k) / (2m) ) because r is 2m.

So (2e^2 *k) / (2m) ) = (e² k) / m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step. Let me recompute.

Each pair contributes U = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m) = (4e² k) / (2m) )= (2 e² k ) / m.

Wait, but wait, that's correct.

So (e^2) is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 2: 5.133e-38.

Multiply by k (8.988e9): 5.133e-38 * 8.988e9 = 4.612e-28.

Divide by m (2m) → 4.612e-28 / 2 = 2.306e-28 J per pair.

Wait, no, wait, the formula is (2 e^2 *k ) / (2m) ), so the 2 in the numerator and denominator cancel, giving (e^2 * k ) / m.

So e^2 is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply by k (8.988e9): 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 = (2.566 * 8.988) * 1e-29.

2.566 * 8.988 ≈ 23.06.

So 23.06e-29 = 2.306e-28 J per pair.

But wait, each of the 12 pairs (since there are 12 2m charges) contributes this amount.

So total from these interactions is 12 * 2.306e-28 J = 27.67e-28 J = 2.767e-27 J.

Wait, but that's about 2.77e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher, and option B is 2.82e-26, which is 10 times higher.

Hmm, so perhaps my approach is missing something. Oh wait, maybe I forgot about the potential energies between the 12 charges themselves. Because the 12 charges are each at 2m from P, but their mutual distances vary. For example, if they're arranged in a circle, the distance between two adjacent charges would be 2 * sqrt(2^2 - r^2) where r is the radius in the circle? Wait, perhaps it's better to think of them as being on the surface of a sphere. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the mutual potential energies are zero, which doesn't make sense because the charges are positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others, and not the mutual interactions between the 12. Because if that's the case, then the total potential energy would be 12 * (2e^2 k)/(2m) )= 12 * (e^2 k)/m.

Wait, let's compute that.

e^2 k / m = (1.602e-19)^2 * 8.988e9 / 2.

So e^2 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply by k: 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 ≈ 2.306e-28.

Divide by m=2: 2.306e-28 / 2 = 1.153e-28 per pair.

Multiply by 12: 1.153e-28 * 12 = 1.383e-27 J.

But that's about 1.38e-27, which is not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me try computing numbers again.

Let me compute the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12.

Each U is (k * 2e * 2e) / (2m) )= k*(4 e²)/(2m) )= 2 k e² / m.

So for each pair, it's 2 k e² / m= 2 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, 2 *8.988e9 is 1.7976e10.

(1.602e-19)^2 is 2.566e-38.

Multiply them: 1.7976e10 * 2.566e-38 = (1.7976 * 2.566) * 1e-28.

1.7976 * 2.566 ≈ 4.613.

So 4.613e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.613e-28 *12 = 5.5356e-27 J.

Ah, so that's approximately 5.536e-27 J. Now, looking at the options: option A is 5.645e-26, which is 10 times larger. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times larger. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is a bit higher than 5.5e-27. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator. Because the distance r is 2m, so each U is (k (2e)(2e))/(2m) )= (4 k e²)/(2m) )= 2 k e² / m.

Wait, but m is 2, so 2 k e² / 2 = k e² / 1, which is the same as k e².

Wait, no, wait: 2/(2m) is 1/m. So 4 k e²/(2m) is 2 k e²/m.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me compute it again.

Each U is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2m.

Which is 4 k e² / (2m) = 2 k e² / m.

So for each pair, it's 2 k e² / m.

m is 2 meters, so 2 k e² / 2 = k e².

So each pair contributes k e².

Wait, that's a simpler way. So 12 pairs contribute 12 * k e².

Wait, that's a big difference. Let me compute that.

k is 8.988e9 N m²/C².

e is 1.602e-19 C.

So k e² = 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = (2.566 *8.988) *1e-29.

2.566 *8.988 ≈23.06.

So 23.06e-29 = 2.306e-28 J per pair.

But wait, each pair with the 13th charge contributes that. But since the 13th charge is fixed, the potential energy is 12 * (k e²) )= 12 * 2.306e-28 = 27.67e-28 = 2.767e-27 J.

Wait, but earlier I thought that each pair's U is 2.306e-28 J, and 12 of them would be 2.767e-27 J. But looking at the options, that's not matching any option except perhaps none. So perhaps I'm missing another component.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges also have mutual potential energy between themselves. Because all of them are at 2m from P, but their mutual distances vary depending on their arrangement.

But without knowing the arrangement, I can't compute their mutual potential energy. So perhaps the problem is designed to ignore that and only consider the potential energy between the 13th and the others.

But in that case, the total potential energy would be 2.767e-27 J, which isn't an option. Because the options are: A)5.645e-26, B)2.822e-26, C)7.056e-27, D)122.330.

Wait, option C is 7.056e-27, which is a bit higher than what I calculated (2.767e-27), but it's in the same ballpark. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Let me compute k e²:

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k * e² = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.06e-29 J m.

Wait, no, units would be N m²/C² * C² → N m² → J m.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing units. Let me think: k has units of N m²/C².

e² has units of C².

Multiply together: N m²/C² * C² = N m² → J m.

Wait, but when you have U = k q1 q2 / r, r is in meters. So the units would be (N m²/C²) * (C)(C) / m → N m^2 * C^2 / (C^2 m) ) → N m → J.

So that's correct.

So k e² = 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 = let me compute it precisely.

First, 8.988e9 = 8.988 * 1e9.

(1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * (1e-19)^2 = 2.566 * 1e-38.

So 8.988 * 2.566 = let's compute that.

8 * 2.566 = 20.528.

0.988 * 2.566 ≈ 2.532.

Total is approximately 23.06.

So 23.06 * 1e9 * 1e-38 = 23.06e-29 = 2.306e-28 J.

So each pair's U is 2.306e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 12 * 2.306e-28 = 27.67e-28 = 2.767e-27 J.

But that's about 2.77e-27 J. The options don't have this. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times higher.

Hmm, maybe I missed a factor of 3 somewhere? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the number of interactions. Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are each at 2m from P, but the 13th is fixed. So the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between the 13th and each of the 12, which is 12 * (k (2e)^2 )/(2m).

Wait, let me recompute that.

(2e)^2 =4e².

Multiply by k: 4e² *k.

Divide by r=2m: (4e² k)/(2m )= 2e² k/m.

So for each pair, it's 2e² k/m.

e² is (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

Multiply by 2: 5.133e-38.

Multiply by k=8.988e9: 5.133e-38 *8.988e9 = 4.613e-28.

Divide by m=2: 4.613e-28 /2 = 2.306e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 2.306e-28 *12= 27.67e-28=2.767e-27 J.

Wait, same result as before. So the potential energy would be approximately 2.77e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C:7.056e-27, but that's about 2.5 times higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate k*e².

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the 12 charges are each at 2m, but also the other way: the 13th and each of the 12, so 12 terms, each U = k (2e)^2 / (2m).

So U per pair is (k*4e^2)/(2m) )= 2 k e^2/m.

But m=2, so 2/(2) =1. So U per pair is k e^2.

So 12 pairs: 12 k e^2.

Compute that.

k e² =8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

As before, 8.988e9 * (2.566e-38) =23.06e-29=2.306e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 2.306e-28 *12=2.767e-27 J.

Hmm. So the correct answer is about 2.767e-27 J, but none of the options match.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 2.55 times higher than 2.767e-27.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of interactions. Wait, the 13th charge is at P, and the 12 are at 2m from P. So the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th is 12 * (k (2e)^2 )/(2m). Let me compute that correctly.

(2e)^2 =4e².

So U for each pair: (4e² *k)/(2m) ) = (2 e² k)/m.

So with m=2, it's (2 e² k)/(2) = e² k.

So each pair contributes e² k.

So 12 pairs: 12 e² k.

Compute 12 * e² *k.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

k=8.988e9.

So 12 *2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = 12 * (2.566 *8.988e-29) ).

2.566 *8.988 ≈23.06.

So 12 *23.06e-29 = 276.7e-29 = 2.767e-27 J.

Hmm, same result as before.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the potential energy between all pairs, including the mutual interactions among the 12 charges.

Wait, but without knowing their arrangement, how can I compute that? Perhaps the problem is making an assumption that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, which wouldn't make sense because they're all positive. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy is negligible or not contributing to the total, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are all 2m as well. Wait, that's not possible because they're all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances can't all be 2m unless they are co-located, which would make the potential energy infinite, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a ring, each at 2m from P. Then the distance between adjacent charges would be 2 * sin(π/12) * 2m? No, perhaps I should think in terms of a regular polygon.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, equally spaced. In that case, the distance between any two charges would be 2 * 2m * sin(π/12), because each would be separated by an angle θ = 360/12 = 30 degrees. So the chord length is 2r sin(θ/2) → 2*2m * sin(15 degrees).

Sin(15 degrees) is about 0.2588.

So chord length r_ij =4m * 0.2588 ≈ 1.035 m.

Wait, but 12 charges arranged on a sphere would have each pair separated by varying distances, but perhaps we can approximate that the average distance is something. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to compute the exact mutual potential energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is zero, which I don't think is possible because like charges repel. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, and nothing else.

In that case, the answer is approximately 2.767e-27 J, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Since each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P, perhaps the potential energy for each charge is the potential at P due to each of the 12. But wait, the potential energy is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is calculated by taking the potential at each charge's position due to the others.

Wait, no, the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for the 13th charge and each of the 12, it's 12 terms. Now, perhaps I should also consider that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential at the other 11 charges. So for the mutual interactions among the 12, each pair contributes a potential energy of k*(2e)^2 / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between two charges in the 12.

But without knowing r_ij, I can't compute this. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, and not the mutual interactions. If that's the case, then the total is approximately 2.767e-27 J, which is not an option. Hmm.

Wait, looking at option C:7.056e-27. That's exactly 2.56 times 2.767e-27. Wait, 2.767e-27 * 2.56 ≈7.06e-27.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think: perhaps I forgot that each charge contributes to multiple pairs. Wait, no, I added all 12 pairs between the 13th and the 12.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges as being at a distance of 2m from P, but also, each 12th charge is 2m from each other. But that's impossible unless all are at the same point, which would make their potential energy infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the charge value. The problem states each charge is 2e. So in the calculation, I used 2e for each charge.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the potential energy using the formula for multiple point charges. The potential energy is the sum over all pairs.

So the total potential energy U_total is U_13 + sum of U_ij for i=1 to 12, j=i+1 to 12.

Where U_13 is the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, which is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

U_ij is the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges, which depends on their mutual distances.

But without knowing the arrangement, I can't compute U_ij. So perhaps the problem is designed to assume that U_ij is zero, which isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps they're arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is minimal, which would require them to be as far apart as possible. But without knowing the arrangement, I can't compute that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are at the same point as the 13th, but that's not possible because they're constrained to be 2m away.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible because they're all positive.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and not the mutual interactions, and perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair, including all 13 charges.

Wait, no, because the 13th is fixed, but each of the 12 is interacting with it.

Wait, let me think again. The 13 charges are each 2e. The 13th is fixed, the other 12 are at 2m from it.

So the potential energy is:

U_total = U_13 + sum_{i<j, i or j =13} U_ij + sum_{i<j, i and j not 13} U_ij.

But without knowing the positions of the 12, I can't compute the last term.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is designed to ignore that term, and only compute U_13.

But that leads me back to 2.767e-27 J, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the mutual potential energy between the 12 is zero, which isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the distance. If each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, but the mutual distances are larger than 2m, then their mutual potential energy would be smaller than if they were closer. But without knowing, I can't compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the mutual potential energy is zero, which is impossible because all charges are positive. So I'm stuck.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C is 7.056e-27, which is exactly 2.56 times my calculated value (2.767e-27). Wait, 2.767e-27 * 2.56 = approx 7.06e-27. So perhaps I missed a factor of 3 somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy, but I'm only calculating the potential at the 13th charge. No, that's not the case because the potential energy between two charges is the same regardless of which charge you're considering.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy per charge, but that doesn't fit the question.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, which is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) )= 12 * (k *4 e²)/(2m) )= 24 k e²/(2m) )= 12 k e²/m.

Wait, m is 2, so 12 k e²/(2) )=6 k e².

So U =6 *k * e².

Compute that.

k=8.988e9, e²=2.566e-38.

So 6 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = 6 * (8.988 *2.566) *1e-29.

8.988*2.566≈23.06.

6 *23.06≈138.36.

So 138.36e-29=1.3836e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 1.38e-27 J, which is not an option either.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, and not the mutual potential between the 12. So the total energy is 12*(k*(2e)^2)/(2m) )=12*(4e² k)/(2m) )=24 e² k/(2m) )=12 e² k/m.

m=2, so 12 e² k/2=6 e² k.

Compute 6 e² k =6 * (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9.

(1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 2.566e-38 *8.988e9=2.306e-28.

Multiply by 6: 1.383e-27 J.

Again, same as before. So I'm back to 1.38e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Hmm, maybe I should check my calculation of Coulomb's constant. I've used 8.988e9 N m²/C². Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different value, like 9e9 for simplicity.

Let me try that.

k=9e9.

Each U is 12*(k*(2e)^2)/(2m) )=12*(4k e²)/(2m) )=24 k e²/(2m) )=12 k e²/m.

m=2: 12 k e² /2 =6 k e².

With k=9e9:

6 *9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 =6 *9e9 *2.566e-38.

6*9=54.

54 *2.566e-29=138.3e-29=1.383e-27 J.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged such that each is at a distance of 2m from P, but the mutual potential is negligible. But I can't see any option matching that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, which would mean that the total potential energy is only the one from the 13th charge and the 12. But that still gives me 2.767e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is exactly 2.56 times my result of 2.767e-27.

Wait, 2.767e-27 * 2.56 = 7.057e-27, which matches option C.

So why would there be a factor of 2.56? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of interactions. Oh wait! Because when considering all the pairs, perhaps I should have included all possible pairs, including the mutual ones between the 12.

But without knowing their arrangement, I can't compute that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy is the same as the potential between the 13th and each charge, which isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is interacting with all the others, leading to (12 choose 2) =66 pairs, each contributing U_ij =k (2e)^2 / r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, I can't compute that. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is the same as their potential with the 13th, which would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different distance, like each charge is at a distance of 1m from P, but that's not what the question says.

I think I'm stuck, but perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, which is approximately twice my calculated value of 2.767e-27 J. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the charge being 2e. Wait, the problem says each charge is 2e. So I used 2e correctly in the calculations.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the potential energy is calculated as the sum of the charges' contributions to each other. So each of the 12 charges contributes a potential of (k * 2e)/(2m) at their position, and the 13th charge's potential energy is the sum of each charge's potential multiplied by 2e.

Wait, that would be another approach. Let me think: the potential at each of the 12 charges due to the 13th charge is V =k*(2e)/(2m) )=k e/m.

The potential energy of each 12th charge is q * V =2e*(k e/m) )=2 k e²/m.

So each contributes 2 k e²/m. For 12 charges, it's 12 * 2 k e²/m =24 k e²/m.

m=2, so 24 k e²/(2) )=12 k e².

So U_total =12 k e².

Compute that:

12 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Which is 12 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

12 *8.988=107.856.

107.856e9 *2.566e-38 =107.856 *2.566e-29.

107.856 *2.566 ≈276.7.

So 276.7e-29=2.767e-27 J.

Same as before.

Hmm, so I'm back to the same result.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering each pair twice. But no, potential energy is calculated once per pair.

I think I've tried all possible approaches, and the correct calculation leads to approximately 2.767e-27 J, which isn't one of the given options. But the closest option is C:7.056e-27, which is about 2.56 times higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps in the exponents.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k * e².

Let me recompute k * e².

k = 8.988e9.

e=1.602e-19.

e squared is 2.566e-38.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute this precisely.

8.988 *2.566 = ?

8 *2.566=20.528.

0.988 *2.566: 0.9 *2.566=2.3094, 0.08 *2.566=0.20528, 0.008*2.566=0.020528 → total 2.3094 +0.20528=2.51468 +0.020528=2.5352.

So total 20.528 +2.5352=23.0632.

So 23.0632e-29=2.30632e-28 J.

Multiply by 12 for 12 pairs: 2.30632e-28 *12=2.7676e-27 J.

Which is approximately 2.768e-27 J.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27, which is exactly 2.56 times higher. Wait, 2.768e-27 * 2.56 =7.064e-27. So perhaps the problem expects me to include a factor I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are each 2 meters from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between the 13th and each of the 12, which is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) )=12*(4e²k)/(2m) )=24 e² k/(2m) )=12 e² k/m.

Wait, m=2, so 12 e² k /2=6 e² k.

Compute 6 *k *e².

k=8.988e9.

e²=2.566e-38.

So 6 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38=6 * (8.988 *2.566) *1e-29.

8.988*2.566=23.06.

6 *23.06=138.36.

So 138.36e-29=1.3836e-27 J.

Again, same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between all 13 charges, including the 13th with itself, which doesn't make sense. Or perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the potential energy as the sum of all possible pairs, including the mutual ones. But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the mutual potential energy is considered as the same as each individual potential, which would be incorrect. But perhaps it's intended.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential of the others, leading to a total of (12 * 12) terms, but that's not correct because each pair is counted once.

I think I'm stuck, and perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J. But I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponents. Let me try that again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 12 * (k (2e)^2)/(2m) )=12*(4k e²)/(2m) )=24 k e²/(2m) )=12 k e²/m.

m=2, so 12 k e²/(2)=6 k e².

Compute 6 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute step by step:

(1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9:2.566e-38 *8.988e9=2.566 *8.988 =23.06e-29=2.306e-28.

Multiply by 6:2.306e-28 *6=1.3836e-27 J.

So the same result again.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different value for e, but I used the standard 1.602e-19 C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use e=1.6e-19 for simplicity.

Let me try that.

e=1.6e-19.

Then e²=2.56e-38.

k=8.988e9.

Compute 6 *k *e² =6 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38.

6 *8.988=53.928.

53.928e9 *2.56e-38=53.928 *2.56=138.2e-29=1.382e-27 J.

Still same result.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using a different Coulomb's constant, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9.

Using k=9e9:

6 *9e9 *2.56e-38=6*9=54.

54 *2.56e-29=138.24e-29=1.3824e-27 J.

Same.

I think I'm stuck. The problem must have an error, or perhaps I'm missing something. Given that, among the options, the closest to my calculation is option C:7.056e-27, which is about 2.56 times larger than my result. Perhaps the problem intended for me to include a factor of 3, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each pair between the 12 charges, leading to (12*11)/2=66 pairs, each contributing a potential energy of k*(2e)^2/(2m), which would be 66 * (4e²k)/(2m) )=66 * 2e²k/m.

Which is 132 e² k/m.

m=2:132 e² k /2=66 e² k.

Compute 66 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

66 *8.988e9=6 *8.988e9=53.928e9; 60 *8.988e9=539.28e9; 6 *8.988e9=53.928e9; total 539.28e9 +53.928e9=593.208e9.

593.208e9 *2.566e-38=593.208 *2.566e-29=1523.8e-29=1.5238e-26 J.

Which is 1.524e-26 J. Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is three times higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in this approach.

Wait, but if I include all mutual pairs, that would be 66 pairs, each contributing U =k*(2e)^2/(r_ij), but I don't know r_ij. So perhaps the problem is intended to have only the potential between the 13th and the 12, leading to 2.767e-27 J, which isn't an option. I think I'm stuck and perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J.


The problem involves calculating the minimum energy of a system of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 of the charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a fixed charge at point \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is determined by considering the interactions between the fixed charge and the 12 charges, as well as the mutual interactions among the 12 charges. However, the exact arrangement of the 12 charges is not specified, making it challenging to compute their mutual potential energy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Energy Between the 13th Charge and the 12 Charges**:
   - The potential energy between two charges is given by:
     \[
     U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}
     \]
     where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( q_1 = q_2 = 2e \), and \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \).
   - Substituting \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), the potential energy for each pair is:
     \[
     U = k \frac{(2e)^2}{2m} = \frac{4 k e^2}{2m} = \frac{2 k e^2}{m}
     \]
   - For \( m = 2 \, \text{m} \), this simplifies to:
     \[
     U = k e^2
     \]
   - The total potential energy for the 12 pairs is:
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = 12 \cdot k e^2
     \]
   - Substituting \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \) and \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \):
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = 12 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38}
     \]
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = 12 \cdot 23.06 \times 10^{-29} = 276.72 \times 10^{-29} = 2.767 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
     \]

2. **Mutual Potential Energy Among the 12 Charges**:
   - The mutual potential energy between the 12 charges depends on their arrangement. Without knowing the exact distances between them, their mutual potential energy cannot be computed directly. However, the problem likely assumes that this contribution is negligible or does not significantly affect the total energy.

3. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated potential energy \( 2.767 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the given options exactly.
   - Option \( C \) (\( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)) is approximately \( 2.56 \) times larger than the calculated value. This discrepancy could arise from an implicit assumption in the problem or a difference in interpretation.

### Conclusion:
Given the calculations and the provided options, the closest match to the computed potential energy is **Option C**. While the exact reasoning for the discrepancy remains unclear, this is the most reasonable choice based on the given data.

**Answer: C**
