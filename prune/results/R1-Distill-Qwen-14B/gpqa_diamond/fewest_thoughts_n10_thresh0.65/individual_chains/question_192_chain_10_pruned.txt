Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity.

The question asks what the electric field E is at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that when charges are inside a conductor's cavity, the conductor itself doesn't have any net charge, but the charges redistribute in a certain way. Since the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on it must be zero. But the cavity has a charge +q. I think this is a case involving the method of shells or something about induced charges.

Wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges inside would cause the electrons in the conductor to redistribute. Since the conductor is neutral, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the charge +q inside the cavity would attract negative charges to the inner surface. Then, the outer surface must have a +q charge to balance it out because the total is zero. But wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the inner surface has -q and the outer surface has +q, making the total zero. 

But the point P is outside the conductor, so the outer surface's charge is what matters. The electric field outside a conducting sphere is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So in this case, the outer surface has +q, so the electric field at P should be due to this +q charge.

Wait, but wait a minute. The conductor is not a solid sphere, but a spherical shell with a cavity. The arrangement is such that the cavity is off-center by a distance s. Oh, that complicates things. Because the charge is placed inside the cavity but not at the center. So the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces would be different.

Wait, no, let me think again. The conductor is neutral. The charge inside the cavity is +q. So the
