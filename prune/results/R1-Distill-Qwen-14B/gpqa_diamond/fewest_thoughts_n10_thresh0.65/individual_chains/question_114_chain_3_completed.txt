Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Oh wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with cyanide, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism would be the ketone's carbonyl group reacting with the CN- nucleophile. But wait, under what conditions does that happen? NaCN is a source of cyanide ions, so maybe it's an acid-catalyzed addition.

Wait, but in the product, the nitrile is added to the carbonyl, and there's a hydroxyl group. Oh wait, no, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile group. So the product would have four carbons: the nitrile is on the second carbon, along with a hydroxyl and methyl group? Hmm, maybe the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN-CH2... Wait, but that doesn't add up. Oh wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, under certain conditions, it would add the cyanide to the carbonyl. The product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, butanone is four carbons, so after adding nitrile, maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, that would be five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but that doesn't make much sense for ketones. Oh, wait a second—could it be a condensation reaction? No, I think it's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But butanenitrile is four carbons, so the product might be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would have the structure (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN? No, wait, that would be five carbons. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count the carbons. Butan-2-one has four carbons: the carbonyl is on C2, so the structure is CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is (CH3)2C-O. So when NaCN is added, the cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen would pick up a proton, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. Then, a proton would be lost as water, forming (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that would be four carbons? No, because the ketone has three carbons (CH3-CO-CH3) but adding CN would make it four? Or is it (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is four carbons in total? Hmm.

Wait, regardless of the structure, the main point is that the reagent A is needed to facilitate the reaction between the ketone and NaCN. Typically, the addition of HCN to ketones requires an acid catalyst. So, perhaps reagent A is H3O+ (like sulfuric acid), which would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, allowing the CN- to attack.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Oh wait, the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So the reaction is nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. How is that done?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, using H2SO4 and H2O, heat, would typically convert nitriles to amides first, but wait, no—acidic hydrolysis of nitriles usually gives carboxylic acids. Alternatively, I think that a strong acid like HCl can be used with water. Or maybe it's done using a mixture of HCl and water with some other reagent.

Wait, but the second reagent B is H2O. So the reagent is either H2O in the presence of an acid or a base. Let me think. To hydrolyze a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, the common methods are:

1. Under strong acidic conditions: H2SO4 as a catalyst, with water. This is a hydrolysis that goes through an imidamide intermediate and then to the acid.

2. Under basic conditions, but that usually gives a carboxylate salt, which would then need acid work-up to become the carboxylic acid.

So in this case, the starting material is the nitrile, and the product is the carboxylic acid. So the reagent B must be providing acidic conditions.

Looking at the options, the possible B reagents are HCl or CH3COOH. Wait, option A says B is HCl, option B says B is CH3COOH. So for acidic hydrolysis, either might work, but which is more likely?

Wait, but in the problem statement, the reagent is B (H2O), meaning that the actual reagent is H2O plus another component. Oh, perhaps B is the acid catalyst. So in the second reaction, the reagent is H2O with an acid, such as HCl or CH3COOH.

So for nitrile to carboxylic acid, which conditions are used? I think that HCl (H2O, HCl) is a common reagent for such hydrolysis. Alternatively, using a mixture like H2O with H2SO4 as catalyst. But among the options given, the B reagents are either HCl or CH3COOH.

Another approach: the reaction in the second step is nitrile to carboxylic acid. The possible reagents would be HCl (like a HCl aqueous solution), or perhaps a mixture with another acid.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says B is HCl, option C says B is HCl as well.

Wait, the options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

Wait, so for the second reaction, the reagent is B, which includes H2O. So perhaps the reaction is in aqueous solution. So for the second step, the reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid via hydrolysis. The conditions for that are typically either strong acid (like HCl) or strong base followed by acidification.

But in the options, B's possible reagents are HCl (options A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D).

HCl is a strong acid, which would work for hydrolysis. CH3COOH is a weak acid. Would that be sufficient for the reaction? I think that for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, strong acid is needed, like HCl.

Alternatively, sometimes nitriles are hydrolyzed with H2O in presence of an acid catalyst, but which one?

Wait, but another thought: in the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ (as per my initial thought). So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+.

But for the second reaction, I'm thinking that B is HCl, which is an acid, making options A and C possible (since A in those is H3O+ or NaHSO3).

Wait, but wait. Let me recap. First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product, which is a cyanohydrin. The reaction is acid-catalyzed, so A is H3O+.

So for the first reaction, A must be H3O+.

Looking back at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. So which of those is correct?

Now, the second reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid. So the reagent would be aqueous HCl (H2O and HCl). So B is HCl. So looking at the options, option A has B as HCl.

So putting it together: A is H3O+ and B is HCl. So the correct option would be A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other possibilities?

Wait, another possibility: if in the second reaction, the nitrile is being hydrolyzed using a weak acid. Let me think. For the nitrile hydrolysis to produce a carboxylic acid, the reaction typically requires either strong acid or strong base. So HCl (a strong acid) would be a suitable reagent for this.

So the second reaction uses HCl as B, which is option A.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl. That fits.

But wait, another thought: during the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, sometimes a strong acid like H2SO4 is used, or perhaps HCl. Alternatively, sometimes the reaction is done in aqueous acid with heat.

So in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid). Since HCl is a strong acid, it's more likely to be the correct reagent for this hydrolysis.

So the correct answer would be option A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl.


The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone. Acid catalysis is typically required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Therefore, reagent A is likely **H₃O⁺**, which provides the necessary acidic conditions.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires acidic or basic conditions. Among the options, **HCl** is a strong acid and a suitable reagent for this reaction, as it facilitates the hydrolysis process. Weak acids like CH₃COOH are less likely to provide the necessary conditions for this transformation.

Considering the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This fits the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, B is not suitable for the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the first reaction.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
