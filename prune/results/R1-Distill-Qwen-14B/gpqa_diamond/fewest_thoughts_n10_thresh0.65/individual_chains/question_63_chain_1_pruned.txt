Okay, so I have this physics problem about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, so I'll need to calculate it.

First, understanding the model. The non-rigid rotor model probably means we're considering both rotational and vibrational energy states. But wait, the question is about the transition to the next state with the lowest energy. I'm a bit confused about whether this is a rotational or vibrational transition, or both.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. If the molecule is in the fundamental state, perhaps it's in the ground state for both rotation and vibration. When it absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next state. But what's the next state with the lowest energy? Oh, maybe it's the first excited state, which could involve either vibration or rotation.

Wait, I think the rotational and vibrational states have different energy levels. Vibrational energy transitions typically require more energy than rotational because the bond is involved in vibrations, which have higher frequencies. So maybe the next lowest state is the first vibrational excited state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me clarify. In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0 or J=1, depending on the molecule). But for diatomic molecules, the rotational state J=0 is allowed for certain vibrational transitions? Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's think about the energy levels. The total energy is a sum of rotational (E_rot) and vibrational (E_vib) energies.

The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number.

So the fundamental state would be the lowest, which is v=0 and J=0. If the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and it absorbs a photon, the photon's energy must match the energy difference to the next higher state. But which state is the next in energy?

The
