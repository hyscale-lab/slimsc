Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So, the star moves a little back and forth as the planet orbits it.

The question says there are two stars with exactly the same masses, both similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with masses similar to Neptune, and the planets are in circular orbits. So, same star masses, same planet masses, but the Doppler shifts are different.

Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 is 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does that relate to the orbital period?

I think the Doppler shift (or radial velocity semi-amplitude) depends on several factors. There's this formula, right? The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by something like K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. But wait, wait, I think the formula also involves the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the distance between them.

Oh right! The formula I remember is K = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)))

But since the planets have similar masses to Neptune and the stars are similar to Sun, M_p is much less than M_star. So we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the orbits are circular, so e is zero, so that term becomes 1. So, K ≈ (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) * sin i. But since sin i is the same for both (maybe both are edge-on for maximum effect?), but the question doesn't say. Hmm, but I don't think we can assume that. Wait, but the RV method measures the semi-amplitude K, which depends on sin i. So if i is 90 degrees, sin i is 1, which is the maximum. But in this question, since both planets are found, it's likely that their inclinations are such that sin
