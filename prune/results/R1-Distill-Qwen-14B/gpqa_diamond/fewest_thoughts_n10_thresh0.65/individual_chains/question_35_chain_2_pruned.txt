Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read it again and understand what it's asking.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, I have to choose the correct statement among the options A to D.

Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvalues are related to the angular momentum quantum numbers. But wait, this is for spin-1/2 particles since muons are fermions, right? So their spin is 1/2, so the possible eigenvalues for the components should be ħ/2 times something.

Wait, actually, the intrinsic angular momentum operator components (like Sx, Sy, Sz) for spin-1/2 particles have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But in this case, the operator is Ay, which is given as c multiplied by S. So c is h/(4π). Let me compute c times S to get Ay.

Wait, let me think about the matrix S first. The matrix S is given as:

S = [ [0, -i],
      [i, 0] ]

So when we multiply c, which is h/(4π), each
