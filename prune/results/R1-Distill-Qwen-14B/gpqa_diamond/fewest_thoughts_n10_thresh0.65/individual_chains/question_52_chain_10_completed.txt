Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. I remember from my studies that when stars have spots, it changes their overall brightness and temperature, which in turn affects the spectra we observe. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so let me think through this.

So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive. If spots are cooler, then the star's overall temperature should decrease, right? So the effective temperature being lower when spots are present makes sense.

The problem states that when looking at the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2), this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Oh, right, that's in the near-ultraviolet range. And the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann equation applies here.

So, in LTE, the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g are the statistical weights, E are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, we're looking at the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels, and this ratio changes when the star has spots. The ratio decreases when there are spots. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher, and when it does have spots, it's lower.

But why would the ratio change? Because the temperature changes. Since spots are cooler, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere goes down when spots are present. So when the star has spots, the average Teff is lower. 

So the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE = E2 - E1 (assuming E2 > E1, so level 2 is higher energy). Since the temperature is lower when spots are present, the exponential term becomes larger. Wait, wait no: the exponent is negative, so a lower T makes the exponent less negative. So exp(-x) where x is larger (because T is smaller) would make the value bigger.

Wait, let's think numerically. If T decreases, ΔE/(k*T) increases because T is in the denominator. So if E2 > E1, ΔE is positive. So when T is lower, (ΔE)/(kT) is larger, so exp(-ΔE/(kT)) becomes smaller. Wait no, wait: wait, if (ΔE / (k T)) is larger, then exp(- that) is a smaller number. Because, for example, exp(-5) is smaller than exp(-3). So if T is lower, the exponent is more negative, leading to a lower ratio n2/n1.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T decreases, the ratio n2/n1 would decrease as well. Because the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio is smaller. So, without spots, the star is hotter (6000 K), so the ratio is higher. When spots are present, it's cooler (5500 K), so the ratio is lower. So the ratio decreases when spots are present. That matches the problem statement.

So the question is, what's the factor by which the ratio changes. That is, original ratio (no spots) divided by the ratio with spots.

So the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

Which is [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ].

Wait, but g2/g1 would be the same in both cases, since they’re the same energy levels. So it cancels out. So the factor is exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Alternatively, factor = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because the exponent becomes (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) when you factor that.

Wait, let me double-check. The ratio when no spots is (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and with spots, it's exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). So the ratio is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )

Because:

exp(-a)/exp(-b) = exp( b - a ) = exp( (b - a) ) 

Which is exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-express that.

Original ratio: exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Ratio with spots: exp(-ΔE/(k T2) )

So the factor is [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Which is the same as exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, but wait: T1 is the temperature when there are no spots, which is 6000 K. T2 is the temperature when there are spots, 5500 K.

So 1/T2 is bigger than 1/T1. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 is positive.

So (ΔE/k) multiplied by a positive number.

So the exponent is positive. So the factor is greater than 1, which makes sense because the ratio without spots is higher than with spots.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the factor (no spots / spots) is greater than 1.

So the formula is correct.

Now, I need to compute this factor. But I don't have the value of ΔE. But I know the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Oh, right! The energy difference between the two levels can be found using the relation between energy and wavelength.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength.

So ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

But wait, in the Boltzmann equation, the energy is in terms of the transition between the two levels, which is given by the photon emitted or absorbed. So yes, ΔE = hc/λ.

So let me compute ΔE/(k) in terms of temperature. Because k is Boltzmann's constant.

So, rearrange:

ΔE/(k) = (hc)/(kλ )

So, let's compute this value.

Given that λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

Planck's constant h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

So let me compute hc/(kλ):

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by (k * λ): 1.38e-23 J/K * 1448e-10 m = 1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7 = 1.38 *1.448e-30 ≈ 1.996e-30 J·m

Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly. 1.38e-23 * 1448e-10 = 1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7 = (1.38 *1.448) * 1e-30 ≈ 1.996e-30.

So hc/(kλ) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.996e-30 J·m) = approximately 1e5 (since 1e-25 / 1e-30 = 1e5) → but let me compute it precisely.

1.9878e-25 / 1.996e-30 ≈ (1.9878 / 1.996) * 1e5 → approx 1.0 * 1e5 → 1e5 K.

Wait, that's interesting. So hc/(kλ) ≈ 1e5 K.

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

k λ = 1.38e-23 J/K * 1448e-10 m = 1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7 = 1.38 * 1.448 = approx 1.995 (since 1.38 *1.4 is 1.932, and 1.38 *0.048≈0.06624 → total≈1.998). So 1.998e-30 J·m.

So hc/(kλ) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.998e-30 ≈ (1.9878 / 1.998) * 1e5 ≈ 0.995 * 1e5 ≈ 9.95e4 K. Approximately 1e5 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Wait, but I can also think in terms of 1 Angstrom. I remember that for visible light (say 5000 Angstroms), the corresponding temperature is around 6000 K. So the formula is about 1.44e4 K·Å. Because 5000 K * 1.44e4 Å per K ≈ 7.2e8 K·Å? Wait no, perhaps I'm mixing up something. Alternatively, the Wien's law says that λ_max * T ≈ 2.9e-3 m·K. But that's for the peak wavelength of blackbody emission. But here, the transition is at 1448 Å. So the energy is about hc/(lambda) → which gives the E per photon.

So going back, ΔE/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

So now, the exponent in the factor is ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = 1e5 K * (1/5500 K - 1/6000 K).

Let me compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) first.

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818
1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667
Difference ≈ 0.000015151

So 1e5 K * 0.000015151 1/K → 1e5 * 0.000015151 = 1.5151.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5151.

So the factor is exp(1.5151) ≈ what?

I know that e^1 is about 2.718. e^1.5 is approximately 4.4817. Because e^1=2.718, e^0.5≈1.6487, so 2.718 * 1.6487 ≈ 4.48. So 1.515 is a bit less than 1.5. Let me compute e^1.515.

Alternatively, using a calculator: e^1.515 ≈ ?

I can break it down: 1.515 = 1.5 + 0.015.

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^0.015 ≈ 1 + 0.015 + (0.015^2)/2 + (0.015^3)/6 ≈ 1.01511.

So e^1.515 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.01511 ≈ 4.4817 *1.015 ≈ approx 4.546.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can use a more precise approach. Let me compute 1.515:

The natural exponent e^1.515.

We can compute it as:

ln(4.546) is about 1.515, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate it as around 4.54 or so.

But let me think: the options are B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9. So 4.5 is an option, option C.

Wait, but wait! Wait a minute. Did I compute the exponent correctly?

Wait ΔE/(k) is (hc)/(kλ) ≈ 1e5 K. So (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = 1e5 * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 1e5 * ( (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) )

Wait, correct calculation of 1/5500 - 1/6000.

Compute (6000 - 5500)/(5500 * 6000) ) = 500/(3.3e7) ) = 5e2 / 3.3e7 = (5/3.3) * 1e-5 → 5/3.3 ≈ 1.515 → so 1.515e-5.

Then, 1e5 * 1.515e-5 = 1.515.

So exponent is 1.515. So e^1.515 ≈ 4.54.

So the factor is about 4.5, which is option C.

Wait, but let me think again. I'm supposed to find the ratio (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is 4.5 times higher. So the answer is option C) ~4.5.

Wait, but let me just double-check the calculation for (1/5500 - 1/6000).

1/5500 = 0.000181818...
1/6000 = 0.000166666...
Subtracting, 0.000015151...

So (1/5500 -1/6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(33,000,000) ) = 5e2/(3.3e7) = (5/33e5) )? Wait, 5e2 /3.3e7 is (5/3.3e5) ) → 5/(330000) )= 1/66,000 ≈ 1.515e-5.

Yes, that part is correct.

So 1e5 K * (1.515e-5) = 1.515.

So exp(1.515) ≈ 4.54, which is option C.

But wait, let me think about whether I should be using the temperature of the star without spots (6000 K) and with spots (5500 K) correctly.

Yes, because the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So, when spots are present (T = T2=5500K), ratio is lower than without spots (T1=6000K).

So the factor is about 4.5, so option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE):

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio of the populations is proportional to the exponential term, and the statistical weights \( g_2/g_1 \) cancel out when taking the ratio of the populations at two different temperatures.

The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Relating energy difference to wavelength
The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the transition wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\). Using the relation \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), we compute:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} = 1.448 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

To express \(\Delta E/k\) in terms of temperature, we divide by \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.448 \times 10^{-19}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 105,000 \, \text{K}.
\]

Thus, \(\Delta E / k \approx 10^5 \, \text{K}\).

### Step 2: Compute the temperature difference term
The temperatures of the star are \(T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\). The term \((1/T_{\text{spots}} - 1/T_{\text{no spots}})\) is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}.
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818, \quad \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.00001515 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the factor
The exponent in the factor is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right) = (10^5) \times (0.00001515) \approx 1.515.
\]

The factor is then:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.515).
\]

Using \(e^{1.515} \approx 4.54\), the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5.

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.
