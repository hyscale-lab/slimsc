Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm. Let's see. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like Ca²+.

The problem gives me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Oh wait, formation constants are for the reaction where the metal and ligand form a complex. So the formula for K is [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but in the solution, the EDTA is probably all bound to Ca²+ because the K is so large. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be really low. That makes sense because EDTA is a strong chelator.

The solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of CaEDTA²- is 0.02 M. Since the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-, the stoichiometry is 1:1.

So if all the Ca is in the complex, then [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M. But wait, no, because some of it might dissociate. But with such a high K, the dissociation should be minimal.

So to model this, the dissociation would be K = [Ca][EDTA]/[CaEDTA²-
