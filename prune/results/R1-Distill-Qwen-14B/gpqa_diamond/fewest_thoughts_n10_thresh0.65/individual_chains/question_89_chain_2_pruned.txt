Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, producing a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, and then dimethylsulfide is added to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

First, I need to figure out what each reaction does. Let's start with the first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene. So, I think this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction. So, the product 1 is likely an adamantane derivative with a double bond. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the elimination would form an alkene between the 1 and 3 positions? Wait, but in adamantane, the structure is a diamondoid, so positions 1 and 3 might not be adjacent. Wait, no—adamantane has a structure where each carbon is bonded to three others, so 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Oh, wait, maybe it's a diamondoid structure where carbons are in a cage-like arrangement. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on carbons that are two positions apart, perhaps on adjacent faces. So when KOH is used, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr twice, forming a double bond.

Wait, but wait: 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on adjacent carbons in the diamondoid structure. So when KOH is added, each bromine would leave, and the adjacent hydrogens would be abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond. So product 1 should be 1,3-diamantadiene or something similar? Or more accurately
