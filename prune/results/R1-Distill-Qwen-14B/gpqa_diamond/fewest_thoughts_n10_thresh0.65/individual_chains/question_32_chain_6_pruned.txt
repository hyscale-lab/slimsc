Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of a nucleus. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons, which I think means it's Lithium-6 because Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons makes it Li-6. So, the mass number A is 6.

First, I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a particle in a collider is often given by the relativistic energy formula. But wait, which formula exactly? Oh right, the total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy, E = γmc². And gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, I need to find gamma for v = 0.96c. Let me calculate gamma first. The formula is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Plugging in v = 0.96c:

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is indeed 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The rest mass energy E0 is mc². The mass m is the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. So I need the mass of Li-6 in kilograms.

Wait, but I think there's an easier way. I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be found using the atomic mass in atomic mass units (u). One u is approximately 1.
