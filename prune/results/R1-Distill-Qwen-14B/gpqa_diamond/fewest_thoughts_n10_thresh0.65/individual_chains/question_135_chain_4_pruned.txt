Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about the decay of a boson X. Hmm, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψf(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ̄f(y). Wait, I think that's the interaction term between the boson X and the fermions.

So, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find which of the given options correctly lists the possible decay channels of X at the lowest order. The options are A to D, each listing different fermion-antifermion pairs.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into fermions, the energy (mass of the boson) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because in decay processes, conservation of energy and mass comes into play. So, the fermions that X can decay into must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV each because 6 GeV is the mass of X, and you need two of them (like a fermion and antifermion).

Wait, but wait. I think the mass of the fermions is important. Let me list the masses of the known fermions. Electrons are very light, about 0.5 MeV, so way below 3 GeV. Same with muons (about 105.7 MeV) and taus (about 1.78 GeV). Then, quarks: up and down are light, like a few MeV, but the strange quark is about 100 MeV. The charm quark is around 1.5 GeV, bottom quark about 4.5 GeV, and top quark way heavier, about 173 GeV. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact masses. 

Wait, but wait. The problem is about X's decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. So for each possible fermion f, the mass of X must be at least 2m_f, because each fermion has mass m_f and the pair (f and f̄) would require 2m_f.

So X is 6 GeV. Let's see which fermions f have m_f such that 2
