Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the operator P, which is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, P_z. The eigenvector is for a muon, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I remember that the operator P is a vector, so the overall operator P would be a combination of these components, probably something like P = P_x x_hat + P_y y_hat + P_z z_hat, but wait, is that right? Or maybe in this case, the direction is arbitrary but lying in the x-z plane. Oh, right, the direction vector n is in the x-z plane. So the direction is arbitrary but within x and z. That probably means the angle theta is either 0 or 90 degrees, but wait, no, the question says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". So n could have components in x and z, but zero in y. So the direction is, say, (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that.

Wait, but the operator in question is the vector P. So to find the eigenvector for the operator P along n, I think it relates to the spin operator. Because in quantum mechanics, spin operators are similar. The operator P might be the spin operator σ (like Pauli matrices) scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, the components given: Px is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i? Wait, no, the Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], so yes, that's correct. And Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix. So each component of P is (ħ/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix.

So the operator P is a vector operator where each component is (ħ/2) σ_i, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So for a spin-½ particle, the eigenvalue of the spin component along
