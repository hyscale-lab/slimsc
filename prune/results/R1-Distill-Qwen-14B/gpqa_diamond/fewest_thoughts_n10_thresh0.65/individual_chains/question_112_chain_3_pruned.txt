Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

Alright, the problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state. Because when you have a quantum state, it has to have a norm of 1, right? So the coefficients should satisfy <alpha|alpha> = 1.

Wait, but the question says it's proportional, so perhaps I need to find the normalization factor first. Let me write down the components. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So the coefficients are (1+i) for up and (2-i) for down.

To normalize, I'll compute the inner product of the state with itself. So the inner product is (1+i)*(1-i) + (2-i)*(2+i), because when you take the inner product of a sum, it's the sum of the products. Oh wait, no, wait: actually, the inner product is the sum of each coefficient times the conjugate of the corresponding coefficient. Because |a|^2 is a*a_conj.

So let me compute each part. For the |up> part: (1+i) times its conjugate (1-i) is (1)(1) + (1)(-i) + (i)(1) + (i)(-i) = 1 -i +i -
