Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the crystal is rhombohedral, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. The angles alpha, beta, and gamma are all 30 degrees. They're asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The options are A to D, with numbers around 8.95 to 10.05 Angstroms.

Wait, interplanar distance... Oh right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h² + k² + l²)(α² + β² + γ²)/something... Wait, no, wait. I think I'm mixing things up. The general formula for a cubic system is d = a/(sqrt(h² +k² +l²)), but for non-cubic systems, especially rhombohedral, it's more complicated.

Rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where all edges are equal (a = b = c) but the angles are not 90 degrees. Oh, right, the unit cell is a rhombohedron. So the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system must take the angles into account.

I remember the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice is d = [a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) ) ] or something like that. Wait, no, I'm not getting it right. Another approach: the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is derived from the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

Wait, maybe the formula is d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ( (1/a²) (1 + (cos α)/(cos β)) ... )) no, that's not right. Maybe I should look up the general formula for interplanar distance, but since I can't, I have to recall from what I know.

Another thought: For a rhombohedral system, the lattice is based on a rhombohed
