Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant tells us how stable the complex is. The higher the K, the more stable the complex. So in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is pretty stable because K is 5e10, which is a big number.

Stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex... Oh right, that means the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio. So each Ca²+ binds with one EDTA^4- (or maybe the deprotonated form, but under ideal pH, I think the EDTA is in its active form, Y^4-). So the complex is CaY²−, maybe? Or wait, the charge would depend on the EDTA form. But I think the exact charge might not matter right now.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−, but the K is so large, the dissociation should be minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the concentration of calcium ions. So the solution has the Ca-EDTA complex, which is mostly dissociated into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. But because the formation constant is so large, the dissociation is small.

Wait, no, actually, formation constant K is for the formation of the complex. The formation reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ⇌ CaEDTA²−. The K for this reaction is 5e10. So K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

In this case, the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA²−], is 0.02 M. But wait, if the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²−, then we can think that the dissociation is minimal, so [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−]
