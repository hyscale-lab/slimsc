Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e, and they have negligible mass. Out of these, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and choose from the given options.

Hmm, so I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. When dealing with charges, the potential energy stored in a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Since potential energy for point charges is involved, I remember the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant.

But wait, in a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for each charge, I need to calculate the energy it contributes when placed at its position, considering all the other charges already there.

In this scenario, the setup has a charge fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P. So, the 13th charge is fixed, meaning I don't have to account for moving it because it's already in place. The other 12 are moving into their positions, each at 2 meters from P.

Wait, but all the 13 charges are identical. Each has charge 2e. So each has 2 times the elementary charge, which is about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So 2e would be 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Now, the system's potential energy will be the sum of the interactions between each pair. But wait, since all charges are identical and placed symmetrically, maybe there's a simpler way to compute this.

Let me think. The fixed charge at P is one charge, and the 12 others are each at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges will interact with the fixed charge and also with each other.

Wait, but the 12 charges at 2 meters are constrained not to move relative to each other. So their distances from each other might be varying,
