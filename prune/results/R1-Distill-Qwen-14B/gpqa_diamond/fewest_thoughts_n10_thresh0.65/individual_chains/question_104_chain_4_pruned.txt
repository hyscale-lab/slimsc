Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, and they used the RV method to detect them. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull, right?

So, planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. I remember that the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity. Oh wait, but how does that relate to the planet's orbital period?

Wait, the RV method gives us the star's velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula for K is K = (V) = ( (G * (M_p)^2) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/(3)) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )... Or maybe that's not right. Maybe I should think in terms of Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis divided by the mass of the star. But since the stars are the same mass, and the planets have similar mass, maybe the semi-major axis is related to the velocity?

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (2π * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 year)^2 ) )

But this might be getting too complicated. Alternatively, I remember that for circular orbits (e=0), the formula simplifies. Also, since the masses of the planets are similar to Neptune, and the stars are like the Sun, M_p << M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So let's approximate.

So K ≈
