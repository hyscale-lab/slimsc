Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation states of atoms can tell us something about their temperatures. 

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, but what does that mean exactly? Oh right, the excitation level relates to the population of higher energy states. I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution describes how particles are distributed in different energy states at thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann factor is the probability of a particle being in a state with energy E. The formula is something like (g_i/g_j) * exp(-(E_i - E_j)/(k T)), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E_i and E_j are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant. Oh wait, since the question compares the same energy levels, maybe the statistical weights are the same for both stars, so they cancel out.

Wait, the problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So for a certain transition, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So the ratio of their excitation levels is 2.

Let me denote the excitation as N. So N1 = 2 N2. Or more precisely, the ratio N1/N2 = 2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, N_i = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ) * N_j. Assuming it's a two-level system, where j is the lower state and i is the upper. Hmm, but wait, the problem says that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. That's the E_i - E_j, the energy difference between the levels.

Wait, but in the Boltzmann factor, it's (E_i - E_j) since i is higher. So E_i > E_j, so the term is positive. So the ratio N_i / N_j is proportional to exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), but wait wait, actually the formula is N_i = N_j * (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_i - E_j.

So the ratio N_i / N_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). But in the problem, I think we are looking at the same transition for both stars, so the ΔE is the same for both. Also, assuming that the statistical weights are the same for both stars, which I think is a valid assumption since it's the same elements and transitions.

Wait, but the question says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So for star_1, the upper level population is N1_upper, and lower is N1_lower. Similarly for star_2. So for each star, the excitation is (N_upper)/(N_lower), perhaps.

Wait, maybe the ratio N1_upper / N1_lower is twice that of N2_upper / N2_lower. So:

(N1_upper / N1_lower) = 2 * (
