Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll work through it.

First, the question says that ESPRESSO at Paranal can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. HIRES at Keck can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, the star's apparent V magnitude needs to be less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Because lower magnitude means brighter, right? So, any star with V mag ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and ≤16 can be seen by HIRES.

But wait, wait. The question is which stars can be detected by both. So, the star must be observable by both. That means the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if it's ≤16, then it's definitely ≤17. So, the star's apparent V mag has to be ≤16 for both to detect it.

But wait, some stars have extinction (like dust in the interstellar medium), which affects their apparent magnitude. Oh, right, because interstellar extinction (or reddening) makes stars appear dimmer and redder. The problem mentions E(B-V), which is the color excess. The total absorption in V band is 3.1 times E(B-V). So, the observed V magnitude (apparent) is the intrinsic (absolute) V magnitude plus the extinction.

Wait, but how does that work? Let me think. Absolute magnitude is how bright the star would appear at 10 pc. But when it's farther away, it's dimmer. But extinction makes it appear even dimmer.

Wait, the formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V, where A_V is the extinction in V band. Or wait, is it m = M + 5 (log10(d) - 1) + A_V? Because d is in parsecs. Yes, so that's correct.

But in some cases, the star's given apparent magnitude already accounts for extinction. Wait, the problem states for Star3 and Star4, the E(B-V) is given, and we're to calculate the extinction.

So, let's go through each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So, compute its apparent magnitude. Since it's at 10 pc, the distance modulus is 0, so apparent magnitude is 15.5. But wait, is there any extinction? The problem doesn't mention E(B-V) for Star1, so I think we can assume no extinction. So apparent V is 15.5. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it? Because 15.5 is ≤16 and ≤17. So yes, both would detect it.

Star2: Apparent V mag 16.5. No mention of E(B-V), so no extinction. So apparent mag is 16.5. For HIRES, which can go up to 16, 16.5 is too faint. So HIRES can't see it. ESPRESSO can, as 16.5 ≤17. So Star2 can't be detected by both.

Star3: Absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. Distance is 15 pc. So first, compute the distance modulus. 15 pc, so modulus is 5 log(15/10) = 5 log(1.5) ≈5 *0.1761=0.8805. So M = 15.5, m no extinction would be 15.5 + 0.8805=16.3805. But then extinction: A_V=3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.6=1.86. So apparent V =16.3805 +1.86=18.24. So m=18.24. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can't detect it, because 18.24 is higher than both 17 and 16. So Star3 is too faint for both.

Wait, but wait. Oh wait, Star3's apparent V is given as 15.5 mag. Wait no, the problem says Star3 has apparent V mag of 15.5, but also gives E(B-V). Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, let me re-read.

Star3: Apparent V mag of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6 mag. Oh, but wait, then the apparent magnitude is already observed. So perhaps in that case, do I
