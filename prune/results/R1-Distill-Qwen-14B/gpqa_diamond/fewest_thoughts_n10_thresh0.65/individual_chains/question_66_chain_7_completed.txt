Hmm, okay, I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the SMEFT. I remember SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework that incorporates the Standard Model with higher-dimensional operators to describe beyond the Standard Model physics.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincaré, CP, and CPT. And the possible answer choices are combinations of these.

Wait, wait. Let me think. I think the SMEFT is constructed in a way that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model. So which symmetries are those?

The Standard Model has Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. Then there's the Poincaré symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting space and time). Oh wait, wait, because Lorentz symmetry is a subset of Poincaré? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Poincaré symmetry is the combination of Lorentz transformations and translations. So Poincaré includes Lorentz. So if SMEFT respects Poincaré, it automatically respects Lorentz symmetry. Or vice versa? I'm a bit confused here.

But the question includes both Lorentz and Poincaré as separate options. So I need to figure out whether operators in SMEFT must respect both or just one.

Wait, SMEFT is built as an effective theory, so it's a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because effective theories are usually built under the same symmetries as the theories they're effective for. Since the Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, SMEFT must also be Lorentz invariant.

But what about Poincaré symmetry? I'm not entirely sure. Does SMEFT include translations? Well, the operators are built as local operators, so I think they're still invariant under Poincaré symmetry. Or wait, maybe the way SMEFT is constructed, the operators are local, so they must respect all the symmetries that the Standard Model respects, which includes Poincaré. So maybe both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries are respected.

Wait, but the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So if SMEFT respects Poincaré, that includes Lorentz symmetry. So does that mean that the operators must respect both? Or is one redundant?

Wait, no, the question lists them as separate options. So perhaps both Lorentz and Poincaré must be respected. But wait, I'm not entirely certain. I think Poincaré includes Lorentz and translation. So if operators respect Poincaré, they automatically respect Lorentz symmetry. So the question is, do the operators have to respect both? Or is it enough to have Poincaré?

But the question is about which must be respected. So if Poincaré includes Lorentz, then maybe the answer includes Poincaré, which would imply Lorentz is automatically included. But the options are given as 1,2, etc. So option A is 1 and 2, which are Lorentz and Poincaré. So perhaps both are required.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because if Poincaré symmetry is already a symmetry, then operators in the theory must be Poincaré invariant. So they must respect both Lorentz and translation symmetries, which are part of Poincaré. So perhaps the operators must respect Poincaré symmetry, which in turn implies Lorentz symmetry. So maybe the correct answer includes both 1 and 2.

Wait, but maybe the SMEFT is constructed so that the operators are required to be Lorentz scalars. So the operators must be Lorentz invariant, but I'm not sure if it's necessary to separately mention Poincaré. Maybe the SMEFT is formulated in a way that respects Poincaré, so both symmetries are required.

Hmm. Let's think about the other options. What about CP and CPT symmetry?

CP symmetry is the combination of Charge conjugation and Parity. CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. The Standard Model is not CP symmetric, right? For example, CP violation is observed in the weak interaction. So does SMEFT require operators to be CP invariant? I don't think so. Because SMEFT is a framework that can include higher-dimensional operators that may or may not respect various symmetries.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Do the SMEFT operators have to respect CP? Or is CP violation allowed?

Wait, in the Standard Model, certain CP violations are present, like in the CKM matrix. So the effective operators in SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. Thus, the operators don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 (CP) isn't a must.

What about CPT symmetry? I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry. The CPT theorem states that in any quantum field theory with certain properties (like Lorentz symmetry), the product of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal symmetry must hold. So if a theory respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT.

Wait, so the SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. And if it does, then it must automatically respect CPT symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT because it's required by Lorentz symmetry.

So putting it all together:

- Do operators respect Lorentz symmetry? Yes, because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory.
- Do they respect Poincaré symmetry? Yes, because the operators are local (and translation-invariant), so Poincaré is included.
- Do they respect CP? No, because CP is not necessarily conserved. So operators can violate CP, so it's not a must.
- Do they respect CPT? Yes, because Lorentz symmetry implies CPT.

Wait, but wait a second. The Poincaré symmetry includes translations. So if SMEFT operators are local, they must be invariant under translations. So the operators must be scalars under the Poincaré group, which includes translations. So both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries must be respected.

Wait, but do all operators automatically respect translation symmetry if they are local? Because in effective field theories, operators are typically written as local operators. So the translation invariance would be part of Poincaré, so operators must be invariant under both Lorentz and translation.

But the question is about which symmetries must all operators respect. So in the SMEFT, every operator must be a scalar under Lorentz and Poincaré. So the operators must be invariant under both Lorentz and Poincaré.

Wait, but in a way, if an operator is Poincaré invariant, it's automatically Lorentz invariant. So perhaps the question lists them as separate, but only Poincaré is a must, which implies Lorentz.

Alternatively, the question may be considering that SMEFT respects Lorentz, but perhaps the operators are not necessarily respecting Poincaré? No, I think SMEFT is built to respect all the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Poincaré.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of which symmetries must the operators individually respect. Oh, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the theory respects Poincaré, then all operators must be Poincaré invariant, which includes Lorentz.

So the operators must respect Poincaré, which includes Lorentz. So the correct options would be Poincaré, and CPT. But wait, the options are given as 1,2,3,4. So the question is which of the four must be respected.

Wait, the options are 1. Lorentz, 2. Poincare, 3. CP, 4. CPT.

So do all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare, or just Poincare?

Hmm. Let's think about the structure of SMEFT. The operators are written in terms of local fields, so they must be scalars under the Poincaré group (because the theory is Poincaré invariant). So each operator must be a scalar under Poincaré, which implies they are scalars under Lorentz as well. So that would mean that the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries.

Wait, but isn't Poincaré symmetry a bigger symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator is a Poincaré scalar, it's automatically a Lorentz scalar. So perhaps the correct answer includes both 1 and 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that Poincaré includes Lorentz, so perhaps the answer is that all operators must respect Poincaré, which in turn requires Lorentz and translation. So the symmetry 2 must be respected, but 1 is redundant.

Wait, but the way the options are structured, option A is 1 and 2. Option C is 1,2,4. Hmm.

Wait, but earlier I thought that CPT must be respected, as it's implied by Lorentz symmetry. So all operators must respect CPT, which is symmetry 4.

So putting it all together:

Which symmetries must all operators respect?

- Lorentz (1): Yes, because SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant.
- Poincaré (2): Yes, because the theory is Poincaré-invariant.
- CP (3): No, because SMEFT allows for CP violation.
- CPT (4): Yes, because Lorentz implies CPT.

So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So the correct answer would be option C, which includes 1,2,4.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about whether Poincaré is a must or just Lorentz. Let me think again. The SMEFT is formulated as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. But Poincaré includes translations. So in terms of the operators, they must also be translation invariant. Are all operators in SMEFT translation invariant? Because translation invariance is part of Poincaré.

Wait, for a term like ∫ d^4x L, each term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar under Poincaré, which includes translations. So yes, operators must be Poincaré invariant.

So the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincaré. Additionally, they must respect CPT.

So the correct options are 1,2,4. So the answer is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. Additionally, SMEFT respects Poincaré symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since Poincaré symmetry is a broader symmetry that encompasses Lorentz symmetry, operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries.

CP symmetry, on the other hand, is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT. The Standard Model already allows for CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix), and SMEFT can include operators that violate CP symmetry.

CPT symmetry, however, must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. This is because the CPT theorem ensures that any theory consistent with Lorentz symmetry (and quantum mechanics) must also respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it automatically respects CPT symmetry.

In summary:
- **Lorentz symmetry (1):** Must be respected.
- **Poincaré symmetry (2):** Must be respected.
- **CP symmetry (3):** Not necessarily respected.
- **CPT symmetry (4):** Must be respected.

Thus, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct answer is:

Answer: C
