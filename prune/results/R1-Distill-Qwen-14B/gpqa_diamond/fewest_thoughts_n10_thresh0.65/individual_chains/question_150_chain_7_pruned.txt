Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product after a series of reactions. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. The general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, substituting: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 = (9)/2=4.5. Wait, that can't be right because degrees of unsaturation should be an integer. Did I do the formula correctly? Oh wait, the correct formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So O doesn't factor into it. Wait, no, wait, the formula is: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So X is halogens, which we don't have here. So, substituting, DoU= (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees. That means five rings or double bonds. So probably a combination—like a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU) plus some double bonds or rings.

Looking at the NMR data:

The 1H-NMR shows several peaks. Let's see:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): A triplet near 10 ppm. That's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. Wait, but aldehydes are usually deshielded and split based on adjacent protons. Hmm, but wait, maybe it's a phenol or something else? Or perhaps an aldehyde group adjacent to another proton, like in a conjugated system.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): That's likely aromatic protons. A doublet. So perhaps two protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. Or maybe in a meta arrangement?

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, probably aromatic. Maybe an ortho coupling? Or another para-substituted ring.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet. Two protons. Maybe an enol proton, or protons adjacent to an electronegative group. Or perhaps some aromatic protons in a different environment, like in a di-substituted ring. But the 'bs' stands for broad singlet, which could indicate exchange with something else, like in a phenolic OH group, but that's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol tautomer or something else.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating for two protons. That sounds like a CH2 group attached to something electronegative. Maybe an OCH2 group? Or perhaps part of an alkoxy group. The deshielded region suggests it's near an oxygen. So OCH2CH2... but wait, the doublet—so two protons each coupled to one neighboring proton. So perhaps a CH2 connected to an O, and another CH2 elsewhere.

Putting this together, the structure likely has a benzene ring. Looking at the options, all of them have multiple phenyl groups except option A, which is 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. But let's see. 

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. Molecular formula would be C13H10O (each phenyl is C6H5, but with butenals, let's count: butenals are four carbons. So 2 phenyl groups would add 2*(5 carbons)
