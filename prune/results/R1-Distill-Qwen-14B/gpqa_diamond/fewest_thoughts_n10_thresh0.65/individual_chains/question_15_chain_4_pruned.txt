Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit, making it a better target for observation. Let me try to think through this.

Hmm, the question gives me two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But the masses are the same for both. Wait, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, then Planet_1's is P/3. That means Planet_1 is orbiting much closer to its star, right? Because orbital period is related to the distance from the star. Shorter period means closer orbit.

Now, the host stars: the star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. Oh, interesting. So even though the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but they have same size. Maybe because the higher mass star (Planet_1's) is younger or hasn't expanded yet, or maybe it's a different type.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. Specifically, it's the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital radius, right? Wait, no, actually, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet)^2, where a_planet is the semi-major axis (which is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law). Or was it just R_star / a_planet? I think it's the ratio of the star's size to the orbital distance. Because for the planet to pass in front of the star, the orbital plane must be edge-on. But the probability also depends on the size of the star relative to the orbit.

Wait, the transit probability formula I remember is P = (R_star / a)^2, where R_star is the radius of the star, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So the probability increases as the star's radius increases, and decreases as the planet's orbital distance a increases.

But wait, in this problem, both stars have the same radius. So R_star is the same for both. So the probability depends inversely on the square of the
