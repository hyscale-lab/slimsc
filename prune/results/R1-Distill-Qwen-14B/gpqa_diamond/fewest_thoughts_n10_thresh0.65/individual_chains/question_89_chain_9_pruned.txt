Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the problem is about organic chemistry reactions and the resulting NMR spectra. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to walk through it step by step.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, like a cage with several bridgehead carbons. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two of those bridgehead carbons, probably opposite each other.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. KOH is a strong base, so probably an elimination reaction is happening here. When dibromides react with bases, they can undergo dehydrohalogenation, which leads to the formation of alkenes via the E2 mechanism. So, product 1 is likely an alkene. But wait, in this case, since it's a dibromide of adamantane, elimination would form an allene or maybe a more substituted alkene structure.

Wait, but adamantane is quite a rigid structure. Heating with KOH (maybe a strong base like potassium hydroxide) would abstract a β-hydron, leading to the elimination of Br- and the formation of a double bond. Considering the positions, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two Br atoms, so elimination from each Br would form a double bond between C1 and C3. So, product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or maybe a diradical? Hmm, no, more likely a diene because each Br was on adjacent carbons. Wait, no, 1 and 3 positions on adamantane might not be adjacent. Let me think: adamantane is like a diamond cube, so positions 1 and 3 might be opposite each other, but maybe the structure allows for a conjugated diene.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is on adjacent bridgeheads, leading to forming a double bond between those two carbons. But wait, the product is an alkene, so the structure would have a double bond. The NMR data for product 1 is given as 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch.
