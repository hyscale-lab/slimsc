Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about identifying a chemical formula based on various spectroscopic data. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me look at the information given. The compound was characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching. So maybe this compound has an -OH group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch, maybe like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, or perhaps an amide, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, but if there are two strong carbonyl peaks, maybe it's something with two different carbonyl groups. Or maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic C=C. Oh, wait, the FTIR also shows a very broad peak at 3000. So that could be an -OH group, like an alcohol. But if there's a carbonyl, maybe that's an ester or a ketone.

Looking next at the 1H NMR data: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound probably has a double bond. So maybe an ester with a double bond, or a ketone with a double bond.

Now the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, I need to think about what fragment would give m/z=45. The molecular ion peak is not given, but the fragment could be a common one. 45 is a familiar mass. Let me recall: the molecular weight of (CH2)2O is 45 (since CH2=14, so 3*(14) + 16= 46? Wait, no, (CH3O) would be 31. Wait, maybe it's a different fragment. Oh, wait, the mass 45
