Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out what compound E is. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with compound A reacting with HCN to form compound B. Then B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

First, I'll think about each reaction step.

Starting with compound A and HCN. HCN is a nucleophile and can add to carbonyl groups. So maybe A is a ketone or aldehyde. The product B would be a cyanohydrin if A is a ketone. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, B would be an aldehyde cyanohydrin. 

Wait, but then B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation, probably adding hydrogen across a triple bond or a double bond. If B had a nitrile group (from HCN addition), I'm not sure how that would react. Wait, H2 with Pd is typically for hydrogenolysis or hydrogenation of triple bonds or double bonds. Nitriles are usually reduced by other methods, like using H2 and a catalyst like Raney Ni or maybe using LiAlH4. Hmm, but if B is a nitrile, maybe it's being hydrogenated to an amine? But that doesn't seem right because Pd is used more for hydrogenation of alkenes or alkynes.

Wait, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let me think again. If A is a ketone, reacting with HCN would add a cyanide group across the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin (which would have an alcohol and a cyanide group adjacent). But when B is hydrogenated, that might hydrogenate the double bond from the cyanohydrin. Wait, no, the cyanohydrin would have an -OH and a -CN group on adjacent carbons, but no double bond. So maybe I'm off.

Wait, another approach: maybe A is a cyclic ketone. For example, cyclopentanone. When it reacts with HCN, it would form a cyanohydrin, which would be a cyclopentanol with a cyanide substituent adjacent.

Then, when B is reduced with H2 and Pd, what would happen? If
