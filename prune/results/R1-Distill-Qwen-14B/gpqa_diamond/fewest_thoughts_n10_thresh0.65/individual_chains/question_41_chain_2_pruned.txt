Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again. Hmm, a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is, what's the speed of light in the glass as seen by the observer? Oh, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1, so I can use c=1 in calculations.

Wait, I remember something about how the speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n. But wait, that's the speed relative to the medium, right? So if the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Oh, right, this probably involves some relativity, like the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because when objects are moving relative to each other, their velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh, but wait, the velocities here are v (of the glass) and the light's speed in the medium. Or is it?

Wait, no. The light's speed relative to the glass is v_light_medium = c/n. Because in the glass, light slows down. So the speed of light in the glass, in the rest frame of the glass, is c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So I need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

Wait a second, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. The formula is (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), but wait, that's for when
