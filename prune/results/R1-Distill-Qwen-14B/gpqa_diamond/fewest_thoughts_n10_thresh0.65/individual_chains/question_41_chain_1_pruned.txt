Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's see. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. And we need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index, n. So normally, in the medium, the speed is c/n. But wait, in this case, the medium itself is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

I think this has to do with relative velocities. Let me think about frames of reference. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving, and the light is moving through it.

Wait, in the glass's frame, the speed of light would be c/n. But because the glass is moving, the lab would see a different speed. Oh right, this is similar to how you add velocities in special relativity, but wait, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, the problem is about a medium with a refractive index, so maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, no, wait. Special relativity says that the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But that's for light in a vacuum. When a medium is involved, like glass, things are different because the medium affects the speed of light. So I'm not sure if the usual
