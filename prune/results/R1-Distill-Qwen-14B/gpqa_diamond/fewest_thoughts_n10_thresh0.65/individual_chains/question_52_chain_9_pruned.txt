Alright, so I'm trying to tackle this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

Okay, so the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting, so the spots are making the star appear cooler overall.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. They're asking for the factor by which this ratio changes—so when there's no spots (normal state) compared to when there are spots.

Hmm, right. So I remember that in stellar atmospheres, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is given by (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, wait. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall temperature is lower. So what's happening to the ratio?

Let me think. The ratio R = (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the direction. If ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), then higher temperature T would lead to a higher ratio because the exponential becomes less negative. So when T decreases, the ratio R decreases.

So when the star has spots, T_eff is lower. That would make the ratio R (n2/n1) lower. Which matches the given observation that the ratio decreases when there are spots.

But wait, the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher. So we need to find the ratio when T is 6000 K divided by the ratio when T is 5500 K.

Let me write down the formula:

Ratio without spots (R1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Ratio with spots (R2) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the factor is R1 / R2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, let me be precise. Since R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )

Wait, wait. Let me compute that. Because exponentiating a negative will flip the sign.

So R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait no, let me re-express. Let's see:

R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] 

Which is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Because when you subtract exponents, you add the exponents. So:

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a−b). So:

( -ΔE/(k T1) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = ΔE/(k) [ (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]

Yes, that's correct.

So, the factor is exponential of (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But wait, since ΔE is positive, and T2 is less than T1, 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1. So (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive.

So the exponent is positive, so the factor is greater than 1. Which makes sense because R1 is bigger than R2, so R1/R2 is the factor by which the ratio increases from spots to no spots.

Wait, the question says the ratio decreases when there are spots, so R1 is higher than R2. So when you take R1/R2, you get a number greater than 1.

But what is ΔE? Oh, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the energy difference ΔE is related to the
