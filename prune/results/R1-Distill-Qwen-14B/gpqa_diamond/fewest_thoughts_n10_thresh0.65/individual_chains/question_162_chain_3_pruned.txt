Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, wait, that doesn't look like the standard form of a pseudosphere metric. I remember that a pseudosphere, or a hyperbolic space, usually has a metric that's conformally flat, something like ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + dθ² + sin²θ dφ²), but maybe in 2D it's simpler. Oh, wait, this metric is in 2D because it only has dx² and dy² terms, right? So perhaps it's a 2-dimensional space.

Wait, but pseudospheres are usually in 3D, right? Like the tractricoid, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. But maybe here, the problem is referring to a 2D surface with hyperbolic geometry. Alternatively, perhaps it's a metric in higher dimensions that's being considered as a pseudosphere.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, pseudospheres have an infinite area because they're non-compact. But wait, maybe not. Wait, the usual 2D hyperbolic plane has infinite area, but in higher dimensions, like a 3D pseudosphere, does it have a finite area?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The area of a sphere in
