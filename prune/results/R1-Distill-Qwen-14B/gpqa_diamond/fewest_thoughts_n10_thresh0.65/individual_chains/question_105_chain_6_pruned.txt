Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about comparing the brightness variations caused by a planet to those caused by star spots. Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, star spots can also cause dips because they're cooler and darker regions.

The problem says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The question is asking, to produce the same brightness variation as the spots, what would be the radius of an exoplanet relative to the star?

Wait, so the star's brightness variation is due to spots. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing changes in the observed brightness. But if we didn't have the spots, a planet would cause a similar variation. So we need to find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve.

I think the key here is to calculate the relative change in brightness for both the star spots and the planet transit and set them equal, then solve for the planet's radius.

Let me break this down. First, for the star spots. The spots cover a certain area, but since they're cooler, their contribution to the total light is less. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, the problem says "one hemisphere is covered"—so maybe the spots are spread over half the star's surface. But the filling factor is 20%, so the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere? Or is the filling factor the fraction of the total star's surface covered by spots?

Wait, I think the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Oh wait, because the star is a sphere, so if one hemisphere is covered, then the entire spot coverage is 50% of the star's surface? Or wait, no, the filling factor is 20%—so the spots take up 20% of the star's surface. So the total area of
