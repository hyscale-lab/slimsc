Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. When it reacts violently with liquid Y, it releases gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, and when G is heated, it releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius, so just above freezing. 

Then, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. We need to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes.

Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, let me think about the reaction between X and Y. The reaction is violent and releases gas W. Also, a precipitate forms. The gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, same protons and neutrons mean that the molecule is made of elements with the same number of p and n. Wait, but W is a molecule, so maybe it's something like H2O? Or maybe it's something else with the same number of p and n for each atom in the molecule. Alternatively, perhaps W is a diatomic molecule where each atom has equal p and n.

Wait, the molecule of W has same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, each molecule? Or each atom in the molecule? The way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous, but I think it's each atom. Because if the molecule has, say, two atoms, each with the same number of p and n, then the molecule would have 2*(p +n) each. But more likely, each atom in W has same number of protons and neutrons. Because if it's the molecule, like O2, each O has 8p and 8n, so O has the same p and n. So O2 would be a possible W.

So W is O2 perhaps. Or maybe something else. Let's think: O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in its isotope. So W could be O2. Another possibility is H2 but H has 1p and 0n or 1n (depending on isotope). So that's not matching
