Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When observed, the star's brightness changes because of these spots rotating into and out of view. The problem states that this brightness variation can look similar to an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. Now, the question is asking, if there were no spots, what would be the radius of an exoplanet needed to produce the same light curve amplitude? So we need to find Rpl divided by Rstar.

Hmm. I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. The formula I think is (Rp/R*)^2. Because the area blocked is the area of the planet divided by the area of the star. Since area scales with radius squared, that's where the factor comes from.

But wait, in this problem, the star has spots. So the observed brightness variation isn't just from a planet blocking the star; it's from the spots being in and out of view as the star rotates. So the star's brightness is varying because different areas (the spotted regions) come into the line of sight.

Wait, but the problem says that this situation can "closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet." So, when the spots are on one hemisphere, as the star rotates, the spots would come into and out of view, causing the brightness to dip when spots are facing us and rise when they're not. But how does that compare to a planet's transit?

Wait, no. When a planet transits, the brightness drops because a part of the star is blocked. Similarly, when a spot is facing us, the brightness might drop because the spot is cooler and emits less light. So the star's brightness variation due to spots is similar to a planet blocking light, but in reality, the spots add varying brightness as they rotate.

But the problem is saying that the observed brightness variations (from the spotted star) are the
