Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying hydrogens and oxygen counts. The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

First, I'll look at the FTIR data. It mentions a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate either O-H (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or N-H (amines), but since the options have O, maybe it's O-H. Wait, but waitâ€”the FTIR also shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be ketone, aldehyde, ester, carboxylic acid, etc. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like conjugated double bonds in an aromatic structure, which can absorb around 1600 cm^-1). Sometimes, conjugated carbonyls can have lower wavenumbers. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, which would lower the wavenumber. Also, the broad peak at 3000 might suggest a carbonyl group with an adjacent H, like in a ketone, but wait, ketones don't typically have O-H. Hmm, maybe it's an ester or something else.

Moving on to the NMR. The 1H NMR has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those in a double bond, like CH2=CH. So the compound has a double bond, maybe an alkene or perhaps part of a ring. So, the structure might have both a carbonyl group and a double bond.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I remember that 45 is a common mass for (CH3)2O, which is 45 (since 12*2 +1*6 +16= 24+6+16=46? Wait no, wait: (CH3)2O is (12*2) + (3*2*1) +16= 24 +6 +16=46. Oh wait, another possibility: maybe it's an ester group. Wait, another common fragment is the CH2=O group, which is 30 (12+16=28? Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, 45 could be from a (CH2)2O fragment? Or perhaps the fragment is from an ethyl group with oxygen? Wait, let me think about possible fragments. For example, OCH2CH3 would have a mass of 45? Let's calculate: O is 16, C is 12, H3 is 3. O is 16, CH2 is 14, CH3 is
