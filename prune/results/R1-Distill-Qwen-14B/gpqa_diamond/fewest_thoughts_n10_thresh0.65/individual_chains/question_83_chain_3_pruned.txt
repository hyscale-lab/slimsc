Alright, I've got this chemistry problem about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me try to break it down step by step. So, the question is about finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when a certain volume of acetic acid is diluted and then titrated.

Okay, first, the initial solution. They took 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid and diluted it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. I think I need to calculate the new concentration after dilution.

Using the dilution formula C1V1 = C2V2. C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. So C2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles of acetic acid. After adding 20 cm³, volume is 40 cm³. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is the pH at 25% titration. 25% of what volume? I think the equivalence point volume is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So, at equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed would be same as acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume V = moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait, no. Wait, the initial solution is 0.025 M acetic acid in 0.04 L? Or wait, no, wait. Let me recount. The initial solution was 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then diluted to 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So yes, 0.025 M in 0.04 L.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol. So volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So 25% titration would be 25% of the equivalence point volume. That's 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So, the first part is the pH at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Let's think about the reaction.

Acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with NaOH (OH-) to form acetate (CH3COO^-) and water.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, the moles of acetic acid initially is 0.001 mol. The moles of NaOH added at 25% are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, the moles of CH3COOH remaining would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And moles of CH3COO^- formed is 0.00025 mol.

Wait, wait. Wait, the total volume at this point is initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L. So the concentrations would be [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 and [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425.

But maybe it's easier to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. Because at a certain ratio of acid to conjugate base, pH = pKa + log( [A^-]/[HA] ).

The pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.
