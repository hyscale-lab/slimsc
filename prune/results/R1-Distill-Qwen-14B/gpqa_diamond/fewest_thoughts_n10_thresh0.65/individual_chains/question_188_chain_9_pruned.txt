Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all edges equal and all angles equal too. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms and each angle alpha, beta, gamma is 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice, right? I think the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) )) or something like that. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. I remember that for a cubic system, the formula is simpler because all angles are 90 degrees. But in a rhombohedral system, the angles are different. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos(alpha) + 2hl cos(beta) + 2kl cos(gamma) ). Wait, no, I think I forgot a sign. Because for a rhombohedral crystal, the angles are all the same, alpha = beta = gamma. So in this case, since all angles are 30 degrees, maybe I can plug that in.

The plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1. Let me plug those into the formula. So d = a / sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 + 2*1*1*cos(30) + 2*1*1*cos(30) + 2*1*1*cos(30) )

Wait a second, let me make sure I have the formula correct. Oh wait, the formula for d is a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 hk cos γ + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos α )). But since all angles are 30 degrees, the formula simplifies a bit. So let me compute the denominator step by step.

Compute h² + k² + l²: 1 + 1 + 1
