Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a given operator, and the average value of that operator.

The operator's matrix representation is given as elements A_ij. A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so that's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, right? Because |up> and |down> form a basis for spin states.

So first, I think I should figure out what the operator looks like. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, let's denote the basis as |up> and |down> which correspond to the first and second basis vectors. So, for a 2x2 matrix:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because when i != j, A_ij is hbar/2, and when i=j, it's zero. So this is an off-diagonal matrix with hbar/2 in both off-diagonal elements. Hmm, wait that's correct.

Wait, but I've heard that the Pauli matrices are similar. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is diagonal. So the operator here looks like a scaled version of the Pauli X matrix. Because our A is (hbar/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the X matrix multiplied by (hbar/2).

So, the operator A is (hbar/2) * σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. Knowing that, the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of this operator as well, since it's just a scalar multiple.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the superpositions that are eigenvectors for σ_x. The eigenvalues of σ_x are
