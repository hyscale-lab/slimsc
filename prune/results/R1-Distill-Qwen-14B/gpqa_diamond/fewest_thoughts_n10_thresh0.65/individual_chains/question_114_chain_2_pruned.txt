Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile with reagent B and water to produce the corresponding butanoic acid.

Hmm, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. Adding NaCN, which is sodium cyanide, and some reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe (CH3)2CH(OH)CN? Wait no, wait.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN- (from NaCN), it would undergo a nucleophilic addition. In ketones, the nucleophile adds to the carbonyl carbon. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, but wait, the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. The
