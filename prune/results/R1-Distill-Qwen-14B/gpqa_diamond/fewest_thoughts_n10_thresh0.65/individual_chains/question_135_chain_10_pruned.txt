Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to determine which decay channels are possible at the lowest order.

Hmm, right. So, the problem is about particle physics and decay processes. The key here is to determine which fermions the boson X can decay into. Since the Lagrangian describes the interaction between the boson X and fermions, the possible decay products depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions involved.

Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So, when X decays, it must produce a pair of fermions, like a fermion and its antiparticle, right? Because X is a boson, which typically couples to fermion-antifermion pairs, I think.

So the general rule is that the sum of the masses of the fermion and antifermion must be less than or equal to the mass of the boson. Because energy and mass are related via E=mc², so the rest mass energy of the boson must be enough to create the fermions.

Now, considering that fermions come in different generations, each with different masses. The possible fermions are quarks (like u, d, s, c, b, t) and leptons (like e, mu, tau, and their neutrinos).

But wait, the interaction term in the Lagrangian is given as involving ψ_f. So which fermions are involved here? The Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Maybe f here is a type of fermion that X can interact with.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify which fermions are included. So perhaps I need to assume that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided the mass condition is met.

But wait, another point: the decay must conserve charge and other quantum numbers. But since X is a boson, which is neutral (assuming it's
