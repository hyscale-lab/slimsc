Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2D metric in terms of x and y. I'm trying to remember what kind of geometry this represents. Oh right, this looks like a metric for a 2D space, possibly a sphere or something related.

Wait, pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But I'm getting confused between pseudosphere and hyperboloid maybe. Or is it a sphere in some other space? No, a pseudosphere is an actual shape with negative curvature.

Wait, but the metric here is in 2D, so it's a surface in 3D space? Or perhaps a 2D manifold. Hmm. I think the area in this case would be the area of a surface, but wait, no, because this is a 2D metric itself. Wait, no, the metric is for a 2D space, so the area would be the area of that space.

Wait, but the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2." So maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in 3D, but the metric is given in terms of x and y. Oh wait, perhaps it's a different approach. Let's think about the metric.

The general form of a metric on a surface of revolution can be written as ds² = A(r)^2 (dr² + dθ²), but here it's in terms of x and y. Alternatively, maybe this is a conformal metric, because it's a scaling of the Euclidean metric (dx² + dy²) by a function.

So the given metric has the form ds² = E(x,y) (dx² + dy²), where E(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So this is a conformally flat metric.

Now, when you have a metric like this, the area element is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy. Wait, but for 2D, the metric tensor is diagonal, so determinant is (E)(E) - 0 = E². So the area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, which is E dx dy.

Wait, no. Wait, the metric tensor in 2D, when expressed as ds² = E dx² + E dy², is actually:

g = diag(E, E). The determinant of this is E * E - 0 = E². So the area element is sqrt(determinant) dx dy, which is E dx dy. So for this metric, the area element is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, but the domain where this metric is defined is important. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². So for this metric to be real, 4 - x² - y² must be positive. So x² + y² < 4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Because x² + y² < (2)^2.

Wait, but that's interesting because the radius r=2 is given. So the area of the pseudosphere would depend on the area of this 2D space covered by the metric.

Wait, no. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. So perhaps this metric represents a pseudosphere, and the area would be the area of that surface. But the metric given is in terms of x and y, which suggests it's a 2D space embedded in 3D or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a hyperboloid of one sheet, which has negative curvature. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the area of a surface of revolution can be found using the metric. But perhaps I should compute the area of the 2D space described by the metric.

So the area would be the integral over the domain of the area element. The domain is where x² + y² < 4, as established. So the area A is the integral over x² + y² < 4 of (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, that seems manageable. Let's switch to polar coordinates because the integrand is radially symmetric. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ, and x² + y² = r². So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from r=0 to r=2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32 / (4 - r²)] * r dθ dr.

Let's compute this. The integral over θ is straightforward: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

So A = 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Hmm, let me compute this integral. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → - (du) = 2r dr. So r dr = (-du)/2.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

Integral from r=0 to 2 of [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr = ∫u=4 to u=0 [32 (r dr)/u] → let's substitute r dr = (-du)/2.

So 32 ( (-du/2) ) / u → 32 * (-1/2) ∫ [du / u] from u=4 to u=0.

Which is 32 * (-1/2) [ln |u| ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but integrating from 4 to 0... that's integrating in the reverse direction, so let's flip the limits and take out a negative sign.

So it's 32 * (-1/2) [ (ln 0) - (ln 4) ) ].

But ln 0 is negative infinity. So let's compute:

32 * (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = 32 * (-1/2) * (-infty - ln4 ) → this seems problematic because as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the integrand blow up.

Wait, but I'm getting a divergent integral here. Because as r approaches 2 from below, the denominator (4 - r²) approaches zero, and the integrand behaves like 1/(4 - r²) multiplied by r dr. So the integral diverges. That suggests that the area A is infinite.

Wait, but that can't be right because the metric is defined on a finite domain (x² + y² <4). Or perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me check the substitution again.

Wait, when I substitute u = 4 - r², du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes:

∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 → 32 ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Which becomes 32 ∫ [ (r dr) ]/(4 - r²) from r=0 to 2.

Substituting u=4 - r²:

Integral from u=4 (r=0) to u=0 (r=2) of [ (-du/2) ) / u ] → 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) du.

Which is 32 * (-1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, that's 32 * (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ] → ln(0) is -infty, so it's 32 * (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] → 32*(-1/2)*(-infty - ln4) → which is positive infinity.

So the integral diverges to positive infinity. Therefore, the area A is infinite.

But wait, what's the pseudosphere's area? I thought pseudospheres have finite area but infinite length. Because you can cover an infinite length along the surface but the area remains finite. Wait, that's for a tractricoid, which is a pseudosphere. Or is that the case?

Wait, no. Wait, the tractricoid (pseudosphere) has finite area but infinite perimeter. Oh, but in this question, the metric is in 2D, and the area would be the area of that space. But if the integral diverges, then the area is infinite.

Wait, but how does this relate to the pseudosphere. Let me think about the metric.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is not a pseudosphere but a sphere. Because if I look at the denominator, 4 - x² - y², that's reminiscent of the metric for a sphere. Wait, the standard metric on a sphere is ds² = (R^2/(x² + y² + z²)) (dx² + dy² + dz²), but that's for 3D. Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, another thought: the metric given could be the induced metric on a hyperboloid. Because hyperboloids have negative curvature. Let me think.

But regardless, the area integral seems to diverge, leading to an infinite area. But the pseudosphere, as I remember, has finite area. So maybe I'm getting something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps in the metric given, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which is 4 - r². So as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, causing E to blow up. So the area element becomes infinite at r=2, leading to an infinite area.

But if the pseudosphere has finite area, why is this integral giving an infinite area? Maybe because this isn't the standard parametrization of a pseudosphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a different kind of surface. Wait, another angle: the metric given is conformal to the Euclidean metric, because E is a function scaling dx² + dy². So the area is the integral of E over the region where E is defined, which is the disk of radius 2.

So the area would be ∫ (32/(4 - r²)) * r dr dθ from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π. Which we saw earlier leads to a divergent integral.

So the area is infinite. Looking back at the options, option D is +infty.

But wait, the question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Maybe I'm confusing the radius here. Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a sphere with radius 2, but in a space of constant positive curvature. No, the denominator suggests 4 - x^2 - y^2, which is more like a sphere, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the metric for a sphere in 2D would be something like (R²/(x² + y²)) (dx² + dy²), but that's in 3D, perhaps. Alternatively, in 2D, the standard metric on a sphere can be written as (R^2/(r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), but that's in polar coordinates.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Gaussian curvature. For a metric of the form ds² = E (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by (1/(2 E)) [ (Δ ln E) ) ], where Δ is the Laplacian in 2D. Wait, perhaps I can compute K and see if it's negative (pseudosphere) or positive (sphere).

Let me compute ln E = ln(32) - ln(4 - x² - y²). So the Laplacian of ln E is the sum of the second derivatives with respect to x and y.

But since E is a function of r² = x² + y², let's compute in polar coordinates.

Let me denote r² = x² + y². So ln E = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²).

So the Laplacian in 2D (using polar coordinates) is (1/r) d/dr (r d/dr). So:

Δ (ln E) = (1/r) d/dr [ r * d/dr (ln(32) - ln(4 - r²)) ) ]

The derivative of ln(4 - r²) is ( -2r ) / (4 - r² ), so:

d/dr (ln E) = d/dr [ ln(32) - ln(4-r²) ] = ( -2r )/(4 - r² )

So the term inside the Laplacian becomes:

r * d/dr (ln E) = r * ( -2r/(4 - r²) ) ) = -2 r² / (4 - r²)

Now, take the derivative with respect to r:

d/dr [ -2 r²/(4 - r²) ) ] = [ (-4r)(4 - r²) ) + (2 r³) ] / (4 - r²)^2

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

Let me write it as -2 r² (4 - r²)^(-1). Using the product rule:

d/dr [ -2 r² (4 - r²)^(-1) ] = (-2)(2 r) (4 - r²)^(-1) + (-2 r²)(-1) (4 - r²)^(-2) ) * (-2 r )

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to compute the derivative:

d/dr [ -2 r²/(4 - r²) ) ] = [ (-4r)(4 - r²) ) + (2 r^3) ] / (4 - r^2)^2.

Wait, let me compute numerator:

(-4 r) (4 - r²) = -16 r + 4 r^3.

Add 2 r^3: total is (-16 r + 4 r^3) + 2 r^3 = -16 r +6 r^3.

So numerator is 6 r^3 -16 r. Denominator is (4 -r²)^2.

So putting it all together:

Δ (ln E) = (1/r ) * [ (6 r^3 -16 r) ) / (4 - r²)^2 ]

Simplify numerator: 6 r^3 -16 r = r (6 r^2 -16).

So,

Δ (ln E) = (1/r) * [ r (6 r^2 -16) ) / (4 - r²)^2 ) ] = (6 r^2 -16) / (4 - r^2)^2.

Now, Gaussian curvature K is (1/(2 E )) Δ (ln E ). E =32/(4 - r²), so 1/(2 E ) = (4 - r²)/(64).

So K = [ (6 r^2 -16) / (4 - r^2)^2 ] * [ (4 - r²) / 64 ] = (6 r² -16) / [64 (4 - r²) ].

Simplify numerator: 6 r² -16 = 2 (3 r² - 8). Hmm, let's see.

Wait, let me compute at r=0: K = (0 -16)/(64 *4 ) = (-16)/(256) = -1/16. Negative curvature. So this space has negative Gaussian curvature everywhere except perhaps at the center. So it's a hyperbolic space. So the metric is for a hyperbolic plane, perhaps.

But wait, the hyperbolic plane is non-compact and has infinite area. Oh, but our domain is x² + y² <4, so it's a finite region. So the area is finite? Wait, but earlier the integral diverged, giving an infinite area. So perhaps the answer is D) +infty.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral. Let me recheck.

The area element is (32/(4 - r^2)) * r dr dθ. So the integral from r=0 to 2 is:

Integral of (32 r)/(4 - r^2) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me change variable u =4 - r^2 → du = -2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

As r=0 → u=4, r=2 →u=0.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (r dr)/u → 32 ∫ ( (-du/2) ) / u.

Which is (32)(-1/2) ∫ (du/u) from u=4 to u=0.

But ∫ du/u from 4 to 0 is [ln u ] from 4 to 0 → ln(0) - ln(4) → -infty - ln4 → -infty.

So the integral becomes (32)(-1/2) ( -infty - ln4 ) → 32*(1/2) (infty + ln4 ) → which is positive infinity.

So the total area is infinite, which would correspond to option D.

But wait, the question says the pseudosphere has radius r=2. So perhaps I'm getting confused between the radius of the sphere and the range of the coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a sphere with radius 2. Let me think about the standard metric on a 2-sphere.

Wait, the standard metric on a 2-sphere in polar coordinates (r is the radius from the origin) is ds² = (R²/(r²)) (dr² + r² dθ² ), where R is the radius of the sphere. But that's in 3D, perhaps.

Alternatively, in 2D, the metric on a sphere of radius R can be written as ds² = R² (dφ² + sin²φ dθ² ), but that's a different parametrization.

But in any case, the metric given here is different. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which is 4 - r², so when r approaches 2, it approaches zero. That suggests that the metric becomes singular at r=2, which is the edge of the domain.

Wait, but in the case of a sphere, the radius is a parameter, not a coordinate. Here, the coordinate r goes up to 2, beyond which the metric becomes singular. So the space described by this metric is a disk with radius 2, but the area is infinite.

Wait, but a pseudosphere has finite area. So perhaps this is not the case. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, let me think again. The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps the given metric is that of a pseudosphere, and we're to compute its area.

But if the metric is for a hyperbolic plane, the area of a hyperbolic disk of radius R is 2π (cosh R - 1), but that's for infinite radius, it's infinite. But in our case, R=2, but it's a finite area. Wait, but in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a disk of radius R is 2π (cosh R - 1). Let me compute this.

For R=2, cosh(2) is (e^2 + e^-2)/2 ≈ (7.389 + 0.135)/2 ≈ 3.762. So 2π (3.762 -1) = 2π * 2.762 ≈ 17.36 π. So a finite area.

But according to our earlier integral, the area is infinite. So perhaps the given metric is not that of a hyperbolic disk but a different surface.

Wait, perhaps I confused the area of the pseudosphere, which is a 2D surface embedded in 3D. The pseudosphere (tractricoid) has finite area but infinite perimeter. So the area is finite.

But according to the metric given, the area seems to be infinite. So perhaps the given metric is not the standard one for a pseudosphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a sphere. Let's compute the Gaussian curvature again. Earlier, I found that the Gaussian curvature K is (6 r² -16)/(64 (4 - r²) ). At r=0, K is (0 -16)/(64 *4) )= (-16)/(256 )= -1/16, which is negative. So the space has negative curvature, which is hyperbolic, not spherical.

Thus, the area of this space (the 2D surface it describes) is infinite because the integral diverges. So the answer would be D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right),
\]

which describes a 2D space with a conformal metric. The task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \).

### Key Observations:
1. **Domain of the Metric**: The metric is defined for \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), as the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) must remain positive to avoid singularities. This corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane.

2. **Area Element**: For a conformal metric \( ds^2 = E(x, y) (dx^2 + dy^2) \), the area element is \( dA = E(x, y) \, dx \, dy \). Here, \( E(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). Thus, the area element becomes:
   \[
   dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
   \]

3. **Switch to Polar Coordinates**: To compute the total area, switch to polar coordinates where \( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \), and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \). The area element becomes:
   \[
   dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

4. **Integral for Total Area**: The total area is:
   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

   - The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \) evaluates to \( 2\pi \).
   - The radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \) is computed using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives:
     \[
     \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \cdot \frac{-1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \cdot \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
     \]
     The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges to \( +\infty \) because \( \ln u \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \).

5. **Conclusion**: The total area diverges to \( +\infty \), indicating that the area of the pseudosphere described by this metric is infinite.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (0)**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **Option B (\( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \))**: Incorrect, as this is not the correct expression for the area.
- **Option C (\( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \))**: Incorrect, as this is not the correct expression for the area.
- **Option D (\( +\infty \))**: Correct, as the integral for the area diverges.

### Final Answer:
The area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.

**Answer: D**
