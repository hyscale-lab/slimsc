Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativistic mechanics. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question is asking about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, since 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6.

The options given are all in GeV, which is a unit of energy. I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with relativistic speeds, you have to use the relativistic energy formulas. 

So, the first thing I need to find is the total energy of the nucleus. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Given that v is 0.96c, let me compute gamma. Let's plug in v=0.96c into the formula. 

v = 0.96c → v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that would be sqrt(0.0784). Let me compute that. Well, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. Hmm, 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but maybe I should do a more precise calculation to avoid errors. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately. 0.28 is exact because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28, which is 100/28. Let me compute that: 100 divided by 28. 28 times 3 is 84, so 3.57142857... So gamma is approximately 3.5714286.

Next, I need to find the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. So each Li-6 nucleus has a mass. I remember that the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 atomic mass units (u), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, maybe I should check that. Alternatively, I can look up the mass number. Lithium-6 has a mass of approximately 6.014 atomic mass units. Alternatively, I might have to compute the exact mass using the number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, to get an accurate calculation, maybe I should compute the mass using the individual masses of protons and neutrons. But that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can look up the exact value. Let me think: a proton is about 1.007276 u, a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the total mass would be 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u.

Wait, but that can't be right because the actual mass of Li-6 is
