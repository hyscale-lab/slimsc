Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and going through several steps, each producing a new product. The question is about the NMR coupling pattern of product 3.

Alright, let me break it down. The first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR data shows specific peaks, and there's an IR absorbance at 1720 cm^-1. Wait, IR at 1720 is probably an ester or a ketone or maybe an aldehyde. But more likely an ester or ketone. Let me thinkâ€”KOH is a strong base. When dibromides react with strong bases like KOH, especially when heated, it's probably an elimination reaction. Wait, no, wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would undergo a double elimination, perhaps forming an epoxide? Or wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but with two bromines adjacent? Or maybe an E2 elimination forming a double bond.

Wait, the product after KOH is a solid. The IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl group. Oh, wait, maybe it's an epoxide. No, wait, epoxide's carbonyl is around 1230 cm
