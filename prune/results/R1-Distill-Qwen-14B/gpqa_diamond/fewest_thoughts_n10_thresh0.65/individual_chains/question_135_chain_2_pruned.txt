Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the decay of a boson X. Let me start by understanding the question.

The problem gives me an interaction Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this means that the boson X interacts with some fermions. The term λ is probably a coupling constant, and v is maybe the vacuum expectation value or something like that.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question asks about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to find which fermion pairs X can decay into.

Wait, kinematically allowed means the decay products must have enough energy to create the particles. So the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into. Because each fermion would take at least half the mass of X.

But wait, what fermions are involved here? The Lagrangian has ψ_f, so f could be different types of fermions. Let me think: in the term, the fermion ψ_f is interacting with X. So X can decay into ψ_f and ψ̄_f? Or wait, the Lagrangian is -λ f ψ̄_f X ψ_f. Oh, but wait, when the boson X decays, the interaction term would allow it to couple to fermion-antifermion pairs.

So the possible decay products would
