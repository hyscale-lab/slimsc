Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. The setup is that we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options given are A to D, each with two pH values.

First, I think I should figure out what the initial concentration of acetic acid is after dilution. Because when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M, and we add 20 cm³ of water. The total volume becomes 40 cm³.

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging in the numbers: M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let's calculate that.

0.05 * 20 is 1, and 1 divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but wait a second. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. But for the initial concentration after dilution, the exact dissociation isn't needed, just the concentration matters.

Next, when we titrate with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (which provides OH- ions) should be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid present initially. So I need to calculate the equivalence point volume.

Wait, but first, let's find the initial moles of acetic acid. The diluted solution is 0.025 M in 40 cm³. Moles are Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) equals 0.001 moles. So moles of acetic acid = 0.001.

The NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence would be moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid, so 0.001. So volume V = moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH. But the question is about 25% titration. Wait, 25% of what? I think 25% of the equivalence point volume. Because the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized, so 25% titration would be a quarter of that volume, so 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the 25% refers to the percentage of the titration relative to the equivalence point. So if the equivalence volume is 10 cm³, then 25% is 2.5 cm³. Yeah, that makes sense.

So now, the first part of the question is the pH at 25% titration. Let's tackle that.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Since
