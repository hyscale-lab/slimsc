Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and the compound undergoes a series of reactions with specific reagents. I need to figure out what the final product is from the given options.

First, I'll start by analyzing the NMR data to determine the structure of the starting compound. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's break that down. The degree of unsaturation can help. Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, and assuming no halogens (since X isn't given, maybe). So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or maybe two rings and a double bond, but let's think about the NMR.

The 1H NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating to 1H. High chemical shift, possibly an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehyde is a terminal group, so maybe it's adjacent to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton. Wait, aromatic protons don't typically go that high unless they're in an aldehyde group. Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde.

- 6.98 ppm: doublet of 2H. Aromatic protons perhaps, maybe in a para-substituted benzene ring. Because a doublet usually means one neighboring proton, but in a para-substituted benzene, each proton has two adjacent protons. Wait, no, in a para-substituted ring, each H has two adjacent Hs, so coupling with two, but in a doublet? Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene where each H is coupled with only one other H. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system.

- 6.51 ppm: doublet of 2H.
