Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the crystal systems. Oh right, a rhombohedron is a three-dimensional figure with six faces, each of which is a rhombus. The angles α, β, γ are all equal in this case, each being 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance—so that's the distance between adjacent atoms in the crystal structure. But wait, in a crystal, the atoms are arranged periodically, so the interatomic distance would typically be the lattice parameter, the edge length. So the a, b, c parameters are all equal in a rhombohedral crystal because all the edges are the same length. So in this case, the interatomic distance would be the lattice parameter, a = 10 Angstroms.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I remember that's given by the formula 1/d = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) multiplied by something involving the angles. Wait, no, more accurately, the general formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) + ... ) ]^{-1/2}

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to recall the formula. Oh right, the formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ between them is a bit more complicated than the simple cubic case. For a general rhombohedral system, since all sides are equal and all angles are equal, maybe there's a simplified version.

Wait, I think the formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d = ( (a² (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a² (hk cos gamma + hk cos beta + kl cos alpha)) )^{-1/2} )

Wait, that might not be right. Maybe I should think about the Miller indices. For a rhombohedral system, when the lattice is rh
