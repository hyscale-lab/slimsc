Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. They give me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma (time dilation factor) multiplied by the velocity. Because particles moving at relativistic speeds will have longer lifetimes from our frame of reference.

First, I think I need to find the lifetime τ of the meson. The width Γ is connected to the lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, right? Or wait, maybe Γ is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the mean lifetime multiplied by some factors. Oh wait, the mean lifetime τ is equal to ħ divided by Γ, but wait that's not quite right. Wait, the natural linewidth is Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But since Γ is given in MeV, I think I need to handle the units properly.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ of the meson.
2. Find the velocity of the meson using its energy and mass.
3. Calculate the mean decay distance using τ * velocity * c, considering relativistic effects.

Wait, no. The mean decay length is L = c * γ * β * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is v/c. Because the lifetime observed in the lab frame is γτ. So the decay length is velocity times lifetime (γτ) divided by c? Or wait, L = v * t, where t is the lifetime in the lab frame. Since v is in m/s and t is in seconds, that would give meters.

Wait, another approach: the proper lifetime is τ, but in the lab frame, it's γτ. So the time the particle exists as seen by us is γτ. Then the distance it travels is v * γτ. So L = v * γτ.

But v is the velocity, which can be found from the energy. Since the production energy is given, E
