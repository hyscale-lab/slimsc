Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, wait, I remember that the rigid rotor model treats the bond length as fixed, but the non-rigid one allows the bond to stretch a bit, so it accounts for both rotation and vibration. But wait, does that matter for this problem? Hmm.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? But wait, in quantum mechanics, the fundamental state for a rotating molecule is when the rotational quantum number is at its lowest, maybe J=0 or J=1? Wait, no, for rigid rotor, the lowest state is J=0. But since this is the non-rigid rotor, maybe the energy levels are a bit different. Oh wait, maybe the non-rigid rotor model includes vibrational energy as well. So the total energy has both rotational and vibrational parts.

Wait, the question is asking about the momentum of the photon needed for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, so the molecule is in the fundamental state, and it needs to absorb a photon to go to the next possible state. But what is the next state? I think in energy terms, the next state would be the next higher energy state, which could either be a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, whichever requires the least energy. Because the photon's energy would have to match the energy difference between the two states.

Wait, the options give possible momenta for the photon. But photons carry momentum p = h / λ, but also E = pc. So the energy of the photon is E = hν = pc. So if I can find the energy difference between the current state and the next state, I can find the momentum.

Wait, but what is the energy of the current state and the next state? The molecule is in the fundamental state. So for a diatomic, the fundamental state would be the state with the lowest energy. But in the quantum model, the molecule's energy includes both rotational and vibrational contributions.

So the energy levels are given by the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. For the non-rigid rotor, the rotational energy is different from the rigid rotor, but perhaps for the purpose of this question, they model it as a rigid rotor. Hmm, the question says that the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model, so I think it's better to consider both.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule can either increase its vibrational state or its rotational state. Which transition requires less energy? The one with the smaller energy difference.

I need to compute the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next possible state, either vibrationally or rotationally excited.

Let me think about the vibrational energy levels. The energy levels for a harmonic oscillator (which is what the vibrational model is often approximated as) are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) hν, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The fundamental state is v=0, so E_0 = (0 + 1/2) hν. The next vibrational state would be v=1, which is E_1 = (1 + 1/2) hν. The energy difference ΔE_vib is E_1 - E_0 = hν.

For rotational energy, the rigid rotor model gives energy levels E_J = (J (J+1) ħ² )/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The fundamental state is J=0, so E_0 = 0. The next rotational state is J=1, so E_1 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I). So the energy difference for rotation is E_J=1 - E_J=0 = ħ²/(I).

Now, which one is smaller: the energy needed to go to the next vibrational state (hν) or the next rotational state (ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I))? The photon's energy must match the smaller of these two to allow the transition to the next lowest state.

Wait, but wait. The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy. So the fundamental state has both the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next possible state could be either J=1 or v=1, whichever requires less energy.

So I need to calculate both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot and see which is smaller.

Let me compute both.

First, compute ΔE_vib = hν. That's straightforward. The given angular frequency ω is 4e14 rad/s. Since ν = ω/(2π), but wait, wait, no. Actually, ν is given as the angular frequency? Wait, the question says w (omega) is 4e14 rad/s. Hmm, in quantum mechanics, the vibrational energy levels are E_v = (v + 1/2) hν, where ν is the frequency in Hz. But the problem gives angular frequency ω. Oh, because ω = 2πν, so ν = ω/(2π).

So ΔE_vib = hν = h*(ω/(2π)).

Compute that: h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So hν = 6.626e-34 * (4e14)/(2π) = (6.626e-34 * 4e14) / (6.2832)

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19.

Divide by 6.2832: 2.6504e-19 / 6.2832 ≈ 4.208e-20 J.

So ΔE_vib ≈4.208e-20 J.

Now compute ΔE_rot, which is the energy difference when J goes from 0 to 1.

ΔE_rot = (J=1 energy) - (J=0 energy) = [ (2 ħ²)/(2I) ] - 0 = ħ²/(I).

I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

Bond length r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu.

The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) amu. Wait, but I need to convert this to kg.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So:

Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.
My = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) * 1.6605e-27 kg

Wait, no: μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) all in kg.

So Mx = 20 amu = 3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) * (1.6605e-27 kg).

Wait, wait, better to compute it numerically.

Mx =20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

My =2 amu = 2 *1.6605e-27 = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) 

Wait, wait, let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator = (20 amu)(2 amu) = 40 (amu)^2.

Denominator = 22 amu.

Hmm, but let's compute in kg.

Wait, Mx = 3.321e-26 kg, My = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 )

Compute denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

Numerator: 3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.028 * 1e-53 = 1.1028e-52 (kg)^2.

So μ = 1.1028e-52 / 3.6531e-26 = approx 2.997e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, 3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 = 3.321^2 * 1e-26 * 1e-27 = 11.028 * 1e-53 = 1.1028e-52.

Denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 (1 + 0.1) )= 3.321e-26 *1.1 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

So μ = (1.1028e-52) / (3.6531e-26) = approximately 3.019e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.1028e-52 divided by 3.6531e-26 is (1.1028 /3.6531 ) * 1e-26.

1.1028 /3.6531 ≈ 0.3018 → so 0.3018e-26 = 3.018e-27 kg.

Yes, so μ ≈3.018e-27 kg.

Now, the moment of inertia I = μ r².

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

r² = (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = 3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

Then, ΔE_rot = ħ² / I = (1.112e-68) / (1.207e-46) ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = (1.112/1.207) * 1e(-68+46) = approx 0.921 * 1e-22 → 9.21e-23 J.

So now compare ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot.

ΔE_vib ≈4.208e-20 J.

ΔE_rot ≈9.21e-23 J.

Which is smaller? 9.21e-23 is much smaller than 4.2e-20.

So the photon needs to have energy equal to the smaller ΔE_rot, because that's the next possible state with the lowest energy.

Wait, but wait. The question states that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. That model includes both vibrational and rotational energies. So the total energy is a combination of both. So the energy levels are different from either the pure rotational or pure vibrational case.

But when the molecule is in the fundamental state, it's the state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the combination of the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and lowest rotational state (J=0).

So the next possible state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which one requires less energy?

But earlier, I found that the energy difference for J=1 is 9.2e-23 J, while the vibrational energy difference is 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the molecule would absorb a photon with energy equal to ΔE_rot.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem is considering that in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy isn't just the rigid rotor's energy. Or maybe the model includes both effects. But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps we can proceed with the rigid rotor model for the rotational part.

So the photon's energy is ΔE_rot = 9.21e-23 J.

But the question is about the momentum of the photon. So E_photon = p c, since for a photon, E = pc, where p is momentum.

So p = E / c.

c is the speed of light, approx 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, the options given are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, 3e-31 kg·m/s is 3e-31 N·s. Because 1 N·s is 1 kg·m/s.

Wait, so 3e-31 Ns is much smaller than any of the options. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up some calculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, let's re-calculate I. I = μ r².

μ was 3.018e-27 kg. r=2e-10 m.

r squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

I = 3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Yes.

Then ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx (1.0545e-34)^2 is about 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ΔE_rot = ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = approx 9.21e-23 J.

Yes.

E_photon = 9.21e-23 J.

p = E_photon / c = (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are anywhere near this. The smallest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is 1000 times larger than my calculation. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the moment of inertia. Let me re-examine that.

Maybe I messed up the calculation of the reduced mass. Because the masses are given in amu, and when calculating the reduced mass, I have to convert them into kg correctly.

Wait, mass of X: 20 amu. 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So, Mx = 20 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

Reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (3.321e-26 *3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 )

Wait, 3.321e-26 +3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 (1 + 0.1) ) = 3.321e-26 *1.1 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

So numerator: 3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 = 11.028 * 1e-53 = 1.1028e-52 kg².

So μ = 1.1028e-52 / 3.6531e-26 = 3.018e-27 kg. So that's correct.

Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the rotational energy difference. The rigid rotor model's energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1) ħ² )/(2I). So when J=0, E=0. When J=1, E= (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

Wait no, E_J=1 is (2 * ħ² )/(2I) ) = (2 ħ² )/(2I) = ħ² /I. So the energy difference is ħ²/I. That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should have used the rotational energy in terms of frequency, like E = (J+1/2) h Ω, where Ω is the rotational constant. But I think the approach I took is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state isn't J=1 but J=0, v=1. Wait, but I thought the energy for J=1 is lower than v=1. But according to the numbers I have, E_rot is 9e-23 J, E_vib is 4e-20 J, so E_rot is smaller. So the photon's energy should match E_rot.

But in that case, the momentum is 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3e-31 Ns. But none of the options are that small.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the model. Maybe the molecule is in the vibrational ground state (v=0), but in the rotational state J=0. So the next state could be J=1 (rotational) or v=1 (vibrational). Which transition requires less energy? As before, the rotational transition is lower energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the model treats this as a harmonic oscillator plus rigid rotor, but the quantum number transitions are such that the molecule can either change vibration or rotation, but the minimal energy change is the rotational transition.

But the photon's momentum calculation is giving a number much smaller than any option. So perhaps I did something wrong in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the rotational energy difference is incorrect. Another approach: in a rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, B = ħ²/(2I). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B.

So ΔE_rot = 2B = 2 * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/(I). So same as before.

Hmm. So that part's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass. Let me re-calculate μ.

Wait, Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2 ) / (20 +2 ) amu = 40/22 amu = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Ah, wait a minute! Oh no, I think I messed up the calculation earlier. I converted each mass to kg and then multiplied, but that's wrong. The correct way to compute the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My), but in the same units.

So μ in amu is (20 * 2) / (20 +2 ) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

But earlier, I converted each mass into kg first, then multiplied and divided. That's correct, but perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, 20 amu is 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

2 amu is 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg =3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 ) / (3.321e-26 +3.321e-27 )

As before, the denominator is 3.653e-26 kg.

Numerator: 3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * (1e-26 *1e-27 )= 11.028 * 1e-53 = 1.1028e-52.

So μ = 1.1028e-52 / 3.653e-26 = 3.018e-27 kg. That's correct.

Hmm, so no mistake here.

Wait, let's compute the rotational energy again.

ΔE_rot = ħ² / I.

I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg m².

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 ≈9.21e-23 J. Correct.

E_photon = 9.21e-23 J.

p_photon = E/c =9.21e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns → 1.9e-28 is 10^7 times larger than 3e-31.

Wait, so there's a discrepancy. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the model is the non-rigid rotor, which includes vibrational energy as a part of the rotational energy. Or perhaps the question refers to the molecule being in the vibrational ground state but the rotational state can be in any level. So the next state is either J=1 or v=1. But perhaps the transition is not allowed unless certain selection rules are followed.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, transitions are allowed only if certain selection rules are met. For rotational transitions, typically ΔJ = ±1. For vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. But maybe in this question, the selection rules are considered as allowing the transition. But even so, the energy required is the smaller of the two.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon should have that energy.

But the photon's momentum I calculated is way too small. So perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the rotational energy. Alternatively, perhaps the model used here is the rigid rotor, but the energy levels are in terms of the vibrational frequency.

Wait, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model combines rotation and vibration into a single effective energy, but that's not something I'm familiar with. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy levels as a combination of rotation and vibration, but the next state is the first excited state, which could be either vibrational or rotational, whichever is lower.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is considering the energy required for the molecule to go from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next possible state, which is either v=1 or J=1, whichever requires the least energy. I've computed that, but perhaps I messed up the energy of the rotational state.

Wait, let's re-calculate the rotational energy difference.

E_J=1 = (2)* B, where B is the rotational constant. B = ħ²/(2I).

Wait, E_J=1 = 2B = (2 * ħ² )/(2I) ) = ħ² / I. So that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question uses the bond length in another unit. Wait, the molecular bond length is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation. Let me try again.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

So μ =1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.018e-27 kg. So correct.

Another thought: perhaps the model includes both rotation and vibration, and the minimal energy transition is not just the rotational or vibrational part. Maybe the combined energy is considered, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational contributions, but that's not the case when considering the next state. Because the next state could be either J increases or v increases, whichever requires less energy.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can't change both J and v at the same time. So the next state is either J=1, v=0 or J=0, v=1. Which energy is lower? The J=1 transition is lower in energy, so the photon's energy is the rotational energy difference.

But again, that leads to the same result, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the energy of the photon. Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum, and I misapplied the formula.

Photon's momentum p = E / c.

Yes, because E = pc for photons.

So if E_photon = 9.21e-23 J, then p = 9.21e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are near this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the energy difference.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the question is asking about the transition to the next possible state in a non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration. Hmm, maybe the non-rigid rotor model has energy levels that are a combination of rotation and vibration, so the energy levels are not just the sum of rotation and vibration. But I'm not sure about the exact model used here.

Alternatively, perhaps the model considers the energy as a sum of both, but the next state is the first excited state, which is the lowest possible energy above the ground state, regardless of being rotational or vibrational.

So in that case, the energy required is the minimum of the two possible ΔE's, which is the rotational ΔE.

But perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for the rotational energy. Another approach: perhaps the rotational energy is modeled as a harmonic oscillator as well. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is modeled as a non-rigid rotor, which means that the bond length can change, which affects the moment of inertia. But in that case, the moment of inertia is not fixed, so the rotational energy levels aren't quantized as in the rigid rotor model. Hmm, but I'm not familiar with the exact expression for the non-rigid rotor model.

Wait, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model includes both rotation and vibration, treating the bond as a vibrating system. In that case, the energy levels might have a different form, perhaps involving both rotational and vibrational quantum numbers. But I'm not sure how to compute that for the next state.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state refers to the next vibrational state, not the rotational. But earlier, the vibrational ΔE is much larger, so that would make the photon's momentum larger.

Wait, let's compute the photon's momentum if the energy is the vibrational ΔE.

E_vib =4.208e-20 J.

p = E/c =4.208e-20 /3e8 = 1.403e-28 kg m/s =1.403e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches this.

So perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the next state is the first vibrational state, not the rotational state.

Why would that be? Because perhaps the selection rules for vibrational transitions are such that the transition is allowed, but rotational transitions are not? Or perhaps the problem assumes that the molecule is in the rotational ground state (J=0) but in the vibrational ground state (v=0). But the next state is the first vibrational state (v=1), not the rotational.

Wait, but earlier, the energy for the vibrational transition was 4.2e-20 J, which is higher than the rotational transition. So why would the molecule switch to the vibrational state if the rotational transition is lower in energy?

Hmm. Maybe the rotational transition isn't allowed. For example, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational state transitions require a change in J of ±1, so from J=0 to J=1. But perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational selection rules are different. Or perhaps in this specific model, the rotational transitions are forbidden or not considered, so the next state is the vibrational one.

But the problem says the model is the non-rigid rotor model. So perhaps in this model, the rotational energy levels are allowed to change, but the selection rules are such that the next state is the vibrational state.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0), but in the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state would be the first excited state, which could be either J=1 or v=1. But perhaps the next state is the vibrational state because the rotational state is already at J=0, and the next state is the lowest possible energy state.

Wait, no, because the rotational transition requires less energy. So why would the photon's energy correspond to the vibrational transition?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only vibrational transitions and not rotational, but that would be odd given the model mentioned.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy difference.

Wait, let me recompute the rotational energy.

E_J=1 = ħ²/(2I) *2 = ħ²/I.

Wait, no: E_J = (J (J+1) ħ² )/(2I).

So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E= (2 * ħ² )/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

Which is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy of the photon to cause a transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state (v=1, J=0), which is the next possible state. But why would that be the case when the rotational transition requires less energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in a non-rigid rotor model where the rotational energy and vibrational energy are treated together, leading to a different energy expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the moment of inertia.

Wait, double-checking the moment of inertia I = μ r².

μ=3.018e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

r²=4e-20 m².

So I =3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg m².

Yes.

Hmm. I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the rotational transition requires a photon with momentum ~3e-31 Ns, which isn't any of the options. But the vibrational transition gives a momentum of ~1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

But why would the problem choose the vibrational transition when the rotational one requires less energy? Maybe because the rotational transition is not allowed, or perhaps because the question is designed to have the answer as the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the translational energy, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, it says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor model). So perhaps in this model, the energy levels are quantized in a way that the next state is a vibrational state, not rotational.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model includes both rotation and vibration, but transitions typically involve a change in both, but perhaps the next state is the combination of J=0 and v=1.

But I'm not sure about the exact model.

Given that my calculation for the vibrational transition gives a photon momentum of ~1.4e-28 Ns, which matches option D, perhaps that's the intended answer.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions. The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model, and the question specifies that it is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state corresponds to the lowest energy state, which is the combination of the lowest vibrational state ($v=0$) and the lowest rotational state ($J=0$). The next possible states are either ($v=1, J=0$) or ($v=0, J=1$). The energy difference for each transition is calculated, and the smaller energy difference determines the required photon energy.

### Vibrational Energy Difference
The vibrational energy levels are given by the harmonic oscillator formula:
\[
E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h\nu
\]
The energy difference for the transition from $v=0$ to $v=1$ is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h\nu
\]
The angular frequency $\omega$ is provided as $4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}$. Since $\nu = \omega / (2\pi)$, we calculate:
\[
\nu = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}
\]
The Planck constant $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$, so:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h\nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34})(6.366 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.21 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
\]

### Rotational Energy Difference
The rotational energy levels for a rigid rotor are given by:
\[
E_J = \frac{J(J+1)\hbar^2}{2I}
\]
The moment of inertia $I$ is calculated using the reduced mass $\mu$ and bond length $r$:
\[
\mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y}, \quad I = \mu r^2
\]
The masses are $M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}$ and $M_y = 2 \, \text{amu}$, and $1 \, \text{amu} \approx 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}$. Converting to kilograms:
\[
M_x = 20 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} = 3.321 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg}, \quad M_y = 2 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} = 3.321 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
\]
The reduced mass is:
\[
\mu = \frac{(3.321 \times 10^{-26})(3.321 \times 10^{-27})}{(3.321 \times 10^{-26}) + (3.321 \times 10^{-27})} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
\]
The bond length $r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}$, so:
\[
I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27})(2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
\]
The reduced Planck constant is $\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$. The energy difference for the transition from $J=0$ to $J=1$ is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
\]

### Comparison of Energy Differences
The vibrational energy difference is $\Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.21 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}$, and the rotational energy difference is $\Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}$. Since $\Delta E_{\text{rot}} < \Delta E_{\text{vib}}$, the rotational transition requires less energy. However, the problem options suggest that the vibrational transition is being considered. This discrepancy may arise from selection rules or the specific assumptions of the non-rigid rotor model.

### Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition
The energy of the photon corresponds to the vibrational energy difference:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.21 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
\]
The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by $p = E / c$, where $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$:
\[
p = \frac{4.21 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.403 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
\]
This matches option **D**.

### Conclusion
Although the rotational transition requires less energy, the problem appears to focus on the vibrational transition. Thus, the momentum of the photon required for the molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy is:
