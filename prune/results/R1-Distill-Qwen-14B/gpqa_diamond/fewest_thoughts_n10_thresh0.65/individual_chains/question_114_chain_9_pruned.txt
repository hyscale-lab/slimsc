Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me read it carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, I need to figure out what reagents A and B are from the given options.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? It's a ketone. Reacting with NaCN. Wait, NaCN is sodium cyanide. Oh, wait, but ketones usually undergo nucleophilic addition. So maybe this is a substitution reaction, but with a ketone?

Wait, no, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. For example, in the presence of a base, a nucleophile like CN- can attack the carbonyl carbon. But the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me look at the structure.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, I think it's adding cyanide to the carbonyl. But the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Hmm.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write it out. The structure would be CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Or wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN?

Wait, but wait. Butan-2-one has the structure (CH3)2CO. When NaCN is added, perhaps in a nucleophilic addition, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, becoming (CH3)2C(O-)CN, and then maybe protonated?

But that would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butan-2-one is four carbons
