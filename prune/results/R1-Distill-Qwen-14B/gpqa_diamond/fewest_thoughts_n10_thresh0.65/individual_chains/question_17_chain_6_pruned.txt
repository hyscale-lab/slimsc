Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds to metal ions like calcium. The problem gives the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in this solution.

Wait, right, the formation constant (K) for a complex tells us about the stability of the complex. The higher the K, the more stable the complex. So in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is pretty stable because 5e10 is a large number.

I think the formula for the formation constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, I should make sure about the stoichiometry. EDTA typically forms complexes with a 1:1 ratio, so each Ca^2+ binds with one EDTA^4- ion to form the Ca-EDTA complex. So the formula should be correct.

The problem states that the solution is 0.02 M in the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. I'm assuming that all the Ca^2+ is tied up in the complex unless some dissociates. But given the high K, I think the dissociation would be minimal. So, the concentration of free Ca^2+ should be very low.

Let me set up the equation. Let’s denote the concentration of the complex as [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M, which is a large value. Wait, no, because when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. But since the complex is stable, the dissociation is minimal, so [Ca^2+] would be very small, and [EDTA^4-] would also be small, but perhaps we can make some approximation.

Let me define x as the concentration of Ca^2+ ions that dissociate from the complex. So, at equilibrium:

[Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small)
[Ca^2+] = x
