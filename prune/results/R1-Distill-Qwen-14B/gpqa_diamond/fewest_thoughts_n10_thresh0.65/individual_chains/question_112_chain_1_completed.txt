Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to tackle it. Let me read it again.

The problem states that we have an electron in a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator. The options are A through D, each giving two probabilities and an average value.

Hmm, okay. So let me break this down. First, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional to that combination. Then, perhaps find the eigenstates of the operator A, and then compute the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate when the system is in |alpha>? Alternatively, maybe the operator A is expressed in the same basis as |up> and |down>, so perhaps I can diagonalize it first. Wait, but the question is about the eigenstates of A, so maybe the operator is not diagonal in the z-basis.

Wait, the operator A's matrix is given. So let's think about what A looks like. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, because it's spin-1/2, right? The operator A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So that would make it:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Because for i≠j, the elements are ħ/2. So this is a 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

Wait, what's the eigenvalue problem for this operator? Because the eigenstates of A will be the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, perhaps, since A is proportional to sigma_x. Let me see: the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) * sigma_x. So yes, the eigenstates of A are the same as those of sigma_x, which are |+x> and |-x>, the eigenstates of spin in the x-direction.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues, let me compute them. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1, so for A, which is (ħ/2) sigma_x, the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)(1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1) = -ħ/2.

Wait, but when the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A, that would involve projecting |alpha> onto |+x> and |-x>, right? So I'll need to express |alpha> in terms of the |+x> and |-x> basis.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value of A using the given state |alpha>, which might be easier. But wait, the question specifically asks for the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of A, which implies that we have to find the probability of each outcome when measuring in the A eigenbasis. So yes, that makes sense.

So first, let me normalize the state |alpha>. The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. To find the normalization, we compute the inner product of the state with itself.

The inner product is (1+i)(1-i) |<up|up>| + (2-i)(2+i) |<down|down>| plus the cross terms. Wait, but |up> and |down> are orthogonal, so cross terms vanish. So |alpha> is:

(1 + i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>

So |alpha> has a squared magnitude of |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2 - i|^2: 2^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So total squared norm is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait wait, no. Because |alpha> is proportional to that, so the actual state is |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7). Because sqrt(7) is the normalization factor.

Once we have the normalized state, perhaps we can express it in the eigenbasis of A. Let me recall that the eigenstates |+x> and |-x> can be written in the z-basis as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait: the eigenvectors are (1,1) and (1,-1), but normalized. So:

|+x> = [ |up> + |down> ] / sqrt(2)
|-x> = [ |up> - |down> ] / sqrt(2)

Yes, that's correct.

So, to express the given |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I can write:

|alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>

Wait, let's compute c1 and c2 by taking the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x>.

So, c1 = < +x | alpha >
Similarly, c2 = < -x | alpha >.

So let's compute c1:

c1 = [ (1/(sqrt(2)) )^* ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ) ]

Wait, perhaps it would be easier to compute the inner products directly.

Wait, in terms of components, since |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), then the inner product < +x | alpha > is [ (1, 1)/sqrt(2) ] multiplied by the vector ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )^T.

So, the inner product is [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1+i) + (2 - i) ) ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, no, let's compute it step by step.

Compute c1: < +x | alpha >.

Expressed as:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So, taking the inner product, the terms are:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1)(1+i) + (1)(2 - i) ] / sqrt(7)

Because <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1, and cross terms are zero.

So compute numerator:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 1 + i + 2 - i = 3.

So c1 = (3) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14)

Similarly, compute c2: < -x | alpha >.

Expressed as:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

The inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1*(1+i)) + (-1)*(2 - i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

So that's [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Compute numerator:

1 + i - 2 + i = (1-2) + (i + i) = -1 + 2i.

So c2 = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14 )

Wait, check that calculation again:

Wait, [ (1*(1+i)) + (-1)*(2 - i) ) ] = (1+i) -2 +i = (1-2) + (i +i) = -1 + 2i.

Yes, correct.

So, |c1|^2 is the probability of measuring eigenvalue ħ/2 (since |+x> has eigenvalue ħ/2?), wait, let's double-check.

Wait, operator A is (ħ/2) sigma_x. So the eigenvalues are (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1). So eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So when we measure in |+x>, the eigenvalue is ħ/2, and in |-x> it's -ħ/2.

The probability of measuring ħ/2 is |c1|^2, which is (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

The probability of measuring -ħ/2 is |c2|^2 = | (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) |^2.

Compute modulus squared: [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] = 1 +4 =5. So 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571. That's about 64% and 36%, so the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.64, 5/14 ≈ 0.36.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, with average hbar/7.

But wait, let's check the average value. The expectation value of A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, and |alpha> can be written in terms of the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are |+x> and |-x>.

The expectation value would be (3/sqrt(14)) * (ħ/2) ) * 1 + ( (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) ) * (ħ/2) ) * (-1)

Wait, no, more accurately, since |alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>, then the expectation value <A> is c1^* c1 (ħ/2) + c2^* c2 (-ħ/2).

Which is (|c1|^2)(ħ/2) + (|c2|^2)(- ħ/2 )

So |c1|^2 is 9/14, |c2|^2 is 5/14.

So <A> = (9/14)*(ħ/2) + (5/14)*(-ħ/2)
= [9* ħ/(28) ) ] - [5 * ħ/(28) ]
= (4 ħ) /28 
= ħ/(7)

So the average value is ħ/7.

So putting it together, the probabilities are approximately 64% and 36%, and average is ħ/7. So looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that's option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the probabilities. Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, about 0.36. So that fits option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the computation of |c2|². Let me re-calculate. c2 is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). The modulus squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So 5/14, which is correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

So the average is ħ/7, as I computed.

Wait, but let me think again about the initial state. Did I normalize it correctly?

The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

The modulus squared of each component is |1+i|^2=2, |2-i|^2=5. So sum is 7. So the normalized state is each coefficient divided by sqrt(7). So yes, that part was correct.

So all calculations seem correct. So the correct option is option A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by computing the squared magnitude of the coefficients:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 5.
\]

Thus, the total squared norm is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), and the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matrix corresponds to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), given by:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), corresponding to \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of \( A \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle, |-x\rangle \) basis. The coefficients \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are computed as:

\[
c_1 = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}},
\]
\[
c_2 = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
c_1 = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_2 = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities of measuring \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively.

To compute the average value of \( A \), we use:

\[
\langle A \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |c_2|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Probabilities: \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), Average: \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).**
