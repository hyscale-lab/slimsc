Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So the star moves back and forth, and we see shifts in the spectral lines.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift in the spectral line, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the planet's orbit. The formula I recall is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) which depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets' masses are similar, the inclination probably isn't a factor here because we're assuming they're similar or maybe it's already factored in.

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like K = (V) = (21 * (M_p sin i) ) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * ( (1 day) / (P year) ) ) * ( (c) / (2π) ) ) 

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) ), but maybe I'm mixing some terms here.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use Kepler's third law, but in terms of the RV method. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (1) / ( (P * c) ) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the formula is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P)
