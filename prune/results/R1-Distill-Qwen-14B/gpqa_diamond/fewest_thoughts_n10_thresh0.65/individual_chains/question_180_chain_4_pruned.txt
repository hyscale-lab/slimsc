Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

So, the problem says there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. All the charges are 2e, right? And they have negligible mass. Interesting. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is about finding the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm. So, I'm trying to remember about electric potential energy in systems of charges. Since all the charges are the same and fixed in some way, I think I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair and sum them all up.

Wait, the system is isolated, so it's just these 13 charges. Since theyâ€™re identical, each pair interaction will contribute to the total potential energy. But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P. So I guess the 12 charges are all located on a sphere of radius 2 m around point P, each at a distance of 2 m from P.

But wait, the 13th charge is at P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the 13th charge. But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Since they're on a sphere, like the vertices of a regular icosahedron or something, but the problem doesn't specify their arrangement. Oh wait, but the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but not necessarily that they are all at the same distance from each other. Hmm, that complicates things because if they're all on a sphere, their mutual distances vary, but perhaps the problem considers them to be arranged in a way that each is equidistant from each other? Or maybe the problem only considers the energy due to the 13th charge and the others, not the energy between the 12 charges themselves. Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because the total potential energy of the system would include all possible pairs.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering only the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge at
