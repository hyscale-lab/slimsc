Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Hmm, right, e is the elementary charge, about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each particle has a charge of 3.2e-19 C. But wait, the problem says 2e, so yeah, that's correct.

So there are 12 of these charges constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Okay, I think this is an electrostatics problem involving potential energy. Because when charges are placed in a system, their potential energy contributes to the total energy, and we need to find the minimum, which probably relates to the most stable configuration.

Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The other 12 are at 2m from P. So each of these 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge. But what about the potential energy between the 12 charges among themselves?

Because the system's total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair. So let me think. The charges are all identical, so each has charge 2e. Let's denote the charge as q = 2e.

The formula for the electric potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

But since the system is isolated, the energy is going to be the sum of all pairwise potentials. Let me count how many pairs there are.

Wait, the system has 13 charges. But one is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2m from P. But I also need to consider the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

So, the total potential energy U is the sum of two parts: 
1. The potential energy between the fixed charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges.
2. The potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Let me calculate each part separately.

First, part
