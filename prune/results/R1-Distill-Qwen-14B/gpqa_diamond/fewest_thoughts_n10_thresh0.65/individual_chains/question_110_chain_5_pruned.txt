Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and the spectrographs that can detect them. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The options are A to D, each pairing two stars. Let me first note down the key points.

First, I should recall what each spectrograph can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, actually, the wording is that they can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. Oh, wait, no, wait! The given info says: with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So, brighter than 17 means lower magnitude numbers, because lower magnitude is brighter. So the maximum apparent magnitude ESPRESSO can handle is 17. Because anything brighter (lower) would be okay, and anything dimmer (higher) would not.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 for HIRES to detect.

Wait wait, no, wait again. The exact wording is: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. That means that they can observe stars with V mag less than 17. Because brighter than 17 implies V magnitude is lower (since lower magnitude means brighter). So, ESPRESSO can handle up to 17 mag. So if a star's apparent V is 17 or dimmer (higher number), can it be observed? Wait, no, because brighter is lower magnitude. So if a star's V is 16, that's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. If it's 18, it's dimmer than 17, which is beyond ESPRESSO's capability.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So apparent V must be less than 16? No, wait: the wording is "brighter than 16 V mag". So for HIRES, the star's V has to be less than 16, because brighter than 16 would mean magnitude <16.

Wait, no, that can
