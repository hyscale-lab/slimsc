Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

The question says that compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options A to D. The given data is the IR and 1H NMR spectra of compound X. 

First, I should probably analyze the IR and NMR data to figure out what compound X is. Once I know what X is, I can think about what reaction it undergoes with red phosphorus and HI.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region. That usually indicates O-H stretching, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, the peak around 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which typically corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. If it were a ketone, the peak is around 1700-1750, but 1720 is a bit higher, which might suggest a carboxylic acid (since their carbonyl peaks are around 1700, but maybe they can go a bit higher). Alternatively, an ester or maybe an aldehyde? But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm in NMR, which I'll look at later.

Another IR peak at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So compound X has an aromatic ring with substituents. The 1610 might be a strong absorption, suggesting maybe conjugated double bonds or some substitution pattern on the ring.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's a strong signal. In aromatic compounds, this could be an -OH proton, like from a phenol. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But aldehyde protons are usually sharp, not broad. So phenol's OH is more likely here. Wait, but the IR had a peak at 1720, which
