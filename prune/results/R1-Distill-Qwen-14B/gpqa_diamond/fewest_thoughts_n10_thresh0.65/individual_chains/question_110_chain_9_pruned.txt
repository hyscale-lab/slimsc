Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's try to think through this.

First, I need to understand the capabilities of each spectrograph. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, brighter than 17? Oh wait, waitâ€”apparent magnitude works such that lower numbers are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its apparent V magnitude is less than 17. Because higher magnitudes are dimmer. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V up to 17, maybe not including 17? Or is it less than or equal? The question says "brighter than 17 mag", which would mean apparent V less than 17. Because, for example, a star with magnitude 16 is brighter than 17. So for ESPRESSO, m_v < 17.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, m_v < 16.

Wait, the question says 'brighter than 17' for ESPRESSO implies m <17, and 'brighter than 16' for HIRES implies m <16. So a star that can be seen by both must have m_v <16, because it's the more restrictive condition. Because if a star is brighter than 16, it's also brighter than 17, so it can be seen by both.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me think. Both instruments can observe stars brighter than their threshold. So for a star to be detected by both, it must satisfy both conditions. So the more stringent condition is the lower magnitude limit. So the star must have an apparent V magnitude less than 16, because 16 is lower than 17, so to be seen by HIRES, the star's m_v must be less than 16. Because if it's less than 16, it's automatically less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it too. So stars with m_v <16 can be detected by both.

But wait, the question says, which stars can be detected with both. So the apparent V magnitude
