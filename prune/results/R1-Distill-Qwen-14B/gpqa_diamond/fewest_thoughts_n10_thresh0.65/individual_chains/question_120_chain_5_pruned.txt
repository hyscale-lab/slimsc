Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different dependencies on plx.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Wait, right, the parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d. That means as plx increases, the distance decreases. So closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the question says the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed... I'm not exactly sure what that means in this context. Oh, wait, does it mean that the number density of stars is the same everywhere? Like, same number of stars per cubic parsec throughout space? Or maybe it's about the distribution on the sky's surface, like uniform in solid angle?

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So maybe I should think about how many stars exist at a certain parallax range.

Parallax is a measure of distance, so higher parallax means closer. So if I consider a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

I think I need to find the number of stars per unit parallax interval. Let's denote the number as N. So N is the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx.

If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, then the number density (stars per unit volume) is
