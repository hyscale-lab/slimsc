Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question says a light beam is in a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer. Oh wait, the options are given, but I should try to work it out myself first.

I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. Oh right, the formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving.

So, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is also moving in the same direction as the glass. So, the glass is moving along with the light, but the observer is in the lab frame.

Wait, this sounds like a problem involving relative velocity, maybe using the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because the glass is moving, the speed of light as observed might not just be c/n anymore. Or does it? Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So even if the glass is moving, the speed of light in the lab frame should still be c. But wait, the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. Oh! Wait
