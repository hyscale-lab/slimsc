Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum in quantum mechanics is related to spin, and muons are spin-1/2 particles. So their spin states are represented by 2x2 matrices, probably Pauli matrices or something similar.

The question says that the Y-component of this angular momentum operator, Ay, is given by c multiplied by S. The constant c is h divided by 4π. Wait, I think I remember that the spin matrices for angular momentum are related to the Pauli matrices scaled by something. The Pauli matrices usually have eigenvalues ±ℏ/2, so maybe this is similar.

The matrix S is given as:
First row: 0, -i
Second row: i, 0
Oh wait, that looks familiar. The Pauli Y matrix is usually [[0, -i], [i, 0]], right? So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

So Ay = c * S. Plugging in c, which is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/4π) * Y, where Y is the Pauli Y matrix.

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Since Y is a Pauli matrix, its eigenvalues are known. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±ℏ/2. But wait, in this case, the matrix Ay is c multiplied by Y. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by the eigenvalues of Y.

Let me compute that. So Y has eigenvalues ±
