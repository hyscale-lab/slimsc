Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's asking. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And then it's asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. Wait, but wait, the exact formula might be more precise. Oh right, the parsec unit is defined such that 1 parsec is the distance where 1 astronomical unit subtends 1 arcsecond. So, d (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So, d = 1/plx. Got it.

So the question says the number of stars N varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that: 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5?

Wait, but wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. Wait, but the question is phrased a bit tricky. It says, how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit range of distance r
