Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy questions.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, really stable and has multiple rings. So, 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two opposite corners of the adamantane structure. 

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240°C, leading to a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are given. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is indicative of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester. The NMR has a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H, which could be an OCH₂ group, like in an epoxide or maybe an ether. But wait, the IR peak is more likely a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol that's been deprotonated? Hmm, no, I think the 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl, so probably a ketone. 

Wait, KOH is a strong base. Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH might lead to an elimination reaction, like an E2 mechanism, especially since KOH is a good base. But with two bromine atoms, maybe it's a double elimination? Or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Oh, wait! If you have vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo), heating with KOH can lead to elimination to form an alkene. But here, the dibromide is 1,3-dibromo. So the two bromines are not adjacent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's undergoing a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination leading to the formation of a ketone. Because when two adjacent (vicinal) halides are present, elimination can form a double bond. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in the diamond structure, maybe? Or wait, adamantane is a bicyclic structure, so 1 and 3 might be across from each other but connected through the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps KOH is causing a substitution reaction
