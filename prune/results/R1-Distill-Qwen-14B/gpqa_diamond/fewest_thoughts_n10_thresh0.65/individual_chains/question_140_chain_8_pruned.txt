Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, the product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, let's think about gas W. The molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, each molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, but protons and neutrons are in the nucleus. So perhaps the molecule is made of atoms where each has the same number of protons and neutrons. Or maybe the entire molecule has equal numbers of protons and neutrons.

Wait, but each molecule's atoms contribute to the total. Alternatively, maybe each molecule is a single atom, so that the molecule itself is an atom with same protons and neutrons. Oh wait, because if it's a diatomic molecule, the numbers would double. Wait, no. Let's think: if the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons in each atom, maybe it's a noble gas.

Wait, for example, Argon has atomic number 18, so 18 protons and 22 neutrons in the most common isotope (Ar-40). That doesn't fit. What about something like H2O? No, that's a molecule, but the question says gas W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, perhaps each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons in its atoms. Hmm, maybe CO2? No, carbon is 6 protons, 6 neutrons in C-12; O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons in O-16. So each CO2 molecule has (6+16*2) protons and (6 + 16*2) neutrons? Wait no, each O is 8p, so CO2 has 6 + 2*8 =
