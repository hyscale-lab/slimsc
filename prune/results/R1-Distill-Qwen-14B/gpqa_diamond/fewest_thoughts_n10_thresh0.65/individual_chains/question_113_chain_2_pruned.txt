Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem gives me FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The compound's possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Starting with the FTIR data: there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak, maybe. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol, but maybe more likely a carboxylic acid? Because the peak is very broad, which is typical for -OH groups in acids.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with some substituent. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but that's less likely because the options don't include N. Wait, the options are all C, H, O. Oh, right, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Or perhaps an aromatic ring with a carbonyl nearby.

Looking at the 1H NMR: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones in alkenes, like CH2=CH-. So the compound has a double bond, maybe part of an ester group if we're considering the carbonyl. Or perhaps it's a substituted alkene elsewhere.

Mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. I remember that m/z 45 is a common fragment. Let me think: for example, CH3COOH (acetic acid) has a fragment at m/z 45, which is the COOH group losing something. Wait, or perhaps it's (CH3)2CO, which is acetone; but wait, the molecular ion for acetone is 58, I think. Or wait, what about the fragment for a methyl ester? Or maybe
