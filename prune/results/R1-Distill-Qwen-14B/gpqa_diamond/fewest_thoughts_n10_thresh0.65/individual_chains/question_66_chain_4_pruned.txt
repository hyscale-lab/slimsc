Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible interactions (operators) consistent with the Standard Model, but at higher energies. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these four.

Wait, let me think. I know that Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. So if Poincare is respected, then Lorentz symmetry is automatically included. But does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry? Or is it just Lorentz?

I think SMEFT is built from the Standard Model, which is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all the operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. But what about Poincare? Poincare includes not just rotations and boosts, but also translations. But in effective theories, sometimes you can have operators that break translation symmetry, like nonrenormalizable terms are local but include higher derivatives. Wait, but nonrenormalizable operators are still local, so maybe translation symmetry is still preserved?

Wait, translation symmetry is part of Poincare. So if the theory is Lorentz-invariant and translation-invariant, then Poincare holds. But in SMEFT, the interactions are local, so they should respect Poincare symmetry. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes people say that effective theories don't necessarily have to respect global symmetries, but Poincare is a spacetime symmetry. So I think SMEFT requires Poincare symmetry. So both Lorentz and Poincare must be respected.

Wait, no, maybe not? Because Poincare is a bigger symmetry. If a theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But if it respects Lorentz, it doesn't necessarily mean Poincare. Or wait, noâ€”if Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, then if the theory is Lorentz and translation invariant, it is Poincare. But SMEFT operators are local, so I think they must respect Poincare. Or perhaps in SMEFT, they only enforce Lorentz and not translation? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy here.

Wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator doesn't respect Poincare, that would mean it's not translation-invariant. But SME
