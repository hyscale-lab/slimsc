Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator is along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. So that means the direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz), because it's in the x-z plane, so the y-component is zero. So the operator P is in the direction of n, so it's P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z), right? Because the operator for a direction is the sum of each component multiplied by the respective Pauli matrix, scaled by the direction's components.

Wait, but in this problem, the operator P is given in components. Each component (Px, Py, Pz) is given as ħ/2 multiplied by some 2x2 matrix. So for example, Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix.

So the operator P along direction n is P = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz. Since n is in the x-z plane, ny is zero. So P = nx Px + nz Pz.

Wait, but the problem states that the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in x-z plane. So the operator is a combination of Px and Pz. So let's write that out.

Let me write the components of P. Since n is in the x-z plane, let me represent it as a unit vector (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x² + n_z² = 1. So the operator P is then n_x * Px + n_z * Pz.

Substituting the given matrices, we have:

P = (n_x * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]).
Factor out ħ/2
