Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain reaction stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions remain the same. They're asking about the ratio of flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux1/flux2 = ?

First, I need to remember what the pp-III branch is. I recall that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. There are different branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh wait, the pp-III branch involves the reaction where a helium-3 nucleus captures two protons to form a boron-5 nucleus, which then decays into a beryllium-5 nucleus. This beryllium nucleus then captures a neutron to become boron-5 again, but wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, the pp-III branch might be the part where three helium-3 nuclei combine to form a carbon-12 nucleus. Oh right, I think the pp-III branch is the process where two helium-3s combine to make a helium-4 and two protons. Wait, no, that's maybe the pp-I branch. I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the proton-proton chain starts with two protons (hydrogen nuclei) fusing. The pp-I branch is where a proton captures a proton to form a diproton, which then emits a positron and a neutrino to become helium-2 (which is helium-3? No, wait, the diproton is H-2, which then beta decays to He-3). Then, the He-3 can combine with another He-3 in the pp-II branch to form He-4, but that's not the main path. Oh, right, the main branch is the pp-I, which produces He-3, which then in the pp-III branch combines with another He-3 and a proton to form C-12? Or wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is the path where two He-3s combine to make He-4 and two protons. Or
