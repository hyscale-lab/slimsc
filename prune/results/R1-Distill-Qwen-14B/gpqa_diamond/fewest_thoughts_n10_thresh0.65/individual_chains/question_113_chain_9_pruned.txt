Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options given are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

First, I'll look at the FTIR data. It shows a very broad absorption at 3000 cm-1. I remember that a broad peak around 3000 usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak. Also, in the same IR spectrum, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or possibly an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an acid or an amide. But wait, amides usually have lower carbonyl absorption. Hmm.

Then, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl refers to spÂ² hybridized carbons, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond. Also, the presence of vinyl protons suggests that the structure has some unsaturation, maybe an alkene group.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. I need to think about what fragments give a mass of 45. Common fragments with m/z 45 include the methyl ester group (like from a carboxylic acid losing CO2 or something else?), but wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of CH3O (but that's 31), or maybe a fragment like CH3CO (43), not 45. Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene ion (like (CH3)2CO+ which is 58?), wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh, wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a CH2O group, but that's 30. Alternatively, maybe a propyl group or something else. Alternatively, the molecular ion at 45 could be from a smaller molecule, but in this case, the options are all six-carbon compounds. Hmm.

Let me think about the possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. The molecular formula suggests it's an ester, maybe, because esters have the formula CnH2nO2. Alternatively, a diol ester or something else. Alternatively, it could be a cyclic ester (lactone), but I'm not sure. For C6H12O2, the degree of unsaturation would be (2*6 +2 -12 -2*2)/2 = (14-12-4)/2= (-2)/2= -1. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, the formula is C6H12O2. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 - 0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 2/2=1. So one DoU. Which could be a ring or a double bond. But since there's a vinyl proton in NMR, there's a double bond. So maybe one ring and a double bond? Or just a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU for this would be (2*6+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. Could be two rings, one ring and one double bond, etc. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl group. So maybe a ketone or an al
