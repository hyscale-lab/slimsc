Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. I remember that it has to do with stars, their effective temperatures, and the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in different energy levels. Hmm.

The problem says the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that affect the photosphere? Oh right, the spots are cooler regions, so when they cover part of the surface, the average temperature of the whole star's photosphere decreases. But wait, the given Teff is for the whole star, not the spots themselves. So the photospheric temperature is dropping overall.

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when there are no spots. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes, i.e., no spots divided by when spots are present.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. I remember that this wavelength is in the near ultraviolet or extreme ultraviolet range. Oh wait, 1448 Å is about 0.1448 nm, which is in the far UV. Titanium lines are often used in stellar spectroscopy, so this makes sense.

Since the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Boltzmann equation applies for the population of atoms in energy levels. The ratio of populations is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energy levels, and k is the Boltzmann constant.

So, the ratio R = N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the Teff
