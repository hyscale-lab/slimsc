Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of wave functions and probabilities. Let me read through the question carefully.

Alright, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5*i. So that's a complex wave function since it has an 'i' which is the square root of -1. Interesting. 

When they measure the position of the particles, none are found outside the region x=1 to x=3. So the particles are confined between x=1 and x=3. That must mean the wave function is zero outside this region, right? Because if the probability is zero there, the wave function squared would be zero.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. Hmm. So maybe this is the part where the wave function is non-zero. So for x <1 and x>3, the wave function must be zero because the particles aren't found there. So between x=1 and x=3, the wave function is as given, and outside, it's zero. 

But wait, if the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, that suggests it's a complex function. So maybe this is the expression inside the region where the particle is found (x=1 to x=3), and zero elsewhere. But how do I find 'a'?

I remember that for wave functions, the integral of the probability density (|ψ|^2) over all space must equal 1. So the total probability is 1, ensuring normalization. So I'll need to normalize the wave function.

The wave function ψ(x) is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise. To normalize, I have to calculate the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1.

Wait, let's calculate |ψ|^2. Since ψ is a complex number, |ψ|^2 is ψ multiplied by its complex conjugate. So ψ = A - 0.5i, where A is a/sqrt(1+x). The conjugate would be A + 0.5i. 

So |
