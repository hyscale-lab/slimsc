Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit unsure how to approach it, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a star with certain properties and some observations about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The problem statement says that when the star doesn't have spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They're looking at the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. They want the factor by which this ratio changes (no spots vs spots) and the options are given.

Hmm. So I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which the problem states we can assume. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states to the temperature and the energy difference between the states.

The Boltzmann factor is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) )

Where:
- n_i is the number of particles in state i,
- g_i is the statistical weight (or degeneracy) of state i,
- E_i is the energy of state i,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature.

In this case, the ratio is n1/n2, where level 1 and level 2 are the two energy levels. So the ratio R = (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Angstroms. So the energy difference between the two levels is related to the photon emitted during the transition. The energy E is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

But wait, in the Boltzmann equation, the difference in energy between the levels is (E2 - E1), because the exponent is negative. So if E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive, and the ratio n1/n2 would be proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

Wait, but the ratio is given as n1/n2. So, for the problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K).

They observed that the ratio R (n1/n2) decreases when there are spots. So R is lower when T is lower. Let me think about this. The ratio R depends on exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). If T decreases, what happens to R?

Let me compute the ratio R for two different temperatures, T1 = 6000 K and T2 = 5500 K.

But
