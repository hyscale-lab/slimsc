Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these instruments have different capabilities. Let me think about what each one can observe.

The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question states that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Oh wait, no, wait again. Wait, the way it's phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, but in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's a magnitude less than 17. Because higher numbers mean fainter. So ESPRESSO observes stars where V < 17.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So V <16 for HIRES. So which stars are bright enough (low magnitude) to be seen by both?

Wait, no. Let me make sure: if a magnitude is 17, that's pretty faint. So ESPRESSO can see up to 17. HIRES can only see up to 16, which is brighter. So any star that is brighter than 16 (V less than 16) can be detected by both, because HIRES can't see beyond 16, but if a star
