Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, each with a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance, right? So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. Wait, but wait, parallax is usually in arcseconds and distance in parsecs, so actually, the formula is plx (in arcseconds) = 1/d (where d is in parsecs). So d = 1/plx. That makes sense.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, I can substitute plx with 1/d. So let's write that substitution.

N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that exponent. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 over that is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

But wait, the question isn't just about how N depends on d. It's about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. I think that means the number of stars per unit distance. So maybe it's the derivative of N with respect to r, or perhaps the way N changes as r increases by a small amount.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about how the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr scales. So if the number of stars in a shell is N dr, then dN/dr would be the number per unit distance. But in this case, N is proportional to d^5, so dN/dr is 5d^4, which is proportional to r^4. So the number per unit distance would go as r^4. Wait, but is that the case?

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the number of stars in a region as a function of distance, considering a unit range. So let's think about it.

Wait, the question says 'how does the number of stars in that region of the sky
