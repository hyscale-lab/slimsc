Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down.

So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where each star appears brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are given: Star_1 is 0 km/s and Star_2 is 700 km/s. They want to find by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. I remember that for black bodies, the peak wavelength (the wavelength where the star appears brightest) is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (about 2.9 x 10^-3 mÂ·K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, because lambda_max is the same, so T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, same lambda_max implies same temperature, right? Because according to Wien's Law, if lambda_max is same, T is same. So T1 = T2.

But wait, no. What about Doppler shift? Oh, right! Because the stars are moving, their observed wavelengths could be different from their actual emission. Because when a star moves towards us, the light is blueshifted, and when moving away, it's redshifted. So the observed wavelength is affected by the star's velocity.

Wait, so the problem says that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So Star_1's observed lambda_max is the same as Star_2's. But because Star_2 is moving away (radial velocity 700 km/s), its observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted) compared to its emission. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its observed lambda_max is the same as its emitted lambda_max.

So, let's think. Let's denote T1 as the effective temperature of Star_1 and T2 as that of Star_2. But due to their velocities, the observed wavelengths are
