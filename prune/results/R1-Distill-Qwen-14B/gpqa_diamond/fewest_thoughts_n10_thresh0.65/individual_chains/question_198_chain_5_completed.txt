Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Hmm, stability constants. Right, those are the formation constants, which indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So β1 is the constant for the first complex, say [Co(SCN)]+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]³+, β3 for [Co(SCN)₃]⁵+, and β4 for [Co(SCN)₄]⁶-.

Wait, but what's the order of the complexes? Because sometimes the numbering could be different, but I think it's based on the number of thiocyanate ligands. So, the first complex has one SCN-, the second two, etc.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would have two SCN- ligands, so that's the [Co(SCN)₂]³+ complex, which has β2=40.

Wait, but I'm not sure if all the complexes are blue. The problem says "blue dithiocyanato," so I guess that's the specific one we're looking for.

So, to find the percentage, I need to calculate the fraction of each complex and then sum the fraction for the dithiocyanato one.

The general approach for these types of problems is to consider the distribution of metal complexes based on their stability constants. Since the stability constants are given, the most stable complex (highest β) will have the highest concentration. But wait, β3 is 63, which is the highest, followed by β4=16, β2=40, and β1=9. Wait, no, β3 is 63, which is higher than β2 (40) and β4 (16). Hmm, but wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong. Oh wait, no, because β1 is the first complex, which would have one SCN-.

Wait, but sometimes the stability constants are given for each step. So, for the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+, the stability constant is β1. For the second, [Co(SCN)₂]^(3+), the constant is β2, which is the formation from the first complex. Or wait, perhaps the overall β2 is the constant for the second complex, considering all the ligands. Maybe I should think of the overall formation constants for each complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the β values are for each step of complexation. Like β1 is the constant for adding the first SCN-, β2 is for adding the second, and so on. So the overall formation constant for the nth complex would be the product of β1 to βn. Wait, but wait, the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So each β is the stability constant for a specific complex. So for [Co(SCN)]^+ it's β1=9, [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ is β2=40, [Co(SCN)3]^5+ is β3=63, and [Co(SCN)4]^6- is β4=16.

Wait, but that might not make sense because β4 is lower than β2 and β3. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the β values are for each step, i.e., the stepwise constants. So to get the overall β for each complex, you multiply the step constants up to that complex. Let me think.

For example, the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+, has a formation constant K1 = β1 =9.

The second complex, [Co(SCN)₂]^3+, would form by adding another SCN- to the first complex. So its formation constant would be K2 = β1 * β2 = 9*40=360.

Similarly, K3 would be 9*40*63= 9*40=360 *63= 22680.

And K4 would be 9*40*63*16=22680 *16= 362880.

Wait, but then K3 is 22680 and K4 is 362880. So the higher the complex order, the higher the overall stability constant? That can't be right because β4 is 16, which is lower than β2 and β3. So this approach would lead to K4 being higher than K3, which might make sense if the fourth complex is more stable than the third.

But wait, I'm not sure if the given β values are the stepwise or the overall constants. The question states they are the stability constants of the complexes, which suggests they are the overall constants for each complex. Wait, no, the stability constant (β) for a complex is the overall formation constant, which is the product of the stepwise constants. Alternatively, sometimes β is used as the stepwise constant, so each βn is the constant for adding the nth ligand. So perhaps in this problem, each β is the stepwise constant for adding the nth SCN-.

So the possible complexes are:

Co²+ + n SCN⁻ → [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}.

The possible n values are 1,2,3,4.

Each step's formation constant is β1, β2, β3, β4, respectively.

So the overall formation constant for the first complex is K1 = β1 =9.

The second complex is formed by adding a second SCN- to the first complex. The stepwise constant for the second addition is β2=40. So the overall K2= β1 * β2 = 9*40=360.

Similarly, K3= β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680.

K4= β1*β2*β3*β4=22680 *16=362880.

Wait, but β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63) and β2 (40), but higher than β1 (9). So when you multiply stepwise constants, the overall K increases each time, but the stepwise β4 is lower than some previous steps. Hmm, but that's okay because each step's β can vary.

Now, the problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the second complex, [Co(SCN)₂]^(3+), with n=2. So that's the one with K2=360.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the one with two SCN- ligands. So we need to find the fraction of this species in the solution.

The approach is to calculate the fraction distribution of each complex based on their overall formation constants and the concentrations of the ligand (SCN⁻) and the metal (Co²+).

The general formula for the fraction f_n of the nth complex is:

f_n = (K_n * [Co²+] * [SCN⁻]^n) / ( [Co²+] + sum over all m of ( K_m [SCN⁻]^m ) )

Wait, no, I think the more accurate approach is to consider that the fraction of each complex is given by the product of the metal's concentration and the ligand's concentration raised to the power of the number of ligands, multiplied by the formation constant, divided by the sum of all such terms for all possible complexes plus the uncomplexed metal.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to model the species distribution. Let's denote [Co] as the concentration of free Co²+ ions.

The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of [Co] and [SCN^-].

So:

[Co] is the free Co²+.

[CoSCN] = β1 [Co][SCN]

[Co(SCN)_2] = β1 β2 [Co][SCN]^2

[Co(SCN)_3] = β1 β2 β3 [Co][SCN]^3

[Co(SCN)_4] = β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co][SCN]^4

Wait, no, because each step's formation constant is multiplied. So for the nth complex, the formation constant is the product of β1 to βn.

So, the concentration of each complex is [Co] multiplied by [SCN]^n multiplied by the product of β1 to βn.

But wait, isn't [Co(SCN)_n] = β1*β2*...*βn [Co][SCN]^n.

Wait, but in this case, the overall formation constant K_n is the product of stepwise β's up to n. So:

K1=β1=9

K2=β1β2=9*40=360

K3=β1β2β3=9*40*63=22680

K4=β1β2β3β4=9*40*63*16=362880.

So, the concentrations of the complexes are:

[Co(SCN)_1] = K1 [Co][SCN]

[Co(SCN)_2] = K2 [Co][SCN]^2

[Co(SCN)_3] = K3 [Co][SCN]^3

[Co(SCN)_4] = K4 [Co][SCN]^4

And the free Co²+ is [Co].

The total cobalt concentration c_total is the sum of all these species plus the free Co²+.

So:

c_total = [Co] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4]

Substituting the expressions in terms of [Co]:

c_total = [Co] + K1 [Co][SCN] + K2 [Co][SCN]^2 + K3 [Co][SCN]^3 + K4 [Co][SCN]^4

Factor out [Co]:

c_total = [Co] (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

We can solve for [Co]:

[Co] = c_total / (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

But wait, the given [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. Let me plug in the numbers.

First, calculate each K term multiplied by [SCN]^n.

Compute each term in the denominator:

Term0 = 1

Term1 = K1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term2 = K2 * [SCN]^2 = 360 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

Term3 = K3 * [SCN]^3 = 22680 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68

Term4 = K4 * [SCN]^4 = 362880 * (0.1)^4 = 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288

So the denominator is 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let me add them up:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So denominator is 64.468.

Thus, [Co] = (0.01 M) / 64.468 ≈ 0.000155 M.

Now, the fraction of each complex is (K_n [SCN]^n) / denominator.

Wait, no, because [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co][SCN]^n.

But the fraction fn is [Co(SCN)_n] / c_total.

Which is (K_n [Co][SCN]^n) / c_total.

But since c_total = [Co] (denominator), the [Co] cancels out.

So, fn = (K_n [SCN]^n) / denominator.

So for each n (1,2,3,4), calculate fn and sum to 100%.

Wait, but wait, the denominator is 64.468 as computed.

So let's compute each fn.

n=1: K1=9, [SCN]=0.1 → 9*(0.1) =0.9. fn=0.9 /64.468 ≈ 0.014, or 1.4%

n=2: K2=360, [SCN]^2=0.01 → 360*0.01=3.6 → 3.6 /64.468≈0.05556, or 5.556%

n=3: K3=22680, [SCN]^3=0.001 → 22680 *0.001 =22.68 → 22.68/64.468≈0.3518 → 35.18%

n=4: K4=362880, [SCN]^4=0.0001 →362880 *0.0001=36.288 →36.288/64.468≈0.5627 →56.27%.

So the fractions are approximately:

n=1: 1.4%

n=2:5.556%

n=3:35.18%

n=4:56.27%

Wait, but these sum up to roughly 1.4+5.56=7, +35=42, +56=98. So wait, that's about 98.21%, but I may have missed some. Let's do exact calculations.

Compute each:

f1 = (9*0.1)/64.468 ≈0.9/64.468 ≈0.014 →1.4%

f2= (360*(0.1)^2)/64.468 → 360*0.01=3.6 →3.6/64.468≈0.05556 →5.556%

f3= (22680*(0.1)^3)=22680 *0.001=22.68 →22.68/64.468≈0.3518 →35.18%

f4= (362880 * (0.1)^4)=362880 *0.0001=36.288 →36.288/64.468≈0.5627 →56.27%

Adding all fractions: 1.4 +5.556=6.956; +35.18=42.136; +56.27=98.406%. Wait, that's about 98.4%, but the sum should be 100% because [Co] is included as the free ion.

Ah, right, [Co] itself contributes the first term in the denominator, which is 1. So [Co]/c_total = (1)/(denominator) = 1/64.468 ≈0.0155 →1.55%.

So the fractions are:

f0 = [Co] / c_total = 1/64.468 ≈0.0155 →1.55%

f1=0.9/64.468≈0.014 →1.4%

f2=3.6/64.468≈5.556%

f3=22.68/64.468≈35.18%

f4=36.288/64.468≈56.27%

Sum: 1.55 +1.4=2.95; +5.556=8.5; +35.18=43.68; +56.27=99.95. Close enough to 100% considering rounding.

So the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2, [Co(SCN)₂]^3+.

Looking at f2, which is about 5.556%. But none of the options match that. Hmm, the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Wait, so clearly I must have made a mistake. Because according to my calculation, the percentage for n=2 is about 5.5%, which isn't any of the options. So I need to reevaluate.

Ah, wait a second. Maybe I misinterpreted the β values. Let me go back.

The problem says that β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16 are the stability constants of the complexes. So maybe each βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex. Which would mean:

K1 = β1=9

K2 = β2=40

K3 = β3=63

K4= β4=16

Wait, but that can't be right because then for each complex, the K would be as given, and for K4, which is the highest complex, the K is 16, which is lower than K2 (40) and K3 (63). That would imply that the fourth complex is less stable than the second and third. Which seems odd, but perhaps possible.

But in any case, how would that affect the calculation?

Wait, if the β values are the overall K for each complex, not the stepwise, then the concentrations would be:

[Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co][SCN]^n

So the denominator would be sum over n=0 to 4 of (K_n [SCN]^n ), where K0=1 (free Co²+), K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

Wait, no, K0 is 1 for [Co], K1=9 for [CoSCN], K2=40 for [Co(SCN)₂], etc.

Wait, but that's a different scenario. So in this case, the denominator would be 1 +9*(0.1) +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Let me compute each term:

Term0: 1

Term1:9*0.1=0.9

Term2:40*(0.01)=0.4

Term3:63*(0.001)=0.063

Term4:16*(0.0001)=0.0016

Sum all terms:1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016≈2.3646.

So denominator is approx 2.3646.

So [Co] = c_total / denominator =0.01 / 2.3646 ≈0.004225 M.

Now, the fraction of each complex is (K_n [SCN]^n ) / denominator.

So for n=2, K2=40, so [Co(SCN)₂] =40 * [Co] * (0.1)^2.

The fraction f2 = (40 *0.1^2) / denominator.

Which is (40 *0.01) /2.3646 =0.4 /2.3646≈0.169, or 16.9%.

Wait, that's option D. But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2, so if f2 is 16.9%, then the answer would be D.

But wait, the problem is that the β values as given might be the stepwise or overall constants. So I think I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Because earlier, when I took each β as stepwise, the sum didn't match any options, but if I take each β as the overall K for each complex, then n=2 gives f2=16.9%, which is option D.

But I'm confused because the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So each βn is the overall K for the nth complex.

Wait, but for K4=16, which is less than K3=63. That would mean the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which is possible, but perhaps unlikely.

But let's proceed with this approach.

So with K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

Denominator is 1 +9*0.1 +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Which is 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646.

So the fraction for n=2 is (40*(0.1)^2) / 2.3646= 0.4 /2.3646≈0.169, or 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, in the initial approach, using stepwise β's, the percentage for n=2 was about 5.55%, which didn't match any options. So perhaps the correct approach is to treat the given β's as the overall K for each complex.

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Another way to think about this is that the formation constants are for each complex step, so β1 is the first step, β2 the second, etc. So the overall K for n=2 is K1*K2=9*40=360, as I did earlier. But when I did that, the percentage for n=2 was around 5.5%, which isn't an option.

But according to the options, the only one that matches the second approach is D)16.9%.

Wait, but why is the problem giving β4=16 and β3=63? If the order of the complexes is based on the number of SCN- ligands, then n=4 would have a lower K than n=3, which is possible, but perhaps the solution's color depends on the number of ligands. But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2.

Alternatively, perhaps the β values are the stepwise constants, but in that case, the fraction for n=2 is about 5.5%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation using the stepwise approach.

In the stepwise approach:

K1=9, K2=360, K3=22680, K4=362880.

Denominator terms:

Term0=1

Term1=K1*0.1=0.9

Term2=K2*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6

Term3=K3*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68

Term4= K4*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288

Denominator sum:1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So [Co]=0.01 /64.468≈0.000155.

Now, the fractions:

f2= [Co(SCN)_2]/c_total = (K2*(0.1)^2) / denominator = 360 *0.01 /64.468 = 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05556, or 5.556%.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the initial approach where each β is the overall K is correct.

Let me recalculate with each β as the overall K for the complex.

K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

Denominator is 1 +9*0.1 +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Which is 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 =2.3646.

So [Co]=0.01 /2.3646≈0.004225 M.

f2= (40*(0.1)^2) /2.3646= (40*0.01)/2.3646 =0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the problem is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So if option D is 16.9%, that's the answer.

But I'm a bit confused because earlier calculations with stepwise βs didn't match any options, but when taking each β as the overall K, it matches option D.

So perhaps the correct approach is to treat each β as the overall formation constant for the respective complex.

Therefore, the answer should be D)16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]³⁺, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt complexes based on the given stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16). These constants represent the overall stability constants for the respective complexes, where:

- [Co(SCN)]⁺ has β₁=9  
- [Co(SCN)₂]³⁺ has β₂=40  
- [Co(SCN)₃]⁵⁺ has β₃=63  
- [Co(SCN)₄]⁶⁻ has β₄=16  

The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The fraction of each complex is determined by the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{K_n \cdot [\text{SCN}]^n}{\text{Denominator}}
\]

where \(K_n\) is the stability constant for the nth complex, and the denominator is the sum of all terms of the form \(K_m \cdot [\text{SCN}]^m\) for \(m = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). Here, \(K_0 = 1\) corresponds to the free cobalt ion [Co²⁺].

### Step 1: Calculate the denominator
The denominator is computed as:

\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + K_1 \cdot [\text{SCN}] + K_2 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^2 + K_3 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^3 + K_4 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^4
\]

Substituting the values:
- \(K_1 = 9, [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \implies K_1 \cdot [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9\)
- \(K_2 = 40, [\text{SCN}]^2 = 0.1^2 = 0.01 \implies K_2 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4\)
- \(K_3 = 63, [\text{SCN}]^3 = 0.1^3 = 0.001 \implies K_3 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063\)
- \(K_4 = 16, [\text{SCN}]^4 = 0.1^4 = 0.0001 \implies K_4 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016\)

Adding these terms:
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex
The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂]³⁺, is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{K_2 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^2}{\text{Denominator}}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
f_2 = \frac{40 \cdot (0.1)^2}{2.3646} = \frac{40 \cdot 0.01}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Converting to a percentage:
\[
f_2 \approx 0.169 \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.

Answer: D
