Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, okay, I need to find the maximum speed of the mass. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem states it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Oh right, in the relativistic case, the equations change because of the speed of light limit. The maximum speed can't reach the speed of light, so we have to consider relativistic effects.

The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. Right, so it's a standard harmonic oscillator but with relativity in mind.

In the classical, non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would just be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Looking at the options, option C is that, but wait, this is the relativistic case, so maybe C is not the answer here.

But since it's relativistic, I should think about how kinetic energy is treated. In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The total energy is gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the kinetic energy would be (gamma - 1) mc².

The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², but at maximum amplitude A, that would be (1/2)kA². So, at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential, and at maximum speed, it's kinetic.

So, the total energy E when the oscillator is at x=0 (max speed) is entirely kinetic. But wait, in the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So when the particle is at the equilibrium position (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. But wait, at maximum displacement, x = A, so the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy would be E = (1/2)kA² + mc²? Or is it (gamma - 1) mc² equals (1/2)kA²?

Wait, no. At maximum displacement, the oscillator has potential
