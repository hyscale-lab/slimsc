Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. And we need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed depends on the medium's index of refraction. Oh right, the speed v in the medium is c divided by n, but wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer, right?

But wait, the medium here is moving. So I think I need to consider a frame where the medium is moving. Oh, maybe I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh wait, no, because the speeds might not be close to the speed of light. Wait, but if the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving in the same direction, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, let me think. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. Because the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. So from the glass's perspective, the light's speed is c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame.

So the lab frame sees the glass moving. So the light's velocity in the lab frame would be the velocity of the glass plus the light's velocity in the glass's frame, but with some considerations
