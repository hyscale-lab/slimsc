Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question involves some matrices and statements about them. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices often represent operators, and certain properties are important like whether they're Hermitian or Unitary.

The matrices given are W, X, Y, Z. Let me list them out again to visualize better.

W is a 3x3 matrix:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

X is:
i  -1  2i
1   0   1
2i -1  -i

Y is:
0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

Z is:
3   2i  5
-2i -2  -4i
5   4i  4

The options are about which statements are correct. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says there's a vector where multiplying by e^X changes its norm. Wait, the exponential of a matrix is involved here. I think the exponential of a matrix is related to the time evolution operator in quantum mechanics. But for the norm to change, the operator e^X must not be unitary. Because unitary operators preserve the norm when you apply them to a vector.

So, if e^X isn't unitary, then there exists a vector where the norm changes. How do I check if X is such that e^X is unitary? Wait, I remember that for e^X to be unitary, X must be skew-Hermitian, because the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. A matrix A is skew-Hermitian if A† = -A, where † is the conjugate transpose.

So let me check if X is skew-Hermitian. Compute X's conjugate transpose and see if it's equal to -X.

X's rows are:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Conjugate transpose (X†) would have columns as the conjugate of the rows.

So X† would be:

First row of X† is (i*, 1*, (2i)* ) → (-i, 1, -2i)
Second row is (-1*, 0*, -1* ) → (-1,0,-1)
Wait, wait, no. Wait, when you take the conjugate transpose, each element becomes the conjugate, and rows become columns.

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So X† is the conjugate of each element, then transposed.

So X†:

First column is (i*, 1*, 2i* ) → (-i
