Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. Hmm, I remember that when metal ions form complexes with ligands, the stability constants (beta values) play a big role in determining the distribution of these complexes.

So, the problem states that the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: total cobalt is 1e-2 M, and thiocyanate is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, beta values are the formation constants, right? So, each beta corresponds to a different complex. Let's think about how the complexes form.

Cobalt can form various thiocyanate complexes. For each step, the metal binds another SCN- ion. The first complex is Co(SCN), the next is Co(SCN)₂, then Co(SCN)₃, and Co(SCN)₄. The beta values given are for each step. So β1 is the constant for the first ligand binding, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, no. I think the stability constant is for the overall formation. Or is it for each step? Oh, right, stability constants are for each step when adding ligands. So, the overall formation constant for the n-th complex would be the product of the stepwise constants β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, let me clarify. The stability constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of the constants up to that point. So, the first complex Co(SCN) has a β1 of 9. The second, Co(SCN)₂, would have a β1*β2=9*40=360. The third is β1*β2*β3= 9*40*63= 22680. The fourth is 9*40*63*16= 362880. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the way stability constants work: the overall β for the n-th complex is the product of the stepwise beta's from 1
