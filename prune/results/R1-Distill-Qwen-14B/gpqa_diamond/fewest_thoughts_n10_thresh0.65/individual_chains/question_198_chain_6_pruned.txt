Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to understand what's being asked. Hmm, so the question is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, I remember that stability constants are used to determine the concentration of metal-ligand complexes in solution. Each β represents the formation constant for a specific complex. So, for Co(II), the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^n, where n is the number of thiocyanate ligands attached.

The problem asks specifically about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. So, that's the third complex because the β3 is given as 63. Or wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. Stability constants are usually ordered by the number of ligands. So β1 is for the monodentate complex, β2 for the bidentate, etc. Or wait, no, actually, the stability constant βn represents the equilibrium for the formation of the complex with n ligands. So β1 would be for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- (if that's possible), and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2- or something similar. But in this case, the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the blue dithiocyanato complex is likely the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ ion. So, that would be the second complex. Because the first is [CoSCN]^+ and the second is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. So β2 is 40, right? Wait, but wait, the given β3 is 63. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think
