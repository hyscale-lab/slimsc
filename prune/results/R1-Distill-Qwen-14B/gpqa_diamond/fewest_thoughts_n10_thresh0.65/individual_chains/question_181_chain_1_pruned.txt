Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how the flux changes when a certain branch stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me think this through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light (and neutrinos?) from the Sun's core to reach Earth. So if the pp-III stopped, what happens to the neutrino flux here?

I remember that the pp chain is the primary source of energy in the Sun. The pp-I, II, III are different stages. The pp-III branch probably produces high-energy neutrinos. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the fusion of two helium-3 nuclei into beryllium-7, which then captures a proton to form lithium-7 and emits a positron and a neutrino. Wait, wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the steps. Or is it the other way around? Oh, no, wait: The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, which is the dominant fusion process in the Sun. So, in the pp chain, the first steps produce deuterium, then tritium, and then eventually helium-4. But the pp-III branch... maybe it's when two helium-3 nuclei (tritium?) capture to form beryllium-7, which then captures a proton to become lithium-7 and emits a positron and a neutrino.

Wait, but neutrinos are produced
