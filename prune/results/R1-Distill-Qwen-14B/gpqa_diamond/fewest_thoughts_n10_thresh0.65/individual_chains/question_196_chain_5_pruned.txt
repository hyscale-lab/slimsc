Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed which depends on its amplitude and the spring constant. But wait, this is relativistic, so I guess I have to consider how relativity affects the maximum speed.

The question gives F = -kx, so it's obeying Hooke's law. The mass is m, maximum amplitude is A. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is achieved when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy U is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy K is (1/2)mv_max². So setting U = K, we get v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But that's option C, but this is a relativistic case, so I can't use that directly.

Wait, relativity affects energy calculations. The total energy in special relativity is gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But the oscillator's potential and kinetic energy might be different. Oh, right, in relativistic harmonic oscillators, the potential is often treated with a relativistic correction.

Wait, another approach: energy conservation. The total energy at maximum displacement (x=A) should be equal to the total energy when the mass is at the equilibrium point (x=0), moving at maximum speed.

In the relativistic case, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kA² anymore. Let me think. The force is F = -kx, so the
