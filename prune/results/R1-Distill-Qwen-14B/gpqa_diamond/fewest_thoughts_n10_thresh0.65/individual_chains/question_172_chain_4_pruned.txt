Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key point is that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 for a specific energy level. They've given the energy difference between the levels as 1.38e-23 J. And we need to find the correct equation relating their temperatures, T1 and T2, assuming LTE.

Hmm, LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so I think that means the conditions in the photosphere can be treated as if they're in equilibrium with a blackbody at the local temperature. So, the excitation of the atoms would follow the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann equation relates the population of energy levels to the temperature. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i is the number of atoms in energy level i, n_j in level j, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as delta E = 1.38e-23 J. Let's say E_i is the higher energy level, E_j the lower. So for star_1, the excitation (n_i) is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, (n_i)_1 = 2*(n_i)_2.

Wait, but star_2's (n_i) would be lower? Or maybe I should think in terms of ratios. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, the number of excited atoms in level i for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n_i)_1 = 2*(n_i)_2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of n_i to n_j is e^(-(E_i - E_j)/(kT)).

So, for each star, we can write the ratio of their excited to lower state populations.

Let me denote for each star:

For star_1: (n_i)_1 / (n_j)_1 = exp( -delta E / (k T1) )

For star_2: (n_i)_2 / (n_j)_
