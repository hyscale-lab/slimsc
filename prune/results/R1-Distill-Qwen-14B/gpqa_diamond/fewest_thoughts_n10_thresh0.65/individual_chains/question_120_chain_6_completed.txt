Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula I think is parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Oh wait, uniform distribution means the same number density everywhere. So if I imagine a sphere around the galaxy, the number of stars in each shell depends on the volume. But wait, how does that relate to parallax?

Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance d: plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. If I consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume of the shell would be the surface area times the thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd². So the volume element dV is 4π d² dd.

But wait, the number of stars per unit volume is uniform. Let's say the number density is n stars per cubic parsec. So the number of stars in the shell would be n * dV = n * 4π d² dd.

Now, we're interested in how the number of stars per unit parallax range (like dplx) changes. So we need to express this in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, let me substitute that.

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but since we're considering a small range, I can ignore the sign for now.

So substituting d = 1/plx and dd = (1/plx²) dplx, the number of stars in a shell becomes:

n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) )

Wait, let me double-check. dV = 4π d² dd. So substituting:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx²) dplx )

Wait, no, dd is (1/plx²) dplx. So:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait no, wait, let me re-examine. Because d = 1/plx, so d squared is 1/plx². And dd is (1/plx²) dplx, right?

So putting it together: dV = 4π (1/plx^2) * ( dplx / plx² )

Wait, that would be 4π * (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx² ) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

So the number of stars in that shell is n * dV = n * 4π dplx / plx^4.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So if I take the number of stars per dplx, it's (n * 4π / plx^4 ) dplx.

So the number per unit plx range (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that's the number in each shell. So the number of stars per unit plx (since the question says 'number per unit range of parallax') would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, wait, but another angle: sometimes when dealing with distributions, we think about flux or other factors, but the question states stars are uniformly distributed, so no other factors—just the volume element.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about differential number per parallax. So the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is n*4π (1/plx²) dplx / (plx^2), which is n *4π dplx / plx^4.

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So option A is correct.


The question asks how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. For a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \), the volume element is \( dV = 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \), the volume element becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} = \frac{4\pi d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the number density \( n \) of stars and the volume \( dV \), giving:

\[
\text{Number of stars} = n \cdot \frac{4\pi d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This matches option A. The other options can be ruled out as they do not align with the derived relationship.

Answer: A
