Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is 0 here, and N is 1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring plus double bonds or something like that.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a strong peak, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons. So maybe the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group?

- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. This could be aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted because two protons as a doublet. Like in a benzene ring with substituents that cause two equivalent protons.

- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Another aromatic region. Maybe another set of protons, perhaps ortho or meta? Wait, but if one is 6.98 and the other 6.51, perhaps they are part of the same ring but in different chemical environments. Alternatively, maybe two different rings. Wait, the NMR shows 2H each for two doublets. Let me thinkâ€”could this be a biphenyl structure? So perhaps two benzene rings connected.

- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange, like an -OH proton. But it's a singlet with two H, so maybe a conjugated diol or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps these are part of a vinyl group, but the broadness makes me think of hydroxyl groups. Wait, but 2H as a singlet? Maybe a di-substituted group, like two adjacent protons on a ring with substituents causing them to be equivalent, but I'm not sure.

- 3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H
