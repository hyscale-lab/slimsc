Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The problem states that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian:

L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, I think I might have read that wrong. Let me parse the equation again. Oh, right, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So, X(y) is a boson field interacting with fermions. The term suggests that X couples to the fermion fields, which would mean that when X decays, it can produce fermion-antifermion pairs.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, the question is about the possible decay channels of X at the lowest order. The options are all different combinations of fermion pairs.

In particle physics, the decay of a boson into fermions depends on the mass of the fermions. For a decay X → f f̄ to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the fermion (m_f) must be less than or equal to half the mass of X. Because each fermion would get some energy, but the minimum energy each needs is their rest mass. So, m_f ≤ M_X / 2.

So, X's mass is 6 GeV. Let's compute M_X / 2 = 3 GeV. Any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced as a pair.

Wait, but fermions have different masses. Let me think about the masses of known fermions.

Leptons: electrons (m ~ 0.0005 GeV), muons (0.1057), taus (1.777). So, tau is about 1.777 GeV, so much less than 3 GeV. So, tau pairs are allowed.

Quarks: Let's see. The up and down quarks are light, but the actual masses are a bit tricky because they depend on the context (like confinement). But roughly, the masses are: u and d are around a few MeV (so way below 3 GeV). S quark (strange) is about 95-100 MeV, still much less than 3 GeV. The charm quark is about 1.27 GeV, which is under 3. The bottom quark is about 4.1-4.7 GeV. Wait, wait a second. If X is 6 GeV, then M_X/2 is 3 GeV. So, a fermion pair like b b̄ would require each b quark to be around 4.7 GeV. Wait, but 4.7 GeV is more than 3 GeV, so that's not possible. So, X can't decay into b b̄ because each b quark would require more than 3 GeV. So, any fermion pair where each fermion's mass is more than 3 GeV can't be produced.

So, the allowed fermions are those with m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but what about the masses of the fermions in the Standard Model? Let me list them:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.1057 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up (u): ~2 MeV (<<1 GeV)
- Down (d): ~4-5 MeV (<<1 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Top (t): ~173 GeV (way above)
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-
