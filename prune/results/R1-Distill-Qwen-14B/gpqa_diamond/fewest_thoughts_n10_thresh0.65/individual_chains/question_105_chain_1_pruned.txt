Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about a star similar to the Sun. Half of its surface is covered in dark spots. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. They're saying that this setup would cause brightness variations that look like an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is, what would be the radius of such an exoplanet compared to the star to produce the same light curve amplitude?

Hmm. I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. Because the planet blocks a part of the star's light. So the formula is (Rp / Rstar)^2, I think. But wait, this problem is about a star with spots, so maybe the effect is different?

The star's hemisphere is covered with spots, and the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So 20% of one hemisphere, which is half the star's surface, so 10% of the entire star's surface is spots. Wait, no, wait. The total surface area of a sphere is 4πR². If one hemisphere is covered, that's 2πR². So if the filling factor is 20% on that hemisphere, then spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². The total area of the star is 4πR², so spots are 0.4π / 4π = 10% of the star's surface.

But wait, each spot is cooler. The star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. The brightness of the star comes from the sum of all the surface areas emitting light. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away, causing dips in brightness.

Wait, no, actually, when the spots are on the visible side, the total emitted light from the star would be less because the spots are cooler. So the brightness variation would depend on the
