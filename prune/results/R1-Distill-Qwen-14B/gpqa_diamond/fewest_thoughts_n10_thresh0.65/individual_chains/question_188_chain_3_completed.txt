Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. All the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, varying around 9 to 10 Angstroms.

Wait, so first, what's a rhombohedral crystal? I remember that rhombohedral crystals are a type of hexagonal crystal system, but wait, no, maybe not. Oh right, rhombohedral is a type of cubic crystal system, but with all the edges equal and all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So it's a special case where a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma, but not 90 degrees. So in this case, each angle is 30 degrees.

Interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, right? So in this case, each atom is 10 Angstroms apart. But wait, wait—the interatomic distance in a crystal can be found using the unit cell parameters. So I think the interatomic distance is the edge length of the rhombohedral unit cell. So a = 10 Angstroms, because in a rhombohedral structure with a cubic-like structure but skewed angles.

Now, the interplanar distance d for a given plane (hkl) is calculated using the formula from crystallography. I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h + k + l)(2 cos α) ) ... Wait, no, perhaps I should double-check. Alternatively, another formula I remember is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - hk( (cos α)/(1 - cos^2 α) )) or something like that. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the general formula involving the structure factor and the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, no, the standard formula for interplanar distance in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2), but this is when the angles are 90 degrees. Since this isn't cubic but rhombohedral, we have to adjust for the angles.

I think the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, wait. Let me think. In a rhombohedral lattice, the lattice is defined with vectors a, b, c, each of length a (since a = b = c), and the angles between them are all alpha (since alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees here). So the interplanar distance formula is different from cubic.

Wait, I've heard that for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, is that correct? Because in a hexagonal system, the formula is different, but for rhombohedral, since all the angles are same, maybe that's the case.

Wait, no, perhaps I should look up the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. But since I can't look it up, I have to remember.

Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the relationship between the reciprocal lattice and the real lattice can be used. The general formula for d is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/a² + 2(hk + hl + kl)/(a² (1 - cos² α)) )

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, another approach: in a rhombohedral system, the Miller indices (hkl) are the same for all axes because a = b = c.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is given by:

d = 1/√( (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos γ)/(a²) - 2(hl cos β)/(a²) - 2(kl cos α)/(a²) ) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem quite right. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula involving the metric tensor.

Hmm, I think I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the formula can be found using the following approach.

For a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, a, a, but with angles between them. So the unit cell vectors can be represented as vectors in 3D space. The metric tensor (g) is built from the dot products of the lattice vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the metric tensor is symmetric because the angles are all the same. The elements of the metric tensor are:

g11 = a²
g22 = a² cos² α
g33 = a² cos² α

Wait no, actually, the metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:

g11 = a²
g12 = g13 = g23 = a² cos α

Wait, wait, perhaps I should correct that. In a rhombohedral system, because the angles between each pair of axes are the same (alpha), so the non-diagonal terms are all a² cos α.

So, the metric tensor g is:

[ a², a² cos α, a² cos α ]
[ a² cos α, a², a² cos α ]
[ a² cos α, a² cos α, a² ]

Then, the reciprocal metric tensor (g*) is needed to find the interplanar distances. The reciprocal metric tensor is found by inverting the metric tensor.

Once I have the reciprocal metric tensor, the formula for d is:

d² = (h² + k² + l²) / (g11 h² + g22 k² + g33 l² + 2 g12 hk + 2 g13 hl + 2 g23 kl )

Wait, no, actually, the reciprocal metric tensor is used to find the d-spacing. The general formula is:

(1/d²) = (h² + k² + l²) / (a²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α) / a²

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the formula for d in terms of the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance d for a crystal plane (hkl) is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * g11 + ... )

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for d in a rhombohedral system.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal by considering the general plane (hkl) and the structure of the crystal.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, a, a, but with angles between them. So the unit vectors can be represented in terms of vectors in 3D space.

The plane (111) would have h=1, k=1, l=1.

So the formula for d is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, does that make sense? Let me test with a cubic system where alpha=90 degrees. Then cos alpha is zero, so the formula reduces to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²), which is correct. So this must be the correct formula.

So, given that, for (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1 + 1 + 1) + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) * cos α )

Since alpha is 30 degrees, cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Calculations step by step:

Compute the numerator: a = 10 Angstrom.

Compute the denominator:

h² +k² + l² = 1+1+1 = 3.

Then 2*(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1+1+1) = 6.

Multiply by cos α: 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate:

Wait, the denominator is the square root of (3 + 6 * cos 30 degrees).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute again.

Wait, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2*(hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α) )

Which is same as sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

In this case, h=k=l=1. So:

h² +k² + l² = 3.

2*(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1 +1 +1) = 6.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 + 6 * cos(30°).

Wait, 6 * cos(30) is 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3 * sqrt(3) ≈ 5.19615.

So 3 + 5.19615 = 8.19615.

So sqrt(8.19615) ≈ 2.86479.

So d = 10 / 2.86479 ≈ 3.4905 Angstrom, wait, that can't be right. Because the options are around 9 Angstrom.

Wait, I must be making a mistake. Hmm. Wait, wait, that can't be. Wait, hold on. Oh no, wait a second. Did I compute the denominator correctly?

Wait, the formula is a divided by the square root, so if the denominator is sqrt(8.196), which is approximately 2.8648, then 10 / 2.8648 is approximately 3.49 Angstrom. But that's way lower than any of the options given (which are around 9).

Hmm, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, maybe I should think of the reciprocal lattice vectors approach.

In a rhombohedral crystal, the reciprocal lattice vectors are:

h^* = (h + k + l) a^* - (k b^* + l c^* )

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for d in a rhombohedral system is:

d^2 = a^2 / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, wait, if I use this, then for (111) plane:

h = k = l =1.

So denominator is 3 + 2(3) cos 30.

Which is 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So d^2 = 10^2 / 8.196 = 100 /8.196 ≈ 12.20.

Wait, so d ≈ sqrt(12.20) ≈ 3.49 Angstrom, same as before. But the options are much higher, so I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the formula is actually:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But wait, in this case, the angles are all 30 degrees, so perhaps that formula is correct. But wait, the calculation gives me d=3.49 Angstrom, which isn't any of the options. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the interatomic distance with the edge length. Wait, what's the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral crystal?

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is equal to a, the edge length. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the interatomic distance is different because the atoms are not at the corners of the cube but perhaps in a different arrangement. Or wait, maybe in this problem, the interatomic distance is given as the edge length, a=10 Angstrom.

Wait, no, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between the nearest atoms. So in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is different. Because in a cubic system, the nearest neighbor distance is a√2 / 2 for a face-centered cubic, but wait, no, that's for different structures.

Wait, perhaps in the simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a. So in this case, if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, then a would also be 10 Angstroms.

Wait, but wait, perhaps in the rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a√2, or something else.

Wait, if the crystal is a simple rhombohedral structure, each atom is at each corner of the rhombohedral cell. So each corner has 6 other atoms adjacent to it. Wait, no, in a simple cubic, each corner has 6 nearest neighbors, but in a rhombohedral, maybe the same applies.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me get back to the formula.

Another approach: The formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which is the same as before. So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So plugging in a=10, α=30°, cos(30)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660.

Denominator inside sqrt: 3 + 2*(1+1+1) * 0.8660.

Wait, 2*(3) *0.866 = 6 * 0.866 ≈5.196.

So 3 +5.196 =8.196. Square root is approx 2.8648.

So d=10/2.8648 ≈3.49 Angstroms.

But the options are 8.95, 9.08, etc. So this can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Maybe I should use a different formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α) )

Which is same as before. So same calculation as before.

But the result is around 3.49, which is not among the options. So perhaps I have misunderstood the initial parameters.

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. What's the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral structure?

In a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the edge length a. But in a rhombohedral structure, maybe the interatomic distance is a√(2/3) or something else?

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral structure is a√2. Because in a simple cubic, each atom has 6 nearest neighbors, each along cube edges, but in a rhombohedral, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is along face diagonals, which would be a√2.

Wait, but if the interatomic distance (nearest neighbor) is 10 Angstroms, then the edge length a would be 10 / sqrt(2) ≈7.071 Angstrom.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me think. Suppose the nearest neighbor distance is D=10 Angstrom. Then, in a simple cubic, D =a. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the nearest neighbor is along a different direction.

Wait, rhombohedral structures can be viewed as a cube with all edges equal but with angles not 90 degrees. The nearest neighbor distance depends on the arrangement. For a simple rhombohedral structure, each atom is at a corner of the rhombohedron, and the nearest neighbors are along the edges. So the distance would be a, the edge length. So D = a.

So in this case, a=10 Angstrom.

But that brings us back to the initial calculation leading to d=3.49, which is not an option. So something is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Another formula I've heard for rhombohedral systems is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (h +k + l)^2 (1 - cos α) )

Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which is same as I did earlier. So same result.

Wait, but if the answer options are all about 9 Angstrom, maybe my initial assumption about a is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length a. So a=10. Then the formula gives d=3.49, which is not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the length of the face diagonal. So in that case, a√2 =10. Then a=10/sqrt(2)=7.071.

So using a=7.071, then the denominator is 8.196 as before.

So d=7.071 / sqrt(8.196) ≈7.071 / 2.8648 ≈2.468 Angstroms. Still not matching options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe the formula isn't correct.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the volume of the unit cell and the relation to the interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps another way to compute d is through the use of the reciprocal lattice.

The reciprocal lattice vectors h, k, l are given by:

h = (h^* a^* ) / (a) in some fashion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the length of the reciprocal lattice vector.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is:

g = (h a^* + k b^* + l c^* )

Where a^*, b^*, c^* are the reciprocal basis vectors.

But in a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal basis vectors have a certain relationship.

Wait, for a rhombohedral lattice with a = b = c and angles alpha between them, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be expressed as:

a^* = (a sin α)/(a sin α) ) ... wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector g for (hkl) is:

|g| = sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ) ) / a²

Wait, wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

The magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector g is given by:

|g| = sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

But in this case, alpha=beta=gamma=30°, so cos γ = cos β = cos alpha = sqrt(3)/2.

So for (111):

|g| = sqrt(3 - 2*( (1*1 * cos 30) + (1*1 * cos 30) + (1*1 * cos 30) )) )

= sqrt(3 - 2*(3 * (sqrt(3)/2) ))

= sqrt(3 - 3*sqrt(3) )

Wait, but 3*sqrt(3) is about 5.196, so 3 -5.196 = -2.196. Taking the square root of a negative number is impossible, which suggests that this approach is wrong.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps the formula I used is incorrect.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α )

But wait, that would be for a 2D case, perhaps. Because in 2D, for a rhombus, the distance between planes (hkl) would involve h and k. But in 3D, perhaps it's more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system using the Miller indices and the angles between the lattice vectors.

The general formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (h² + k² + l²) [other terms involving cosines] )

Wait, perhaps I can find the correct formula by referring to the general equation for interplanar spacing in a cubic system with arbitrary angles. 

Wait, in a cubic system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 h k cos α + 2 h l cos β + 2 k l cos γ )

But in our case, alpha=beta=gamma=30°, so:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 h k cos 30 + 2 h l cos 30 + 2 k l cos 30 )

For (111), h=k=l=1.

So:

d = a / sqrt( 3 + 2*(1*1 * cos 30)*3 )

Wait, because hk + hl + kl = 3 terms each with coefficient 2 cos 30.

So:

Denominator inside sqrt: 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So same as before, sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.8648.

d = a / 2.8648.

But a is 10 Angstroms, so d=10/2.8648≈3.49 Angstroms. But options are all around 9.

So I'm definitely doing something wrong here. What's the correct approach?

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance isn't a=10 Angstroms, but the nearest neighbor distance is 10 Angstroms.

In a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance depends on the arrangement. For example, in a simple cubic, nearest neighbor distance is a√2 (if it's face-centered) or a (if it's simple cubic). But in a rhombohedral structure, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor is along the edge, so a=10. But in a face-centered cubic, it's a√2/2.

Wait, maybe in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a√(something). Let me think.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the structure is similar to a cube but with angles. The nearest neighbor distance would be along the edges, so a=10 Angstroms.

So again, the same issue arises.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to a hexagonal close-packed structure, but no, the question is about rhombohedral.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the formula d = a / [ (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ]^0.5.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to d=3.49.

But the options are way higher, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different for rhombohedral. Maybe it's (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ) in the denominator, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should find a different approach. Another idea: use the volume of the unit cell and the relation with the interplanar distance.

The volume of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is a³ * sqrt(1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) )

So for a=10, alpha=30 degrees, cos alpha=√3/2.

So volume V = 1000 * sqrt(1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*(3√3/8) )

Wait, let's compute inside the square root:

1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*(3√3/8) = 1 - 9/4 + (3√3)/4.

1 is 4/4, so 4/4 -9/4 = -5/4.

So sqrt( (-5/4) + (3√3)/4 )

Hmm, but this is sqrt of a negative number plus a positive. Let me compute numerically.

√3 ≈1.732, so 3√3 ≈5.196.

So (3√3)/4 ≈1.299.

So inside the sqrt: (-1.25) +1.299≈0.049.

So sqrt(0.049)≈0.2214.

So volume V≈1000 *0.2214≈221.4 Å³.

But I'm not sure how this relates to the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between the volume and the interplanar distance.

But I'm not sure. Maybe this is a dead end.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - (h +k +l)^2 (1 - cos α) )

Wait, trying this for (111):

Denominator: 3 - (3)^2 (1 - cos 30) = 3 - 9*(1-0.8660).

1-0.8660=0.134. 9*0.134≈1.206.

So 3 -1.206=1.794.

sqrt(1.794)≈1.339.

d=10/1.339 ≈7.47 Angstroms. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around: denominator is (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos alpha).

Wait, let's try that.

Denominator: 3 - 2*(3)(1 - 0.8660) =3 -6*(0.134)=3 -0.804=2.196.

sqrt(2.196)=1.482.

d=10/1.482≈6.74 Angstroms. Still not matching options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm out of options. Maybe I should think that I made a mistake in the formula and the correct approach is to use a different formula.

Wait, wait! Another thought: maybe the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) ) * cos(alpha/2)

Wait, I don't know. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the rhombohedral system, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + (hk + hl + kl) * (sqrt(3)) )

But this is just a guess.

Wait, for (111), that would be:

3 + (3)*sqrt(3) ≈3+5.196=8.196.

Again, same denominator as before. So same result.

Thus, perhaps the correct answer is around 3.49, but none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not a=10, but the diagonal of the rhombohedron.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between the centers of adjacent atoms.

Wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, the unit cell has atoms at each corner. Each corner is shared among multiple cells, but the nearest neighbor distance is the edge length, a.

So, a=10.

Wait, but then why is the calculation leading to d=3.49, which isn't an option.

Alternative idea: perhaps the formula used is wrong. Let me look for another source.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + (h +k +l)^2 (cos α / (1 - cos α)) )

Wait, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in a hexagonal system and see if it applies here.

In a hexagonal system, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2 h k cos α )

But that's for a hexagonal system, which is different from rhombohedral.

Alternatively, perhaps for rhombohedral, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which is the same as earlier. So same result.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the interplanar distance formula in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2*(h +k +l)^2 (1 - cos α) )

Wait, testing for (111):

h=k=l=1, so h +k +l=3.

Denominator:

3 - 2*(9)(1 - cos 30°) =3 - 18*(0.134).

0.134 *18=2.412.

3-2.412=0.588.

sqrt(0.588)≈0.767.

d=10/0.767≈13.04. Not matching.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Let me think if maybe I messed up the formula's denominator.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2*(h +k +l)^2 cos α )

Wait, for (111), h +k +l =3.

Denominator:

3 - 2*(9) * cos 30 =3 - 18*(0.866) =3 -15.588 =-12.588.

Negative inside sqrt, which is impossible. So no.

Another approach: perhaps the formula for d in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a√( (h² +k² +l²) ) / sqrt( ... ) ?

No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another formula. Maybe using the Bravais lattice approach.

In a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is primitive, and the volume is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α ), as I computed earlier.

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is related to the volume and the area of the plane.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for a. Maybe a is not 10 Angstroms, but something else. The question states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the edge length a is the interatomic distance, so a=10.

Thus, perhaps the correct calculation is d=3.49, but that's not an option.

Wait, the options are:

A)9.08

B)8.95

C)9.54

D)10.05

Hmm. All around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps I should reconsider.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, for (111):

Denominator inside sqrt: 3 - 6*(0.866) =3 -5.196= -2.196. Negative, so impossible.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which for (111) would be:

3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. Negative, no solution.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the angles given are the angles between the crystallographic axes, which are 30 degrees each. But in reality, the angles between the lattice vectors could be different because in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the lattice vectors are determined by the structure.

Wait, but the question states that the angles alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, so I'm using that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator correctly.

Wait, wait, let me recompute the denominator in the formula: 

Denominator = h² + k² + l² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha)

h=k=l=1.

So:

3 + 2*(3)*cos(30) =3 +6*(0.8660)=3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.8648.

Then d=10/2.8648≈3.49.

But the options are around 9, so perhaps the correct approach is to invert the formula.

Wait, wait, perhaps I have the reciprocal.

Wait, no, the formula is d= a / sqrt(...), so if a=10, d≈3.49.

But the options are about 9, which is roughly 3 times larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and it's actually the reciprocal.

Wait, if d= sqrt(...)/a, but that would give d=2.8648/10=0.286, which is even smaller.

No, that can't be.

Alternative idea: perhaps the given interatomic distance is the diagonal of the rhombohedron.

Wait, the space diagonal of a cube is a√3. So if the space diagonal is 10, then a=10/√3≈5.7735.

Then, for (111), denominator same as before: 3 +6*cos(30)=8.196.

d=5.7735/2.8648≈2.016.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is along the face diagonal, which in a cube is a√2.

So if face diagonal is 10, a=10/√2≈7.071.

Then d=7.071/2.8648≈2.468 Angstroms.

Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that can't be. So I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the interplanar distance in reciprocal space, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, if the denominator is 8.196, then 1/d= sqrt(8.196)/10 ≈2.8648/10=0.286.

But that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / [sqrt( h² +k² +l² ) * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 alpha) ) ]

But testing this:

sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 -3*(0.866)^2 )

= sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 - 3*(0.75) )

= sqrt(3) * sqrt(1-2.25)=sqrt(3)*sqrt(-1.25) → imaginary. So no.

Wait, maybe the formula involves the volume of the unit cell.

Volume V=a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha )

So V=1000 * sqrt(1 -3*(3/4) + 2*(3√3/8) )

=1000 * sqrt(1 - 9/4 + (3√3)/4 )

=1000 * sqrt( (4 -9 + 3√3)/4 )

=1000 * sqrt( (-5 +3√3)/4 )

Compute numerator: -5 +3*1.732≈-5+5.196=0.196.

So sqrt(0.196 /4 )=sqrt(0.049)=0.2214.

V=1000 *0.2214≈221.4 Å³.

But how does this help me with d?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is related to the volume via the formula involving the Miller indices and some other factors, but I'm not recalling the exact relation.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the volume can be used with the plane's (hkl) to find d.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Another approach: perhaps the formula is d = a / (sqrt( h² +k² +l^2 ) * sqrt(1 - cos^2 alpha) )

But for (111):

sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 - (3/4))=sqrt(3) * sqrt(1/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

d=10/(0.866)≈11.547. Not matching options.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should try to compute the reciprocal lattice vector magnitude and take its reciprocal.

In the reciprocal lattice, the magnitude of the reciprocal vector is |g|=sqrt( (h a* )^2 + (k b* )^2 + (l c* )^2 + ... )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, a*=a/(a^2 sin α) ) or something.

Alternatively, the reciprocal lattice vectors for a rhombohedral system can be defined in terms of the original lattice vectors.

But perhaps I'm getting into too deep.

Wait, perhaps I should just calculate 10 divided by sqrt(8.196), which is about 3.49, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the angles in the formula are different. Maybe I should use 2α instead of alpha.

Wait, let me think: if the angles between the vectors are 30 degrees, then in the formula, I should use that angle. So perhaps the formula is correct.

But the calculation leads to 3.49, which is not an option. So I must have misunderstood the initial setup.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms along the (111) direction, not along the edges.

Hmm. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the distance between atoms in the (111) direction would be the sum of the vectors along each axis.

So displacement vector would be a + a + a, but with angles between them.

Wait, but the interatomic distance along (111) would be the magnitude of the vector sum.

But wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. So perhaps the vector sum is 10.

So let me compute that.

The displacement vector from one corner to the opposite corner (111) in a rhombohedral system is:

r = a (e1 + e2 + e3 )

But the angle between each pair of vectors is 30 degrees.

So the magnitude squared is:

r² = a² ( |e1|² + |e2|² + |e3|² + 2 e1·e2 + 2 e1·e3 + 2 e2·e3 )

Since each e is a unit vector, |e1|²=1, same for e2 and e3.

So:

r² = a² (3 + 2( cos α + cos α + cos α) ) = a² (3 + 6 cos α )

Given that r=10, so:

100 = a² (3 + 6 * cos 30 )

cos 30=√3/2≈0.8660.

So 3 +6*0.8660=3 +5.196=8.196.

So a²=100 /8.196 ≈12.20.

So a= sqrt(12.20)=3.49 Angstroms.

Wait, but earlier I thought a=10. So if the interatomic distance is along the (111) direction, then a is about 3.49 Angstroms.

But in that case, when I compute d for (111), it would be:

d = a / sqrt(3 +6 * cos 30 ) = 3.49 / sqrt(8.196) =3.49/2.8648≈1.218 Angstroms.

But that's not matching the options either.

This is getting too confusing. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess.

Looking at the options, 9.08 is option A, which is close to 10*(sqrt(3)/sqrt(8.196)).

Wait, let's compute 10 * sqrt(3).

sqrt(3)=1.732, so 10 *1.732=17.32. But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, earlier I found that the denominator was sqrt(8.196)=2.8648.

But perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / sqrt( ... )

No, I don't think so.

Another idea: perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(h +k +l)^2 (1 - cos α) )

Wait, for (111), denominator inside sqrt:3 - 2*(9)(1 - 0.866)=3 - 18*(0.134)=3 - 2.412=0.588.

sqrt(0.588)=0.767.

d=10/0.767≈13.04. Not in options.

Hmm.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for the option closest to the in-correct calculation but scaled by a factor.

Wait, my calculation gave d≈3.49, which is about 1/2.86 of a.

Looking at the options, 9.08 is about 3.49 * 2.6, which is roughly 3*sqrt(3)/something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses 2 cos α instead of cos α.

Wait, trying that:

Denominator: 3 +6*(2*0.866)=3+10.392=13.392.

sqrt(13.392)=3.66.

d=10/3.66≈2.73. Still not matching.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and must conclude that the correct answer is not matching the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula for d is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) * (1/(1 + cos α) )

So for (111):

sqrt(3)=1.732.

1/(1 + cos 30)=1/(1 +0.866)=1/1.866≈0.5359.

So d=10/(1.732 *0.5359 )=10/(0.926 )≈10.79.

Still not matching options.

At this point, I'm really stuck. It's possible that I made a mistake in the initial formula, but I can't figure it out. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 10 / sqrt( (1+1+1) - 2*(1+1+1)*cos 30 )

That is, denominator=3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. Negative again, so no.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * 2 (1 - cos alpha) )

For (111):

Denominator=3 - (3)*2*(1 -0.866)=3 -3*2*0.134=3-0.804=2.196.

sqrt(2.196)=1.482.

d=10/1.482≈6.74. Still not matching.

I think I've tried every possible formula I can think of, but none of them lead to any of the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but since that's unlikely, I must have misunderstood the problem.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses 2*alpha instead of alpha.

Wait, for alpha=30 degrees, 2*alpha=60. Cos 60=0.5.

So denominator:3 +6*(0.5)=3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.082. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 10 * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / sqrt( ... )

Wait, 10 * sqrt(3) / something.

Wait, not sure.

Given that I can't find a correct approach, I'll have to make a guess based on the options. The only option that is close to three times the 3.49 I calculated is option C:9.54 Angstroms.

Wait, 3.49 * 2.74≈9.54. So perhaps the correct answer is C, 9.54.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:

\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha}}
\]

### Given Data:
- Interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \)
- Angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \)
- Miller indices \( h = k = l = 1 \)

### Calculation:
1. **Denominator inside the square root**:
   \[
   h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
   \]
   \[
   2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha = 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) \cos 30^\circ
   \]
   \[
   \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
   \]
   \[
   2(3) \cdot 0.866 = 6 \cdot 0.866 = 5.196
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total denominator} = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
   \]

2. **Square root of the denominator**:
   \[
   \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.8648
   \]

3. **Interplanar distance**:
   \[
   d = \frac{10}{2.8648} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
   \]

### Issue with the Result:
The calculated interplanar distance \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9–10 Å. This suggests a potential misunderstanding of the problem or a mismatch in the formula used.

### Reassessment:
Given the options (A: 9.08 Å, B: 8.95 Å, C: 9.54 Å, D: 10.05 Å), the calculated value of \( 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) is significantly smaller than all options. A plausible explanation is that the interatomic distance provided (10 Å) might not correspond directly to the edge length \( a \), but instead to another characteristic of the crystal structure, such as the space diagonal or face diagonal. However, this was not explicitly stated in the problem.

### Final Guess:
Since the calculated value does not align with the options, and no clear error in the formula was identified, the most reasonable approach is to select the option closest to the expected scale. Based on the options, **C: 9.54 Å** is the most plausible answer.
