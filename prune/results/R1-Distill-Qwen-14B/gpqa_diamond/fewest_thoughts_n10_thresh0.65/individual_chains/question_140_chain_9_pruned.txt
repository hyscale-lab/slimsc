Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs.

I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes. The options are given as A) 35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Let me break this down.

First, thinking about Substance X. It reacts violently with a liquid Y. Violent reactions could involve something like a strong acid reacting with a metal, but what else? Another possibility is a reaction between a metal and an acid to produce hydrogen gas.

Then, the gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think about possible gases. For example, if W is H2O, but that's not a gas under standard conditions. Maybe H2, but H2 has one proton and one neutron each, so total protons (2) and neutrons (2), so same number. But wait, H2's molecule has 2 H atoms, each with one proton and one neutron (if deuterium). So the molecule would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So same number. So W could be H2.

Wait, but H2 is a diatomic gas. So if W is H2, when X reacts with Y, a lot of H2 is released. So what reaction produces H2 gas? Maybe a metal reacting with an acid. So for example, a metal like magnesium or zinc reacting with an acid like HCl or sulfuric acid.

If X is a metal reacting with an acid, then Y is probably an acid. But then the precipitate G would form. Maybe an insoluble metal compound is formed. For example, if X is sodium (but sodium is light, but maybe a heavier isotope?), reacting with Y (like a nitrate or something) but wait, that
