Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's under the same conditions. Each particle can move along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's interesting because I remember wave functions can be complex numbers, but the square of the absolute value gives the probability density. 

The problem says that when they measured the position of the particles, none were found at x < 1 or x > 3. So all the particles are between x=1 and x=3. That must mean that the wave function is zero outside this region. Hmm, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that seems a bit odd because typically, wave functions are functions that are zero outside certain regions. But here, the wave function is given in a part of space where the particle exists, and it's non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the wave function is non-zero only in that interval.

Wait, but the wave function is a function of x. So for x <1 or x>3, the wave function must be zero. But the given expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So that can't be right everywhere. Oh wait, maybe the wave function is such that it's non-zero only between 1 and 3. So perhaps the given expression is valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

But in the problem statement, it says, "the wave function of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as..." So that part is where the particle exists, which is between x=1 and x=3. So outside, the wave function is zero.

So the wave function ψ(x) is:

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3,

and ψ(x) = 0 otherwise.

Wait, but that can't be right because the wave function is given as a function for where it exists, but the complex part suggests it's a standing wave or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is written in a certain form, but when we square it, the modulus must be normalized.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me think about normalization. The integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 must be 1 because it's a probability distribution.

So, the modulus squared is |ψ(x)|² = [ (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 ] because (a/sqrt(1+x)) is the real part and -0.5i is the imaginary part. So when you square the magnitude, it's (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. Wait, but the imaginary part is 0.5, so (0.5)^2 is 0.25. So the modulus squared is (a² / (1+x)) + 0.25.

Wait, but that seems a bit complicated because integrating that from 1 to 3 would give a combination of a squared term and a constant. So normalization would require setting the integral of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3 equal to 1.

Wait, but I thought ψ(x) is zero outside 1 and 3, so the integral is just from 1 to 3. Let me write that down:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

So let's compute that integral. The integral of a²/(1+x) dx is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. And the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So putting it together:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] + 0.5 = 1.

Wait, because ln(1+3)=ln(4), and ln(1+1)=ln(2). So subtracting, ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the equation becomes:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculating that, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7206.

Then, a = sqrt(0.7206) ≈ 0.848.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. So a is approximately 0.85.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I make a mistake in the setup? Let me check again.

Wait, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is [ (a/sqrt(1+x) )^2 + (0.5)^2 ] because for a complex number a+bi, the modulus squared is a^2 + b^2.

So, the integrand is a^2/(1+x) + 0.25.

Yes.

So integrating from 1 to 3:

Integral [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1-3 + ∫0.25 dx from 1-3.

The first integral is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(2) = 0.5.

So total is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.720.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.720) ≈ 0.848, which is approximately 0.85. So option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start with the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i, \quad \text{for } 1 \leq x \leq 3,
\]
and \( \psi(x) = 0 \) otherwise. The wave function must be normalized, meaning the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over all space must equal 1. Since \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 \), the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the integral
The integral splits into two parts:
1. \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \),
2. \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx \).

#### Part 1: \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)
\[
\int \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) + C.
\]
Evaluating from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \):
\[
a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

#### Part 2: \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx \)
\[
\int 0.25 dx = 0.25x + C.
\]
Evaluating from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \):
\[
0.25(3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Combine the results
The normalization condition becomes:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5.
\]
Solve for \( a^2 \):
\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

### Step 3: Approximate \( a \)
Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):
\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7206.
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7206} \approx 0.848.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest value to \( 0.848 \) among the options is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
