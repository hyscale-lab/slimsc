Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details right.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star doesn't have spots, the ratio decreases when spots are present. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—specifically, the ratio without spots compared to when it does have spots.

The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range, maybe. Since it's a specific wavelength, it's probably related to atomic transitions, which depend on temperature.

The problem says to assume local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), which simplifies things because I can use the Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations in two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is proportional to the exponential of the energy difference divided by kT. The formula is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T))

Where:
- n2 is the number of atoms in level 2,
- n1 is the number in level 1,
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels,
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature.

But wait, the question is about the ratio when the star doesn't have spots versus when it does. So I think the ratio when there are no spots (R0) is higher than when there are spots (R1), since the problem states the ratio decreases when spots are present.

So, the factor is R0 / R1.

Since the effective temperature changes when spots are present, I need to calculate the ratio of the ratios based on the temperatures.

Let me think about the effective temperatures. Without spots, Teff is 6000 K. With 40% spots covering, the overall Teff is 5500 K. 

But wait, the spots are cooler regions. So when spots are present, the star's overall photospheric temperature is lower. But how does that affect the ratio of Ti atoms in different energy levels?

Each region (spot and non-spot) emits at its own temperature. But when trying to find the overall line strength, it's more complicated. Alternatively, the problem might be simplifying by treating the entire photosphere as being at a uniform temperature when spots are present, which is 5500 K.

But wait, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the entire photosphere is now at 5500 K? Or is it a mix? Hmm, I think for the purpose of the problem, it's treated as a single temperature, even though in reality, spots are cooler and the rest is at higher temp.

Therefore, the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels depends on the temperature. So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower, so the ratio (n2/n1) will change.

Let me write down the ratios.

The ratio without spots (R0) is (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T0)), where T0 is 6000 K.

The ratio with spots (R1) is (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), where T1 is 5500 K.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is R0/R1 = exp( [ΔE/(k T1)] - [ΔE/(k T0)] )

Wait, let me compute this. Because R0
