Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question gives me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance, and the options are A to D with various values in meters.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula, if I recall right, is something like L = v * τ, where v is the velocity and τ is the proper lifetime. But how do I get τ from the given data?

Oh right, there's this thing called the mean lifetime which is connected to the particle's width. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, I should double-check the units. Γ is given in MeV, which is energy. And ħ has units of GeV·s (since ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s when using natural units). 

So first, I need to convert Γ from MeV to GeV. Because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, Γ is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Now, τ = ħ / Γ. Let me plug in the numbers. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s. Let me calculate that: 6.582 / 0.32 is around 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s. That's 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, wait, 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875? Let me check: 0.32 * 20 is 6.4, 0.32 * 20.5 = 6.56. Oh wait, 0.32 * 20.56875 = 6.582. Right, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s? Wait, no. 20.56875e-25 is the same as 2.056875e-24, because 20.56875 × 1e-25 = 2.056875 × 1e-24. Right.

So τ is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Next, I need to find the velocity v of the meson. How do I get that? Well, the meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, and its rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So I can use the relativistic energy equation: E = γ m c². Wait, but when working in natural units (where c=1 and ħ=1), the energy is just E = γ m. So γ is E / m. So γ = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

Then, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²) → v = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let's compute that.

Compute 1/γ²: 1/(6.6667)^2 = 1/(44.4444) ≈
