Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and another reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, they typically form cyanohydrins. Cyanohydrin formation involves adding a cyanide nucleophile to the carbonyl group. The mechanism usually involves the base deprotonating the alpha hydrogen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, then the cyanide attacks. Wait, but sometimes the conditions are acidic. Let me think.

In the first step, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form a cyanohydrin. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me draw it.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So the carbonyl is in the middle. The cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl carbon, adding CN- to it. Then the oxygen would get a negative charge, which would protonate. But wait, in an acidic or basic condition?

I think that the formation of a cyanohydrin usually occurs under acidic conditions. Because, in the presence of acid, the carbonyl oxygen gets protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- (from NaCN) attacks, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin. So for the first reaction, A should be an acid, like H3O+.

Looking at the options, option A has A as H3O+
