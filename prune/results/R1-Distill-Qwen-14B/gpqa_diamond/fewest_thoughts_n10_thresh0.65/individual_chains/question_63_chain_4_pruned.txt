Okay, so I've got a problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon, which causes it to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon. The options are given, so I should probably figure out what formula or principle applies here.

Wait, the model mentioned is the non-rigid rotor model, but I also remember something about the quantum harmonic oscillator for vibrations. Oh right, the quantum rotation-vibration model probably combines both rotational and vibrational energy states.

So, the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? When it absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next state. But what's the next state? I think the next state would be the first excited state, which would be the lowest energy state of the next higher vibrational or rotational level.

Wait, no, the question says the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so transitions can involve both vibrational and rotational changes. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule would transition to the lowest energy state that's higher than the current one. That could be either a vibrational or rotational transition, whichever requires less energy.

Wait, but in the quantum harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and equally spaced for vibrations. So the energy spacing between vibrational levels is ΔE_vib = h ν, where ν is the frequency. For the rigid rotor model,
