Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting, which means we need to figure out which planet is more likely to pass in front of its star from our point of view.

Both planets were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. So, we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But the key here is the transit probability. Wait, how does the transit probability depend on the orbital parameters?

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is related to the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. Specifically, the probability is approximately R_star / a, where R_star is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis (orbital radius) of the planet. Oh wait, no, wait—no, that's not exactly right. The transit probability P is proportional to (R_star / a), but I think it's actually (R_star / a) multiplied by some other factors, like the inclination. No, wait, no, the RV method already tells us the mass and the period, but the inclination is not known. Oh wait, the RV method gives the minimum mass because it depends on the inclination. So for transit, we need the planet's orbit to be edge-on, which is a specific orientation. The probability of that is related to the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, I think.

Wait, the transit probability (P) is proportional to (R_star / a) * (something else?), maybe (R_star / a) multiplied by the ratio of the planet's orbital speed. Or perhaps just (R_star / a) multiplied by the solid angle or something. Let me think. Oh wait, the probability of a transit is given by the formula:

P = (R_star / a) * (something about the orbital plane). Oh wait, actually, the exact probability is:

P = (R_star / a) * (some function of the inclination). Wait, but in reality, when you have a random inclination, the probability that the planet transits (i.e., the inclination is 90 degrees) is (R_star / a). Wait, no, that's not correct because the transit happens only when the orbital plane's inclination is such that the planet passes in front of the star. The probability is actually the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, multiplied by (1 / (1 - e²))^(1/2), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), that term is 1. So P = R_star / a.

Wait, no, wait—wait. I might have confused the exact formula. Let me think again. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit results in a transit is approximately (R_star / a). Because the transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability of that alignment is the ratio of the star's diameter (2R_star) to the planet's orbital diameter (2a), but I'm not sure.

Wait, so the geometric probability of a transit is roughly (R_star / a). Because for a planet to transit, the planet must lie within the cone of our line of sight that passes through the star. The area that allows transit is a circle on the sky with radius R_star (the star's radius), while the total possible area is a circle with radius a (the orbital radius). So the probability is approximately (R_star / a)²? Or is it (R_star / a)?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think geometrically. Imagine the star as a circle with radius R. The planet's orbit is a circle with radius a. The probability that the planet's position relative to the star, when viewed edge-on, causes it to pass in front is the ratio of the star's area to the planet's orbit area. But since the planet's orbit is much larger, maybe it's more about the angular size.

Alternatively, the geometric probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (1 + (M_planet / M_star))^(1/3)), but wait, no, that's for the RV method. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by the fraction of the orbit where the planet is in front of the star. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for the formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the geometric transit probability is:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / a 

But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, we can approximate it as R_star / a.

So the probability is roughly P = (R_star) / a.

So, in this problem, the probability depends on R_star and a (semi-major axis). But wait, we also have information about the orbital periods.

We know that the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P_2 / 3.

We can relate the orbital period to the semi-major axis using Kepler's third law. Kepler's law states that (P^2) / (a^3) = 4π²/(G(M_star + m_planet)) ). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_star + m_planet ≈ M_star.

So, a^3 is proportional to P^2 * M_star.

Wait, let me write it as a^3 = (G(M_star + m_planet) * P^2 ) / (4π² )

Since m_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate a^3 ≈ (G M_star P^2 ) / (4π² )

So, a is proportional to (M_star * P² )^(1/3 )

So a ∝ (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3 )

Now, for Planet_1 and Planet_2, we have:

P1 = P2 / 3

M_star1 = 2 * M_star2

So let's compute a1 and a2.

a1 ∝ (M_star1)^(1/3) * (P1)^(2/3 )

a1 = (2 M2)^(1/3) * ( (P2/3) )^(2/3 )

Similarly, a2 ∝ (M2)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3 )

So the ratio a1/a2 is [ (2)^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3) ) ] 

Which is the same as 2^{1/3} / (3^{2/3})

Simplify 2^{1/3} = cube root of 2 ≈ 1.26, 3^{2/3} is cube root of 9 ≈ 2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

Wait, but wait, no: Let me compute (2)^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3) ) = 2^{1/3} * (3^{-2})^{1/3} )= 2^{1/3} * 3^{-2/3 } ) = (2/3² )^{1/3} ) = (2/9 )^{1/3} ≈ cube root of (0.222) ≈ 0.6.

So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

Wait, but that's the ratio of a1 to a2. So a1 = 0.6 a2.

So for the transit probability P = R_star / a, since both stars have the same radius (the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same radius), R1 = R2 = R.

So P1 = R / a1 ≈ R / (0.6 a2) = (1/0.6) * (R/a2) ) = (5/3) P2.

Wait, because P2 is R/a2. So P1 = (1/0.6) * P2 = (5/3) P2 ≈ 1.666... times P2.

So Planet_1 has a transit probability about 1.66 times higher than Planet_2. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.

But wait, let me double-check the math. Let's compute a1 and a2 more precisely.

Given:

P1 = P2 /3

M1 = 2 M2

Thus, a1^3 = (G M1 P1² )/(4π² ) = (G * 2 M2 * (P2/3)² ) / (4π² )

a2^3 = (G M2 P2² )/(4π² )

So a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (2 M2) * (P2² / 9) ) ] / [ M2 * P2² ) ] = (2/9) * (M2 P2²) / ( M2 P2² ) ) = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

Compute (2/9)^(1/3 ): 2/9 ≈ 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

Thus, a1 is smaller than a2. So the semi-major axis of Planet_1 is smaller than that of Planet_2.

So R_star is same for both, so P1 = R / a1, P2 = R / a2.

So P1 = R/(0.606 a2) = (1/0.606) * (R/a2) = 1.648 * (R/a2) = 1.648 P2.

Which is approximately 1.65 times higher than P2.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option A and B are about Planet_2. Option D is 2.7 times which is too high.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the star's radius and \( a \) is the planet's semi-major axis. The researchers aim to observe the planet with the higher transit probability.

### Key Information:
1. **Orbital Periods**: \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \).
2. **Star Masses**: \( M_{\text{star,1}} = 2 M_{\text{star,2}} \).
3. **Star Radii**: Both stars have the same radius, \( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \).

### Step 1: Relating Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period
Using Kepler's Third Law, \( a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} P^2 \), we find the ratio of the semi-major axes:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_{\text{star,1}} P_1^2}{M_{\text{star,2}} P_2^2} \right)^{1/3}.
\]
Substituting \( M_{\text{star,1}} = 2 M_{\text{star,2}} \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \):
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 a_2 \).

### Step 2: Transit Probability
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius, the probability ratio is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1}}{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}.
\]
Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.606 a_2 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]
Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Conclusion:
The researchers should prefer observing Planet_1, as it has a ~1.65 times higher probability of transiting. This matches option **C**.
