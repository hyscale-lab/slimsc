Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused about how to approach it. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I recall is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So if plx increases, the distance decreases.

Wait, let me think again. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / d (in parsecs). So d = 1/plx. So if distance d increases, plx decreases. Got it.

Now, the problem says that the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let's write that as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, substituting that in, 1/plx is d. So 1/(plx)^5 would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, no, substituting plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. So 1/(plx^5) is (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, maybe I should think about how N changes as a function of distance. So, if N ∝ d^5, then the number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

Wait, but the options are about the change per unit range of distance. Oh, right, so the question is about the density or the rate of change. So maybe I need to find how many stars are there in a thin shell at a distance r, or how the number increases per unit distance.

Wait, another approach: the observed number of stars as a function of parallax is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance r (since plx = 1/r in parsecs). So substituting plx = 1/r, then N = k * (r)^5, where k is some constant. So the number of stars is proportional to
