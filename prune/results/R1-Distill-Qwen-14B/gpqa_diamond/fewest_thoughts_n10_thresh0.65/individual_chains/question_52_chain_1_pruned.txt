Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. I remember something about the Boltzmann equation and how temperature affects the distribution of atoms in different energy levels.

Right, when the star has spots, its effective temperature decreases. So in this case, without spots, the Teff is 6000 K, and when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that affect the photosphere where the Ti atoms are?

The problem says that the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. The ratio is n1/n2, and it's lower when the star has spots.

I think the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The equation is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. That must be the photon emitted when an electron moves between these two levels. So the energy difference E2 - E1 would be related to the photon's energy. Let me think, E = hc/λ. So I can calculate the energy difference between the two levels.

Wait, but the temperatures given are for the photosphere. When the star has spots, the overall effective temperature is lower, so each spot's temperature would be lower too, or maybe the unspotted areas are hotter? No, wait, spots are cooler regions. Because when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower, so I think the spots themselves are regions with lower temperature than the rest of the photosphere.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the spots have a lower Teff, say T_spot, and the rest (60%) is at
