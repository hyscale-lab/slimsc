Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when objects are moving at speeds comparable to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics; we have to apply Einstein's theory of relativity.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, I think about relative velocity in special relativity. I recall that the formula to find the relative speed between two objects moving at speeds u and v is different from the classical addition. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Since both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed will be the difference in their speeds divided by that factor.

Let me plug in the numbers. So u is 0.6c, and v is 0.5c. So the numerator would be 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 minus (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Let's calculate that denominator: (0.3c²)/c² is 0.3, so 1 - 0.3 is 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. That matches one of the answer options.

Next, I need to calculate the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, so I'll compute each individually and then add them. The relativistic energy formula is E = γmc², where γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For the first astronaut (2m) moving at 0.6c:
γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So their energy E1 is γ1 * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the astronaut's mass is 2m, so E1 = γ * (2m) c². So plugging in γ1 is 1.25, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Similarly, for the second astronaut (3m) at 0.5c:
γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = γ2 * 3m c². Let's compute that: 1.1547 * 3 = approximately 3.464. So E2 ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2 gives total energy E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c². Hmm, looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which is very close to this value. Option D says 5mc², which is lower, so probably not.

Looking back at the options:
Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc²
Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc²

So the relative speed I calculated is approximately 0.14c, which matches both C and D. But the energy calculation gives around 5.96 mc², so the correct option would be C.

Wait, but let me double-check the energy calculation because sometimes I might mix up the mass. Oh, wait: the first astronaut's mass is 2m, so E1 = γ1 * (2m) c². So γ1 is 1.25, so 1.25 * 2 is 2.5, so E1 is 2.5 mc². Second astronaut: 3m and γ2 is about 1.1547. So γ2 *3 = 3.464, so E2 is 3.464 mc². Total is 2.5 +3.464=5.964, which rounds to 5.96 mc². So option C is correct for the energy.

So the relative speed is about 0.14c, and the energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C matches both. Option D has the same relative speed but wrong energy.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The formula for the relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A:** Incorrect. The relative speed \( 1.1c \) is not possible, as it exceeds the speed of light.
- **Option B:** Incorrect. The relative speed \( 0.1c \) is incorrect, and the total energy \( 4.96m c^2 \) does not match the calculation.
- **Option C:** Correct. The relative speed \( 0.14c \) matches the calculation, and the total energy \( 5.96m c^2 \) is consistent with the result.
- **Option D:** Incorrect. While the relative speed \( 0.14c \) is correct, the total energy \( 5m c^2 \) is too low compared to the calculated value.

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy is \( 5.96m c^2 \). These values match **Option C**.
