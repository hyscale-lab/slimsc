Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and honestly, I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state.

Let me break down what I know. 

So, the molecule is made of atoms X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Hmm, when a photon is absorbed, it causes a transition between energy states. But in the context of molecules, this could involve both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." I think that refers to the next higher energy state. Since it's the fundamental state, that's the lowest energy state in vibration and rotation. But wait, the fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0 or J=1, depending on the specifics, but for diatomic molecules, the ground state is J=0 for rotation).

Wait, but in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational
