Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The scenario is that a chemist found an unknown white solid and wants to identify it using spectral data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one fits the given spectral information.

The data given includes mass, IR, and 1H NMR spectra. Let me break down each part and see what I can deduce.

Starting with the mass spectrometry. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 and it's 100%, which means the molecular weight is 156 g/mol. There's also a peak at m/z 158 with 32%, which is likely due to a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has two main isotopes: Cl-35 (~75%) and Cl-37 (~25%). So the molecular ion at 156 and the M+2 peak at 158 would indicate the presence of a Cl in the molecule. The abundance of 32% for the M+2 peak makes sense because 156 would be the Cl-35, and 158 would be Cl-37. So that suggests there's one Cl atom in the molecule.

Next, the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak could mean either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, but wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300. The peak here is from 3500-2700, which is a bit lower than typical for OH in alcohols but could also be a carboxylic acid. Another strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Where do we see that? Carboxylic acids have a peak around 1700, but sometimes a bit higher. Also, esters, ketones, aldehydes, and maybe other carbonyl compounds. But the presence of a broad O-H could point towards a carboxylic acid.

Now the 1H NMR. Let's look at the signals:

- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H): That's a very high chemical shift. Typically, that's a carboxylic acid proton. Aldehydic protons are also around 9-10, but this is higher, so more likely a carboxylic acid. The singlet suggests no neighboring protons, which would make sense for a carboxylic acid where the -OH is attached to the carbon, so no adjacent H.

- 8.02 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet, integrating for two protons. That's usually indicative of aromatic protons, possibly in a para-substituted position. Like in a para-substituted benzene ring, each pair of H in the ortho and para positions can show up as doublets.

- 7.72 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, again two protons. This could be the other pair of aromatic protons, maybe in the meta position relative to substituents.

Putting this together, the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. If we have two doublets each integrating for two H, that's typical of a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. So, for example, two substituents in the para positions, each causing the neighboring H to be deshielded and appear as doublets.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's see. That structure has a hydroxyl group (OH) and a chloro group at positions 2 and 3, and an aldehyde group. Wait, no, the formula would be OHC-6-CHCl-OH? Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Wait, 2-hydroxy-3-chlorobenzaldehyde would have the OH at position 2, Cl at 3, and aldehyde at position 1. But then the aromatic protons would be in positions 4 and 6 as H's. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a 2-hydroxy-3-chlorobenzaldehyde. But in any case, the NMR would have an aldehyde proton, which is usually around 9-10 ppm. But our NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm, which is higher than typical for aldehydes. So maybe it's more like a carboxylic acid.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl attached to the benzene ring in the para position, and a carboxylic acid group (COOH) on another position. Wait, benzene rings are symmetric, so if the substituents are in para positions, wait, no. Wait, benzoic acid has the COOH group attached directly to the benzene. So 4-chlorobenzoic acid would have Cl in the para position relative to the COOH group. So the structure would be Cl attached to the benzene ring in the position opposite to the COOH group.

So, the aromatic protons would be in the ortho and meta positions relative to the COOH group, but wait, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the Cl is in the para position. So the substituents are COOH and Cl at positions 1 and 4. Wait, no. Let me think: benzene is a six-membered ring. Benzoic acid has the COOH group at position 1. 4-chlorobenzoic acid would have Cl at position 4, which is the para position relative to the COOH. So the adjacent positions (2 and 6) would each have H, but the substituents in 2 and 6 would be H's. 

Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4. Then, the remaining positions (2,3,5,6) would have H's. But in such a case, the H in position 2 would be adjacent to both COOH (position 1) and Cl (position 4)? No, position 4 is across from position 1, so position 2 is ortho to position 1 and meta to position 4, perhaps.

Wait, I might be getting the substituents wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the NMR signals. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. So positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Positions 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

In such a case, the aromatic protons would typically split into two sets. For example, the protons in positions 2 and 6 might be deshielded and show up as a doublet, and those in 3 and 5 could be another doublet. Alternatively, maybe they're all as a doublet of doublets, but perhaps in this case, with substituents in para, the coupling could be such that we get two doublets each integrating for 2H.

Let's look at the NMR given: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). So for a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions, the neighboring Hs would be in positions that are ortho to one substituent and maybe meta to another, but perhaps the coupling would result in two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That might fit.

The other option is phenyl chloro
