Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The molecule given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, let's break that down. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene means it's a norbornene structure, right? So norbornene is a bicyclic compound with two rings: a five-membered and a six-membered ring. The 'hept' part tells me it's seven-membered in total, but with the bicyclo structure, so two rings.

The substituents are 2-vinyl and 2-azabicyclo. Wait, no, the formula is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the bicyclo system has a nitrogen in the 2-position, and a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) also at the 2 position. So the structure would have a bridge with a nitrogen, and a double bond at position 5.

Wait, norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, right? So in this case, the structure is similar but with a substituent. So the 2 position has both the nitrogen and the vinyl group. Oh wait, wait, no. The bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene would have the double bond between carbons 5 and 6 (if we number the bridgehead as 1 and 4, as given by the stereo descriptors 1S and 4R). So the double bond is at position 5.

So the molecule is a norbornene with a bridgehead at 1 (S configuration) and 4 (R configuration). At position 2, there's an azabicyclo part—so that's a nitrogen in the ring, making it a heterocycle. And also at position 2, a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-).

So the structure would have the nitrogen in a bridge, and a vinyl group attached to the same carbon. Now, when this undergoes a Cope rearrangement, what happens?

Wait, the Cope
