Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my black hole thermodynamics, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. We need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy.

Wait, right, the event horizon's angular size relates to its radius. I remember that the angular size θ (in radians) is approximately the ratio of the size of the object to the distance. So θ ≈ r / d. But we have to convert degrees to radians first.

Oh right, to convert degrees to radians, multiply by π/180. So θ in radians is (10^-17 degrees) * (π/180). That's a very small angle.

Let me compute that. 10^-17 * π / 180 ≈ 10^-17 * 1.745e-2 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. So θ ≈ 1.745e-19 rad.

Then, the radius r would be θ * d. But wait, d is in parsecs. I need to convert it to meters. 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So r = θ * d = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m. Let's compute that. 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 ≈ 1.745 *3.086 * 1e7 ≈ 5.38e7 meters. So the radius is about 5.38e7 meters.

Wait, the radius of the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is r_s = 2 G M / c². So we can solve for M, the mass. M = (r_s c²) / (2 G).

Plugging in the numbers: r_S is about 5.38e7 m.

So M = (5.38e7 m * (3e8 m/s)^2 ) / (2 * 6.67e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² )

Calculating numerator: 5.38e7 * 9e16 = 5.38e7 * 9e16 = 4.842e24.

Denominator: 2 *6.67e-11 ≈ 1.334e-10.

So M ≈ 4.842e24 / 1.334e-10 ≈ 3.63e34 kg.

Wait, that seems really large. Supermassive black holes usually have masses on the order of 1e6 to 1e10 solar masses. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 5.38e7 meters is 5.38e7 m. Let me compute the Schwarzschild radius again. The formula is r_s = 2 G M / c². So M = (r_s c²)/(2 G).

r_s is 5.38e7 meters, so c squared is (3e8)^2=9e16. So numerator is 5.38e7 *9e16 = 4.842e24.

Divide by 2 G: 2*6.67e-11 =1.334e-10. So 4.842e24 /1.334e-10 = 3.63e34 kg. Hmm, wait, the Sun's mass is about 2e30 kg. So 3.63e34 kg is 3.63e4 solar masses. That's like 36,000 solar masses. But supermassive black holes are millions to billions. So maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait. Let's double-check the calculation for r. Oh wait, I think I confused the order of magnitude when calculating θ in radians.

Wait, the angular size θ is 1e-17 degrees. Let me calculate θ in radians again.

θ (radians) = 1e-17 degrees * (π radians / 180 degrees) ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-1
