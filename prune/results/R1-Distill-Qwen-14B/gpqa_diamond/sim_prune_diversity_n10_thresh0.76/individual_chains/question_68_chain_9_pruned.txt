Okay, so I have this physics problem about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. 

The problem says the particle has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. So mu = γ S_z, right? And initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. We need to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes too. Oh right, the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. Since μ is γ S_z and B is along Z first, then Y.

Initially, when B is along Z, the system is in an eigenstate of S_z. So the state would be either |↑⟩ or |↓⟩. But when B is switched to Y, the magnetic field direction changes, so the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, no. The magnetic field is B, so perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y. Because μ = γ S, so H = -μ·B = -γ B S·n, where n is the direction of B. So when B is along Y, H = -γ B S_y.

But wait, spin matrices. Oh right, the spin matrices for S_x, S_y, S_z. The energy eigenstates for H = a S_y would be the eigenstates of S_y. So the initial state, which is an eigenstate of S_z, is not an eigenstate of S_y. So when the field is changed, the state will evolve over time according to the new Hamiltonian.

But wait, the question is about the time dependence of the expectation value of S_z. So the expectation value of S_z will oscillate over time because the state is in a superposition with respect to the new Hamiltonian's eigenstates.

I think the frequency of oscillation is related to the energy difference between the states. The energy levels are E = ± (1/2) γ B ℏ? Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Spin 1/2 particles have S =
