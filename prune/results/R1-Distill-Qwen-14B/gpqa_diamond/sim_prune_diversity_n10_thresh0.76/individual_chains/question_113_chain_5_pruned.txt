Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The possible formulas are four different options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Let me look at each piece of data one by one and see what they imply about the structure.

First, the FTIR data. It has a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching. So maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid or something with an -OH group. Also, two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, those are in the range of carbonyl groups. 1700 is typical for a carbonyl like a ketone or aldehyde, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring (like conjugated carbonyl) or maybe an ester or something else. Wait, 1650 is a bit lower than 1700. Maybe it's an ester or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in a ketone with some electron-withdrawing groups nearby. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with a carbonyl, like in an aromatic ester or ketone.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has a double bond. So perhaps an alkene is present.

Then the mass spectrum has a fragment at m/z 45. I remember that 45 is often indicative of certain structures. Let me think. The formula for that fragment could be C3H7O or something else. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of, say, (CH3)2O (which is 31, no), or maybe a ketene? Alternatively, for the fragment, perhaps it's a CH2O group or something else. Alternatively, 45 could be the molecular ion of a smaller molecule, like if the compound breaks into a fragment with molecular weight 45. Let me think about the possible formulas. The options given are all C6H...O or O2. So maybe the fragment corresponds to a part of the molecule.

Let me consider each possible formula and see which fits.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2
Possible structures: esters, maybe diols, or something with two oxygen-containing functional groups. Esters typically have a carbonyl and an oxygen. Also, the double bond would fit into an ester perhaps.

B) C6H10O
This is a smaller molecule in terms of hydrogens. Since it's C6H10O,
