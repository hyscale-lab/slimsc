Alright, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go. Let's read the question again.

We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we have to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed for this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A, B, C, D.

Okay, let's break this down. First, I think I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles because the acid's volume will depend on that. Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, so dissolving it in an acid should cause a neutralization reaction. The acid will react with the hydroxide to produce water and the corresponding salt.

The formula for Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)3. Let me calculate its molar mass. Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, and H is 1. So, Fe(OH)3 has 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

Wait, actually, wait: Fe(OH)3 has one Fe, three O, and three H. Wait, no, no, it's Fe(OH)3, so each molecule has Fe, 3 O, and 3 H. Wait, each OH- group is O and H. So, three OH groups mean three O and three H. So yeah, molar mass is 55.85 + 3*(16 +1) = 55.85 +3*17=106.85 g/mol.

So 0.1 grams is 0.1 / 106.85 moles. Let's compute that. 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. So about 9.36e-4 moles.

Now, when Fe(OH)3 dissolves in a strong acid, like HCl, the reaction is: Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O. So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of HCl.

So moles of HCl needed = 3 * 9.36e-4 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

But wait, the acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol per liter. Since 100 cm³ is 0.1 liters, the concentration is 0.1 M. So the volume of acid (V) needed is moles / concentration. So V = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm. But wait, none of the options directly match this. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So perhaps that's the volume needed. But wait, wait a second. Because when we dissolve Fe(OH)3, it's not just about the neutralization reaction. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, isn't it? It's not very soluble in water, but when you add an acid, it should dissolve. But since it's a weak base, maybe the reaction is more complicated? Or perhaps in this case, we can assume it reacts completely with the acid because it's a monobasic strong acid, and the reaction goes to completion.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum volume needed to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. So perhaps the calculation is correct as I did before.

So if 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 is ~0.000936 moles, then 3 moles of HCl are needed: 0.002808 moles. At 0.1 M, the volume is 28.08 cm³. So the closest option is C, which says 28.05 cm³. So that's about right.

Now, the second part is the pH of the resulting solution. So after adding the acid, we have FeCl3 in solution. FeCl3 is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base, so its solution should be acidic. So the pH will be less than 7.

Wait, FeCl3 dissociates into Fe^3+ and Cl^- ions. Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

So the pH depends on the concentration of Fe^3+ ions in solution. The total volume is 100 cm³, and we added 28.05 cm³ of acid. So the total volume is 100 + 28.05=128.05 cm³? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says 100 cm³ is the total volume. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.

"Prepare the solution" — the total volume is 100 cm³. So I think that when you add the acid, the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume of acid is V, and the solution's total volume is 100 cm³. So the concentration of Fe^3+ would be moles / 0.1 L.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the volume after dissolving, meaning that when you add the acid, the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume of acid (V) is such that V + 100 cm³ is the total volume? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let's re-express.

Wait, the question says: "dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution's total volume is 100 cm³. So when you add the acid, you're adding V cm³ of the acid, and the total volume becomes 100 cm³. Wait, that can't be, because adding V cm³ would make the total volume 100 cm³. So when you have V cm³ of acid, the total solution is 100 cm³. So the concentration after adding is based on 100 cm³.

Alternatively, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the total volume after adding the acid, meaning that the acid's volume is V, and the solution is V + (volume of Fe(OH)3 solution?), but I think the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. So perhaps when you dissolve it, the volume is 100 cm³, and the acid is added to that.

Wait, perhaps the initial solution is 100 cm³, and you add the acid to it. So the total volume after adding the acid would be more than 100, but that's not what the question says. The question says "in 100 cm³ total volume." So perhaps the solution's volume is 100 cm³, and the acid is added to that. So the volume of the acid is V, which when added, brings the total volume to 100 cm³. But that would mean that the initial solution (before adding acid) was 100 - V cm³. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial solution is 100 cm³, and the acid is added in V cm³, so the total volume is 100 + V cm³. But the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the total volume is 100 cm³, so the concentration calculations use 0.1 L.

So, after adding V cm³ of the acid, which is 0.1 M, the moles of HCl added are 0.1 * (V/1000) = 0.01 V / 100? Wait, no. Wait, 0.1 M is 0.1 moles per liter. So in V cm³ (which is V/1000 liters), the moles of HCl are 0.1 * (V/1000) = V/(10000) moles.

But wait, earlier calculation said that 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 moles of HCl are needed. So V must be such that 0.01 * V (in liters) is equal to 0.002808 moles.

Wait, 0.1 M * V (in liters) = 0.002808 moles. So V = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters = 28.08 cm³. So that's the volume of acid needed, which aligns with option C's 28.05 cm³.

So moving on to pH. After dissolving Fe(OH)3 in acid, we have FeCl3 in solution. FeCl3 dissociates into Fe^3+ and Cl^- ions. Cl^- is the conjugate base of a strong acid (HCl), so it doesn't hydrolyze. Fe^3+ is a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water.

The hydrolysis reaction is: Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+. So the solution will be acidic. The pH depends on the concentration of Fe^3+ and the hydrolysis constant.

First, calculate the concentration of Fe^3+ in the solution. The moles of Fe^3+ is the same as the moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.000936 moles. The total volume is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L. So concentration [Fe^3+] = 0.000936 / 0.1 = 0.00936 M.

Wait, wait. Because when we added V = 28.08 cm³ of acid, the total volume is 100 cm³, right? So the solution is 100 cm³.

So [Fe^3+] = 0.000936 / 0.1 = 0.00936 M.

But wait, wait. Because the acid (HCl) is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate. So the H+ from the acid will react with Fe(OH)3, but I think the moles of Fe^3+ will be 0.000936, and the H+ will be 3 times that (as per the reaction), but let me think again.

The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 produces 1 mole Fe^3+ and 3 moles H+.

Wait, but the H+ here comes from the acid. So the moles of H+ from the acid is 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3 (since 3 H+ per Fe(OH)3). So when we add the acid, it provides those H+ ions, which then react to dissolve the Fe(OH)3.

So after the reaction, the solution contains Fe^3+ and excess H+ from the acid.

Wait, but the question is about the pH of the resulting solution, which has Fe^3+ and excess H+.

Wait, but wait. When we add the acid, the H+ will react with Fe(OH)3. Let me consider the stoichiometry.

Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.000936 mol.

Moles of HCl added: 0.002808 mol.

The reaction is 1:3. So each Fe(OH)3 requires 3 H+ (from HCl) to dissolve.

So all the Fe(OH)3 will dissolve because we have exactly 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3.

So after the reaction, all the Fe(OH)3 is converted to Fe^3+ and water. So the solution contains Fe^3+ and any excess H+ from the acid.

Wait, but wait. Because HCl is a strong acid, all of it dissociates. The moles of H+ from HCl is 0.002808, which is exactly 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3 (0.000936 *3 = 0.002808). So all the H+ from HCl is consumed in the reaction. So after the reaction, there's no excess H+ from HCl.

But wait, wait a second. No, wait. Because Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups, when it reacts with H+:

Each Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So, 3 moles of H+ are consumed per mole of Fe(OH)3. The moles of H+ added from HCl are exactly 3 * moles Fe(OH)3. So all of the H+ is used up, and there's no excess H+.

Wait, but that can't be right because the solution would then only have Fe^3+ from the dissolved Fe(OH)3. But Fe^3+ is a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce H+.

So the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So the solution has [Fe^3+] = 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

Fe^3+ hydrolyzes as: Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+. The hydrolysis constant (K) can be found from the acid dissociation constant of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, the K for Fe(OH)3 is the third ionization constant of iron hydroxide. I'm not exactly sure of the value, but I think it's around 6.8 × 10^-36. Wait, that seems really small, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the K value for Fe(OH)3. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a weak acid in solution.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, but when it's dissolved in an acid, the Fe^3+ ions will hydrolyze to produce H+.

The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is equal to Kw / Kb, where Kb is the base dissociation constant of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, but I'm not sure of Kb for Fe(OH)3. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pKa of the conjugate acid.

Wait, perhaps I should find the solubility product of Fe(OH)3, which is Ksp. The Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is around 6 × 10^-37. Hmm, but wait, that's the Ksp for Fe(OH)3 dissociating into Fe^3+ and OH^-.

Wait, but the hydrolysis I'm considering is the Fe^3+ reacting with water to produce H+ and Fe(OH)3. The K for this reaction would be K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so its concentration is constant. Wait, no, because when it's dissolved, the Fe(OH)3 comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as the hydrolysis reaction and find the H+ concentration.

Wait, another approach: the pH can be found using the formula for a hydrolysis of a salt of a weak acid. Since Fe^3+ is the conjugate acid of a weak base (Fe(OH)3), its solution will be acidic.

The general approach is:

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)+ + H+.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the hydrolysis equilibrium expression.

Alternatively, because Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, its Kb is given by:

Kb = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 / [Fe(OH)3].

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should use the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 to find the pH.

Wait, the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 6 × 10^-37 at 25°C. The Ksp expression is:

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

If we assume that the solution after hydrolysis has [OH^-] = x, then [Fe^3+] = 0.00936 - x ≈ 0.00936 (since x will be very small compared to 0.00936).

So Ksp = (0.00936)(x)^3 = 6e-37.

Solving for x:

x^3 = (6e-37) / 0.00936 ≈ 6e-37 / 9.36e-3 ≈ 6.41e-35.

Taking cube root:

x ≈ (6.41e-35)^(1/3) ≈ (6.41)^(1/3) * 1e-11.666... → approx 1.86 * 1e-11.666.

Wait, 1e-11.666 is about 2.14e-12. So 1.86 * 2.14e-12 ≈ 4.0e-12.

Wait, that gives [OH^-] ≈ 4.0e-12 M.

Then, pOH = -log(4e-12) ≈ 11.3979. So pH = 14 - 11.3979 ≈ 2.602.

Wait, but none of the options have a pH around 2.6. Let's check the options again.

Option A: pH 3.16, 32.14 cm³. No, we're expecting ~2.6.

Option B: pH 2.69, 30.09 cm³. Close.

Option C: pH 2.04, 28.05 cm³. Hmm, 2.04 is lower than our estimate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the K is not Ksp but the hydrolysis constant. Another approach is to consider that the Fe^3+ hydrolyzes as follows:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so its concentration is constant. Wait, no, in solution, if Fe(OH)3 precipitates, but in our case, it's dissolved because we added enough acid. So perhaps [Fe(OH)3] is present in solution.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to model this as a solution of Fe^3+ which hydrolyzes to produce H+.

The hydrolysis reaction can be written as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

But solubility is a factor here. Wait, but maybe the solution is better approached using the formula for the pH of a salt of a weak base.

The formula for the pH of a solution of a salt (like FeCl3) which comes from a weak base and a strong acid is given by:

pH = ½ (pKa - log C)

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the pH can be found using the formula:

[H+] = sqrt( (Kw / Ksp) * C )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

The solubility of Fe(OH)3 in water is low. When it's dissolved in acid, the Fe^3+ comes into solution. The Fe^3+ then hydrolyzes in water, producing H+ ions.

The hydrolysis can be considered as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is K = [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+}.

But since Ksp is known, perhaps:

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

And [OH^-] = Kw / [H+].

So Ksp = [Fe^3+](Kw / [H+])^3.

Rearranging, [H+]^-3 = [Fe^3+] * Kw / Ksp.

=> [H+] = ( [Fe^3+] * Kw / Ksp )^(1/3).

Given that [Fe^3+] is 0.00936 M, Kw is 1e-14, and Ksp is 6e-37.

So [H+] = (0.00936 * 1e-14 / 6e-37)^(1/3).

Let me compute the numerator first: 0.00936 * 1e-14 = 9.36e-17.

Divide by 6e-37: 9.36e-17 / 6e-37 = 1.56e20.

Take cube root: (1.56e20)^(1/3) ≈ (1.56)^(1/3) * (1e20)^(1/3).

1e20^(1/3) is 1e(20/3) = 1e6.666... ≈ 4.64e6.

1.56^(1/3) ≈ 1.16.

So [H+] ≈ 1.16 * 4.64e6 ≈ 5.4e6 M.

Wait, that can't be right because [H+] can't be that high. pH would be negative, but that's not possible because the solution can't be more acidic than -log(1e6) = 6, so pH would be -6, which is impossible because pH can't be negative.

Wait, that suggests I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate the exponents.

Compute [H+] = ( (0.00936) * 1e-14 / (6e-37) )^(1/3).

0.00936 is 9.36e-3.

So 9.36e-3 * 1e-14 = 9.36e-17.

Divide by 6e-37: 9.36e-17 / 6e-37 = (9.36/6) * 1e( -17 +37 ) = 1.56 * 1e20.

So 1.56e20.

Cube root of 1.56e20 is approximately (1.56)^(1/3) * (1e20)^(1/3).

(1e20)^(1/3) is 1e(20/3) = 1e6.666..., which is approximately 4.64e6.

1.56^(1/3) is about 1.16.

So 1.16 * 4.64e6 ≈ 5.4e6 M. That's way too high, which is impossible because that would imply an extremely low pH, but our initial Fe^3+ concentration isn't that high. Wait, but the Fe^3+ concentration is 0.00936 M, which isn't that high. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, perhaps I should re-derive the formula.

The Ksp expression for Fe(OH)3 is Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

We can write [OH^-] = (Ksp / [Fe^3+})^(1/3).

Then, pH is determined by [H+] = Kw / [OH^-].

So [H+] = Kw / [OH^-] = Kw / (Ksp / [Fe^3+})^(1/3).

So [H+] = (Kw * [Fe^3+]^(1/3) ) / (Ksp^(1/3)).

Wait, let's plug in the numbers.

Kw = 1e-14.

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.

Ksp = 6e-37.

So:

[H+] = (1e-14 * (0.00936)^(1/3)) ) / (6e-37)^(1/3).

Compute each part:

(0.00936)^(1/3) ≈ 0.21 (since 0.21^3 is about 0.00926).

(6e-37)^(1/3) = (6)^(1/3) * (1e-37)^(1/3) ≈ 1.817 * 1e-12.333... → 1e-12.333 is about 4.68e-13.

So 1.817 * 4.68e-13 ≈ 8.51e-13.

So [H+] = (1e-14 * 0.21) / (8.51e-13) = (2.1e-15) / 8.51e-13 ≈ 2.47e-3.

So [H+] ≈ 2.47e-3 M.

pH = -log(2.47e-3) ≈ 2.61.

Hmm, so pH around 2.61. Looking at the options, option B is pH 2.69, and option C is 2.04. Hmm, our calculation is about 2.61, which is close to option B (2.69). But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp value. Let me check. Fe(OH)3's Ksp is actually around 6 × 10^-37, which I used. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach should include activity coefficients, but that's beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about all Fe(OH)3 dissolving is incorrect. Wait, but the reaction requires 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3. So with exactly 3 moles of H+ added, all Fe(OH)3 should dissolve.

Wait, but another point: when Fe(OH)3 dissolves, it's possible that some precipitate remains, but since the question says to dissolve it, we can assume V is sufficient to fully dissolve it.

So, considering our calculation gives pH ≈ 2.61, which is closest to option B's pH of 2.69. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the cube roots.

Wait, let me re-calculate the cube roots more accurately.

Compute [Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.

Compute (0.00936)^(1/3):

Let me compute 0.00936 = 9.36e-3.

The cube root of 9.36e-3 is approximately:

We know that 0.2^3 = 0.008, which is 8e-3.

0.21^3 = 0.009261, which is very close to 9.36e-3.

So (0.00936)^(1/3) ≈ 0.21.

Similarly, (6e-37)^(1/3) = (6^(1/3)) * (1e-37)^(1/3).

6^(1/3) is approximately 1.817.

(1e-37)^(1/3) is 1e-12.333... ≈ 4.68e-13.

So 1.817 * 4.68e-13 ≈ 8.51e-13.

So [H+] = (1e-14 * 0.21) / (8.51e-13) = (2.1e-15) / (8.51e-13) ≈ 2.47e-3.

pH = -log(2.47e-3) = 2.61.

So I'm getting pH ≈ 2.61, which is close to option B's 2.69. Hmm, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps another approach: considering the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ in solution.

The reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is Ka = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+}.

But since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, its Kb is given by Kb = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 / [Fe(OH)3}.

We know that Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3. So Kb = Ksp / [Fe(OH)3}, but since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its concentration is constant. Wait, no, because in solution, some Fe(OH)3 may dissolve, so [Fe(OH)3] is not constant.

Alternatively, perhaps using the approach that in solution, the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M, and the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of these ions.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to treat Fe^3+ as a weak acid and calculate the pH using the formula for weak acid dissociation.

The formula for weak acid dissociation is:

[H+] = sqrt( Ka * C )

where Ka is the acid dissociation constant.

But wait, Fe^3+ isn't a diprotic acid, but for the sake of approximation, let's model it as a weak acid with a certain Ka.

But what is the Ka of Fe^3+ hydrolysis?

Well, the Kb for Fe(OH)3 is Ksp / [Fe^3+] when [Fe(OH)3] is 1 M, which isn't the case here. Alternatively, perhaps we can calculate it.

Wait, perhaps another method. The hydrolysis reaction of Fe^3+ is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+}.

But since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, perhaps we can relate K to the Ksp.

Wait, considering that Fe(OH)3 is in equilibrium with Fe^3+ and OH^-:

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

So [OH^-] = (Ksp / [Fe^3+})^(1/3).

But [OH^-] = Kw / [H+].

So (Ksp / [Fe^3+})^(1/3) = Kw / [H+].

Rearranging:

[H+] = (Kw * [Fe^3+]^(1/3) )^(1/3) / (Ksp^(1/3)).

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, [H+] = Kw / [OH^-}.

And [OH^-] comes from the hydrolysis.

But perhaps using the relation:

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

So [OH^-] = (Ksp / [Fe^3+})^(1/3) = (6e-37 / 0.00936 )^(1/3).

Compute 6e-37 / 0.00936 ≈ 6.408e-34.

Take cube root: (6.408e-34)^(1/3) ≈ (6.408)^(1/3) * 1e-11.333.

6.408^(1/3) ≈ 1.857.

1e-11.333 is approximately 4.68e-12.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.857 * 4.68e-12 ≈ 8.7e-12 M.

Then, [H+] = Kw / [OH^-} = 1e-14 / 8.7e-12 ≈ 1.149e-3 M.

pH = -log(1.149e-3) ≈ 2.93.

Hmm, that's about 2.93, which doesn't match any options exactly. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the initial approach using the K expression for the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Let me set up the equation.

Let [H+] = x.

The hydrolysis reaction: Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The expression is K = ( [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+}.

But since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, perhaps K is a small value. Alternatively, we can express this in terms of Ksp.

Wait, perhaps K for this reaction is equal to Kw / Ksp.

Wait, let me think. The reverse reaction of Fe(OH)3's dissolution is:

Fe(OH)3 ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^-.

The K for this reaction is Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this would be K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+}.

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its concentration is 1, so K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+}.

But if I multiply Ksp by the K above, I get:

Ksp * K = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 * [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+}.

Simplifying, Ksp * K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 [OH^-]^3.

But [Fe(OH)3] is 1 (as a solid), and [H+][OH^-] = Kw.

So Ksp * K = (Kw)^3.

So K = (Kw)^3 / Ksp.

Plugging in the numbers:

Kw = 1e-14.

Ksp = 6e-37.

So K = (1e-14)^3 / (6e-37) = (1e-42) / 6e-37 = (1/6) * 1e-5 = approximately 1.666e-6.

So K ≈ 1.666e-6.

Now, the hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+}.

Assuming that [Fe^3+] is approximately 0.00936 M (since it's a weak acid and the change is small), then:

1.666e-6 = (x)^3 / 0.00936.

Solving for x:

x^3 = 1.666e-6 * 0.00936 ≈ 1.56e-8.

x = cube root of 1.56e-8 ≈ (1.56)^(1/3) * (1e-8)^(1/3) ≈ 1.16 * 2.15e-3 ≈ 2.5e-3.

So [H+] = x ≈ 2.5e-3 M.

pH = -log(2.5e-3) ≈ 2.6.

Which is close to our earlier calculation of 2.61.

Looking at the options, option B is pH 2.69 and 30.09 cm³. Our calculated pH is about 2.6, which is close to option C (2.04) and B (2.69). Hmm.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of K.

Let me recompute K.

K = (1e-14)^3 / (6e-37) = (1e-42) / (6e-37) = 1/(6) * 1e-5 = 1.666e-6. That's correct.

So, the calculation of x^3 = 1.666e-6 * 0.00936 ≈ 1.56e-8.

Cube root of 1.56e-8 is approx 2.5e-3.

So pH is ~2.6.

But the options don't have 2.6. Let me check the options again.

Option B: pH 2.69; volume 30.09 cm³.

Option C: pH 2.04; volume 28.05 cm³.

Hmm. Oh wait! Another possibility: perhaps the solution's volume isn't 100 cm³. Because when you dissolve Fe(OH)3 in acid, the total volume may include the volume of the acid added.

Wait, the problem says the solution's total volume is 100 cm³. So when you add V cm³ of acid, the total volume becomes 100 cm³. So the concentration is based on 100 cm³ (0.1 L).

Wait, but when I calculated the initial volume of acid needed, I used the moles of HCl needed (0.002808 mol) divided by 0.1 M, which gives 28.08 cm³, which would make the solution's volume 100 cm³. So that's correct.

But then, for pH, I'm getting about 2.6, but none of the options exactly match that. The closest option is B at 2.69, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the [H+] more accurately.

We have K = 1.666e-6.

Equation: 1.666e-6 = [H+]^3 / 0.00936.

[H+]^3 = 1.666e-6 * 0.00936 = 1.56e-8.

Cube root of 1.56e-8.

Let me compute this accurately.

1.56e-8 = 1.56 × 10^-8.

The cube root of 10^-8 is 10^(-8/3) ≈ 10^-2.6667 ≈ 2.154e-3.

The cube root of 1.56 is approximately 1.16 (since 1.16^3 ≈ 1.56).

So, 1.16 * 2.154e-3 ≈ 2.5e-3.

So [H+] = 2.5e-3 → pH = 2.6.

But none of the options exactly match this. The closest is option B at 2.69, but perhaps I should consider the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for the cube roots.

Let me compute 1.56e-8 more accurately.

We can compute x = cube root(1.56e-8).

Express 1.56e-8 as 1.56 × 1e-8.

Cube root of 1e-8 is 1e-8^(1/3) = 1e-2.6666667 ≈ 2.15443469 × 1e-3.

Cube root of 1.56 is approximately 1.166 (since 1.16^3 = 1.560896).

So, x ≈ 1.166 × 2.15443469e-3 ≈ 2.514e-3.

So [H+] = 2.514e-3 → pH = -log(2.514e-3) ≈ 2.599, about 2.60.

So the pH is approximately 2.60.

Looking back at the options, option B's pH is 2.69, which is higher than our calculation. Option C is pH 2.04, which is lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the solution isn't 100 cm³ because the acid is added to 100 cm³, making the total volume 100 + V cm³. But the question states that the total volume is 100 cm³, so the acid's volume must be V = 100 - (volume of Fe(OH)3 solution), which I'm not sure about. Alternatively, perhaps the initial solution is 100 cm³, and when adding V cm³ of acid, the total volume becomes 100 + V cm³. But the problem says the solution's total volume is 100 cm³. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the volume of the solution as 100 cm³, so the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.000936 / 0.1 = 0.00936 M, and the pH calculation as before.

But given that none of the options exactly match, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction of Fe(OH)3 with HCl produces FeCl3 and water. But perhaps the solution also contains excess HCl, which would make the solution more acidic.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that all the HCl is consumed in the reaction.

Wait, moles of HCl needed: 0.000936 *3 = 0.002808 mol.

Moles of HCl added: 0.1 M * V (in liters) = 0.1 * (V/1000) = V/10000.

Set equal: V/10000 = 0.002808 → V = 28.08 cm³.

So, no excess HCl remains. So the solution's pH is determined solely by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So, perhaps the pH is around 2.6, and the volume is 28.08 cm³, which aligns with option C's volume of 28.05 cm³. But option C's pH is 2.04, which is lower than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the K expression.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it as a solution of FeCl3, which is a salt of a strong acid (HCl) and a weak base (Fe(OH)3). So the solution should be acidic, and the pH can be calculated using the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

The formula for a salt of a strong acid and weak base is:

pH = ½ (pKa + log C).

Wait, no, the pH of a solution of a salt can be calculated using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa - log C).

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me recall.

The salt is FeCl3, so the anion is Cl^- (from HCl, a strong acid) and the cation is Fe^3+ (from a weak base, Fe(OH)3).

The pH depends on the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

The formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak base and strong acid is:

pH = ½ (pKa + log C).

Wait, no. Another approach: the hydrolysis reaction of Fe^3+ produces H+, so the concentration of H+ can be found using the formula for weak acid dissociation.

The reaction is Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)+ + H+.

Wait, but actually, the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is more accurately represented as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The expression for this is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+}.

But since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, perhaps it's better to express this in terms of Kb.

Wait, Kb for Fe(OH)3 is Ksp / [Fe^3+] when [Fe(OH)3] is 1 M. But in solution, [Fe(OH)3] is not 1 M.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to use the Ksp approach again.

Wait, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

We have [Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.

So [OH^-] = (Ksp / [Fe^3+})^(1/3) = (6e-37 / 0.00936 )^(1/3).

Compute 6e-37 / 0.00936 ≈ 6.408e-34.

Cube root of 6.408e-34 is approximately:

6.408^(1/3) ≈ 1.86.

1e-34^(1/3) = 1e-11.333 ≈ 4.68e-12.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.86 * 4.68e-12 ≈ 8.7e-12 M.

Thus, [H+] = 1e-14 / 8.7e-12 ≈ 1.149e-3 M.

pH = -log(1.149e-3) ≈ 2.93.

Hmm, that's around 2.93, which is not matching any options. But earlier calculations gave around 2.6.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [OH^-].

Wait, Ksp = 6e-37 = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

So [OH^-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe^3+] = 6e-37 / 0.00936 ≈ 6.408e-34.

Taking cube root: [OH^-] = (6.408e-34)^(1/3).

Compute 6.408e-34 = 6.408 × 1e-34.

Cube root of 6.408 is approximately 1.86.

Cube root of 1e-34 is 1e-11.333... ≈ 4.68e-12.

So [OH^-] = 1.86 * 4.68e-12 ≈ 8.7e-12 M.

So [H+] = 1e-14 / 8.7e-12 ≈ 1.149e-3.

pH = -log(1.149e-3) ≈ 2.93.

Hmm, this leads to a pH of about 2.93, which is not among the options. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more accurate cube root calculation.

Cube root of 6.408e-34.

Let me compute log(6.408e-34) = log(6.408) + log(1e-34) = 0.808 + (-34) = -33.192.

Divide by 3: -11.064.

So 10^(-11.064) ≈ 8.7e-12, which matches the earlier calculation.

Hmm, but then pH is 2.93, which doesn't match any option. So perhaps there's an error in the approach.

Wait, maybe the assumption that all the Fe(OH)3 dissolves is incorrect. But the problem states that we are to dissolve it, so I think we have to proceed with that assumption.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption that the solution's volume is 100 cm³. Maybe the acid is added to the solution, making the total volume 100 cm³, so the concentration is based on that.

Wait, but I think I've considered that already. So, perhaps the correct pH is around 2.6, which is closest to option B's pH of 2.69 with a volume of 30.09 cm³. But that would mean I made a mistake in the volume calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the volume calculation.

Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol.

Moles of HCl needed: 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

Concentration of HCl: 0.1 M.

Volume of HCl: 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³.

So option C has 28.05 cm³, which is very close.

But the pH for option C is 2.04, which is lower than our calculation of 2.6. So perhaps there's a mistake in the pH calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution includes the contribution of both Fe^3+ hydrolysis and excess H+ from HCl, but earlier calculation suggested no excess H+.

Wait, perhaps I should check if any H+ remains after the reaction.

Moles of HCl added: 28.08 cm³ * 0.1 M = 2.808 mmol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.936 mmol.

Reaction: Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So moles of H+ consumed: 3 * 0.936 = 2.808 mmol.

So moles of H+ remaining: 2.808 - 2.808 = 0.

So no excess H+ from HCl; all H+ is consumed.

Therefore, the pH is determined solely by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So I must have made a mistake in the pH calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value for Ksp.

Let me recompute with more precise Ksp value.

If Ksp = 6 × 10^-37.

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.

[OH^-] = (6e-37 / 0.00936 )^(1/3) = (6.408e-34 )^(1/3) ≈ 8.6e-12 M.

[H+] = 1e-14 / 8.6e-12 ≈ 1.16e-3 M.

pH = -log(1.16e-3) ≈ 2.938.

Still around 2.94.

But again, this isn't matching any option. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach to calculate the volume was wrong. Let me think again.

The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O.

So moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol = 0.000936 mol.

Moles of HCl needed: 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

Volume of 0.1 M HCl: 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. So option C's volume is 28.05 cm³, which is very close.

But the pH is not matching. So perhaps the correct option is C, but the pH calculation is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial Ksp value. Let me check: Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is actually about 6.3e-37, so that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ and the presence of Cl^- ions. But Cl^- is the conjugate base of a strong acid and doesn't hydrolyze, so it doesn't contribute to pH.

Another angle: perhaps the solution isn't 100 cm³ because adding 28 cm³ of acid to 100 cm³ would make the total volume 128 cm³. But the problem states the solution's volume is 100 cm³, so perhaps the acid is added up to the 100 cm³ mark, meaning the volume of acid is 71.92 cm³ (100 - 28.08), but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution's volume is 100 cm³, meaning that when adding V cm³ of acid, the solution's volume is 100 cm³. So the concentration calculations use 100 cm³.

So, with [Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M, pH calculation remains around 2.6.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, with pH 2.04 and volume 28.05 cm³. But why the pH is lower than my calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in considering the hydrolysis correctly. Let me think: the solution contains Fe^3+ which hydrolyzes to produce H+.

An alternative approach is to calculate the pH using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base. Wait, no, FeCl3 is a salt of a strong acid and weak base.

Wait, perhaps the formula for pH is:

pH = ½ (pKa + log C)

But pKa is the pKa of the conjugate acid. Wait, the conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)4^+ ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting too stuck here. Let me think about the options.

Option C has a volume of 28.05 cm³, which matches the volume calculation, and a pH of 2.04. But our calculation gave pH around 2.6, which doesn't match any option.

But looking at the options, option B has a volume of 30.09 cm³ and pH 2.69. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, 0.1 grams divided by 106.85 g/mol is 0.000936 moles. That seems correct.

So, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, and my pH calculation is incorrect.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid, but earlier calculation showed no excess.

Alternatively, perhaps the HCl isn't completely neutralized. But no, because the moles of HCl added match exactly the required moles for neutralization.

Wait, perhaps I should consider activity coefficients or more precise log calculations, but that's beyond the scope here.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I think the correct answer is option C, as the volume aligns, and perhaps the pH calculation accounts for something I missed.

But why the pH is lower than calculated?

Wait, another angle: perhaps the solution isn't just FeCl3 but includes HCl. That would mean that some H+ remains, making the solution more acidic.

Wait, let me recheck the moles.

Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936.

Moles of HCl: 0.1 M * 28.08 cm³ = 2.808 mmol.

Moles needed: 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol = 2.808 mmol.

So moles of HCl added exactly match the needed moles. So no excess H+.

Thus, the pH is from Fe^3+ hydrolysis only.

But according to earlier calculations, pH is around 2.6, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the Ksp value. Let me check an alternative source. The Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is indeed approximately 6 × 10^-37.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct pH is around 2.6, and the closest option is B (2.69), but that's not matching the volume. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but that would require a volume of 30.09 cm³, which is more than the 28.08 cm³ we calculated. Why would the volume be higher?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm supposed to consider that the solution's volume is 100 cm³, including the acid added. So the concentration of Fe^3+ is higher.

Wait, no, the volume is 100 cm³ regardless. So I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option C: 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. But I'm not confident because the pH doesn't align with my calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct with pH 2.69 and volume 30.09 cm³. But why the volume is higher?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, 0.1 grams / 106.85 g/mol = 0.000936 mol. That's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the Ksp formula. Wait, Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-37.

But when [Fe^3+] is 0.00936 M, [OH^-]^3 = 6e-37 / 0.00936 ≈ 6.408e-35.

[OH^-] = cube root of 6.408e-35 ≈ 4.0e-12 M.

So [H+] = 1e-14 / 4e-12 = 2.5e-3.

pH = 2.6.

So after multiple calculations, I'm confident that pH is around 2.6. But the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps the correct option is B, as it's the closest in pH and the volume doesn't exactly match but is close to the required value.

Wait, but option B's volume is 30.09 cm³, which would require more HCl than needed.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I didn't account for the fact that adding 30 cm³ of acid would provide 3 mmol of HCl, which is more than the 2.808 mmol needed. So, there's excess HCl, which would make the solution more acidic.

Ah! That makes sense. Because if the volume is 30.09 cm³, the moles of HCl would be 0.1 M * 30.09 cm³ = 3.009 mmol.

Moles needed: 3 * 0.936 mmol = 2.808 mmol.

Excess HCl: 3.009 - 2.808 = 0.201 mmol.

So the excess HCl would contribute to the [H+].

In this case, the solution would have excess H+ from HCl and H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

So, let's recalculate the pH in this scenario.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.201 mmol in 100 cm³ (0.1 L) → 0.201 / 0.1 = 2.01 M.

H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis: negligible compared to 2.01 M.

So pH = -log(2.01) ≈ 0.695.

But that's not matching any options either.

Wait, but perhaps the initial approach is wrong, and the correct volume isn't 28.08 cm³ but 30.09 cm³. Let me re-examine that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction requires 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, but in practice, some excess is needed to fully dissolve it. So perhaps the volume should be 30.09 cm³.

But why would that be the case? Because in reality, not all reactions go to 100% completion, but the question states that we need to dissolve it, implying that we must provide enough acid.

But according to the stoichiometry, 28.08 cm³ is sufficient.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C, with volume 28.05 cm³ and pH around 2.6, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C, and the pH was miscalculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct pH is 2.69, and option B is the correct choice.

Given the time I've spent, I think the best option is to go with the volume calculation, which is 28.05 cm³ (option C), and perhaps the pH is miscalculated. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp approach, and the correct pH is around 2.69.

But since the volume calculation clearly points to option C, I'll go with that.


To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution, the following steps are analyzed:

### Step 1: Moles of Fe(OH)₃
The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃} = 55.85 + 3(16 + 1) = 106.85 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

The moles of Fe(OH)₃ are:

\[
\text{Moles of Fe(OH)₃} = \frac{0.1}{106.85} \approx 0.000936 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Reaction with HCl
The reaction is:

\[
\text{Fe(OH)₃ + 3 HCl → FeCl₃ + 3 H₂O}.
\]

From the stoichiometry, 3 moles of HCl are required per mole of Fe(OH)₃. Thus, the moles of HCl needed are:

\[
\text{Moles of HCl} = 3 \times 0.000936 \approx 0.002808 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Volume of HCl
The concentration of HCl is 0.1 M. The volume of HCl required is:

\[
\text{Volume of HCl} = \frac{\text{Moles of HCl}}{\text{Concentration of HCl}} = \frac{0.002808}{0.1} = 0.02808 \, \text{L} = 28.08 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

This matches closely with option **C** (28.05 cm³).

### Step 4: pH of the Solution
After dissolving Fe(OH)₃ in HCl, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions, which hydrolyze in water:

\[
\text{Fe³⁺ + 3 H₂O ↔ Fe(OH)₃ + 3 H⁺}.
\]

The concentration of Fe³⁺ is:

\[
[\text{Fe³⁺}] = \frac{\text{Moles of Fe³⁺}}{\text{Total volume of solution}} = \frac{0.000936}{0.1} = 0.00936 \, \text{M}.
\]

The solubility product constant (\(K_{sp}\)) for Fe(OH)₃ is \(6 \times 10^{-37}\). Using the relationship:

\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Fe³⁺}][\text{OH⁻}]^3,
\]

the hydroxide ion concentration \([\text{OH⁻}]\) is:

\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \left(\frac{K_{sp}}{[\text{Fe³⁺}]}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{6 \times 10^{-37}}{0.00936}\right)^{1/3} \approx 8.7 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{M}.
\]

The hydronium ion concentration \([\text{H⁺}]\) is:

\[
[\text{H⁺}] = \frac{K_w}{[\text{OH⁻}]} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{8.7 \times 10^{-12}} \approx 1.15 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log[\text{H⁺}] = -\log(1.15 \times 10^{-3}) \approx 2.93.
\]

This value is not directly listed in the options. However, the closest match for the volume is option **C** (28.05 cm³), and the pH discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup.

### Conclusion
The minimum volume of HCl required is **28.05 cm³**, and the pH of the solution is approximately **2.6** (close to the calculated value). Based on the given options, the best match is:

**Answer: C**
