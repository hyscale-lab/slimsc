Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.

Wait, decay distance... I remember that when a particle is produced, it doesn't live forever. It decays after some time, and the mean lifetime is related to its width. Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is given by the inverse of the total decay width. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, isn't that for unstable particles? Right, because the width is related to the particle's lifetime. A larger width means a shorter lifetime because Γ is the total decay rate.

So first, I should calculate the lifetime. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s or something? Oh, I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Let me double-check that number. Yeah, I remember that Planck constant over 2pi is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Wait, but Γ is given in MeV. So I need to convert Γ into GeV to match the units. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging numbers: 6.582e-25 GeV·s divided by 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. So the mean lifetime is around 2e-24 seconds.

Wait, but particles moving at relativistic speeds might have a longer mean path. Because the particle is moving, the lab frame sees a longer lifetime due to time dilation. Oh right! So the mean decay distance is velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So L = v * τ * gamma, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Wait, or is it just v multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau) multiplied by gamma, since the lifetime observed is longer by gamma. Or wait, no: in the rest frame, the lifetime is tau. In the lab frame, it's gamma tau. Because from the lab's perspective, the particle is moving, so its lifetime is longer.

Hmm. So the mean path length is L = velocity * lifetime in lab frame. Which is v * gamma tau. Alternatively, gamma times (v tau). Since v is approximately c for a high-energy particle, maybe we can approximate v as c.

Wait, but the production energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV. So we can compute the velocity of the meson. Because the energy E is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But since mass is given in GeV/c² and energy is GeV, perhaps we can ignore the c² in units.

Wait, let me think. E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But if we are working in units where c=1 (like in particle physics), then E = gamma m. So gamma = E/m.

In this case, E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

So gamma is 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

Now, the velocity v can be found using beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Wait, no. Wait, beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Let me compute that.

Wait, gamma^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/gamma² is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 1/gamma² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

So the velocity is about 0.9887 times the speed of light.

Now, the mean decay distance L is given by L = gamma beta c tau. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, so L = v gamma tau. Since v = beta c, so L = beta c gamma tau.

We have gamma as 20/3, beta as sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) ≈ 0.9887, c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

Wait, let's compute everything step by step.

First, compute gamma: gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666...

Then, compute beta: beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))) = sqrt(1 - 1/(400/9)) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So, beta ≈ 0.9887.

Now, compute tau (mean lifetime in the rest frame): tau = ħ / Γ. Using ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, compute L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

Let me compute that:

beta ≈ 0.9887,

c = 3e8 m/s,

gamma ≈ 6.6667,

tau ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let's compute step by step:

First, 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by gamma 6.6667: 2.966e8 * 6.6667 ≈ (2.966 * 6.6667) e8 ≈ 19.773e8 m/s ≈ 1.9773e9 m/s.

Wait, no, wait: Wait, no, because I think I may have messed up the order. Let me recompute:

Wait, the formula is L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

So, beta * c = 0.9887 * 3e8 = ~2.966e8 m/s.

Gamma is 6.6667, so beta*c*gamma = 2.966e8 * 6.6667 ≈ 1.9773e9 m/s.

Then multiply by tau: 1.9773e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.
