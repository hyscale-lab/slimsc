Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the relationship is N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, no, actually, the formula is plx in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/(distance in parsecs). That makes sense because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

So if plx is inversely proportional to distance, then distance d is inversely proportional to plx. So d = 1/plx. That means plx = 1/d.

But the question is about how the number of stars (N) changes with distance. So I need to find N as a function of d.

Given that N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5.

Let me compute that exponent. 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as d^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 divided by that is d^5.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. (1/d)^5 is 1/(d^5), so taking the reciprocal would be d^5. Yes.

So N is proportional to d^5. But the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm, wait—that part is a bit confusing.

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So I think it's asking about the differential number of stars, like the number per unit distance. So maybe I should think about the derivative of N with respect to d.

Alternatively, perhaps they're asking for the dependence when considering a shell at distance d with thickness dr. The number of stars in that shell as a function of dr and d.

Wait, because when you count stars in a region, you're considering a volume. So the number of stars in a thin shell (like
