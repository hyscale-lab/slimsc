Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The scenario is that I have a small peptidic compound synthesized chemically. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly right except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, meaning together they account for the one proton expected. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. So, it's not like one proton is splitting into another because they're neighboring protons.

Then the LC-MS analysis at elevated temp shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So, same molecular weight but two separate entities. But wait, the mass spec is the same for both, which suggests that the molecular formula is identical. So, they can't be different compounds with the same mass. Maybe they're isomers?

Now, the options are A to D. Let's go through each.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would likely have a different molecular weight, right? Because it's a starting material that didn't react completely. So in the LC-MS, the precursor would have a lower mass. But in the question, both peaks have the same mass as the expected molecule. So A is probably not it.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In NMR, if you have a chiral center, the alpha proton in a peptide would be a set of diastereotopic protons if the molecule is chiral. Wait, but the problem says the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. Hmm, wait, no. If the molecule is chiral, and the alpha position is chiral, then the protons on that carbon might be diastereotopic. That means each would split into different peaks in the NMR. But in this case, the two peaks are same alpha-proton, but perhaps due to different environments. Wait, but how would that happen? Oh wait, but for enantiomers, the NMR spectrum would show the same peaks because enantiomers have identical physical properties. So if the sample is a racemic mixture, the NMR would not show two separate peaks for the same proton. Because enantiomers have the same chemical shifts. So
