Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, right? Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. So, a chemist found an unnamed white solid, and he's got some spectral data to figure out what it is. The options are four different compounds, and I need to pick the right one based on the spectral clues.

The mass spec shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 with 100%, and another peak at 158 with 32%. Hmm, so the molecular ion is at 156. The other peak is 158, which is two units higher. I remember that in mass spectrometry, a molecular ion can lose or gain a proton or some other fragment, but that extra two units... wait, chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35.5, but wait, for mass spec, the isotopes matter. Chlorine has two main isotopes, Cl-35 (about 75%) and Cl-37 (about 25%). So if the molecular ion is at 156, and there's a peak at 158, that could be due to the presence of a chlorine atom. Let me calculate: Cl-35 is 35, Cl-37 is 37. So if the molecular formula includes a Cl, the molecular weight would be based on Cl-35, but the molecular ion would show a peak at 156 (with Cl-35) and another at 158 (if Cl-37 is present). So that's a possibility.

Wait, the molecular ion is at 156 with 100%, and the 158 is 32%. Hmm, 32% sounds like 35Cl vs 37Cl. If the base peak is at 156 (Cl-35), the other would be Cl-37, which is 35 +2 =37. So the molecular weight is 156. So the molecular formula must include Cl, and the M+2 peak is 32% which is approximately 25% (the abundance of Cl-37). But 32% is a bit higher than 25%, which makes me think maybe there's more than one Cl? Or perhaps some other factor. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the molecular formula. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate the molecular weight: C is 12*7=84, H=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. So total is 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. So the M would be around 156.5. So the molecular ion at 156 could be [M]+, but wait, that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the exact mass is about 156. So that's possible.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as option A. So same molecular weight as option A. So same as 156.5.

C) Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is ClCO-O-C6H5. So the formula would be C8H5ClO3. Molecular weight: C=12*8=96, H=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*3=48. So 96+5=101, +35.5=136.5, +48=184.5. That's way higher than 156, so that can't be the molecular ion. So option C is out.

D) 2-ch
