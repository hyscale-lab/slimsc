Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The compound has a molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and it's reacted through a series of reagents. I need to find the final product from the options provided.

First, let me look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The 1H-NMR signals are:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That region is typically where aldehydic protons appear, but wait, it's a triplet. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm and as a singlet if not split. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde but coupled with something else. Or perhaps it's a conjugated aldehyde, which might cause splitting.

Then, looking at the aromatic region. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets, each 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para-substituted rings, the protons are typically split into doublets, each integrating to two. Maybe two para-substituted phenyl groups attached to something.

Then, 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad signals could be from alcohols (OH) or possibly some conjugated diene or enol. But considering the molecular formula has an O, maybe -OH is present. Wait, in the formula, it's C8H9NO. So, one N and one O. Wait, the O could be part of an alcohol or a ketone or an aldehyde.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's probably a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe an OCH2 group? Because OCH2's are typically around 3.5-4 ppm. So that could be an ether or a carbonyl adjacent CH2.

Putting this together: perhaps the structure has two para-substituted phenyl groups attached to a chain that includes an aldehyde and some oxygen-containing groups.

Wait, so the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5.

So 5 degrees of unsaturation. Which could be two benzene rings (each being 3 DoU, but wait, two rings would be 6... wait, no, each benzene is 4 DoU (3 double bonds +1 ring), so two would be 8? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, benzene has 3 double bonds and 1 ring, so 4 DoU each. If the molecule has two benzene rings, that's 8 DoU, which is way higher than 5. But wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the formula is C8H9NO. So the molecular formula for two benzene rings is C12H10, which is way more than C8. So maybe it's not two benzene rings. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single benzene ring and another group.

Wait, considering the NMR data,
