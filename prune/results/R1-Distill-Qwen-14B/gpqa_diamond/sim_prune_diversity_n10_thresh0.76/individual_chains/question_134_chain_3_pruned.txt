Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing three different solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is usually exothermic, which is why the options are all negative values—since exothermic reactions release heat.

First, I think I need to determine the type of each solution. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too but it's diprotic, meaning it can donate two protons. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base because it's a hydroxide, and since Ba is a group 2 metal, I think the hydroxide would dissociate completely.

The next step is probably to figure out the moles of H+ and OH- ions from each solution. Because in neutralization, H+ from the acid reacts with OH- from the base. So, I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- available.

Wait, but wait. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each molecule can contribute two H+ ions. But I should remember that in a solution, the second dissociation might not be complete. Oh wait, no—H2SO4 is a strong acid, so the first H+ is fully dissociated. But the second H+ (from HSO4^-) is weak, right? So, in a concentrated solution, only the first H+ is considered strong. Hmm, wait, no, I think I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think: H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation. The first H+ comes off completely, but the second one (HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-) is a weaker acid. So in a solution, the first H+ is 100% dissociated, but the second is only partially. But for simplicity in this problem, maybe they expect me to assume both H+ are available? Or perhaps they're considering only the first one for the neutralization? I'm not sure. Maybe the problem expects me to account for all possible H+ from H2SO4.

Wait, the problem says 'when mixed', so all solutions are added
