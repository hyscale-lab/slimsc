Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm not super familiar with adamantane derivatives, but I know adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four fused cyclohexane rings, right? So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two of its bridgehead carbons.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases, they usually undergo elimination, like an E2 mechanism. Since we have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons, elimination would form an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure. So if the two bromines are on 1 and 3 positions, eliminating would form a double bond. But wait, in adamantane, positions 1 and 3 are bridgeheads, so the structure is such that those positions are not adjacent. Hmmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: In adamantane, each bridgehead carbon is connected to two other bridgeheads. Wait, no, the structure has four rings, and the 1 and 3 positions are on the same bridge, I think. So when KOH is used, it should deprotonate and eliminate to form a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-didehydroadamantane or something similar? Maybe it's an adamantene structure, which is adamantane with a double bond.

The product, according to the 1H NMR, has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That region is usually for alkenes, perhaps as a deshielded proton. Wait, no, alkenes are usually around 4-5 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? Wait, no. Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone. But how?

Wait another thought: elimination of HBr twice would give a diene, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, if we have a ring-opening or some rearrangement. Wait, KOH in such a high temperature can cause dehydrohalogenation, but if the structure isn't conducive for forming a double bond between 1 and 3, perhaps it forms a bridgehead double bond, which is possible because of the structure of adamantane.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the product is a diepoxide? No, because the IR doesn't show the typical epoxide absorption around 1250 cm-1. The IR at 1720 is more like a carbonyl, such as a ketone. So perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else.

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. How? Because if you remove two HBr from adjacent bromines, you could form a carbonyl group. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Elimination forms alkenes, not ketones. Unless there's some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a substitution reaction. But with two bromides, maybe it's a double substitution. Wait, but KOH is a base, more likely to cause elimination than substitution, especially at high temps.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane? No, that doesn't fit either.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. The product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That could be a methylene group attached to an oxygen, perhaps an epoxide or something else. Alternatively, it could be a deshielded CH2 near an electronegative atom. The IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, maybe a ketone. So perhaps the structure is a diketone? But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination of two HBr, would form a diketone? Because each elimination would form a carbonyl group. Wait, wait, if each Br is removed with a base, perhaps each leads to the formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, but eliminating HBr from each of two adjacent carbons would form a double bond, but how would that lead to a carbonyl group? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but instead a substitution. Or maybe it's an example of the formation of a conjugated diene which isn't possible in adamantane. So perhaps the product is a ketone, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide? But I thought the IR for epoxides is around 1250, not 1720. 1720 is more likely a ketone or an ester. So maybe it's a ketone. Let's think: if the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and each elimination step forms a carbonyl, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone adamantane? But wait, how would that structure look?

Alternatively, maybe the two elimination steps form a single ketone and a double bond. But that might not make sense given the NMR.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. A triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. If those 2H are adjacent to a CH2 group that's coupled with another CH2, perhaps. Maybe it's a geminal coupling or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol. No, because the IR doesn't show OH stretches. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester, but that might require an alcohol and acid chloride, which isn't the case here.

Wait, another angle: the product is a diepoxide. But the NMR in that case would have different features. Or, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane derivative. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think about the reaction conditions again. KOH is used, and heating. So, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or some kind of dehydrohalogenation. But since there are two Br atoms, perhaps we eliminate twice to form a conjugated diene. But adamantane's structure might not allow that; the bridgehead might not form a conjugated diene easily.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single ketone. Wait, but how would that happen with two Br atoms? Oh wait, perhaps each Br is on a different carbon, and elimination of each Br forms a carbonyl group. So each HBr elimination would form a carbonyl. So, if you start with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon base treatment, you lose two HBr to form a diketone, 1,3-diketone adamantane.

Wait, that would fit the IR. Two ketones would have two absorption bands around 1720, but maybe the peaks are close enough or it's a symmetrical structure. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 with 2H. Hmm, for a diketone, that might not fit because the carbonyls are on bridgehead positions, which are typically substituted with CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane. If the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgeheads, perhaps elimination forms a cyclopropane ring with a bridge. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, and the 4.79 peak is from a neighboring CH2 group. Wait, 4.79 is somewhat upfield for a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe it's an enol ether or something else.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck on the first step. Let's move to the next steps for a moment.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide upon heating to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But to do Friedel-Crafts, you need an aromatic ring. Adamantane derivatives are polycyclic but not aromatic. So maybe it's a different reaction. Perhaps it's a formation of an epoxide? Or some kind of acetylation?

Wait, but aluminum isopropoxide is also used in the formation of alkenes via elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol. Wait, product 1's NMR has a peak at 4.79 (2H), which could be an -OCH2- group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, going back, product 1's IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So perhaps in the first step, the two Brs are replaced by ketone groups. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules to form 1,3-diketone adamantane. That would explain the IR. Now, the NMR has a peak at 4.79 (2H). If the molecule is 1,3-diketone adamantane, the structure would have two ketone groups on bridgeheads, and perhaps some CH2 groups next to them. But the bridgehead carbons in adamantane are generally CH groups, not CH2. So maybe those 2H are part of a bridge or a substituent.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is a ketone and has some bridgehead CH2 groups. Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ring with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step produces a diepoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR. So, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. So when KOH is added, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr. But since there are two Br atoms, maybe two eliminations happen, forming a conjugated diene. But in adamantane, the bridgehead positions might not allow for that due to the structure's rigidity. So perhaps the diene isn't formed, and instead, a different process occurs.

Wait, maybe the product is a bridged bicyclic diene. But again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, and the 4.79 ppm is due to a neighboring CH2 group. So, if the structure is 1,3-adamantanedione, then the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would appear around 2.4-2.23 ppm, which is in the NMR data. The 4.79 peak would be something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first step forms an epoxide. But I don't think so because the IR doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe it's a peroxide, but again, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a gem-dialkoxy compound, but that seems less likely.

Wait, perhaps the product is an alkyne. But the IR doesn't align with that either.

Alternatively, could the product be a diol formed via nucleophilic substitution? But again, the IR doesn't show OH groups, and the NMR doesn't have broad peaks, which diols typically do.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on the first step. Let me try to think of another angle. The first product's NMR has a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H). A triplet implies that each of these two protons has two neighboring equivalent protons. So maybe it's a -CH2-O-CH2- group, like in an ether. But wait, the IR has a carbonyl, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, it's a -CH2-C=O- group. But that would be adjacent to a carbonyl, which typically causes the CH2 protons to appear around 2.1-2.4 ppm, which is in the given NMR. So maybe the 4.79 peak isn't from that.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a di-substituted cyclopropane, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with substituents, but I don't see how that would form from adamantane.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms a ketone, and the rest of the structure has CH2 groups that appear in the NMR. So, perhaps the product is a ketone with some substituents.

Wait, let's try to accept that product 1 is a ketone. Then, in the IR, 1720 cm-1 is the ketone carbonyl. Then, the NMR shows a triplet for 2H at 4.79. Maybe that's a methylene group next to an oxygen, like an ether or ester, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's a CH2 group that's deshielded due to proximity to the carbonyl.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to move forward. The second step is heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Now, aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid; perhaps it's involved in some kind of Friedel-Crafts acylation, but again, adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, it could be a catalyst for some elimination or other reaction.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. Then, using a Lewis acid would promote the formation of an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or some kind of acetal, but that may not fit.

Wait, another possibility: the first product is a ketone and has some bridgehead substituents. The second step involves some kind of ring-opening or further reaction with Lewis acid.

But honestly, I'm not making much progress here. Let's think about the third step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, which is a reductive workup. Ozonolysis of alkenes typically cleaves them into carbonyl compounds. So product 3 would be the result of ozonolysis. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

So, the coupling pattern depends on the structure of product 3. If product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. So, the structure of product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

Wait, but product 2 comes from product 1 reacted with aluminum isopropoxide. So, if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would break that.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is a diene. Because when you have a ketone, perhaps the Lewis acid catalyzes some kind of elimination to form a diene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that into two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not certain. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane -> (KOH, heat) product 1 (probably a di-ketone? Or maybe an alkene?)

2. product 1 -> (Aluminum isopropoxide, heat) product 2 (maybe an alkene or diene)

3. product 2 ozonolysis -> product 3 (which would have carbonyl groups)

But if product 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. The coupling pattern in product 3's NMR depends on the structure of those carbonyl groups and adjacent protons.

Wait, but the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So, perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, which would cause it to be deshielded and appear downfield.

But the coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons. For example, a CH2 next to a carbonyl may be split by neighboring CH2 groups. Alternatively, if it's a CH group adjacent to another CH2, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, let's say product 2 is a diene. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds. Suppose product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene, then ozonolysis would form two ketones or aldehydes. But in adamantane derivatives, the structure would be more complex.

Alternatively, suppose product 2 is a cyclic diene. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups connected by a chain. For example, if it's a cyclohexene, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes.

But since the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H, perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. If that CH2 is next to another CH2, the splitting could be a triplet. But wait, if each H in the CH2 is coupling with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, then each would be a triplet. But wait, the problem says "the most deshielded hydrogen atom", so perhaps it's a CH group in a carbonyl group, but that's not possible as carbonyl Hs don't exist. So, more likely, a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

Wait, but if the CH2 is next to a carbonyl, and the next group is another CH2, then each H in the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs. So each would have two neighbors, leading to a triplet.

But wait, if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, then each H is only seeing the adjacent CH2. So that would be a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group, which would lead to more splitting.

Wait, another scenario: if product 3 is a diketone, then the adjacent CH2 groups might have coupling patterns. For example, if it's (CH2)2(CO)2, then the CH2 groups are between two carbonyls. Each CH2 would have two Hs adjacent, so each proton would be a triplet.

Wait, but the most deshielded H would be the one closest to the carbonyl. So, if it's a CH2 next to a carbonyl, each H would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But wait, the options are: triplet (A), triplet of triplets (B), doublet of triplets (C), pentet (D).

Wait, another possibility is that the CH2 is next to a CH group. For example, if product 3 is something like CH2-CO-CH2-CO. Then, the central CH2 group would be adjacent to two CH2 groups. Wait, but that would complicate the coupling.

Alternatively, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R, then the CH2 groups in the middle would each be adjacent to two other CH2 groups. But wait, in that case, each H on the middle CH2 would be split by two neighboring Hs from each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group that is adjacent to another CH2 group, which in turn is adjacent to a CH group. For example:

Imagine a structure like CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-..., then the CH2 next to the CO would be the most deshielded. Each H in that CH2 would be next to two Hs from the adjacent CH2. So each H would see two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But wait, maybe the situation is more complex. Suppose the CH2 is connected to a CH group, which is connected to another CH2. Then, each H in the CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 and possibly the Hs on the CH group. But if the CH group is a CH with two Hs, then each H in the CH2 would couple with both the CH2 and the CH, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, if the structure is a cyclopropane ring with substituents, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps the product 3 is a diketone with a bridge structure. The most deshielded H would be on a bridgehead adjacent to the ketone. But bridgehead protons in adamantane are typically in a rigid structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 3 has a CH2 group next to two different CH2 groups, leading to a more complex coupling pattern.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to summarize:

- Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (probable di-ketone)
- Step 2: product 1 + Al isopropoxide → product 2 (maybe an alkene)
- Step 3: product 2 undergoes ozonolysis → product 3 (which is a cleavage product, possibly a diketone)
- The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3.

Assuming product 3 is a diketone with a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, the Hs on that CH2 would be split by adjacent Hs. If that CH2 is next to another CH2, each H would see two neighboring Hs, giving a triplet.

But wait, another scenario: if product 3 has a structure like (CH2)n(CO)2, where n=1, then the CH2 is between two CO groups. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs from the same CH2. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

But if the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group, then the coupling pattern would be more complex. For example, if the structure is CH2-CO-CH(CH3)-CO-CH2, then the CH2 group would be next to a CH, which has two Hs. So each H in the CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH, resulting in a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Wait, let's think about the coupling. Suppose you have a CH2 group, and each H is next to a CH that has two Hs. Then, each H in the CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH. So each would have a triplet. But wait, the coupling would be between each H in the CH2 and the two Hs on the CH. So each H in the CH2 would split into a doublet of doublets? Or a triplet due to two neighboring protons.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is between two CH groups, each H in the CH2 would see two Hs on each side, leading to more splitting.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of a possible structure. Suppose product 3 is a diketone with a CH2 group between two ketone groups. So the structure is O=C-R-CH2-CH2-C=O-R'. Then, the CH2 groups next to the ketones would have their Hs coupled with each other. Each H in the CH2 would see two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But wait, if the two CH2 groups are identical, then each H in the CH2 would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH which is next to another CH2, the coupling could be more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2 group which is adjacent to a CH. So each H in the central CH2 would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 and two Hs from the CH. But that would lead to more splitting, perhaps a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, let's imagine the structure is O=C-(CH2)2-C=O. Then, the CH2 in the middle would have each H adjacent to two Hs from each neighboring CH2. So each H in the central CH2 would couple with two Hs on each side, leading to a quartet. But wait, each H in the central CH2 would see four neighboring Hs (two from each side), but that's not possible because each H can only couple with adjacent protons.

Wait, no. Each H in the central CH2 is adjacent to two Hs from the left CH2 and two from the right CH2. But coupling is only with adjacent (vicinal) protons. So each H in the central CH2 would see two Hs from the left and two from the right. Wait, no, because each H is only coupled with Hs on adjacent carbons. So each H in the central CH2 is adjacent to two Hs (from the left and right CH2). So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in reality, for a structure like (CH2)2(CO)2, the central CH2 is between two CH2 groups. Each H in the central CH2 would be coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 groups. So each H would see two Hs, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But that would suggest the answer is A) triplet.

But wait, let's think about another possibility. Suppose product 3 has a structure where the deshielded H is part of a CH group adjacent to a CH2 group. For example, a structure like CH(CH2CO)2. Then, each H on the CH would be coupled with two Hs from each adjacent CH2 group. But the CH group would have two Hs, each coupling with two Hs from each side. Wait, but that would lead to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a CH2 group which is adjacent to another CH2 group. Then, each H in the CH2 would see two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Hmm, I'm not sure. But based on the options, the most likely coupling pattern is a triplet, which would fit if the H is in a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group. So the answer would be A) triplet.

Wait, but another angle: the product 3 from ozonolysis could have a triple bond if the starting alkene was cyclic. But ozonolysis of a cyclic diene would give a diketone. For example, ozonolysis of cyclopropane would give two carbonyls.

But in any case, the Hs adjacent to carbonyls would likely be in CH2 groups, leading to triplet patterns.

So, considering all this, I think the coupling pattern is a triplet, which is option A.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C likely leads to elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a diketone, 1,3-diketone adamantane. This is supported by the IR spectrum showing a strong carbonyl absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ and the ¹H NMR spectrum, which includes a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), consistent with a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.

2. **Reaction 2**: Heating the diketone with aluminum isopropoxide likely forms an alkene or a diene. Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, can promote elimination reactions, leading to the formation of a conjugated diene or a strained alkene.

3. **Reaction 3**: Ozonolysis of the alkene or diene at -78°C followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide cleaves the double bond, forming a diketone or carbonyl-containing product. The most deshielded hydrogen in the final product is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Coupling Pattern**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. This CH₂ group is coupled with two hydrogens from an adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

Based on this analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

Answer: A
