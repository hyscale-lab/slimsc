Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. We're supposed to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so their reaction should form a salt, sodium acetate, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid.

The problem gives me the initial volume and concentration of acetic acid. Let me jot down the details:

- Volume of acetic acid: 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters)
- Concentration of acetic acid: 0.05 M
- We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³, right?

Then, during titration, we're using 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is to find the pH at 25% titration. The second part is the pH at the equivalence point.

Wait, but wait. How do I approach this?

Let me think. First, I should calculate the initial concentration after dilution because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. Oh yeah, because concentration is moles over volume. So if I have 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid, the moles are 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, adding 20 mL water makes the total volume 40 mL (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Okay, so the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Wait, no. Wait, 25% of the total volume of the solution is being used in the titration? Or 25% of the moles?

Wait, the term "25% titration" usually refers to 25% of the moles of the acid being neutralized, I think. Because in titration, you reach equivalence when all the acid has reacted. So 25% titration would mean 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH.

So first, let's find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The diluted solution is 40 mL (0.04 L) of 0.025 M, so moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. So at 25% titration, 0.00025 moles of NaOH have been added.

Wait, but wait, how much NaOH is that? The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume required is moles / concentration. So 0.00025 moles / 0.1 M = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 mL. But perhaps I don't need to calculate the volume; maybe I can just work with moles.

So the initial setup: we have 0.001 moles of CH3COOH. After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, the reaction consumes CH3COOH and produces CH3COO^-.

So, the moles after reaction:

CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.
CH3COO^- : 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume is now the original 40 mL plus the added NaOH volume. Hmm, that's a good point. Because when you add titrant, the volume changes. But the problem is, at 25% titration, how much volume has been added? Let me think. The total moles of acetic acid is 0.001, so at equivalence, you need 0.001 moles of NaOH. So 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. So the volume added would be 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 mL. So the total solution volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L. Hmm, but wait, maybe the question assumes that the volume change is negligible, or perhaps not. I'm not sure, but perhaps for simplicity, I can just proceed with the concentrations based on moles.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the concentrations based on the total volume, but let's see.

So, after reaction:

Moles of CH3COOH = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- = 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 4
