Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read the question again. 

The problem says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out what compound A is and which catalyst (B) was used.

Hmm. So the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, which is a cyclic secondary amine. The product is a molecule where a cyclohexylidene group is attached to the pyrrolidine ring. Let me think about what kind of reaction would do that.

Wait, I remember that when amines react with aldehydes, especially in acid conditions, they can undergo aldehyde-amine reactions. Like the formation of imines. Oh, right! The condensation reaction between an amine and an aldehyde in the presence of an acid catalyst typically forms an imine.

In this case, the product has a cyclohexylidene group attached. Cyclohexylidene suggests that it's a cyclohexene group attached via a double bond. Wait, no, the name is cyclohexylidenemethyl, so maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene. Let me think about the structure.

The product structure is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the pyrrolidine ring has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group, which is like a cyclohexene ring attached to a methyl group. Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexene attached via a methylene group (CH2) but as a double bond? Or perhaps it's a cyclohexene ring with a substituent where the substituent is connected as an imine.

Wait, let me visualize this. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the substituent at position 1 is a cyclohexylidene (which is a cyclohexene substituent) attached to a methyl group. Or maybe it's a cyclohexylidene group connected to a methylene group that's part of the ring? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the
