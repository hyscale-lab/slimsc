Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question has two parts: Reaction A and Reaction B. I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them with the options provided.

First, Reaction A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let's try to visualize this structure. Benzene ring with a substituent that's an O-CH2- group attached to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl chain.

Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl... So the chain is four carbons long. The double bond is between C2 and C3, and there's a methyl group on C3. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-, but wait, the substituent is on the benzene. Let me write it out:

The substituent is O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

No, wait. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. Wait, but the way it's written, it's (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy connected to a methyl group attached to benzene. Or is it (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy as the substituent on benzene, but that's connected to a methyl group?

Wait no, the structure is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Oh, so benzene has a substituent which is (CH2O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)) but wait, no. Let me parse that correctly.

The substituent is -O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2-), but wait, the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, no. But-2-en-
