Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f̄ (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think I need to parse that. So, the interaction term involves the fermion field ψ_f and the boson X. Oh wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure. Maybe it's written as something like -λ f f̄ X ψ_f? Or perhaps it's a Yukawa-like interaction. Oh, right, Yukawa couplings usually have the form g ψ ψ ϕ, where ϕ is the boson field. So here, X is the boson, and the fermions involved are ψ_f and maybe another one since the term has f and f̄. Wait, the term is -λ f f̄ (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused by the notation. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is something like the fermion ψ_f coupling to X via a term like λ f f̄ X ψ_f? Or maybe it's a four-fermion interaction? 

Wait, no, because X is a boson, so the term must be something like X coupling to two fermions. Wait, the term must be something like X times a product of fermion fields. Oh, perhaps it's a trilinear term? No, because the interaction is X ψ ψ. So, for example, the term might be X ψ_f ψ_f. Or perhaps it's X ψ_f ψ_f̄. Wait, the way it's written here is a bit unclear. The term in the Lagrangian is written as -λ f f̄ (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps ψ_f is another fermion field, so maybe the interaction is between X and two fermions ψ_f and something else, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the notation.

But maybe I can think about the problem in a more general way. The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV, and I need to find its possible decay products. The possible decay products are given in the options, which include various quark and lepton pairs.

So, the key here is kinematical thresholds. For a particle to decay into a pair of particles, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of each of the decay products. So, if X has mass m_X =6 GeV, then for any decay X → f f̄, the fermion mass m_f must satisfy 2 m_f ≤ m_X.

Wait, but fermions have different masses. For example, up and down quarks are very light (a few MeV), strange quarks are about 100 MeV, charm quarks about 1.5 GeV, bottom quarks about 4.5 GeV, top quarks about 173 GeV, and leptons like electrons (0.5 MeV), muons (105 MeV), taus (1.78 GeV), etc.

So, since X is 6 GeV, the decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. So, for each possible fermion pair, I check if 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

Let me list the fermion masses:

- Up quark (u): ~2.2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy)
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV

So, for each fermion f, 2m_f must be ≤6 GeV.

So let's go through each possible fermion:

- u: 2m_u ≈4.4 MeV → yes
- d: 2m_d ≈9.4 MeV → yes
- s: 2m_s ≈200 MeV → yes
- c: 2m_c ≈3 GeV → yes (3 GeV <6)
- b: 2m_b ≈9 GeV → no, because 9>6.
- t: 2m_t way larger → no
- e: 2m_e ≈1 MeV → yes
- μ: 2m_μ ≈210 MeV → yes (≈0.21 GeV <6)
- τ: 2m_τ ≈3.56 GeV → yes (3.56 <6)

Wait, wait. So the possible fermions that can be produced are u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ. Because for each, 2m_f ≤6 GeV. So the decay products could be any of these quarks or leptons. So possible decay channels are X → u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b has 2m_b=9 GeV>6 GeV, so b can't be produced. So option A includes b b̄, which is not allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Wait, but option B includes c c̄, which is allowed because 2m_c=3 GeV <6. So that's fine. And the others are all allowed. So B might be a possibility.

Option C: X→ c c
