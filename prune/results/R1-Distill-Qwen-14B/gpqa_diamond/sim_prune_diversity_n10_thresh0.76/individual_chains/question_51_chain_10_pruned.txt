Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about calculating the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Hmm, I remember that potential energy in electrostatics often involves interactions between charges, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact approach here.

Wait, the sphere is conducting and grounded. Oh right, a grounded conductor means that any excess charge on it will go to ground. But wait, when a conductor is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So if the sphere is grounded, it must be that any induced charges on it would adjust to maintain this condition.

So, when a charge q is placed near the conducting sphere, the sphere will experience an induced charge. But since it's grounded, the induced charges can move to the surface or even to the ground. So, actually, the sphere's net charge might be zero because any induced charge would be neutralized by the ground. Hmm, wait no, wait. Wait, wait, no, that depends on the situation. Let me think again.

When a charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere's electrons (since it's a conductor) will redistribute. The charge q will induce a charge of -q on the near side of the sphere and +q on the far side. But since the sphere is grounded, the excess charge can flow away. So the sphere's net charge might actually be
