Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions and disease resistance in white lupine. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember that when you knock out genes, you're looking to see how each affects the phenotype—in this case, resistance to anthracnose.

The setup is that they have three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made single knockouts (g1, g2, g3) and some double knockouts. The resistance levels are given as percentages of the wild-type control. Their resistance is measured as how much they resist the anthracnose pathogen.

So the data is:
- g1: 75% (so less than wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half as resistant)
- g1g3: 10% (very little resistance)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

Wait, the question says at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors are usually upstream, regulating other genes. So perhaps they're in a pathway, and the order matters for the phenotype.

Let me think about what each result implies. When you see that a single mutant has 0% resistance, like g2, that suggests that G2 is essential for resistance because without it, they're completely susceptible. So G2 might be a key player, perhaps the transcription factor since it's upstream.

Looking at the double mutants, let's see. For example, the double mutant g2g3 has 0% resistance, same as g2. Similarly, g1g2 is 0%—so when you combine g2 with any other, the resistance is as bad as g2. That suggests that G2 is epistatic over the others. Because when G2 is knocked out, the other gene's presence doesn't matter—resistance is gone. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. So if the phenotype of g2 is 0% regardless of the other gene, that suggests that G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3. Because when G2 is missing, the other mutations don't change the outcome.

Let me think about the possibilities. For example, if G2 is a transcription factor, it might activate other genes (like G1 or G3) that contribute to resistance. So if G2 is not working, none of the downstream genes can be expressed, leading to no resistance.

Looking at the data, when g2 is knocked out, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. So G2's function is crucial. G1's single mutant is 75% resistance—so it's still somewhat resistant. G3's single mutant is 50%, which is worse than G1 but not as bad as G2's knockout.

Now, when you look at the double mutants:

g1g3 has 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance drops much lower than either single mutant. Hmm, that suggests that G1 and G3 might be contributing additively or synergistically. Or perhaps they function in parallel pathways.

Wait, but g2g3 is 0%—so same as g2, which suggests that G3 doesn't contribute anything when G2 is already knocked out. Similarly, g1g2 is 0%—so G1 doesn't contribute without G2.

So, G2 is necessary for any resistance. Without G2, even the presence of G1 or G3 doesn't help. So G2 is acting upstream of both G1 and G3.

What about the single mutants? The g1 mutant is 75%—so it's 25% less than wild-type. G3 mutant is 50%—so 50% less. So perhaps G1 contributes more than G3, or their contributions are additive.

In the double mutants without G2, the resistance is 0%, but when only G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is even worse than either single. So G1 and G3 might be working in separate pathways. But without G2, neither can function. Wait, no, because in the double mutants where G2 is present, like g1g3, the resistance is 10%. Hmm, but what's the reasoning here.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So, in
