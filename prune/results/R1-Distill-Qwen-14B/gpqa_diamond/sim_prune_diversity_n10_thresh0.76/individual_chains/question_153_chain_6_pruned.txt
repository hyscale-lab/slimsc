Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think through each part step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C. Each involves different reactants and conditions, and I need to find the major products.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. So, NaOEt is a strong base, and in EtOH, which is a protic solvent. This likely deprotonates the alpha position of the malonate to form an enolate.

Wait, malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form a strong enolate. The other compound is a Michael acceptor since it's an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate.

Let me sketch this out. Dimethyl malonate has two methyl groups on the central carbon, so when the enolate forms, it'll be at the alpha position. The structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. When deprotonated, the enolate will be at the central carbon, making it a good nucleophile.

The acrylate is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Structure-wise, it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Actually, since it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, the substituents. Let me recheck. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl group is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? Or wait, no. Wait, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? Or maybe the p-tolyl is attached to the acrylate chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2-p-tolyl)-COOEt? No, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The correct structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with the substituent. Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-R. So the substituent is on the middle carbon. So it's CH2=C-(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, no, that can't be right because the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is:

The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but in this case, the CH2 group has the substituent. Wait, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Oh wait, no. The correct structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the acrylate has an electron-deficient double bond, so the enolate from malonate will attack the beta carbon (the CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl).

Wait, when the malonate enolate attacks, it
