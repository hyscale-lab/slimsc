Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A_y, is represented by a 2x2 matrix. The operator is given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

Wait, so S is a matrix, right? Let me write that down. So S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

And c is h/(4π). So A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Oh, right, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(A_y - λI) = 0, where λ are the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.

But wait, let me compute A_y first. Let me calculate each element.

A_y would be c multiplied by each element of S. So:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * S = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

So the matrix looks like:

[ 0        -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0       ]

Let me denote c = h/(4π), so A_y becomes:

[ 0   -i c ]
[ i c   0  ]

So the matrix is:

0   -i c

i c  0

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation:

det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

So A_y - λ I would be:

[ -λ    -i c ]
[ i c    -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ
