Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function is the sum over all states of exp(-beta E), right? Beta is 1/(kT), but I don't think I need to worry about the exact expression since it'll just carry through as a variable.

So each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, how many possible states are there? Each has two options, so 2^3 = 8 states. Oh right, 8 possible configurations. I'll probably have to list them all or find a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the number of states with each possible energy. Because the energy depends on the number of pairs that are aligned or anti-aligned. Let me think about how the energy is calculated.

Wait, the energy E is -J times the sum of S_i S_j for each pair. Each S_i S_j can be +1 (if the spins are the same) or -1 (if opposite). So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can range based on how many pairs are aligned.

So for three spins, how many pairs are there? For three spins, it's three pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). Each pair contributes +1 or -1.

So the total sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3, right? Because each term is +1 or -1. Let me see:

If all three pairs are aligned, sum is 3*(+1) =3. So E= -J*3.

If two pairs are aligned and one is not, sum is +1 +1 -1 =1. So E= -J*1.

If one pair aligned, two not: sum is +1 -1 -1 =-1. E= J*1.

If all three pairs not aligned: sum is -3. E= 3J.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check. Each S_i S_j is 1 if same, -1 otherwise. So if all three spins are same, say all +1, then S1S2
