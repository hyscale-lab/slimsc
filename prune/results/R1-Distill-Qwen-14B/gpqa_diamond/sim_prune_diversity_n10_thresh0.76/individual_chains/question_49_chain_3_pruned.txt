Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pericyclic reactions yet. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which are a type of pericyclic reaction. From what I remember, pericyclic reactions involve concerted movements of electrons, like in cycloadditions or sigmatropic shifts. Sigmatropic rearrangements, specifically, involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond moving. The classic examples are the Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which I think are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts.

The question has three parts, each requiring the identification of the product A, B, and C from given starting materials and conditions. The options are provided, so I need to figure out each reaction's outcome.

Let me look at each reaction one by one.

Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A.

Hmm. The starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol, with H+ and heat. I'm trying to think about what kind of reaction these would undergo under acidic conditions and heat.

Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is an allylic alcohol. The other molecule is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine, which looks like a secondary amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. So maybe it's something like a Hinsberg reaction, but that's for detecting amines. Alternatively, under acidic conditions, perhaps the alcohol could form an oxonium ion, making it a better leaving group.

Wait, but if H+ is present, perhaps it's a scenario for a Claisen-like rearrangement. The Claisen rearrangement involves allyl vinyl ethers rearranging into gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. But in this case, the starting material isn't an allyl vinyl ether. Wait, but 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine... maybe it's reacting with the alcohol?

Alternatively, considering that the amine has two methoxy groups. Maybe it's a scenario where the amine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the protonated alcohol. Let's see: but-3-en-2-ol would have the OH on C2, and a double bond between C3 and C4. Under acid, the OH would protonate, making it a better leaving group. The amine could attack the adjacent carbon, leading to some kind of ring formation?

Wait, if the amine attacks the adjacent carbon, considering the structure, maybe a six-membered ring would form. Let me draw this out.

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine: the structure is (CH3O)2CH-NH2. So the amine is on a central carbon attached to two methoxy groups. The but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2C(OH)=CH2? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, perhaps a better way: the structure is CH2CH2 with the OH on C2 and a double bond between C3 and C4. So it's CH2CH2-C(OH)=CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2-CH2? No, wait the numbering. Let's correct that. But-3-en-2-ol: the molecule is CH2CH2-CH(OH)-CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CH-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, no, because but-3-en-2-ol would have four carbons, double bond between C3 and C4 (but that's not possible because but-3-en would imply a four-carbon chain with double bond between C3 and C4, but that's beyond the chain length. Oh, wait, but-3-en-2-ol must be CH2CH(OH)-CH2-CH2? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. But-3-en-2-ol: the structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, because the double bond would be between C3 and C4 in a four-carbon chain, which isn't possible. So perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH? No, that's 2-en-1-ol, I think. Wait, perhaps my confusion arises. The correct structure is CH2CH2... Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, that would be but-
