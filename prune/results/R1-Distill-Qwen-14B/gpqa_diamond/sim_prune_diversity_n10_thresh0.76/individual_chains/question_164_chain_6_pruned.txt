Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass, right? The question is about figuring out the mass of two systems and then comparing them. Let me try to break this down.

So, the problem says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses, which I think refers to the orbital period of the binary system. So the orbital period for system_1 is 2 years, system_2 is 1 year.

Then there are spectroscopic observations about radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, 15 km/s and 10 km/s. I remember that the radial velocity method is used to detect exoplanets, but here it's for binary stars. The amplitude of the RV curve depends on the mass of the companion and the inclination of the orbit, among other factors.

Wait, right, in a binary system, each star orbits the common center of mass. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum speed at which the star moves toward or away from us. The formula for K is related to the mass of the companion and the system's orbital period.

I think the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_p + M_s)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )) ) ... Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Alternatively, perhaps the relation between the masses of the two stars and their RV amplitudes.

Oh, right! In a binary system, the two stars orbit each other. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, right? Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star. So the star with the smaller mass will have a larger orbit, hence a larger velocity amplitude, because velocity is proportional to the size of the orbit and inversely proportional to the period. Wait, or is it more about the mass ratio?

Wait, let's think about the mass ratio. Let’s say in system_1, the two stars have RV am
