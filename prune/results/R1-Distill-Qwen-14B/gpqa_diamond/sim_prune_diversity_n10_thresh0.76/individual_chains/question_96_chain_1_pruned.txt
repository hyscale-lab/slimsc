Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because black holes aren't my strongest topic. But I'll try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the entropy of a supermassive black hole given its angular size. Hmm.

Alright, let me read the question again. The event horizon's angular size is theta equals 1e-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 1e10 parsecs. We need to find the entropy's order of magnitude. The options are A to D, with exponents varying a lot.

Wait, entropy of a black hole. I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, specifically the area of the event horizon. Oh right, the formula is S = A c^3/(4 Ä§ G k_B), where A is the area, and the constants are Planck's hbar, gravitational constant G, and Boltzmann's constant k_B. So entropy scales with the area of the event horizon.

So first, I need to find the radius of the event horizon, then calculate the area. Alternatively, maybe I can find the radius from the angular size and distance.

The angular size formula is theta (in radians) equals the size divided by the distance. So theta = R / d. But wait, theta is given in degrees, so I need to convert it to radians first.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Convert theta from degrees to radians.
2. Calculate the radius R = theta_rad * d.
3. Compute the area A = 4 pi R^2.
4. Plug A into the entropy formula and compute S.

Okay, let's start with step 1. Theta is 1e-17 degrees. To convert degrees to radians, I multiply by pi and divide by 180. So theta_rad = (1e-17) * (pi / 180). Let me compute that numerically. Pi is about 3.1416, so pi/180 is roughly 0.0174533 radians per degree. So 1e-17 degrees is about 1.74533e-19 radians.

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 1e-17 degrees * (pi rad / 180 deg) = (1e-17) * (pi/1
