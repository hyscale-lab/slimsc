Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's think about what that could be. The options are A to D, each with different structures.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 are medium to strong. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretches, like in amines or amides, or maybe O-H groups. But wait, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Carbonyls in esters, amides, ketones, etc., usually show up around there. So maybe an amide or an ester?

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has several signals. Let's break them down:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, probably from a CH2CH3 group, so maybe an ethyl group attached to something else.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe an exchange, like an amine or an OCH2 group. But wait, at 4.0, maybe it's attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 connected to something else, like an ester.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, which is usually a CH2 next to another CH2. Maybe the OCH2 in an ester group. So if it's a quartet at 4.5, perhaps it's part of an ethyl ester. Because in ethyl groups, the two CH2s would be split into quartets and triplets.
- 7.0 and 8.0 ppm (both d, 2H each): Those are aromatic protons. Two doublets each with 2H suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in a para-substituted ring, each set of equivalent protons would be a doublet. So that's probably a substituted benzene, maybe with substituents in the para positions.

Putting this together, the aromatic region suggests a mono-substituted benzene ring, but wait, no, two doublets each with
