Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions 1, 2, and 3, each producing products A, B, and C respectively. There are four options, each providing possible answers for A, B, and C. My goal is to figure out which option is correct by analyzing each reaction.

Let's start with the first reaction:
Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A

Hmm, the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. The conditions are H+ and heat. I remember that under acidic conditions, enol ethers can undergo Claisen rearrangement. Wait, but what's the structure here?

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be like (CH3O)2CH-NH2. Wait no, wait: ethan-1-amine is NH2CH2CH3. But 1,1-dimethoxy would mean two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So structure is CH2(OCH3)2NH2. That's a bit crowded, but okay. But wait, wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. 1,1-dimethoxy would have two OMe groups on the first carbon. So the structure would be (MeO)2CHCH2NH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is NH2CH2CH3. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be (OCH3)2CHCH2NH2? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's H2N-C(OCH2CH3)2? Wait, no, because 1,1 would be on the same carbon as the amine.

Wait, maybe it's like (OCH3)2CH-CH2NH2? Or perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's more like the amine is on the same carbon as the two methoxys. So the structure is H2N-C(CH2O
