Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to calculate the enthalpy of formation of this compound. Hmm, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a long name. I should probably draw the structure first to understand how many bonds I'm dealing with.

Wait, the enthalpy of formation is usually calculated using bond energies, right? The formula I remember is something like taking the bond energies of the reactants and products. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

So, the general approach is: calculate the total bond energies of all the bonds broken in the reactants and subtract the total bond energies of all the bonds formed in the product. But wait, I might have that backwards. Because enthalpy of formation is the energy released when forming bonds, I think it's the sum of bond energies of reactants minus the bond energies of products. Or is it the other way around? No, wait. Enthalpy of formation is the energy change when forming the compound. So for the formation reaction, we have elements (like H2 and C) combining to form the compound.

Wait, maybe I should think about it as the sum of all the bonds broken (in the reactants) minus the sum of all the bonds formed (in the product). Because when you break bonds, you're putting energy in (endothermic), and when you
