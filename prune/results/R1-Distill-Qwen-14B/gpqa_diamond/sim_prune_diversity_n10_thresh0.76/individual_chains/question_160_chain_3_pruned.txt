Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. When a monochromatic light of wavelength λ falls vertically on it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. And the options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, creating a diffraction pattern. The shape of the aperture affects the diffraction pattern. For a single slit, the minima occur at certain angles determined by the width of the slit. But this is a polygon with a very large number of sides, so I guess it approximates a circle when N is infinitely large.

Wait, wait. Oh right! When N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle. So the problem reduces to finding the minima for a circular aperture. Oh, but I thought the circular aperture's diffraction pattern is called the Airy disk. The central maximum is surrounded by concentric rings, and the first minimum is at a certain angle.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm a bit confused. For a single slit, the minima are given by a*sinθ = mλ, where m is the order, and a is the slit width. The first minimum is at m=1. But for a circular aperture, the minima are found using the Bessel functions, right? The first minimum occurs at approximately θ = 1.22λ/(π a), something like that.

Wait, let's think again. The question says the apothems are all the same length 'a'. So for a polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So as N goes to infinity, the polygon becomes a circle of radius 'a'? Or wait, is the apothem the same as the radius when N is infinite?

Wait, no. Apothem for a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which is equal to the radius of the inscribed circle. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem, because each side's midpoint is at a distance 'a' from the center. Oh, wait, no. Wait, a regular polygon's apothem 'a' is related to its radius (the distance from center to a
