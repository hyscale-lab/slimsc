Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but let's think through this.

The question says there's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and also figure out the form of f.

Wait, right. I remember that for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is a function of θ. The maximum power is along the equator, I think. For a dipole, the radiation is maximum at θ=90 degrees, and the pattern is something like sin²θ. Oh wait, no, for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern varies as sin²θ, so the intensity is maximum at θ=90 degrees because sin(90) is 1. But wait, in that case, the intensity would be highest perpendicular to the dipole's axis.

But wait, the question is about an oscillating charge distribution. So maybe it's similar to a dipole but perhaps a different order multipole? Or maybe it's a dipole situation here.

Wait, the charge distribution is spheroid, which would imply some symmetry. If it's oscillating, maybe it's an oscillating dipole. The dipole's radiation pattern is known.

In the far field (radiation zone), the power radiated per unit solid angle is given by the radiation intensity, which for a dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2. Oh, so the intensity peaks at θ=90 degrees. So the maximum intensity is when θ=90°, and the intensity is zero along the axis (θ=0 and θ=180).

Wait, but the problem says that the maximum power is A. So the maximum value of f would be at θ=90°, and f would be zero at θ=0 and θ=180. So the function f(θ) would be proportional to sin²θ, right?

So for θ=30 degrees, sinθ is 0.5
