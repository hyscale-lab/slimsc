Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about the reaction of an anhydride with a cyclopentadiene derivative, leading to two products, and then analyzing their NMR spectra.

First, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. I remember that dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride by losing a water molecule. The structure of the anhydride probably has two ester groups connected by an oxygen bridge because it's a cyclic anhydride, maybe something like a six-membered ring if the starting diacid was appropriate.

Next, the anhydride's NMR data: the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. Wait, 7 ppm is usually aromatic, but wait, maybe it's something else. Or perhaps it's an olefinic proton? Because if it's an anhydride from a diacid with a cis-alkene, the resulting anhydride might have a conjugated double bond. Let me think: when you dehydrate a diacid with a cis double bond, the resulting anhydride would have a trans double bond because the dehydration would usually form a more stable (trans) alkene. But the NMR shows a singlet at 7 ppm; maybe it's a doublet of protons but they're equivalent, so it appears as a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single set of protons, maybe a pair of equivalent protons on a double bond.

Wait, the 13C NMR has two peaks in the 13C spectrum: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Carbonyl carbons are usually higher, like around 165-220. 137 is probably a carbon adjacent to a double bond, like a CH2 or CH group next to an sp2 hybridized carbon. Hmm. So maybe the anhydride has a structure where the carbonyl groups are in a ring, and there's a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, the anhydride is formed from a cis-alkene diacid. So originally, the diacid had two carboxylic acid groups connected by a cis double bond. Dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride. The structure would have the double bond possibly between the two carbonyl groups. So perhaps the anhydride is a five-membered ring? Wait, no—more likely a six-membered ring, like in maleic anhydride. Wait, maleic anhydride has a structure with two carbonyl groups and a double bond between them in a five-membered ring. But wait, the 1H NMR of maleic anhydride has two sets of protons: the ones adjacent to the carbonyl are around δ 6.5-7.5, I think. But in this case, the question says the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, so perhaps it's a monosubstituted double bond, but the two protons are equivalent, giving
