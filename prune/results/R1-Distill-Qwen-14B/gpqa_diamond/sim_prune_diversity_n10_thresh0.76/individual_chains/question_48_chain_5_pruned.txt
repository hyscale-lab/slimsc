Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem starts with cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? So it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first reaction is treating it with bromine, which forms product 1.

Wait, what happens when a ketone reacts with bromine? Oh right, in the presence of a base, like maybe in a nucleophilic addition? Or wait, no, bromine can also undergo electrophilic addition. Since cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, bromine might add across the double bond. But wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond; the carbonyl is a C=O. Oh, right! So maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's the addition of Br to the carbonyl group. I think that's called the haloform reaction, but wait, no, that's when you have multiple carbonyl groups, like maybe with acetone. Hmm, maybe it's a bromination via enolate formation?

Wait, when ketones react with bromine, I think they can undergo a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but bromine is more likely to act as an electrophile. Oh wait, maybe it's the bromination of the carbonyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is an addition across the carbonyl, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, another thought: cyclohexanone and bromine in a non-polar solvent might undergo an electrophilic addition. Wait, no, the carbonyl is a double bond, so bromine could add across it. Wait, but adding Br2 to a ketoneâ€”oh wait, I think that's the ketone undergoing a bromination via a cyclic bromonium intermediate. So the Br would add to the carbonyl, making a di-substituted bromide. Wait, but cyclohexanone has a carbonyl, and adding Br2 would give a dibromide. But wait, more accurately, when a ketone is treated with bromine, maybe it's a 1,2-addition, forming a geminal dibromide. Oh right! That's called the haloform reaction precursor. So cyclohexanone would react with excess bromine to form 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? Or wait, maybe it's not an addition but a substitution? No, substitution would require a good leaving group, which the ketone isn't. So yes, addition. So product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if it's using a different condition, like perhaps in a basic solution, it could form an enolate which then adds Br2. But the question doesn't specify the conditions, just says treated with bromine. So perhaps it's a straightforward addition.

So, product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. I think that's correct.

Next step: product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to form product 2. So, 1,2-dibromocyclohexane treated with NaOH. Hmm, what's that reaction? Well, when a vicinal dihalide (
