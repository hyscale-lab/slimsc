Okay, I'm trying to solve this enamine reaction problem. Hmm, I remember that enamines are typically formed from secondary amines and carbonyl compounds. Wait, the reaction here starts with an enamine, so I guess it's undergoing some kind of reaction.

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Let me visualize that structure. So, the enamine has a nitrogen attached to a methyl group and a pentan-2-ylidene group. Pentan-2-ylidene is like a CH2CH2 group with a double bond? So the enamine would have a structure where the amine is connected to a substituted double bond.

The question is about what reagents are used (A) and what the product (B) is. The options give different sequences of reagents and products. Let me think about the steps involved in enamine reactions.

Enamine reactions often involve two steps: first, deprotonation to form the enamine, then alkylation, and finally hydrolysis. Wait, but in this case, since the starting material is already an enamine, perhaps the reaction involves some kind of alkylation.

Wait, looking at the reagents, I see options with LDA, DME, and CH3CH2I. LDA is a strong base, usually used to deprotonate things. DME is a solvent, dimethyl ether. CH3CH2I is ethyl iodide, a good alkylating agent
