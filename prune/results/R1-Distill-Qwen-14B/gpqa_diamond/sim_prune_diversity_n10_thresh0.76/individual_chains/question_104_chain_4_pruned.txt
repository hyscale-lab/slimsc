Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets, and the shifts in the spectral lines are given as 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so the RV method's shift relates to the star's velocity. The formula I remember is that the velocity of the star (v) is given by ( (G * (M_planet) ) / (4 * pi^2) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(M_star + M_planet))^(1/3) ) * (1 / (a * (1 - e^2)^(1/2))) ), but I'm probably mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the RV semi-amplitude (K) is proportional to (M_planet * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1/(a^(1/2)) )).

But wait, another approach: the RV method's measured velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. From what I recall, the semi-amplitude K of the velocity is given by:

K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (1 / ( (1 year)^2 * (1 AU)^1 )^(1/3) )) * something... Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for K.

Wait, I think the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ]^(1/ )... Hmm, maybe I should look for a simpler relation between the RV shifts
