Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Sometimes, these reaction mechanisms can get a bit tricky, but I'll take it slowly.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage-like structure. So 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two opposite faces maybe? 

When heated with excess KOH at 240Â°C, it creates a light yellow solid product 1. They give the 1H NMR spectrum of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. 

Hmm, IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 probably has a ketone group. Let's think about what reaction that would be. KOH is a strong base. If we have a dihalide reacting with KOH, it's likely an elimination reaction. Since there are two bromines, perhaps a double elimination? Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes. But then why the ketone?

Wait, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo a double dehydrohalogenation. If it's a vicinal dihalide, two adjacent Brs, elimination would form a double bond. But wait, adamantane is a cage structure, so maybe the bromines are on adjacent carbons. But when KOH is used, especially in elimination, maybe it's forming an alkene. But how does that lead to a ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, wait, that's for esters. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's more for amines. Or maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement? Wait, pinacol is when a 1,2-diol loses water to form a carbonyl. But wait, product 1 is from a dihalide. Oh, wait a second. Wait, when dihalides undergo dehydrohalogenation, especially in a strong base, they can form alkenes. But if there's another possibility, like a base-induced elimination forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. Alternatively, the reaction conditions could be leading to elimination and then some kind of ring expansion or contraction. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is undergoing a double E2 elimination, leading to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, the initial structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me imagine adamantane. It has a structure where each carbon is connected to three others, forming a diamond-like lattice. 1,3-dibromo would place Br on two opposite positions perhaps. When treated with KOH, which is a strong base, the Brs may undergo elimination. Since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two E2 eliminations occur, leading to the formation of a diene or something else. But how does that form a ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the treatment with KOH leads to the formation of a ketone. Wait, but normally KOH wouldn't create a ketone from a dihalide. Hmm. Maybe the dihalide is undergoing a nucleophilic substitution, but with two leaving groups... Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination, but each elimination forms a carbonyl group. Oh wait, that's the pinacol mechanism, but that's for diols. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism. Not sure.

Alternatively, another possibility: when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they can undergo elimination to form an alkene. But in this case, the product has a ketone. So maybe after elimination, there's a rearrangement that forms a carbony
