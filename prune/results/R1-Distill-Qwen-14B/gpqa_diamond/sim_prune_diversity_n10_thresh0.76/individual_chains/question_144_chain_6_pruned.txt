Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's see what I can remember. The question is about finding the mean decay distance for this meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D, with some very small distances in meters.

Wait, mesons are bosons, right? And they are composed of a quark and an antiquark. But how does that relate to decay distance? I think the decay distance is related to how long the particle lives before decaying. So the mean lifetime would determine how far it travels before disintegrating.

I remember that the mean lifetime τ of a particle is related to its decay width Γ. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ. Oh, but wait, Γ is the total decay width, so the lifetime is inversely proportional to Γ. So a larger Γ means a shorter lifetime, which would mean a shorter decay distance.

But wait, how do I get from Γ to the distance? Oh right, the decay length is the product of the particle's speed (or velocity) and its mean lifetime τ. So the decay distance L is approximately v * τ.

Wait, but how do I find v? The velocity of the particle can be found from its energy. Since the production energy is given as E = 8 GeV, which is higher than the
