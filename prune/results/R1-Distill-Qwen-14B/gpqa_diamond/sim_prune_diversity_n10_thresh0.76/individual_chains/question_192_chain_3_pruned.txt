Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The setup is a spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor is uncharged, so it starts with zero charge. The cavity has a radius r, which is smaller than R, the radius of the conductor. There's a point P outside the conductor, so L is greater than R. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l, which is also bigger than R. The angle between l and s (which is the distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity) is theta.

Wait, the problem says that a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. So the conductor itself is neutral, but the presence of this charge will induce some effects. I remember that when a conductor encloses a charge, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Oh right, the inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to q, and the outer surface will have some induced charge too. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor would be the sum of the inner and outer induced charges.

Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the induced charges must balance out. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q because the conductor's total charge is zero. Because the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, the conductor's net charge is zero. Oh wait, wait. No, wait: the conductor was uncharged, so the inner induced charge is -q, and the outer induced charge must be +q to balance it, because the conductor's total charge is zero. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the conductor is neutral, the total charge on it is zero. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q, so that the conductor's total charge is zero. Because the conductor's initial charge is zero, so inner (-q) and outer (+q) sum to zero.

But wait, when the charge +q is inside the cavity, the cavity is inside the conductor. So the conductor has to have induced charges. The inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity)
