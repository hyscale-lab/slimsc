Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I remember that luminosity has to do with the amount of light a star emits. 

Alright, let's read the details. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. And the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times bigger than Star_2's mass. So M1 = 1.5 * M2. Interesting, both radius and mass are 1.5 times. But wait, I don't think mass directly affects luminosity in the same way as radius and temperature do. Oh right, because stars don't necessarily emit more light just because they're more massive unless other factors are considered, like maybe their temperature or size.

The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's about the peak emission wavelength. I remember Wien's Law, which states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the black body. So lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If the lambda_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2. That's a key point.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But wait, the problem says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest to be the same. So maybe the rest wavelengths are the same, but due to Doppler shift, perhaps their observed wavelengths differ? Or does the radial velocity affect the calculation of their temperatures? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think.

Wait, no. The problem states that they used spectroscopy to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and they found those wavelengths to be the same. So the observed lambda_max is the same. But if Star_2 is moving, its spectrum would be Doppler shifted. So perhaps the rest frame lambda_max is the same, but because Star_2 is moving, the observed lambda_max would be different unless
