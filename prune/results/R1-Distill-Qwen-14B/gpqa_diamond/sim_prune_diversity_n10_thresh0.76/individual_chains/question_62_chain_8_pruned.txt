Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting my head around these synthesis problems. Let's take a deep breath and break this down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me parse that structure. So, the main parts are a cyclohexane ring substituted with a carbaldehyde group (so a -CHO) and another substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait, cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl would be a CH2 group attached to a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl ring, right? So the structure is like cyclohexane with two substituents: one is a -CHO, and the other is a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon?

Wait, no, more accurately, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part would be a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde (CHO) attached. The substituent at position 1 is the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, position 1 on the cyclohexane ring is connected to a CH(OH-Cyclohexyl) group. So the molecule has two cyclohexane rings: one as the main ring, and the other attached via a CH2 group which also has an OH.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So, structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

So I need to figure out the reagents that would take ethynylcyclohexane to the target compound. Let's think about the possible reactions and steps.

Let me start by mapping out the steps needed.

First, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. The target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, which suggests that somewhere, a carbonyl has to form. Also, the substituent has a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl attached. So perhaps some kind of oxidation or addition reactions are involved.

Wait, ethynyl group is a triple bond. One approach with triple bonds is to perform a hydration reaction. For example, using H2O with a catalyst, which would add water across the triple bond to form a carbonyl group. Alternatively, other methods might be involved.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane. Hydration of the triple bond would typically give either an aldehyde or a ketone, depending on the conditions. For example, using HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration) might add H2O to form a ket
