Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about an experiment where a researcher reacts (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, they checked using TLC and found that the reactant spot diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to determine which of the given options are the possible products.

Hmm, so the starting material is an ether. The structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me try to visualize that. The benzene ring has an oxygen connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is 3-en-1-yl, meaning the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So, positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. But wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, butenyl would have a double bond. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH2? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the position of the double bond: but-3-en-1-yl would mean the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but butenyl is four carbons, so positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. Wait, that can't be right because but-3-en-1-yl would imply a double bond between 3 and 4 on a four-carbon chain starting at position 1. So, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, I must be getting confused. Let me draw it out.

The group is but-3-en-1-yl. So, the chain is four carbons, with the double bond starting at carbon 3. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that doesn't have a double bond. Wait, no, wait the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3? No, wait. Wait, butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- or something else. Let me think: but-3-en-1-yl. So, the substituent is O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at position 3. But wait, that can't be. Because in a four-carbon chain, the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, that doesn't make sense because position 3 is the third carbon from the point of attachment (which is position 1). So, the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, that would be O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-, but the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? But that would be O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth? That doesn't make sense because that would be the end, so it's O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- but with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that's not possible because that would require a fifth carbon or so. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the substituent is attached at position 1, and the double bond is between 3 and 4. So, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O- attached to benzene? No, wait, but that would be but-1-en-3-yl or something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the numbering
