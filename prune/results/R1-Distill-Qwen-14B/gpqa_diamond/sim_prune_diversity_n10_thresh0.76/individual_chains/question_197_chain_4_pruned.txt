Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting its product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are involved in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups, maybe an ester or something like that.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. The big peak between 3400 and 2500 usually indicates an -OH group or maybe an alkyne or amine, but more likely an -OH because of the broad nature of such peaks. Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is typical for an ester (C=O) or maybe a ketone. Also, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound probably has a benzene ring.

Now the 1H NMR data: There's a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's a strong indication of a phenolic OH proton. Phenols usually have protons around 10 ppm. Then at 8.0 ppm, a doublet with 2H, and 7.2 ppm another doublet with 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Like maybe two substituents opposite each other on the benzene. The two doublets could be two sets of protons each adjacent to substituents. 

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could be a CH adjacent to something, maybe a carbonyl. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be two neighboring CH2 groups, perhaps part of a chain. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of CH3, probably attached to a CH that's next to a carbonyl. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, like the end of an ethyl or longer chain.

Putting this together, the benzene ring is para-substituted. The substituent groups would be a phenolic OH and another group. Wait, but the IR had a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is likely a carbonyl. So the substituents on the benzene might be a hydroxyl group and an ester or another carbonyl-containing group.

Wait, but another possibility is that the substituent is an acyl group, perhaps an ester or a ketone. Let's think: if the substituent is an ester, like OAc (acyloxy), but the IR suggests a carbonyl, so maybe a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet. That's not typical for an ester. Esters usually have carbonyl groups, but their protons (like the ester oxygen's adjacent) don't show up that high. Oh wait, maybe that's the phenol O-H. So the ring has a phenol group and another substituent.

Looking at the rest of the NMR: the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH group next to the carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) might be two CH2 groups, and 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH that's next to something else. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a CH3 at the end of a chain, like an ethyl or longer.

So maybe the structure is something like para-substituted phenyl group with a side chain that has a carbonyl. Like, perhaps an aryl ester or a ketone.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720, which is around where esters are. So maybe the substituent is an ester group. Let's think: the molecule could be a substituted phenyl ester.

Another approach: The NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is probably a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, no. A triplet at 0.9 would be a terminal CH2CH3. So perhaps a chain like CH2CH2CH3 attached to something else.

Let me try to sketch a possible structure. The benzene ring is para-substituted. One substituent is a phen
