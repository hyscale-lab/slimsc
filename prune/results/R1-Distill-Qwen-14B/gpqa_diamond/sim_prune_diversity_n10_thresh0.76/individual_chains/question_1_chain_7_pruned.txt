Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and the uncertainty in time for each state is roughly that lifetime. So for E1, the lifetime (Δt1) is 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 seconds. 

Wait, but how does that apply to the energy difference between E1 and E2? Let me think. If we're trying to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy for each state is smaller than ΔE. Because if the uncertainty is larger, you can't distinguish the two.

Wait, maybe I should model it as each state having an uncertainty in energy due to their lifetime. For state E1, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE1 = ℏ / (2 * Δt1). Similarly, for E2, ΔE2 = ℏ/(2 * Δt2). Then, the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than the sum of these two uncertainties? Or maybe just greater than each individually? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference between E1 and E2 (ΔE = E2 - E1) needs to be greater than the uncertainty in energy of either state, so that the two can be resolved. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, the two states would
