Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let me start by going through the question step by step.

The molecular formula of the compound is C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 4, since it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds) and a double bond or ring elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring and a ketone or aldehyde group.

Looking at the NMR data: 
- 9.72 ppm as a triplet (t, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests maybe coupling with two neighboring protons, but wait, in an aldehyde, the proton is usually deshielded and doesn't have neighboring protons, so maybe it's a triplet due to coupling with two protons elsewhere. Hmm, but aldehydes are usually as singlets because they don't have adjacent Hs. Unless... wait, maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde? Or maybe it's a conjugated system where the aldehyde is adjacent to another group. Or maybe it's a triplet because it's coupling with two other Hs, like from a vinyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's an enol form. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Other NMR signals:
- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d, 2H). That's probably aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. Since it's a doublet, each H is next to one H. So perhaps in a para-substituted benzene, each proton has one neighbor.
- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d, 2H). Another aromatic region, maybe a para-substituted ring adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. Because the chemical shift is lower than the previous one (6.51 vs 6.98), perhaps it's a ring with substituents that are more de-shielding, like a nitro group or an aldehyde. Wait, but the aldehyde is elsewhere.
- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad suggests perhaps exchange, like if it's a hydroxyl proton, but wait, that's 2H. Or maybe it's a vinyl proton, like in a conjugated system. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents causing them to be deshielded but not as much as the others. Alternatively, could this be a di-substituted benzene with some symmetry? Or maybe it's a diene
