Okay, so I've got this question here about a diatomic molecule and some quantum model stuff. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the same as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we're supposed to find the momentum of a photon it absorbs to switch to the next lowest energy state. 

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next higher energy state. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, there are both vibrational and rotational energy levels. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational level (like J=0 or maybe J=1? Not sure. Wait, I think for a diatomic, the rotation starts at J=0, but for a rigid rotor, J=0 is the ground state. But this is the non-rigid rotor model, so maybe there's some vibration involved.

Wait, maybe the molecule is in the ground state of both rotation and vibration. So when it absorbs a photon, it can either go to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy," which probably refers to the lowest energy transition. Because higher vibrational states have higher energy jumps than rotational states, perhaps the photon would cause a vibrational transition.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the molecule is in the lowest state of both vibration and rotation. So when it absorbs a photon, it can make a transition to the next allowed state. The next state could be an increase in vibrational quantum number (v=0→v=1) or an increase in rotational (J→J+1). But the question is about the lowest possible energy—so the photon would have the minimum energy required for any allowed transition.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the energy levels. Vibrational energy levels are quantized as Ev = (v + ½) h ν, where ν is the frequency. Rotational energy levels are Er = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The rotational constant depends on the moment of inertia, which is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

So the total energy is Evib + Erot.

In the fundamental state, the molecule is in v=0 and J=0. When it absorbs a photon, it could go to v=1, J=0 or J=1, or even higher J, but the next state in energy would be the one with the least energy required. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the smallest possible energy jump. So which transition requires less energy: a vibrational or a rotational one?

The vibrational transition (v=0 → v=1) would require an energy of h ν. The rotational transition (J=0 → J=1) would require energy of 2B, since ΔJ=1, so ΔErot = B ( (J+1)(J+2) - J(J-1) ) Wait, no, J goes from 0 to1. So ΔErot = B (1*(2) – 0*(1)) ) = 2B. So which is bigger, h ν or 2B? It depends on the values.

But wait, the question says the molecule is modeled with the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor. Oh, but wait, non-rigid rotor allows J to change, but the bond length isn't fixed. But the key point is the energy levels.

So the question is, which transition (vibrational or rotational) requires less energy. Because the photon with the least momentum would correspond to the lower energy transition.

So I need to calculate both h ν and 2B and see which is smaller.

The given data: mass of X is 20 amu, Y is 2 amu, bond length R is 2 angstroms, angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

First, let's compute the vibrational energy quantum. The energy per photon is E_vib = h ν, where ν = w/(2π) ?

Wait, wait. The angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s. So the frequency ν is w/(2π) = (4e14)/(2π) ≈ (4e14)/6.28 ≈ ~6.366e13 Hz.

So E_vib = h ν = Planck's constant * frequency. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s.

So E_vib =6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ let me compute that.

6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 = (6.626 * 6.366) e (-34 +13) → approx 42.25e-21 = 4.225e-20 J.

Wait, no, 6.626 *6.366 ≈ 42.25? Wait, 6 *6 is 36, 6 *0.366 is ~2.2, 0.626 *6 is ~3.756, 0.626 *0.366 is ~0.229. Adding up: 36 +2.2 +3.756 +0.229 ≈ 42.2. So yes, 42.2e-21 J → 4.22e-20 J.

Now let's compute the rotational energy jump. The rotational energy for J=0 to J=1 is ΔErot = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = B [1*(1+1) - 0] = 2B.

B is the rotational constant, given by B = h/(8π² c I), where I is the moment of inertia. Wait, no, I think B is (h/(8π² I)) * something... Wait, the formula is B = (h/(8π² I)) * (1/(k)), but wait, no. Let me recall the rotational energy levels:

Erot = B J (J+1), where B = (h²)/(8 π² I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, correct formula: B = (h²)/(8 π² I c), wait no, I think B is given by (h²)/(8 π² I), but I'm a bit confused. Wait, the rotational constant in terms of spectroscopy is B = (h/(8 π² I c)) when considering wavenumbers, but in terms of energy, I think it'sErot = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I).

Wait, let me get the formula right. The energy levels for rotation are given by:

Erot = (J (J + 1) h²) / (8 π² I)

So the rotational constant B in energy terms is B = h²/(8 π² I).

So for J=0 to J=1, ΔErot = B * [1*(2) - 0] = 2B.

But wait, B is (h²)/(8 π² I), so ΔErot = 2*(h²)/(8 π² I) = (h²)/(4 π² I).

So let's compute I, the moment of inertia. I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

The reduced mass μ is (mX * mY) / (mX + mY) ), but the masses are given in amu, so I need to convert them to kg.

Masses: mX =20 amu, mY=2 amu. So μ = (20 *2 )/(20+2) amu = (40)/(22) amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 20 and 2, so 20+2=22. 20 *2=40. So yes, 40/22 is about 1.818 amu.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ =1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute this.

1.818 * 1.6605 = approx: 1.8*1.66 is about 2.988, but more accurately:

1.818 *1.6605 = (1.8 *1.6605) + (0.018 *1.6605 )
= 2.9889 + 0.0299 (approx 0.03)
= ~3.0188e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg → correct?

Wait, 1.818 *1.6605 is:

1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889

0.018 *1.6605 = 0.02989

Total: 2.9889 +0.02989 = 3.01879 → 3.01879e-27 kg.

So I is μ R².

R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

So I = 3.01879e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01879e-27 *4e-20 → 12.075e-47 kg m² → 1.2075e-46 kg m².

So B is (h^2)/(8 π² I)

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J²·s².

So 8 π² I is 8*(9.8696) *1.2075e-46 → 8*9.8696 ≈78.9568; 78.9568 *1.2075e-46 ≈ 95.31e-46 →9.531e-45 kg m².

So B = (4.39e-67) / (9.531e-45) ≈4.39e-67 / 9.531e-45 ≈ approx 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

4.39e-67 /9.531e-45 = (4.39/9.531) * 1e-22 → since 1e-67 /1e-45 is 1e-22.

4.39 /9.531 ≈ 0.4603.

So B ≈0.4603e-22 J →4.603e-23 J.

So the energy difference for rotation is ΔErot =2B = 2 *4.603e-23 =9.206e-23 J.

Now, comparing E_vib and ΔErot.

E_vib was about 4.225e-20 J.

ΔErot is 9.2e-23 J.

So E_vib is much larger. So the rotational transition is lower in energy. So the photon would cause a rotational transition, because that's the lower energy jump.

Wait wait, but the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. So when it absorbs a photon, it can go to either v=1, J=0 or J=1, v=0, whichever requires less energy.

So the next possible state is the one with the lower energy transition.

But wait, some models only allow certain transitions. For example, in vibration, the selection rules are Δv=±1. But for rotation, ΔJ=±1. So from J=0, it can go to J=1.

So the photon would cause either a vibrational transition or a rotational transition. But since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon's energy is determined by the rotational transition.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state is the one with the least energy increase. So the photon's energy should match the smallest possible ΔE.

So in this case, the rotational ΔErot is much smaller than the vibrational ΔE, so the photon's energy is h ν_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but wait. The photon's momentum p is related to its energy by E = p c, but wait, that's for photons. Oh wait, photons have energy E = h f and momentum p = E/c. Because for photons, p = h f /c = (h/(2π)) * (w)/(2π) ) * (1/c) ?

Wait, no. For a photon, E = h ν, and momentum p = E/c. So p = h ν / c.

Wait, but in this case, the photon's energy is the same as the energy difference of the transition. So if the molecule absorbs a photon with energy equal to ΔErot (9.2e-23 J), then the momentum of that photon is p = E/c.

So p = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) → 3e8 is 3*10^8.

Compute 9.2e-23 /3e8 = (9.2/3) * 1e-31 ≈3.0667e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, 9.2e-23 divided by 3e8 is 9.2/(3) =3.066..., exponent is -23 -8= -31 →3.066e-31 kg m/s. But the options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28.

Hmm, none of the options match that. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy difference. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should be using the rotational constant expressed in terms of wavenumbers or something else. Or maybe the question is considering the vibrational transition. Because the numbers in the options are much larger than what I got with the rotational transition.

Wait, the options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. My rotational p came out to ~3e-31, which is way smaller than the options.

So perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me go back.

I think I messed up the formula for B. Because sometimes B is given in terms of the rotational constant in cm^-1, which is different. Hmm.

Wait, the correct formula for the rotational energy levels is:

Erot = B J (J + 1), where B = (h²)/(8 π² I c) * c, or is it something else?

Wait, maybe I should use the rotational constant in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, I think the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia as B = (h)/(8 π² I). So, Erot = B J (J +1).

Wait, earlier calculation: I = μ R² = ( (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) ) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, 20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg.

Similarly, 2 amu is 3.32e-27 kg.

Wait, wait no. Wait, 1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg. So 20 amu is 20 *1.66e-27 = 3.32e-26 kg. 2 amu is 2 * 1.66e-27 =3.32e-27 kg.

So the reduced mass μ is (mX * mY)/(mX + mY) = (3.32e-26 kg *3.32e-27 kg) / (3.32e-26 +3.32e-27) kg.

Wait, numerator: (3.32e-26)(3.32e-27) = (3.32)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.02 *1e-53 = 1.102e-52 kg².

Denominator: 3.32e-26 +3.32e-27 = 3.32e-26 (1 + 0.1) )=3.32e-26 *1.1 =3.652e-26 kg.

So μ = 1.102e-52 / 3.652e-26 ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, okay, that's the same as before. So I is μ R² =3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 =1.2068e-46 kg m².

So B = h² / (8 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * π² *1.2068e-46).

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 * π² *1.2068e-46 → 8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568 →78.9568 *1.2068e-46 ≈ 95.3e-46 → 9.53e-45 kg m².

So B =4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 = (4.39e-67)/(9.53e-45) = (4.39/9.53) * 1e-22 → ~0.460e-22 →4.60e-23 J.

So the energy difference for J=0→1 is 2B=9.20e-23 J.

Hmm, that's correct.

So the momentum of the photon is p = E/c.

E=9.20e-23 J.

c=3e8 m/s.

So p=9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.066e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are all around 1e-27 to 1e-28, which is much larger. So none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about which transition is being considered. Maybe the problem is looking for a vibrational transition.

Wait, but the rotational transition requires less energy. So if that's the case, but the options don't have that value, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition that involves both vibration and rotation. Wait, but no, the next state with the lowest energy would be the one with the least energy change, which would be the rotational.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition as the main one, and the rotational as higher. But in that case, the photon's energy would be higher than the rotational, which would make the momentum higher.

Wait, but the options don't match either.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_vib.

Wait, E_vib = h ν.

Earlier I computed ν as w/(2π), which is correct.

w=4e14 rad/s → ν=4e14/(2π) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So E_vib=6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 = ?

6.626e-34 *6.366e13 → 6.626 *6.366 ≈42.25 →42.25e(-34 +13) →42.25e-21 →4.225e-20 J.

So that's correct.

So E_phot =4.225e-20 J.

Then, p_phot = E / c =4.225e-20 /3e8 → 1.408e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 1.4e-28 N·s (since Ns is kg m/s).

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the rotational transition requires less energy, so why would the photon's energy be that of the vibrational transition?

Ah, because perhaps I misunderstood the question. Maybe the molecule is in the fundamental state, meaning v=0 and J=0, but when it absorbs a photon, it's the combination of both transitions. Or perhaps the question is considering the next state as the combination of the next possible state, which could be a vibrational transition.

Wait, but the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the minimum energy increase.

So the minimal energy transition is the rotational one (9.2e-23 J), but the photon's energy in that case is 9.2e-23 J, which would lead to p=3e-31 Ns, which isn't in the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me try another approach.

Wait, maybe the rotational constant is in terms of angular frequency. The rotational constant B in terms of angular frequency is given by B = (h)/(8 π² I), but perhaps I'm mixing up units. Alternatively, another formula might help.

Wait, the moment of inertia I is μ R².

So, B = h²/(8 π² I) = (h²)/(8 π² μ R²).

So, let's compute B again.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

μ =3.017e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

So I=3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.017e-27 *4e-20 =1.2068e-46 kg m².

So,

B=(6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * π² *1.2068e-46)

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 * (9.8696) *1.2068e-46 = 8 *9.8696=78.9568 → 78.9568 *1.2068e-46 = approx 78.9568 *1.2068 = ~95.23 →95.23e-46 =9.523e-45.

So,

B=4.39e-67 /9.523e-45 →approx 4.608e-23 J.

Same as before.

So I'm confident B is correct.

Thus, the rotational transition's photon has p=3.06e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.06e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are that small. So perhaps the question is considering a vibrational transition, despite it having a larger energy.

But why? Because the options don't have that. Wait, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28.

Wait, if I compute p_phot for E_vib: p =4.225e-20 J /3e8 m/s →1.408e-28 kg m/s →1.4e-28 Ns. That's option D.

But earlier I thought that the rotational transition is lower in energy. So why would the correct answer be a higher energy transition?

Wait, perhaps the selection rules allow only certain transitions. For example, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, transitions can involve both vibrational and rotational changes. But the question is about the molecule moving to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the smallest ΔE.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition where both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers change, but that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the next state in terms of the vibrational state, not considering rotation. Because the problem says "the next state with the lowest possible energy," perhaps it's considering the first possible transition in the model, which is the vibrational one.

Wait, but if the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and after absorbing a photon, it can go to v=1, J=0 or J=1, v=0, or other combinations, but the next state in energy would be whichever requires the least energy.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels are such that the first excited state is when vibration increases (v=1, J=0), and the next is when rotation increases (v=0, J=1). So the next possible state with the lowest energy is the rotational, but if the photon's energy corresponds to that, the options don't match.

But the options only have D as 1.4e-28, which is the p for the vibrational transition.

So perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the rotational transition is lower. Let me re-calculate the energy of the rotational transition.

ΔErot =2B=9.2e-23 J.

E_vib=4.2e-20 J.

So E_vib is about 4.5e2 times larger than ΔErot.

So the rotational transition is much lower in energy, which would require a photon with much lower energy and thus lower momentum.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the question is considering only vibrational transitions, ignoring rotation. Or perhaps the model is such that the next state is a vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the molecule is in a vibrational state and the next transition is vibrational. But that doesn't make sense with the given question.

Wait, perhaps the calculation for the rotational energy is wrong. Let me check B again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate B in terms of the rotational constant in terms of angular frequency, not energy.

Wait, another formula: B = (h²)/(8 π² I), which is energy. So B is in joules.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate B in terms of cm^-1 or something else. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy difference for the vibrational transition, which is E_vib= h ν. As before, E_vib=4.225e-20 J.

Then, p= E/c =4.225e-20 /3e8 =1.408e-28 kg m/s, which is 1.4e-28 N·s. That's option D.

But why would the photon cause a vibrational transition when a rotational transition requires less energy? Unless the rotational transition is not allowed. But the question says the model is the non-rigid rotor, which allows for rotational transitions.

Hmm, maybe the problem is that for a diatomic molecule, the selection rules for rotation are ΔJ=±1, but for vibration, Δv=±1. So, if a photon is absorbed, it can cause a transition where both v and J change. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the one with the least ΔE.

But from our earlier calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's momentum would be much smaller than any of the options.

This is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of μ.

Wait, the masses are Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

So μ = (20 *2 )/(20+2) ) amu =40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

Yes, correct. So 1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ=1.818 *1.6605e-27 ≈3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, but double-checking: 20 amu is 20 *1.6605e-27= 3.321e-26 kg.

2 amu is 3.321e-27 kg.

So, μ= (3.321e-26 *3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 +3.321e-27)= numerator: (3.321e-26)(3.321e-27)= (3.321)^2 *1e-53 ≈11.02 *1e-53=1.102e-52.

Denominator: 3.321e-26 +0.3321e-26=3.653e-26.

μ=1.102e-52 /3.653e-26 = approx 3.017e-27 kg.

Correct.

So I think the calculations are correct.

Thus, the rotational transition is much lower in energy, but the options don't include it.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the next state as the first excited state, which is vibration only. In that case, the photon's momentum is option D.

But why would the rotational transition be ignored? Maybe because the rotational transition is not allowed in this model? No, the non-rigid rotor model allows for rotational transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition where both vibrational and rotational changes occur, but that would require more energy than either alone.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition, matching option D.

Looking at the options:

Option D: p=1.4e-28 Ns → which is exactly what we get from the vibrational transition.

So perhaps the answer is D.

But why? Because the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy—so if the rotational transition is possible, why isn't it selected?

Wait, perhaps in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are such that the first transition (v=0→v=1, J=0) is higher in energy than the next rotational transition (v=0, J=1). But no, the rotational transition is lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the rotational energy.

Wait, the rotational energy for J=0→1:

ΔErot = B (1*(2) -0) )= 2B.

B = h²/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2/(8 π² *1.2068e-46 )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67.

Denominator:8 π² *1.2068e-46 →8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568 →78.9568 *1.2068e-46 = approx 95.3e-46 →9.53e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 =4.60e-23 J.

So ΔErot=2*4.60e-23=9.20e-23 J.

E_vib=4.22e-20 J.

So E_vib is about 450 times larger.

So the photon's momentum would be E/c =9.20e-23 /3e8 =3.066e-31 kg m/s → 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the question is expecting the vibrational transition and the answer is D.

But why would that be the case? Because the rotational transition is much lower in energy, but perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition as the next state regardless.

Alternatively, perhaps the model being used doesn't include rotational transitions. But the question states it's the quantum rotation-vibration model, which includes both.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about possible errors.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me try using B in terms of the rotational constant in terms of wavenumbers. Wait, the rotational constant is often expressed as B = h/(8 π² c I), where c is the speed of light in m/s. Then, the rotational energy is h c B J(J+1). So in that case, the energy difference would be h c (2 B).

Wait, that might change things. Let me try that.

Wait, if B is h/(8 π² c I), then the energy would be E = h c B J(J+1).

So, B = h/(8 π² c I).

I =1.2068e-46 kg m².

So,

B =6.626e-34 / (8 * π² *3e8 *1.2068e-46 )

Denominator:8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568 →78.9568 *3e8 =2.3687e10 →2.3687e10 *1.2068e-46 =2.86e-36.

So,

B=6.626e-34 /2.86e-36 →approx 231.7 →2.317e2 cm^-1.

Wait, that's the rotational constant in wavenumbers.

Then, the energy difference for J=0→1 is 2 h c B.

So,

ΔErot =2 * h *c * B.

h=6.626e-34, c=3e8 m/s, B=2.317e2 cm^-1 → convert to m^-1: 2.317e2 *1e2 m^-1 =2.317e4 m^-1.

So,

ΔErot=2 *6.626e-34 *3e8 *2.317e4.

Compute step by step:

6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

1.9878e-25 *2.317e4 = approx 4.607e-21.

Multiply by 2: 9.214e-21 J.

Wait, that's about 9.2e-21 J, which is larger than E_vib=4.22e-20 J.

So in this case, the rotational transition requires more energy than the vibrational one.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Earlier, in terms of energy, the rotational transition was lower, but now using this approach, it's higher.

This is confusing. I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, alternative approach: the rotational constant in terms of energy is B = h²/(8 π² I).

Which is what I calculated earlier as 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy for J=0→1 is 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J, which is much smaller than E_vib=4.2e-20 J.

So earlier conclusion holds.

So why is the photon's momentum not matching any option?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering both rotational and vibrational transitions, but the photon's energy must account for both.

Wait, but in that case, the photon's energy would be higher than either, which doesn't match the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually considering the vibrational transition, and the options are correct as per that.

In that case, the answer is D.

But I'm not entirely confident, but given the options, I think the intended answer is D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state (v = 0, J = 0), and the goal is to find the photon momentum corresponding to the smallest energy transition.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Vibrational Transition Energy**:
   - The vibrational energy levels are quantized as \( E_v = (v + \frac{1}{2}) h \nu \), where \( \nu = \frac{w}{2\pi} \).
   - Given \( w = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \), the frequency is:
     \[
     \nu = \frac{w}{2\pi} = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}.
     \]
   - The energy difference for the vibrational transition (\( v = 0 \to v = 1 \)) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (6.366 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.225 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
     \]

2. **Rotational Transition Energy**:
   - The rotational energy levels are \( E_J = B J (J+1) \), where \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} \) and \( I = \mu R^2 \).
   - The reduced mass \( \mu \) is:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{m_X m_Y}{m_X + m_Y} = \frac{(20 \, \text{amu})(2 \, \text{amu})}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]
     Converting to kilograms (\( 1 \, \text{amu} \approx 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)):
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]
   - The bond length \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), so the moment of inertia is:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = (3.017 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2068 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
     \]
   - The rotational constant \( B \) is:
     \[
     B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 (1.2068 \times 10^{-46})}.
     \]
     Numerator: \( (6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2 \approx 4.39 \times 10^{-67} \, \text{J}^2 \cdot \text{s}^2 \).  
     Denominator: \( 8 \pi^2 (1.2068 \times 10^{-46}) \approx 9.53 \times 10^{-45} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \).  
     Thus:
     \[
     B \approx \frac{4.39 \times 10^{-67}}{9.53 \times 10^{-45}} \approx 4.60 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - The energy difference for the rotational transition (\( J = 0 \to J = 1 \)) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \times 4.60 \times 10^{-23} = 9.20 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]

3. **Comparison of Transitions**:
   - The vibrational transition energy (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \)) is much larger than the rotational transition energy (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \)):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.225 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.20 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - Since the rotational transition requires less energy, it corresponds to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

4. **Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition**:
   - The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - For the vibrational transition:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.225 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.408 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires less energy, but the calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\( \sim 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns} \)) does not match any of the provided options. However, the momentum for the vibrational transition (\( 1.408 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)) matches option **D**. Given the options, the intended answer is likely the vibrational transition.
