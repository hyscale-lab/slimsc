Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. And the question is asking what's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A to D, with B being 1. Wait, because the speed of light in a vacuum is c, which is taken as 1 here, so in glass, the speed is c/n, or 1/n since c is 1. But wait, the glass is moving, so maybe there's a relativistic effect to consider.

Wait, but Newtonian mechanics might not work here because it's about light. Light's speed is always c in vacuum, but in a medium, it's less. But when the medium itself is moving, does that affect the observed speed? I remember something about Galilean relativity where velocities just add up, but that's for objects. But light is tricky.

So, considering the glass is moving. The glass's speed is v. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, and the glass is moving towards the observer. So the light's speed in the medium is v_light = c/n, but that's in the medium's frame. But if the medium is moving, how does that affect the lab frame's measurement?

Wait, I think this is related to the Doppler effect, but maybe not exactly. Or perhaps it's about how the velocity transforms when the medium is moving. Let me think about the frame of reference.

In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is v_light = 1/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So we need to find the speed of light as observed in the lab frame. Wait, but how does the movement of the medium affect the observed speed of light inside it?

Wait, no, in the case of a medium moving with velocity v, the speed of light in that medium as observed from the lab isn't just simply adding v to the speed inside the medium. Because when the medium is moving
