Okay, so I need to figure out which compound is C9H11NO2 based on the given spectral data. Hmm, let's start by analyzing the data step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. So, the formula is CnHmOxNp. The degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x - p)/2. Plugging in the numbers: n=9, m=11, x=2, p=1. So that's (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2 = 6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which is 3), so maybe it's a substituted benzene. Or maybe a ring plus a double bond or something else. Let me think.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are broad, which might suggest N-H stretching. Amines or amides have N-H stretches. The 1720 cm-1 peak is strong, which is typical for a carbonyl group, like an ester, amide, or ketone maybe. But looking at the options, some are amides or esters.

Now, the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) - a triplet, likely a CH2CH3 group, so an ethyl group. The triplet with 3H suggests it's attached to a CH2.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) - broad singlet, 2H. Could be NH2, but the broadness might suggest it's exchanging, like an NH group. Or maybe it's an OCH2 group, but I'm not sure.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) - quartet, 2H. A quartet usually comes from splitting with a neighboring group with two protons. So maybe this is a CH2 that's adjacent to another CH2. For example, in an ester group, like OCH2CH2O or something. Wait, ethyl esters usually have a triplet around 1.2 and a quartet around 4.1 for the OCH2. But here, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm.

Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are split into two doublets, each with two protons. So maybe the ring is substituted with two groups in the para positions. Or, more likely, one substituent with two protons in the para positions. Wait, no: if it's a para substituent that's deactivating, the ring might have two doublets each for two protons, which fits a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. Alternatively, perhaps a substituent that's meta, but I think para is more common for such coupling.

Wait, the two doublets could be from a substituent in the para position, like a nitro group, but that's not in the options. The substituents could be an amino group and another group. Let's think about the options.

Now looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: benzamide with ethoxy group at position 3. So the substituents would be at meta. But then the NMR would show more complex splitting for the aromatic protons. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in meta which could lead to different splitting. Hmm, but the given NMR shows two doublets, which suggests two sets of two protons each, which is more like para substitution.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So
