Okay, so I have this question about qPCR, and I'm a bit rusty on the details, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, a scientist is running a quantitative PCR. He made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it in serial dilutions and ran three technical replicates each time. The efficiency was 100%, R² was 1, and the slope was -3.3. 

Looking at the results, the Ct values for each dilution are provided. The higher the dilution (lower copies per microliter), the lower the Ct value. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, higher concentrations should have lower Ct because there's more starting material, so it reaches the threshold sooner. So yeah, 100000 copies have a Ct around 34, and it's lower as the concentration drops. That makes sense.

The question is about the discrepancies in his results. The options are A to D. The possible explanations are listed.

Hmm. The question is asking which option explains the discrepancies. So the data given must show some sort of issue.

Looking at the options:

Option A: qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. Well, the scientist is using it for quantification, so if this were true, his method is wrong. But the efficiency is 100% and R² is 1, which is perfect for a standard curve. So probably A is not correct.

Option B: Ct values don't agree with target amount. Wait, but in the data, the Ct values do align with the dilutions. The higher the copy number (100000, 10000, etc.), the higher the Ct. So if the data is correct, this wouldn't be an issue. So perhaps B is not the right answer.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Hmm, wait. The slope of the qPCR curve is -3.3. The slope in a qPCR standard curve is calculated as log10(copy number) vs Ct. The formula for the slope (m) is m = - (log10(efficiency) ) / log10(efficiency) * (1/ln(efficiency))... Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, the standard formula for the slope is m =
