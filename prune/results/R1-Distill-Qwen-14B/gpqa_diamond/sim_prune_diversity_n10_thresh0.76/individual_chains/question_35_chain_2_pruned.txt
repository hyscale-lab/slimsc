Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The setup is that Ay is given as a 2x2 matrix which is c times S. Oh right, c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

So, the question is asking which statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors is correct. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, this should be manageable.

Let me write down the matrix S first. S is:

[ 0   -i ]

[ i    0 ]

So, Ay is c multiplied by S. So, c is h/(4π). So,

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Wait, but maybe I should think about this in terms of Pauli matrices. Wait, S looks familiar. Oh, right! The Pauli matrices. The Pauli Y matrix is exactly S. Because Pauli Y is:

[0 -i]

[i 0]

Yes, so Ay = c * Y, where Y is the Pauli Y matrix. So, I can think of Ay as (h/(4π)) times the Pauli Y matrix.

But wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Oh, but wait, in this case, the coefficient is h/(4π). Let me double-check. Let's compute the eigenvalues.

The general approach is to find the eigenvalues by solving det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So, the matrix Ay is:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0            (h/(4π))*(-i) ]

[ (h/(4π))*i             (h/(4π)) *0 ]

So, Ay is:

[ 0          -i h/(4π) ]

[ i h/(4π)     0      ]

So, the matrix is:

[ 0           a ]
[ -a*          0 ]

where a = i h/(4π) ?

Wait no, because the second row first element is i (h/(4π)), so the matrix is:

[ 0, -a ]

[ a, 0 ]

where a = (h/(4π)) * i ?

Wait, let me compute a. Because the (2,1) entry is i*(h/(4π)), so let me write a as i*(h/(4π)). So the matrix becomes:

[ 0       -a ]

[ a        0 ]

So, the matrix is anti-diagonal with
