Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Standard Model extension and the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Standard Model's Higgs sector has a potential V(φ, S, H), and when the Higgs field gets a vacuum expectation value (VEV), it breaks the electroweak symmetry. The Goldstone bosons are eaten by the W and Z bosons to give them masses. But sometimes, when there are multiple scalars, some Goldstone bosons remain as pseudo-Goldstone bosons, especially if there's a custodial symmetry or something like that.

Looking at the Lagrangian provided, I see terms like iN̄_R γ^μ ∂_μ N_R, which are for singlet fermions. Then there's the scalar part: (1/2)(∂μ φ)^2, |D^μ S|^2, and the interaction terms including y_i φ N̄_iR^c N_iR^c, and the potential V(φ, S, H). The fields φ, S, and H seem to be scalars with specific quantum numbers.

The given VEVs are ⟨φ⟩^2 = x² + v², where ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, perhaps φ is the field that gets a VEV, and h is another scalar, maybe the Higgs? Or perhaps φ is the Higgs and h is another field? Wait, the problem states ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v. So φ has a VEV of x, and h has a VEV v. And φ and h are parts of the scalar field content.

The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections. I remember that in the Standard Model, the Higgs mass can receive quantum corrections, especially from loops involving top quarks, W bosons, etc. The formula for the Higgs mass squared typically gets contributions from the top quark mass squared and other particles.

Wait, but this is an extended model. So maybe the potential is more complex. The potential V(φ, S, H) would determine the masses of the Higgs bosons. Since there are multiple scalars, there might be multiple Higgs bosons. The φ field is a singlet, so maybe it's part of a two-field model, like the inert doublet model or something else.

The pseudo-Goldstone boson arises when a symmetry is broken but not completely. For example, if the custodial symmetry is respected, the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone (like the Higgs in the SM) is protected. But in extensions, without such symmetry, the mass can get corrections.

Radiative corrections to the mass would come from loops. The mass squared would get contributions proportional to the sum of the masses of the
