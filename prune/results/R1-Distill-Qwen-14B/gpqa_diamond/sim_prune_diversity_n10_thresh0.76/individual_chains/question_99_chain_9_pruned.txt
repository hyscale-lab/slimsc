Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is the right one based on the spectroscopic data given. Let me start by going through each part step by step.

The question says that the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since the compound is a carboxylic acid (they all end with COOH), that makes sense. The O-H stretch in carboxylic acids is usually broad because the hydrogen is easily dissociable.

Then there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's in the range of a carbonyl group (C=O). Carboxylic acids have a strong carbonyl peak around there, so that fits. So the IR data supports that it's a carboxylic acid.

Now looking at the 1H NMR. The question mentions that none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the compound doesn't have any double bonds, which suggests that any possibility with a double bond is out. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't remember any with double bonds. All the options are structures with branching and methyl groups, so maybe I don't need to worry about that. But just to double-check, the structures:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So that's a carboxylic acid with a CH2 group before the COOH. The structure before that is a carbon connected to two ethyl groups and two CH3 groups? Wait, no. Let me parse it properly. The formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So that would be a central carbon connected to another central carbon, each with two substituents. Wait, maybe it's a geminal diethyl group or something else. Hmm, maybe it's a more branching structure.

Wait, the NMR says several peaks, none are vinyl. So no alkenes. So the structures are all single bonds, which they are.

The NMR has some complex splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm. Let me think about what that implies.

Firstly, the splitting patterns can tell us about the neighboring protons. A doublet of triplets of quartets suggests that each proton is split by multiple neighboring groups. Let's break it down.

Let's say a proton is next to another group that has n protons. The splitting would be a multiplet with (n+1) peaks. So for the first part, a doublet implies that the proton is next to a CH that has 1 proton. But that's not possible unless it's a CH2 or something else. Wait, perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, which is adjacent to something else.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each split is due to coupling with adjacent groups. So a doublet means one neighboring group with one proton (like a CH2 next to a CH). Wait, no. Splitting is based on neighboring protons. Let's think of the splitting in order.

The first part is a doublet. So each proton is split into a double
