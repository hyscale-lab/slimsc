Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model extension and the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Hmm, I remember that pseudo-Goldstone bosons come into play when there's a spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the Higgs mechanism is involved. Let's try to think through this step by step.

The Lagrangian given has several terms. Let me parse it. There's a term for the singlet fermions N_R, which are (1,1,0) under SU(2)×U(1)×something. The scalar doublet S is (1,2,1), so it's like a regular Higgs doublet maybe? And the scalar phi is a singlet, (1,1,0), so similar to the Higgs in the Standard Model but perhaps part of a different sector.

The potential V(ϕ, S, H) is there, but I don't have the exact form. The vacuum expectation value (VEV) of phi is given as ⟨ϕ⟩² = x² + v², so ⟨ϕ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v. Wait, h is another field here, maybe the physical Higgs? Or perhaps phi has a component that becomes the Higgs after symmetry breaking.

Wait, in the Standard Model, the Higgs field is a doublet, but here S is a doublet, and phi is a singlet. So maybe S is the Higgs doublet, and phi is another scalar field. But the problem is about the mass of H₂, which is a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons arise when a symmetry is broken but there's some explicit symmetry breaking, leading to a mass that's small compared to the symmetry breaking scale.

In the Standard Model, the Higgs is a Goldstone boson of the breaking from SU(2)×U(1) to U(1)Y. But when you include higher-order corrections, like loops, the Higgs mass can get contributions from other particles. So in an extension, the pseudo-Goldstone's mass would get radiative corrections from various sources.

The question is about the radiative correction approximation for H₂
