Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is a standard problem. The potential is like a 3D version of the simple harmonic oscillator, so the energy levels should be quantized in a specific way.

The question is asking for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that same energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, I think I need to recall how the energy levels work for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. From what I remember, in 3D, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh right, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, maybe that's not exactly right. Let me think. In 3D, each direction (x, y, z) contributes a quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z. The total energy is the sum of each direction's energy. So each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, right? So the total energy would be [n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2] ħω.

But wait, I also remember that for the isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are characterized by the principal quantum number n, which is the sum n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy can be written as E_n = (n + 3/2) ħω. Oh wait, n here is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. So each state is determined by the combination of n_x, n_y, n_z such that their sum is n.

Now, the question is about the third excited state. So I need to figure out what the third excited state corresponds to in terms of n.

Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy. Then the first excited state is the next one, and so on. So let's think about the order. The ground state (n=0) would have energy (0 + 3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be n=1, giving (1 + 3/2) = 5/2 ħω. The second excited state is n=2: (2 + 3/2) = 7/2. The third excited state is n=3: (3 + 3/2) = 9/2 ħω. So the energy should be (9/2) ħω, which is 4.5 ħω.

Looking at the options, options A and C have (9/2) ħω. So the first part is either A or C.

Now, the second part of the question: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to the same energy eigenvalue. So that's the degeneracy of the energy level for n=3.

The degeneracy for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator at level n is given by (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Wait, is that correct? Or maybe it's (n + 2 choose 2), which is (n+2)(n+1)/2. Let me think. The number of states for a given n is the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers n_x, n_y, n_z. That's a classic stars and bars problem.

The formula for the number of solutions is (n + 3 - 1) choose (3 - 1), which is (n+2 choose 2). So that's (n+2)(n+1)/2.

So for n=3, that would be (3+
