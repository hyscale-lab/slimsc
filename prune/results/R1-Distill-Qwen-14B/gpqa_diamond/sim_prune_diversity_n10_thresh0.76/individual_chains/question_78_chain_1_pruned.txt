Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in the electromagnetic field due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a point r and time t, given a charge q moving along some trajectory. The charge was at position s(t) at time t, and the fields are observed at a later time t.

I remember that when a charge is moving, it's not just the Coulomb potential we consider. Because the charge is moving, we have to account for the fact that the fields take time to propagate, and there's the radiation fields as well. But wait, this is about potentials, not the fields directly.

Wait, the scalar potential for a static charge is V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, maybe there's a correction involving the velocity. Or perhaps the potentials are modified because of the retarded time.

Oh right! For a moving charge, the potentials are based on the retarded time. The idea is that the potential at a point depends on where the charge was some time ago, not where it is now. The time it takes for the influence to travel at the speed of light.

So the scalar potential V would depend on the position of the charge at an earlier time. The same goes for the vector potential A. But how exactly do they look?

Let me think about the formula for the scalar potential. Normally, it's V = q/(4πε₀ r), but considering the motion, there's a term involving the velocity. Wait, but when the charge is moving, perhaps the expression for V changes. Or maybe I should think about the potentials in the context of retarded time.

Wait, the vector potential A is usually given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) multiplied by something. Because the vector potential is related to the current, which involves the velocity of the charge.

Looking at the options, option C and D have terms involving (dc - d·v) and (dc + d·v) in the denominator. Those must be related to the distance at the retarded time.

Wait, let me recall the exact expressions. The scalar potential for a moving charge is V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(c (r - (v/c)(r·v)/|v|² )) ), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, the denominator might involve the term (d c - d·v), where d is the vector from the charge's position at time t_r to the observation point r.

Wait, d is the vector from the point where the field was generated (at time t_r) to the observation point r. So d = r - s(t_r), but s(t_r) is the position of the charge at time t_r. Hmm, but in the options, I see expressions like (d c - d·v), which suggests a denominator combining the distance and the velocity.

The scalar potential V is often (q/(4πε₀)) times 1 over (d c - (d·v)). Because the denominator would involve the product of the speed of light and the distance, minus the component of the velocity along d. That makes sense because it's accounting for the time delay and the movement of the charge.

So looking at the options, option C has V = (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), but wait, why is there a c in the numerator? Hmm, wait no. The standard form for V might be q/(4πε₀ (d c - (d·v))) multiplied by 1/c or something. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by V = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(r - (v t_r)/c)), but maybe that's not the right way to think about it. Alternatively, the denominator is (d c - d ⋅ v), where d is the displacement vector from the charge
