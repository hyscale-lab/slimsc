Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. The options are labeled A to D.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. It says there's a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. Broad peaks are common for alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids, but wait, if it's very broad, maybe it's a strong O-H like in a carboxylic acid or a phenol. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol but that's usually a less broad peak. Hmm.

Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. The 1650 peak could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an amide, but we don't have any info about N here.

Wait, but if the compound has two carbonyl peaks, what could that mean? Maybe one is a ketone (around 1700) and the other is an ester or something else. Or maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is conjugated, like an aromatic ring with double bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. The 1650 could be the conjugated double bond, like C=O with an adjacent double bond, causing the peak to shift a bit lower.

Now, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, right? So that suggests that the compound has a double bond, perhaps in an alkene or maybe conjugated with something else. So maybe the compound has an alkene group. Also, if the IR has a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl, perhaps it's an ester or a ketone with a double bond nearby.

Looking at the Mass Spec: fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? Well, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH3 (dimethyl ether) but that's 45 but that's more like 45 for (CH3O-) but wait, I'm not sure. Another thought: the CH3CO+ ion is 43, but that's not 45. Or maybe a COO group? Wait, 45 could be the fragment of a ketone or something else
