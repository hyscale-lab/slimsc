Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. Let me think through the steps and possible issues.

The setup is that they're creating a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G gene is overexpressed. They've modified the gene to include a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with the plasmid using Lipofectamine and are selecting antibiotic-resistant colonies. But the protein isn't overexpressing as expected.

Looking at the problem, the main issue is probably with the construct they made. Let's look at the provided DNA sequence.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then, the next few codons are TAC, which is tyrosine, but wait, the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. HA is typically derived from the influenza virus and has a specific amino acid sequence, like YPYDVPDYA. So, the HA tag would come right after the start codon.

But in the given sequence, the start is ATG, followed directly by TAC. Let me see: the first part is ATGTACCCATACGATGTT... So the reading frame here is important. Let me translate this.

ATG is methionine. TAC is tyrosine. CCATAC is maybe something else. Wait, let me think: the HA tag's coding sequence should be inserted right after the start codon. I'm wondering if the HA tag is actually present in the construct.

Looking at the options, option A is about a missense mutation in the HA sequence. But wait, the current sequence doesn't have the HA tag? Or does it? The user said they introduced the HA determinant into the construct. So the first part should be the HA tag, but the provided sequence starts with ATG TAC, which is Met Tyr.

Wait, the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. Let me think about the DNA sequence encoding that. The amino acid sequence is Y (TAC), P (CC), Y (TAC), D
