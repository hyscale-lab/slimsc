Okay, so I have this genetics problem here, and I need to figure out which mutation will eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar. Let me start by understanding the question.

So, the situation is that there's a drought-resistant barley plant, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and then they sequenced the target gene in all mutants. The changes are in the first exon area. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound.

I remember that the anti-nutritional compound is probably a product of the gene's expression. So, if the gene is not functional, the compound won't be made. Therefore, the mutation should disrupt the gene's function.

Looking at the options, all the mutants have changes in the first exon. Exons are the parts of the gene that code for the protein, so any mutation here could affect the protein structure.

I need to look at each mutant's sequence compared to the intact gene. Let's write down the changes.

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing:
Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTT...
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTT...
So, in the first part, it's TTTCTC changed to TTCTAC. Let me count the bases. The intact gene's first part is positions 1-10 maybe? Let's see:

Positions 1-10 of intact: ATGTTTCTC GCTG...
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTAC GCTG...

So, in the first few codons, there's a change. Let's see the codon changes.

In the intact gene, the first part is ATG TTT CTG GTC... Wait, let me break it down into codons.

ATG is the start codon, methionine.

Then TTT is Phe, CTG is Leu, GTC is Val.

In Mutant 1, the sequence is ATG TCT ACG GCT...

So, the second codon in mutant is TCT which is Ser, whereas it was TTT (Phe) in the intact. Third codon: ACG is Thr, whereas in the intact it was CTG (Leu). Then GCT is Ala. So, in the mutant, the second and third codons have changed. So, the amino acids are changing from Phe, Leu, Val to Ser, Thr, Ala.

So, the protein structure is altered here. But would that eliminate the compound? Maybe, but it depends on whether those residues are critical for the enzyme's function.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact, let's see:

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTT...
Mutant 2: ATGTTCTAA GCTGGTACTT...
Wait, so in positions where the intact has CT CGC, the mutant has CT AA G. Let's see the codons.

Intact has TTT (Phe), CTG (Leu), GTC (Val) etc.

Mutant 2: TCT (Ser), then AAG (Lys), then GCT (Ala)... So, the first three codons would be Met, Ser, Lys, Ala, whereas the intact is Met, Phe, Leu, Val. So, amino acids change here.

Wait, but looking at the sequence again, perhaps the mutation is a frameshift or a stop codon? Let me check the length.

Wait, the lengths seem similar. The intact and mutants are same length. So, no frameshift. So, substitution mutations.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant 2, the second codon is TCT (Ser) instead of TTT (Phe), third codon is AAG (Lys) instead of CTG (Leu). So, two substitutions.

But what about the position of the mutation? The first exon is early in the gene. So, any early mutation could affect the entire protein structure.

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact:

Intact: ...ACTTCTGTGGA...
Mutant3: ...GTCACTTCTGTGGA...

So, the change is in the sequence after the initial part. Let me see:

Original: ...GTC GTCA CT...
Wait, no
