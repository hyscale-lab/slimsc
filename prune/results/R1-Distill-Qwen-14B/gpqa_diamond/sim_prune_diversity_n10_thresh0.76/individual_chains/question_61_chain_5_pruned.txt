Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step. Let me see what the question says.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with benzene and going through several steps to produce a final product. The options are different biphenyl compounds with substituents. My goal is to figure out each step of the reaction sequence to determine what the final product looks like.

First, I'll break down each reaction step by step.

Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.
Hmm, I remember that nitration involves using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as a catalyst. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution here. The nitration of benzene typically introduces a nitro group (-NO2) as the substituent. In benzene, the nitro group can enter in any position, but the meta director is possible. Wait, no, nitro is a strong meta director. So when benzene is nitrated, the nitro group will be added in the meta position, but wait, wait. No, benzene is symmetric, so nitration would produce a single product, nitrobenzene.

Wait, no, actually, benzene has only one position, but nitration adds a nitro group, so product 1 is nitrobenzene. Right, nitration of benzene yields nitrobenzene, which is meta directing because nitro is a strong meta-directing group.

Wait, no. Wait, benzene doesn't have any substituents, so the first nitration would add nitro in the ring, but since benzene is symmetric, it's just nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2.
So, product 1 is nitrobenzene. Now, treating nitrobenzene with Br2 and Fe. Oh, that's a bromination reaction. Since nitro is a strong meta director, the bromine will enter at the meta position relative to the nitro group.

Wait, nitro groups are meta directors. So in nitrobenzene, bromination would add Br in the meta position. So the structure of product 2 would be
