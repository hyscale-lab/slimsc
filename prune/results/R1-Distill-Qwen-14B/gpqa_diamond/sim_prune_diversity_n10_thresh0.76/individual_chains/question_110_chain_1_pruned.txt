Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. The stars are Star1 to Star5, and the options are combinations of these stars. The question is asking which two can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

First, I need to understand the capabilities of each spectrograph. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with a V magnitude brighter than 17 mag. That means anything with V less than or equal to 17 is observable. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so V ≤16.

Wait, no, wait, I think I got that wrong. The way it's phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" — but wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star with apparent magnitude 17 is fainter than 16. So if a spectrograph can observe stars brighter than 17, that means it can see stars up to 17 mag or brighter (so lower magnitude), right? Or wait, maybe I'm confused.

Wait, the way it's written: "brighter than 17 mag" implies that the spectrograph can pick up stars that are brighter (so lower magnitude) than 17, meaning they can see stars with V magnitudes up to 17. Because anything brighter than 17 would have a lower apparent magnitude. So, stars with V ≤17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V ≤16.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the opposite. Because when they say "brighter than 17 mag", it's in terms of apparent magnitude. So a star that's brighter (has a lower apparent magnitude) than 17 is observable. So both spectrographs can only observe stars that are bright enough (i.e., not too faint).

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The apparent magnitude scale is such that lower numbers mean brighter objects. So if a star's apparent V magnitude is 15, it's brighter than a star with 16. So when the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, it means that the apparent V magnitude of the star must be less than 17. So if a star has V=16, it's brighter than 17, so it can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, it can observe stars brighter than 16, so V ≤16. So any star with V ≤16 can be seen by both, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES can only go up to 16. So the limiting factor is HIRES's 16 magnitude.

Wait, no. Wait, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17. So stars with V ≤17 mag. HIRES can observe stars with V mag brighter than 16, meaning V ≤16. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must
