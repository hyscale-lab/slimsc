Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So the scenario is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar. That's good because droughts can be a big problem for crops. But there's this anti-nutritional compound in it, making it unusable for food. So the goal is to eliminate that compound. They found the gene responsible and it has five exons and four introns. Then, they used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and looked at the target gene sequencing.

The question is asking which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So I think it's about finding a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, perhaps through a loss-of-function mutation.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different sequence change in the first exon. The intact gene and each mutant's sequences are given, so I need to compare them.

Intact gene sequence (partial):
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the first part is ATG, which is the start codon. Then TTT, CTC, GCT, etc.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking at the start: Intact is ATGTTTCTC... Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACG... So let's break it down. Intact has TTTCTC. Mutant 1 has TTCTAC.

Wait, let me look at the exact differences. Let's line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, no. Wait, the sequences are longer, so perhaps I should compare the exact letters.

Wait, let me write the sequences for the beginning.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Hmm, so the first part of the intact gene is ATGTTTCTCGCTG... and Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCTG... So, comparing the first few nucleotides.

Intact: positions 1-20: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT

Wait, so let me look at the specific changes. Let's see the exact letters where they differ.

In the intact gene, after ATG comes TTT, then CTC, then GCT, etc.

In Mutant 1, after ATG, the next is TTCTAC, so
