Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions, but I'll give it a shot.

The question starts with toluene being treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitric acid is a nitrating agent, and sulfuric acid is a catalyst. So, when toluene undergoes nitration, it should form nitrotoluene. Wait, where does the nitro group attach? Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene. Nitration typically occurs at the para position because the methyl group is an activating group, making the ring more reactive. But wait, sometimes ortho can be a possibility too. Oh, right, methyl is an activating group, so nitration occurs in the presence of H2SO4, which is a strong acid and a catalyst. So the product 1 should be para-nitrotoluene. Or is it possible to get a mixture? No, I think product 1 refers to the major product, which is para.

Next, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. I remember that under acidic conditions, nitrotoluene can undergo oxidation. The nitro group is a meta-directing group. The oxidation of nitrotoluene... Wait, when the nitro group is attached to a benzene ring, especially in the para position relative to a methyl group, what happens when oxidized? Oh, right, the methyl group attached
