Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance based on the given relationship. Let me try to break this down.

The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. Oh right, parallax is related to distance. Oh yeah, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. But wait, sometimes in astronomy, I think parallax is in arcseconds and distance in parsecs, so plx (in arcseconds) equals 1/d (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx.

But the problem is about how N changes with distance, right? So I need to express the number of stars N in terms of distance r (since the question says 'per unit range of distance, r').

Wait, the question is about how N changes with distance. So let's think about N as a function of d. Since plx = 1/d, we can substitute plx in terms of d.

So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Substituting plx = 1/d, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the question is asking about how N changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then that's the trend. So for each unit increase in distance r, the number of stars increases by r^5. But wait, no, because the relation is N ∝ d^5, so the number increases rapidly with distance.

Wait, but the options are about the change per unit range of distance. So, for example, if you go from d to d + delta_d, the number of stars added would be proportional to (d + delta_d)^5 - d^5. But when delta_d is small compared to d, this difference is approximately 5 d^4 delta_d. So the density of stars per unit distance would be proportional to d^4. But wait, the question is slightly ambiguous. Let me read it again.

The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Hmm, perhaps it's asking for the rate of change of N with r, i.e., dN/dr. If N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be 5 r^4. So the number of stars increases by about r^4 per unit distance. But wait, the options are about how N changes with r. So for each unit of r, the change is like r^4.

Wait, no, perhaps the question is phrased as N varies with plx as 1/plx^5. So N = k / plx^5, where k is a constant. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in gives N = k r^5. So N increases as r^5, meaning that the number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

So for a given distance r, the number of stars is proportional to r^5. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, so the number increases as r^5. Therefore, the correct option would be option B) ~ r^5.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Are they asking for the derivative, or just the trend? The question says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)." Maybe they're asking for the number per unit distance, which would be dN/dr.

If N = kr^5, then dN/dr = 5kr^4. So the rate of change is proportional to r^4. But that's not one of the options given. Wait, the options are A) r^3, B) r^
