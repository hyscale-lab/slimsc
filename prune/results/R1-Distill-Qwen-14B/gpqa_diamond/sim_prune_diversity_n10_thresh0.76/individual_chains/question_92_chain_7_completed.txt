Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, how exactly do I calculate that using the given bond energies?

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complex. Let me try to draw it mentally. I think it's a hydrocarbon with multiple double bonds. Wait, how many double bonds are there? Let me count. The formula has two CH2 groups, and two CH groups with methyl branches. Oh, wait, maybe there are two double bonds in the structure. Because when I see C=CH and another C=, that suggests two double bonds.

Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So, yeah, there are two double bonds. Each double bond is a C=C.

So, to find the enthalpy of formation, I think I need to use the bond energies. The formula I remember is that the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is calculated using the bond energies of the reactants (elements) and products (the compound). The general approach is:

ΔHf = [sum of bond energies of reactants] - [sum of bond energies of products]

Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh, right, the formation is when the compound is formed from elements in their standard states. So, I think the formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of all bonds broken in reactants) - (sum of bond energies of all bonds formed in products)

Wait, wait, no. Alternatively, another approach is using the enthalpy of atomization. The enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in a mole of a substance to form its atoms in the gas phase. So, maybe the question expects me to use the enthalpy of atomization of carbon.

Wait, the given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. And bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, C-H.

Let me think. The enthalpy of formation can also be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf = (Σ bond energies of bonds broken) - (Σ bond energies of bonds formed)

But in the context of elements forming the compound, maybe it's better to think in terms of the standard enthalpy of formation from elements. So, the elements involved are carbon and hydrogen. Since the compound is made of C and H, we can model the formation from these elements.

Another approach is the atomization method. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the atomization enthalpy of each element and considering the bonds made and broken in the compound.

The formula I think is:

ΔHf°(compound) = [Σ (atoms' atomization energies)] - [Σ (bond energies in compound)]

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the enthalpy change when the compound is formed from its constituent atoms. So, the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the atomization enthalpies of the elements minus the sum of the bond energies in the compound.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The standard enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for a hydrocarbon, it's the formation from carbon (graphite) and hydrogen gas.

So, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the energy required to break the bonds in the elements (like H2 and graphite carbon) and the energy released when the bonds in the compound are formed.

Here's the formula:

ΔHf°(compound) = [sum of bond energies of elements (reactants)] - [sum of bond energies of compound (products)]

Wait, but carbon in its standard state is graphite, which has a certain structure. Oh, but the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. So perhaps the approach here is:

1. Calculate the total energy required to atomize all the carbon atoms in the compound.

2. Calculate the total energy required to break all hydrogen bonds (H-H) in H2.

3. Then, calculate the total energy released when the bonds in the compound form.

The enthalpy of formation would then be the sum of energies from steps 1 and 2 minus the energy from step 3.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the number of C atoms and H atoms in the compound.

2. Calculate the total atomization energy for carbon: moles of C × 1000 kJ/mol.

3. Calculate the total bond energy for H-H: moles of H2 × 100 kJ/mol. But wait, each H2 molecule has one bond, so the number of H-H bonds needed is (total H atoms)/2.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is coming from H2, so the initial bonds are H-H, and the number of H atoms is 2n, so the number of H-H bonds is n.

Wait, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let's count the number of C and H atoms.

Each (CH3)2C= is one group. Let's parse the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: This part contributes 2*(3 H) from each CH3, and 1 H from the CH.

Wait, let me count each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : The first group is (CH3)2C=CH-. So:

- Each (CH3) has 3 H, so two of them contribute 2*3=6 H.

- The C in the middle is bonded to two CH3, one CH (from the double bond), and the double bond is between C and another CH group.

Wait, maybe I should count each group separately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count each part of the molecule:

The full formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me break it down:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : This part has 2*(3 H) from two CH3 groups, plus 1 H from CH.

Wait, no, the (CH3)2C=CH- group. The structure is (CH3)2-C double bond CH-.

So, the first part:

- (CH3)2C= : this is a carbocation perhaps? No, it's a structure. The (CH3)2C is a substituent, and the double bond is between C and CH.

So, the structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, maybe it's easier to write the formula as (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

But I'm getting stuck on counting. Maybe I can write the molecular formula.

Each (CH3)2C= group: For (CH3)2C=, each CH3 has 3 H. So for two, 6 H. The C has two CH3, one double bond (so no H on that C?), and one CH group.

Wait, perhaps the entire molecule is a diene? Let me count each unit.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C10H16.

Wait, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the carbons:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- is 3 carbons (two CH3 and one C), then the CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- part: that's 4 carbons (CH, CH2, CH(CH3), CH2), then another CH=C(CH3)2: which is 3 carbons (the central C with double bond, and two CH3 groups).

Wait, so 3 +4 +3 = 10 C. So 10 carbons.

Hydrogen: Let's see.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: each CH3 has 3 H, two of them: 6 H. The CH has 1 H.

Then CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH-: CH2 has 2 H, CH(CH3) has 1 H, another CH2 has 2 H, and the CH has 1 H.

Wait, but perhaps I should write each part:

Each (CH3)2C=CH-: 6 H from CH3 groups, 1 H from CH-.

Then CH2- has 2 H, CH(CH3) has 3 H (since CH(CH3) is a CH with a CH3 group; so the CH has 2 H? Wait, no. Wait, CH(CH3) is a carbon connected to another CH3, so the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-... So the CH(CH3) has two H (since the formula is CH(CH3)).

Wait, maybe it's better to count each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : 2*(3 H) from CH3 groups + 1 H from CH = 7 H.

2. Then CH2- : 2 H.

3. Then CH(CH3) : the CH has 1 H, and the CH3 has 3 H. So 1 H +3 H=4 H.

4. Then CH2- : 2 H.

5. Then CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1 H, and the C=C part has two CH3 groups. Each CH3 has 3 H, so two give 6 H.

So adding all H:

7 +2 +4 +2 +1 +6 = 22 H? Wait, but that doesn't fit. Because for 10 carbons, a typical alkane would have 2n+2 H, which for n=10 would be 22 H. But since this compound has two double bonds (each double bond reduces two H), so 22 - 2*2 = 18 H. Hmm, but when I count, I'm getting 22. Maybe I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct molecular formula is C10H16, which would mean 2n+2 - 2*2 = 22 -4=18. So 18 H.

But when I count, I may have made a mistake. Let me try another approach.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C=CH group: each CH3 has 3 H → 6 H. The CH has 1 H. So 7 H.

Then, CH2: 2 H.

Then CH(CH3): the CH has 1 H, and the CH3 has 3 H → 4 H.

Then CH2: 2 H.

Then CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1 H, the C= has two CH3 groups, each with 3 H → 6 H. So 1+6=7 H.

Now, sum: 7 (first group) +2 (CH2) +4 (CH(CH3)) +2 (CH2) +7 (last group) = 22 H. But for C10H16, H should be 16. Hmm, that suggests I'm overcounting.

Wait, perhaps I'm including H's incorrectly. Let me try to write the formula more systematically.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: Each CH3 is 3 H, so 2*3=6. The CH is 1 H. So 7 H.

Then CH2- : 2 H.

Then CH(CH3)-: the CH has 1 H, and the CH3 has 3 H. So 4 H.

Then CH2-: 2 H.

Then CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1 H, and the C=C is connected to two CH3 groups (each 3 H → 6 H). So 1+6=7 H.

Wait, but in the structure, the CH=C(CH3)2 is the last part. So let's add all:

7 (first) + 2 (CH2) =9 → +4 (CH(CH3))=13 → +2 (CH2)=15 → +7 (last group)=22. Hmm, but that's 22 H. But the formula for C10H16 is 16 H. So I must have made a mistake in counting. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is C10H18.

Wait, perhaps the structure has fewer double bonds. Wait, the structure has two double bonds (the C=C in (CH3)2C=CH- and the CH=C(CH3)2 part). Each double bond reduces two H compared to an alkane. So for C10, an alkane would be C10H22. With two double bonds, it's 22 -4=18 H. So the formula is C10H18.

Wait, but when I count, I get 22 H. That suggests I have an error in counting. Let's try again more carefully.

Let me parse each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-

Each (CH3) group has 3 H → 2*3=6.

The C is double-bonded to CH. So the CH has 1 H. So 6+1=7 H.

Then the next part is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The -CH2- group has 2 H.

Then -CH(CH3)-: the CH has 1 H, the CH3 has 3 H → 4 H.

Then -CH2-: 2 H.

Then -CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1 H, and each CH3 has 3 H, so 3*2=6 H. So 1+6=7 H.

So summing all:

7 (from first group) +2 (CH2) +4 (CH(CH3)) +2 (CH2) +7 (last group) = 22 H. But the correct H count for C10H18 is 18. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another approach. The molecular formula is C10H18. So each molecule has 10 C and 18 H.

So the number of C atoms is 10, each from the enthalpy of atomization, so 10 * 1000 kJ/mol = 10,000 kJ per mole.

But wait, no. The enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break all bonds and form gaseous atoms. So for each carbon atom, it's 1000 kJ/mol. So 10 moles of C → 10 * 1000 = 10,000 kJ.

For hydrogen, each H2 molecule has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol. To get 18 H atoms, you need 9 H2 molecules (since each H2 has 2 H). So 9 moles of H2 → 9 * 100 = 900 kJ.

So sum of bond energies of elements: 10,000 + 900 = 10,900 kJ.

Now, the compound's bonds: we need to calculate the sum of bond energies in the molecule.

So, let's count each type of bond in the molecule.

Looking at the structure again: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 group contributes three C-H bonds. Let me count all C-H bonds.

Each (CH3) group: 3 C-H bonds. The structure has two (CH3) groups in the first part, so 2 *3 =6 C-H.

Then, in the (CH3)2C=CH group, the CH has one C-H bond.

Then, the CH2 groups: each CH2 has two C-H bonds. Let's count how many CH2 groups are present.

Looking at the structure:

- After the first double bond, there's a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH- group.

So, the -CH2- after the first double bond: 2 C-H.

Then, another CH2 group before the next double bond: 2 C-H.

So, from CH2 groups: 2 + 2 =4 C-H.

In the CH(CH3) group: the central C is bonded to CH3, so that's two more C-H bonds (since CH(CH3) is actually a CH2 group attached to a CH3? Wait, no. Let me think: CH(CH3) would have two C-H bonds on the central C, right? Wait, no, in CH(CH3), the central C is connected to one H and a CH3. So that's one C-H bond.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each C in the structure and count the C-H bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of C-H bonds.

Each CH3 group has 3 C-H bonds. The molecule has:

- Two CH3 groups in the first part: 2 *3=6.

- The CH in (CH3)2C=CH- has 1 C-H.

- Each CH2 group has 2 C-H. How many CH2 groups are there? Let's see:

Looking at the structure:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: one CH group (1 C-H).

2. Then, CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH-: so two CH2 groups (each 2 C-H → 4).

3. The last CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1 C-H.

Wait, but the last part is CH=C(CH3)2, so the C is double-bonded, and the CH has one C-H. Each CH3 contributes 3 C-H.

So, let's sum:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 6 (from two CH3) +1 (from CH) =7.

- Next, CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH-: CH2 (2), CH(CH3) (1), CH2 (2), CH (1) → C-H: 2 +1 +2 +1 =6.

Wait, no, perhaps I should count each C's C-H bonds:

Looking at each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 

- Each CH3 in (CH3)2: 3 C-H each → 6.

- The C=CH has one C-H → 1.

Total so far: 7.

2. CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH-:

- CH2: 2 C-H → 2.

- CH(CH3): the CH has one C-H, and the CH3 has 3 C-H → 4.

- CH2: 2 C-H →2.

- CH: 1 C-H →1.

Wait, but wait: the CH(CH3) group is CH2-CH(CH3), so the CH(CH3) would contribute 1 C-H (since the CH is connected to CH3 and the CH2 group. So, the number of C-H bonds in CH(CH3) is 1.

So summing this part: 2+4+2+1=9.

3. Then, CH=C(CH3)2:

- CH: 1 C-H.

- Each CH3 has 3 C-H → 3 *2=6.

Total: 1+6=7.

So total C-H bonds: 7 (from first part) +9 (from middle) +7 (last part) =23.

Wait, but that can't be right because the molecular formula is C10H18. Each H is from a C-H bond, so 18 H atoms. So the number of C-H bonds is 18, because each C-H bond has one H. So why am I getting 23?

Wait, something's wrong. Let me think again.

Each C-H bond corresponds to one H atom. The molecular formula is C10H18, which has 18 H atoms, so 18 C-H bonds.

So perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let's recount.

Each CH3 group contributes 3 C-H. How many CH3 groups are there?

Looking at the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: two CH3 groups → 2 *3=6 C-H.

- CH(CH3) in the middle: that's one CH3 group → 3 C-H.

- CH=C(CH3)2: two CH3 groups → 2 *3=6 C-H.

So that's 6 +3 +6 =15 C-H bonds from CH3 groups.

Then, the remaining H must be from CH and CH2 groups.

Each CH contributes one C-H, and each CH2 contributes two.

Looking for CH and CH2 groups:

- The first part after (CH3)2C= has a CH group: 1.

- Then, the next part has a CH2, followed by a CH(CH3), which as a CH.

- Then another CH2, followed by a CH.

- Then, the last CH before the double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count as follows:

Each CH2 group: 2 C-H.

Each CH group:1 C-H.

CH(CH3) is a CH group with a CH3 attached, but the C-H count is only the H directly attached. So for CH(CH3), it's one C-H.

So, let's count:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: the CH group → 1.

2. CH2-: 2.

3. CH(CH3)-:1.

4. CH2-:2.

5. CH-:1.

6. CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1.

So sum these: 1 +2 +1 +2 +1 +1 =8.

Adding the CH3 groups' 15 C-H: 15 +8=23. But wait, the molecule has 18 H. So this can't be correct. So I must have made a mistake in counting.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me think differently. The molecular formula is C10H18, which implies 18 C-H bonds. So perhaps I should think about all the C-H bonds as 18, which would be the H count.

So if I have 18 C-H bonds, then the sum of C-H bonds is 18 *400 kJ/mol? No, wait, each C-H bond has a bond energy of 400 kJ/mol.

Wait, no, the bond energy for C-H is 400 kJ/mol per bond. So the total energy for all C-H bonds is 18 *400 =7200 kJ.

Then, the molecule has:

- Number of C-C bonds.

- Number of C=C bonds.

- Number of C-H bonds (already counted 18).

So, let's count the other bonds.

First, the molecule has two C=C double bonds. Each C=C has a bond energy of 300 kJ/mol. So 2 *300=600 kJ.

Then, the C-C single bonds. Let's count them.

In the structure (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The single bonds between C atoms: I need to count all the C-C single bonds.

Let me think: each CH3 is attached to a C, which is connected to other Cs.

But perhaps it's easier to count the number of C-C single bonds.

Each C in the structure is connected to others via single bonds (except the double bonds).

Alternatively, the number of C-C bonds can be calculated as (number of C atoms - number of double bonds)/something.

Wait, for a molecule with n C atoms, the number of C-C bonds is (n – number of rings – number of double bonds). But in this case, it's probably a linear chain with no rings, so the number of C-C bonds is (n – 1 – number of double bonds).

n=10 C atoms.

Number of double bonds:2.

So, number of C-C single bonds: 10 –1 –2=7.

So 7 C-C bonds, each with bond energy 200 kJ →7 *200=1400 kJ.

Wait, but wait, the molecule might have more C-C bonds if there are branches. Let me think.

In the structure (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each single bond between C atoms counts as a C-C bond.

Looking at the structure, let me count:

Each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: The C in (CH3)2 is bonded to two CH3, the double bond, and to the next C (CH). So that's two C-C bonds here: from (CH3)2C to CH.

2. CH-CH2: CH connected to CH2 → another C-C.

3. CH2-CH(CH3): another C-C.

4. CH(CH3)-CH2: another.

5. CH2-CH: another.

6. CH-CH=C: this is a single bond from CH to CH (the other end is a double bond).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of the molecule as a chain with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the number of C-C bonds is (total C atoms – number of double bonds – number of rings). But the molecule is a straight chain (I think), so number of C-C bonds is (10 –2) if it's a straight chain. Wait, no, that's not correct. A straight chain with 10 C atoms would have 9 C-C single bonds. But with two double bonds, each double bond replaces a single bond. So the number of C-C single bonds is 9 –2 =7. Which matches my earlier calculation.

So 7 C-C bonds.

So total bonds in the molecule:

- C-H:18 → 18 *400=7200 kJ.

- C=C:2 → 2 *300=600 kJ.

- C-C:7 →7 *200=1400 kJ.

Total bond energy in the molecule:7200 +600 +1400 =9200 kJ.

Now, the enthalpy of formation is calculated as:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of elements) – (sum of bond energies in compound)

Sum of bond energies of elements:10,000 (C) + 900 (H2) =10,900 kJ.

Sum of bond energies in compound:9200 kJ.

So ΔHf =10,900 –9200 =1,700 kJ/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 11200, which is way higher. So this can't be correct. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the H-H bonds correctly. Let's see.

The initial step: to form the compound, we start with elements in their standard states. So carbon is in a solid, graphite form, and hydrogen is in H2 gas.

The bond energies given are for breaking the bonds in the elements to form the constituent atoms.

So for carbon, the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol. So one mole of C atoms requires 1000 kJ.

For hydrogen, each H2 molecule has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol. So to get one mole of H atoms, you need to break one mole of H2, which is 100 kJ.

Wait, wait, each H2 molecule has one H-H bond. To get H atoms, you need to break the bonds. So for each mole of H2, you get 2 moles of H atoms, and the energy required is 100 kJ per mole of H2.

So, for the compound, which has 18 H atoms, we need 9 moles of H2. So the bond energy for H2 is 9 *100=900 kJ.

So the total bond energy for the elements (C and H2) is (10 *1000) + (9 *100) =10,000 +900=10,900 kJ.

The total bond energy in the compound is:

C-H:18 *400=7200.

C=C:2*300=600.

C-C:7*200=1400.

Total:7200+600+1400=9200.

So ΔHf=10,900 –9200=1,700 kJ/mol.

Hmm, but the options don't have 1700. The options are A) 11200, B)67.4, C)11.44, D)1900.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for other types of bonds, like the H-H bonds being broken, but in the compound, no H-H bonds are formed. So the calculation should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the formation is from elements, and the bond energies are calculated differently.

Another approach: the standard enthalpy of formation can also be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf = (Σ bonds broken in elements) – (Σ bonds formed in compound)

So, bonds broken in elements are:

- For C: each C atom comes from breaking graphite, which has a certain structure. But the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of C as 1000 kJ/mol. So each C atom requires 1000 kJ to form.

- For H: each H atom comes from breaking H2. Each H2 has bond energy 100 kJ/mol. So to get 18 H atoms, you need 9 H2 molecules, which requires 9 *100=900 kJ.

So, total energy to break bonds in elements:10 *1000 + 9 *100=10,900 kJ.

Then, in the compound, the bonds formed are:

- C=C: 2 bonds, each 300 →600.

- C-C:7 bonds, each 200 →1400.

- C-H:18 bonds, each 400 →7200.

Total bonds formed:600 +1400 +7200=9200.

So, ΔHf =10,900 –9200=1,700 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the number of bonds.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds. Let me recount.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

It's a chain with two double bonds. Let me count the C-C single bonds:

Each single bond between C atoms counts as one.

Let me list each C and their connections:

1. The first C in (CH3)2C= is connected to two CH3, one C (double bond), and another C (the next in the chain).

So, from (CH3)2C=CH-:

- The central C is connected to two CH3, the double bond (so that's a C=C), and the next C (CH).

So, single bonds: two (to the two CH3), and one to the next C (CH). So three single bonds here.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-C single bonds is 7.

Wait, earlier I thought number of C-C single bonds is 7, leading to 7 *200=1400.

But perhaps the correct number is higher. Let me recount.

Let me count each C-C bond:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Looking at the structure, the chain is:

C (from (CH3)2C=) → C (from CH) → CH2 → CH(CH3) → CH2 → CH → C (from C=) → C (from CH3) etc.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of the molecule as a chain with two double bonds. Let's imagine the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: two C-C bonds (from (CH3)2C to the two CH3 groups?), wait no, each C in (CH3)2C is bonded to two CH3 groups and the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has the following structure:

Each C in the chain:

- The first C is bonded to two CH3, a double bond, and the next C.

- The next C (from CH) is bonded to the first C, a CH2, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is more than 7.

Wait, perhaps the correct count is:

The molecule has 10 C atoms. The two double bonds reduce the number of single bonds by 2. So, in a fully single-bonded chain, there would be 9 C-C bonds. With two double bonds, we have 9 -2 =7 C-C single bonds. So that would make 7 bonds, each contributing 200 kJ →1400.

So, that gives the same as before.

Hmm, but the calculation ends up with 1,700 kJ/mol, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different, and I made a mistake in counting the H.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, that would give 10 C and 18 H. So the formula is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the bond energies.

Wait, the bond energies given are:

C-C:200.

C=C:300.

C-H:400.

H-H:100.

So, using these, the calculation is correct.

But the answer I get (1,700) isn't among the options. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation of the molecule, but considering the standard enthalpy of formation of each element as zero. But that doesn't change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is not per mole of carbon but per mole of C atoms. Wait, the problem says: enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol. So 1 mole of C atoms requires 1000 kJ.

So 10 C atoms would require 10 *1000=10,000 kJ.

Hydrogen: 18 H atoms come from 9 H2 molecules. So 9 *100=900.

Total:10,900 kJ.

Then, the bonds in the compound:

C-H:18 *400=7200.

C=C:2 *300=600.

C-C:7 *200=1400.

Total:9200.

ΔHf=10,900 –9200=1,700 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds. Let me think again.

Each C in the molecule is connected to others via single bonds, except for the double bonds.

In the structure:

- The first C (from (CH3)2C=) is bonded to two CH3, a double bond, and the next C.

So that's two C-C bonds (from the two CH3 groups? No, wait, each CH3 is a C-H bond, not C-C. So the first C is bonded to two CH3 (so two C-C bonds?), the double bond (C=C), and the next C (so another C-C bond).

Wait, no: the (CH3)2C= group is a C attached to two CH3 groups and a double bond. So the first C has two single bonds to CH3 (so two C-C bonds), and a double bond to another C (which counts as one C=C bond, not a C-C). So, the first C is connected to two CH3 (two C-C bonds) and the next C (another C-C bond). So that's three C-C bonds from the first C.

Similarly, the next C (from CH) is connected to the first C (C-C), a CH2 (C-C), and perhaps another bond.

Wait, perhaps I should count each single bond between C atoms.

Let me list all C-C single bonds:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

- Between (CH3)2C and CH: 1.

- Between CH and CH2:1.

- Between CH2 and CH(CH3):1.

- Between CH(CH3) and CH2:1.

- Between CH2 and CH:1.

- Between CH and CH=C:1.

Wait, that's six C-C bonds.

Plus, in the (CH3)2C group: each CH3 is attached to the central C, so two C-C bonds.

And in the CH=C(CH3)2 group: the central C is attached to two CH3 groups, which are two more C-C bonds.

So that's two more C-C bonds.

So total C-C bonds:6 +2 +2=10? No, that can't be right because earlier calculation said 7.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct number of C-C bonds is 9, but that would be for a straight chain without any double bonds. Since we have two double bonds, each replaces a single bond, so 9 –2=7. So yes, 7 C-C bonds.

So, I think the initial calculation is correct. So the ΔHf is 1,700 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation, but the way it's calculated is different.

Wait, the formula is:

ΔHf = sum (elements' bond energies) - sum (compound's bond energies)

But perhaps I should use the formula in reverse.

Wait, I'm getting 1,700, but the options are much lower. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Another thought: Perhaps the calculation is for 1 gram, not per mole. Let me check the options: option C is 11.44 kJ/g, and D is 1900 kJ/g.

Wait, the molecular weight of the compound is (10 *12) + (18 *1)=120 +18=138 g/mol.

So, 1 mole is 138 g.

So, if the ΔHf is 1,700 kJ/mol, then per gram it's 1700 /138 ≈12.32 kJ/g.

But none of the options match this. The closest is option C, 11.44 kJ/g.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps during the calculation, I forgot that each CH3 group in the structure contributes 3 C-H bonds, but perhaps some are not present.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation leads to a different result.

Wait, perhaps the bond energies are in kJ per mole, but I'm using them per bond. Let me think: the bond energies are given per mole. So each C-H bond contributes 400 kJ per mole, but I have 18 moles of C-H bonds. So 18 *400 =7200 kJ per mole of compound.

Wait, that's correct. So 7200 is correct for C-H.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B)67.4 kJ/mol

C)11.44 kJ/g

D)1900 kJ/g

If my calculation gives 1,700 kJ/mol, which is not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond counts.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds. Let me recount:

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each single bond between C atoms counts as one.

Let me list all the C-C single bonds:

1. Between (CH3)2C and CH:1.

2. Between CH and CH2:1.

3. Between CH2 and CH(CH3):1.

4. Between CH(CH3) and CH2:1.

5. Between CH2 and CH:1.

6. Between CH and CH=C:1.

7. Between CH=C and each CH3 in C(CH3)2: but wait, the CH=C is connected to two CH3 groups, so two more C-C bonds.

So that's 1+1+1+1+1+1+2=8 C-C bonds.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 7.

But now I'm getting 8. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should visualize the structure.

The structure is:

(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the C-C bonds are:

- (CH3)2-C=CH- : C connected to two CH3 (two C-C bonds), and the next C (CH) → that's three C-C bonds.

- The next part: CH-CH2: one C-C.

- CH2-CH(CH3): another.

- CH(CH3)-CH2: another.

- CH2-CH: another.

- CH-CH=C: another.

- CH=C is connected to two CH3 groups: two more C-C bonds.

So that's 3 +1+1+1+1+1+2=9 C-C bonds.

Wait, that would make 9 C-C bonds, each 200 kJ:9 *200=1800.

So, total bonds in the compound would be:

C-H:18 *400=7200.

C=C:2 *300=600.

C-C:9 *200=1800.

Total:7200 +600 +1800=9600 kJ.

So ΔHf=10,900 –9600=1,300 kJ/mol.

But that's still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct number of C-C bonds is 8.

Let me recount:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The C-C single bonds are:

1. (CH3)2C-CH:1.

2. CH-CH2:1.

3. CH2-CH(CH3):1.

4. CH(CH3)-CH2:1.

5. CH2-CH:1.

6. CH-CH:1 (the C in CH is connected to the next C in the double bond).

7. CH=C-CH3: two C-C bonds (from the double bond's C to each CH3).

Wait, no, the double bond is C=C, so only one C-C bond is replaced by a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Alternative approach: the number of C-C single bonds in a molecule can be calculated as (number of C atoms + number of C=C bonds - number of rings)/something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that I'm not getting the correct answer and look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation of the molecule using the bond energies, but in a different manner.

Wait, another approach: The enthalpy of formation is the sum of the enthalpies of the elements minus the sum of the bond energies of the compound.

So, for 1 mole of the compound, the calculation is:

Σ (elements' bond energies) – Σ (compound's bond energies).

Elements: 10 C and 18 H.

Bond energies for elements:

C:10 *1000=10,000.

H2:9 *100=900.

Total:10,900.

Compound bonds:

C-H:18 *400=7200.

C=C:2 *300=600.

C-C: let's say 7 *200=1400.

Total:9200.

So ΔHf=10,900 –9200=1,700 kJ/mol.

But no option matches. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Another thought: perhaps the problem isn't considering the full formation from elements but is using a different method.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf = (Σ bond energies of reactants) – (Σ bond energies of products)

But in this case, the reactants are the elements, and the product is the compound.

But that would be the same as what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as considering the formation of the compound from its elements in their standard states, but using only the bond energies of the compound and not considering the H2 bond energies beyond what's needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it as:

ΔHf = [sum (atomization energies of C and H)] – [sum (bond energies in the compound)]

Which is what I did.

Hmm. Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds, and the correct answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol. But I can't see how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has more H atoms, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I should calculate the enthalpy of formation per gram, not per mole.

Wait, the molecular weight is 10*12 +18*1=120+18=138 g/mol.

So, 1,700 kJ/mol divided by 138 g/mol equals approximately 12.32 kJ/g.

But that's not an option either. Option C is 11.44 kJ/g.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond counts.

Wait, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 8.

If C-C is 8, then 8 *200=1600.

Total bonds in compound:7200 +600 +1600=9400.

ΔHf=10,900 –9400=1,500 kJ/mol.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 6.

Then, 6*200=1200.

Total bonds:7200+600+1200=9000.

ΔHf=10,900-9000=1,900 kJ/mol.

Ah! That's option D:1900 kJ/g. Wait, no, option D is 1900 kJ/g. But 1,900 kJ/mol would be different.

Wait, option D is 1900 kJ/g. So 1,900 kJ/g would be 1,900 *138,000 kJ/mol, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, if the ΔHf is 1,900 kJ/mol, then per gram it's 1,900 /138≈13.798 kJ/g. That's not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the question is considering the enthalpy of formation as the energy released when the compound is formed from its elements, but I'm getting the opposite.

Wait, the formula is:

ΔHf = sum (bond energies of elements) – sum (bond energies of compound).

If the compound's bonds are stronger, ΔHf is negative (exothermic). But in this case, 10,900 –9200=1,700, which is positive, meaning endothermic.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 67.4 kJ/mol. But I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should have subtracted the sum of the compound's bonds from the elements' bonds, but perhaps I should have considered that the bond energies are per mole of bonds, not per mole of compound.

Wait, but in my calculation, I multiplied the number of bonds by the bond energy per mole of bonds.

So, for example, 18 C-H bonds *400 kJ/mol per C-H bond →7200 kJ/mol.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, the closest is option B, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is given per mole of C, which is 1000 kJ/mol. So for 10 C atoms, it's 10 *1000=10,000 kJ.

Wait, but what about the bond energies in the compound?

Another approach: maybe the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation of the molecule using the formula:

ΔHf = [Σ (bond energies of reactants)] – [Σ (bond energies of products)]

But the reactants are the elements, which have H2 and C.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be:

ΔHf = [ (10 *1000) + (9 *100) ] – [ (18*400) + (2 *300) + (7 *200) ] 

Which is 10,900 –9200=1,700 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as the enthalpy of formation from CO2 and H2O, but I don't have the necessary data for that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the molecule has more H atoms than I thought.

Wait, earlier I thought the formula is C10H18, but perhaps it's C10H16. Let me recount.

If the formula is C10H16, then the H count would be 16.

So, 16 H atoms →8 H2 molecules.

So, bond energy for H2:8 *100=800.

So, sum of bond energies of elements:10*1000 +8*100=10,800.

Then, bonds in compound:

C-H:16*400=6400.

C=C:2*300=600.

C-C: (10 –1 –2)=7 →7*200=1400.

Total:6400+600+1400=8400.

ΔHf=10,800 –8400=2,400 kJ/mol.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C10H14.

Then, H atoms=14 →7 H2 →700 kJ.

Sum elements:10,000 +700=10,700.

Bonds in compound:

C-H:14*400=5600.

C=C:2*300=600.

C-C:7*200=1400.

Total:5600+600+1400=7600.

ΔHf=10,700 –7600=3,100 kJ/mol.

Not matching.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Given that none of my calculations match the options, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 67.4 kJ/mol, but I can't figure out how.

Wait, perhaps I should try calculating the enthalpy of formation in a different way. Let me think of the molecule as a series of bonds being broken and formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the heat of combustion approach, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the enthalpy of atomization includes the energy to break the bonds in the compound, so I should subtract the bond energies of the compound from the atomization energy.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on my calculations, the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated as:

ΔHf = [ (Σ bond energies of reactants) ] – [ (Σ bond energies of products) ]

But if the reactants are the elements (C and H2), and the product is the compound.

Wait, but I've done that already.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the bond energies in reverse. For example, using the bond energies as the energy released when bonds form, which would make ΔHf negative.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Based on the options, the only one that might make sense in terms of the calculation is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds. Let me recount.

If the number of C-C bonds is 9, then 9 *200=1800.

Total bonds:7200 +600 +1800=9600.

ΔHf=10,900 –9600=1,300 kJ/mol.

No option matches.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I'll have to go with the calculation I did earlier, but since it's not matching the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol.


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**, the following approach was taken:

### Key Information and Assumptions:
1. **Enthalpy of atomization of carbon (C):** 1000 kJ/mol.
2. **Bond energies:**
   - H-H = 100 kJ/mol
   - C-C = 200 kJ/mol
   - C=C = 300 kJ/mol
   - C-H = 400 kJ/mol
3. The compound is formed from its constituent elements, carbon (C) and hydrogen (H), in their standard states.

### Molecular Formula:
The compound has **10 carbon atoms (C₁₀)** and **18 hydrogen atoms (H₁₈)**, giving the molecular formula **C₁₀H₁₈**.

### Bond Counting:
1. **C-H bonds:** Each CH₃ group contributes 3 C-H bonds. The molecule has:
   - 2 CH₃ groups in (CH₃)₂C=CH: 2 × 3 = 6 C-H bonds.
   - 1 CH group in (CH₃)₂C=CH: 1 C-H bond.
   - 1 CH group in CH=C(CH₃)₂: 1 C-H bond.
   - 2 CH₂ groups: 2 × 2 = 4 C-H bonds.
   - 1 CH(CH₃) group: 1 C-H bond.
   - 2 CH₃ groups in C(CH₃)₂: 2 × 3 = 6 C-H bonds.
   - Total C-H bonds = 6 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 6 = **18**.

2. **C=C bonds:** The molecule has **2 double bonds**.

3. **C-C bonds:** The molecule has **7 single bonds** between carbon atoms.

### Total Bond Energy in the Compound:
- **C-H bonds:** 18 × 400 kJ/mol = 7200 kJ/mol.
- **C=C bonds:** 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol.
- **C-C bonds:** 7 × 200 kJ/mol = 1400 kJ/mol.
- **Total bond energy in the compound = 7200 + 600 + 1400 = 9200 kJ/mol.**

### Bond Energy of Elements:
1. **Carbon (C):** 10 moles × 1000 kJ/mol = 10,000 kJ/mol.
2. **Hydrogen (H):** 9 moles of H₂ (since 18 H atoms require 9 H₂ molecules) × 100 kJ/mol = 900 kJ/mol.
3. **Total bond energy of elements = 10,000 + 900 = 10,900 kJ/mol.**

### Enthalpy of Formation:
The enthalpy of formation is calculated as:
\[
\Delta H_f = \text{Sum of bond energies of elements} - \text{Sum of bond energies of compound}
\]
\[
\Delta H_f = 10,900 - 9,200 = 1,700 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (11,200 kJ/mol):** This is far too high and inconsistent with the calculation.
- **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol):** This is much lower than the calculated value and does not match the expected result.
- **Option C (11.44 kJ/g):** This is the enthalpy of formation per gram, calculated as \( \frac{1,700}{138} \, \text{kJ/g} \approx 12.32 \, \text{kJ/g} \), which does not match the given value.
- **Option D (1900 kJ/g):** This is far too high for the enthalpy of formation per gram.

### Conclusion:
The calculated enthalpy of formation is **1,700 kJ/mol**, but none of the provided options match this result. Based on the given options, **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)** is selected as the closest plausible answer, though it does not align with the detailed calculation.

Answer: B
