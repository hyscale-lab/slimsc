Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence gives the desired product with a high yield.

First, I should probably sketch out the structure of the target molecule. The substituents on the benzene ring are:

- tert-butyl group at position 2.
- Ethoxy group at position 1.
- Nitro group at position 3.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Let me number it to get the positions right. If I imagine the benzene ring, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. That arrangement is important because the order of substitution steps will affect where the substituents end up.

In aromatic substitution reactions, the directing effects of substituents matter a lot. Nitro groups are meta-directing, while ethoxy groups are ortho/para-directing. tert-Butyl is an activating group, but wait, no, wait: I think tert-butyl is an alkyl group, which is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent. But wait, no, wait: wait, no, no, wait. Wait, no: wait, the directing effect of substituents depends on whether they are activating or deactivating. Alkyl groups like tert-butyl are activating (since they donate electrons through sigma bonds), so they are ortho/para directors. Nitro groups are deactivating (they withdraw electrons via resonance and inductive effects), so they are meta directors. Ethoxy groups are activating (since they are O-R groups, which donate electrons via resonance), so they are ortho/para directors as well.

So I need to plan the order of adding these substituents to benzene. The order in which substituents are introduced can determine the final structure because each group directs where the next substituent will go.

Let me think about the target molecule again. The ethoxy group is at position 1, the tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at 3. So numbering-wise, it's 1,2,3. Let me see: if benzene is the starting material, which substituents are added first, second, third.

Wait, the target has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. So three steps of substitution.

Let me consider the possible orderings. Each substitution step must be done in a way that the substituents direct the next group to the correct position.

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first. Then, when adding the ethoxy, it would go ortho or para to that. Then nitro would go meta to ethoxy or tert-butyl, depending on their positions.

But wait, the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to both
