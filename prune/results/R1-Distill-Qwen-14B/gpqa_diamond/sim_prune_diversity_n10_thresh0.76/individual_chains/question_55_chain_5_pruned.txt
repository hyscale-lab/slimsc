Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are different types of propenyl and butenyl acetates.

First, let me recall what these structures look like. Acetates are esters where the acid part is acetic acid. So, the general structure is R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, acetate esters are actually R-O-COCH3. Oh right, acetate is OAc, so the ester group is OAc.

The options are Cis and Trans for propenyl and butenyl groups. Propenyl would be CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond, so either CH2=CHCH2- or similar. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2? Wait no, propenyl is like CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or maybe I should think about the structure more carefully.

Wait, propenyl groups are -CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond. Oh wait, no. Propenyl is either CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH2CH2 but that's not right. Wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3, so propenyl would be the substituent. So for propenyl acetate, it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, wait, that's if it's a substituent on the acetate. Alternatively, the structure is CH2CH2CH2-OAc but with a double bond.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like:

For propenyl acetate, it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, the configuration (cis or trans) would matter if there's a substituent on the double bond. Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, so the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the substituents on each carbon are CH3 (on the end) and the OAc on the CH2. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused here.

But wait, the NMR data will help. Let's look at the given data:

1H NMR (ppm):
7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
5.5 (1H, dq)
2.1 (3H, s)
1.6 (3H, d)

So, let's break this down. The 2.1 ppm singlet (s) is probably the methyl group attached to the ester oxygen, like the OAc group (the CH3 in OAc is usually around 2 ppm as a singlet because it's not split by any neighboring protons).

Then, the 1.6 ppm doublet (d) is likely a methyl group adjacent to a double bond. Because if it's a CH3 attached to a CH2, which is next to a double bond, the CH2 would split the CH3 into a doublet. So, that CH3 is probably on a CH2 that's part of a double bond.

The
