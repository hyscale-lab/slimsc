Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think it through step by step. 

The problem says we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air, and only a mixture of gases is formed. Then, this gas mixture is passed through three tubes.

Tube 1 is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb water, especially water vapor. So, this tube probably absorbs any moisture from the gas mixture. The weight of tube 1 increased by 3.60 grams. That suggests that 3.60 grams of water were absorbed here.

Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. Wait, Ca(OH)2 is a base, so it would react with acidic gases. But the weight of tube 2 didn't change. Hmm, so whatever was in the gas didn't react with the solution here. Maybe the gas wasn't acidic, or maybe it was something else.

Tube 3 has red-hot copper. Red-hot copper would react with certain gases. For instance, CO2 might not react unless it's in a specific condition, but wait, CO2 doesn't react with copper. Maybe it's reacting with another gas. Oh wait, when CO reacts with hot copper, it doesn't react. But H2 might. Wait, no, H2 and Cu at high temps... Or perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, actually, when CO2 passes over hot copper, nothing much happens. But if it's another gas like SO3, maybe? Or perhaps, considering the products, the copper is forming CuO. So the gas that reacted with copper must have been something that would oxidize copper. Like H2S maybe? Or maybe water vapor? Wait, but the first tube already absorbed water, so that's not likely.

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's think again. After passing through the three tubes, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). So STP is 0°C and 1 atm, and 1 mole of gas is 22.4 liters. So 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. So gas C is 0.1 moles.

What could gas C be? Maybe CO2 or H2 or something else. Let me think about the reactions.

The initial mixture upon heating produces gases. These gases passed through Mg(ClO4)2, which absorbs water (like H2O), then through Ca(OH)2 solution, which reacts with CO2 or HCl, but in this case, tube 2 didn't change, meaning perhaps no CO2 or HCl was present. But wait, the weight didn't change, so maybe no gas was absorbed here. That would imply that the gas after Mg(ClO4)2 didn't include CO2 or HCl. So the remaining gas after Mg(ClO4)2 is something else.

Wait, but the first tube absorbs 3.60 g of H2O. The molecular weight of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol of H2O. So the gas mixture must have released 0.2 moles of water vapor.

Then, after that, the gas goes to Cu. The increase in tube 3 is 0.80 g. Let's assume that the gas reacting here is H2. Because H2 can react with CuO (or maybe Cu in some condition) at high temperatures. Wait, actually, hydrogen can reduce CuO. When H2 passes through hot CuO, it produces Cu and water. But wait, in this setup, the copper is red-hot, so perhaps the gas is H2.

If it's H2, then the reaction would be:

H2 + Cu → Cu + H2? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The reaction when H2 reacts with CuO is:

H2 + CuO → H2O + Cu. So in this case, the H2 would be consumed, and CuO is formed. 

But in this setup, the solution after the second tube (Ca(OH)2) didn't change. So perhaps H2 didn't react in the second tube because it's a gas, and the solution might not have reacted with H2. So the H2 would have passed through and then reacted with the copper.

Wait, but in tube 3, copper is used. If the gas is H2, it would react with CuO (if present), but if the copper is being heated, maybe it's a different scenario. Alternatively, the copper might be in a different state.

Wait, perhaps the gas that reacts with copper is CO, which upon reaction with copper might form something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2, and reacting with Cu in some way.

Let me think about the masses. Tube 3 gained 0.80 grams. Suppose it's CuO being formed. Let's calculate the moles of CuO formed. The molar mass of CuO is 64 + 16 = 80 g/mol. So 0.80 g is 0.01 mol. 

If the reaction is H2 + Cu → Cu + H2, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is CO reacting with Cu. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe another approach.

The initial salts A and B are equimolar, 7.20 grams. Upon heating, they decompose into gases. The gases pass through the three tubes.

So, let's summarize the data:

- Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2): Absorbed 3.60g H2O → 0.2 mol H2O.
- Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution): No change → no CO2 or acidic gases (like HCl, SO3, etc.).
- Tube 3 (Cu): Gain 0.80g → possibly CuO. So perhaps the gas here is H2O, but that can't be because the first tube already absorbed all the H2O. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the gas that reacted with copper is H2. Let's see. Suppose that H2 is present, and it reacts with Cu:

H2 + Cu → Cu + H2? No, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up reactions. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO, and it
