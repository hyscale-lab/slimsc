Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think. The problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. 

Wait, so I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? Or wait, no, I think HPO4^2- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. Let me get this straight. H3PO4 can lose three protons: the first to become H2PO4^- (with Ka1), the second to HPO4^2- (Ka2), and the third to PO4^3- (Ka3). So orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it dissociates, it goes through these steps. But in solution, it's probably a mix of these forms.

But wait, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^- right? And Na2HPO4·2
