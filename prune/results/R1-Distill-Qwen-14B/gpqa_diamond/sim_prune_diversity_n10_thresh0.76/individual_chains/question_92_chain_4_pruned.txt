Okay, so today I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a molecule. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The molecule given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. It looks like a hydrocarbon with some double bonds. Oh, wait, I see two double bonds in the structure. Each of those is a C=C bond.

The question gives me some bond energies. Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, wait, atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element into its atoms. So for carbon, that's the bond energy for C-C in graphite or diamond. But I'm not sure if it's needed here, since the bond energies are provided for other bonds.

Wait a second, the problem states that the bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H are given. So maybe the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the formation from elements, which requires breaking bonds in elements and forming bonds in the compound.

Enthalpy of formation is usually calculated using the formula: ΔH°f = [Σ bonds broken in reactants] - [Σ bonds formed in products]. But wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Oh wait no, the standard enthalpy of formation is the change when
