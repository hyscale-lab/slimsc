Okay, so I've got this complicated molecular biology question here. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So the question is about a bicistronic vector used to express a ligand and receptor. The setup is that they're expressing these in primary astrocyte cultures and then looking at the expression in mouse models. The problem is that when they cross the mice with SOX10-Cre, they don't see a green signal in the fluorescence microscopy. So why isn't the eGFP showing up?

Alright, let's go through the details.

The vector is bicistronic, which means it has two ORFs (open reading frames) in one construct. The ligand ORF is at the 5' end and is fused to mCherry. The receptor ORF is at the 3' end with eGFP at its C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Wait, CBA is a promoter that's strong and used for expression in various tissues. But I remember that the CBA promoter is constitutive, meaning it's always active. So the ligand should be expressed wherever the construct is present.

Then there's the IRES element upstream of the receptor. IRES elements are Internal Ribosome Entry Sites, which allow for the translation of a second ORF from the same mRNA. IRESs are often used for bicistronic vectors because they can recruit ribosomes to the second ORF without the need for a second promoter. So the receptor is probably expressed from the same mRNA as the ligand, but under the control of IRES. 

But the way the question describes the vector: the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at 3', with eGFP. So each ORF is separate but on the same transcript. Wait, but fusion proteins—so the ligand is ligand-mCherry, and the receptor is receptor-eGFP. Or wait, no—if the ligand is fused to mCherry, then maybe it's a single ORF that encodes a ligand-mCherry fusion. Similarly, the receptor is in a separate ORF, with eGFP at the C-terminus.

Wait, no, the question says the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry
