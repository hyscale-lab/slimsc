Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from chemistry class.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization is usually when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, right? But in this case, it's a bit more complicated because there are three solutions involved. So I need to find out the moles of each acid and base and see how they react.

Let me see the given solutions:

1. 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The moles of HCl would be volume (in liters) times molarity. So 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since HCl is H+ and Cl-, each mole gives one mole of H+.

2. 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Wait no, wait. Wait, actually, the first dissociation is complete, but the second might not be. Wait, no, for concentrated solutions, but in dilute solutions, I think the second H+ might not dissociate fully. But since this is a neutralization reaction, maybe we can assume both H+ are released? Wait, wait, no. Wait, for enthalpy of neutralization, if the acid is strong, both H+ are considered. But H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation, but the second (HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-) is only partially dissociated. But wait, in neutralization reactions, especially with strong bases, I think the second H+ might also ionize. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider all H+ available.

Wait, 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions, so 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

3. 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 moles. So OH- moles would be 0.2 moles.

Now, the neutralization reaction is between H+ and OH-. The total H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4.

So H+ total = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, so the H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the OH- is the limiting reactant. Because each OH- can neutralize one H+. So 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

Wait, but what about the excess H+? 0.28 -0.2 =0.08 moles left. So that would leave some H+ unreacted. But for enthalpy of neutralization, we're typically considering the reaction of one mole of H+ with one mole of OH- to form water.

So the amount of H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles. Since each mole of H+ and OH- reaction releases about 57 kJ (or 57,000 J) of energy. But wait, wait, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), because each mole of H+ reacting releases that amount.

Wait, wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). But in this case, the moles are not 1 each. So, the total enthalpy change would be the moles of H+ neutralized multiplied by 57 kJ, but with a negative sign because it's exothermic.

So here, moles of H+ neutralized are 0.2. So 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. Hmm, but wait, look at the options. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which isn't matching. Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total H+ and OH-, but considering the stoichiometry. Let me think again.

Wait, HCl gives 0.1 mol H+. H2SO4 gives 0.18 mol H+ (because 0.09 mol H2SO4 gives 2 H+ each, so 0.18). Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 mol OH-.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the H+ from both acids will react with OH-.

So moles H+ available: 0.1 + 0.18 =0.28

Moles OH-: 0.2

So the OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, consuming 0.2 moles of H+.

So the moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2.

Each mole releases 57 kJ, so 0.2 *57 =11.4 kJ. But since it's exothermic, it's -11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ. Wait, but the options are in kcal. Hmm, so the options are in kcal and kJ.

Wait the options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, so perhaps I should convert 11.4 kJ to kcal.

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ /4.184 ≈ around 2.725 kcal? Let me calculate: 11.4 /4.184 = let's see, 4.184 *2=8.368, 4.184*2.7=11.2968. So 2.7 times 4.184 is about 11.2968, so 11.4-11.2968=0.1032 left. 0.1032 /4.184≈0.0246. So total is about 2.7246 kcal, which is about 2.72 kcal. But wait, that would be positive? No, wait, the enthalpy is negative because exothermic.

Wait, but in the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. But earlier, I thought the result was about -11.4 kJ, which is around -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but that doesn't fit with the standard neutralization value.

Wait another thought: maybe I should consider the total H+ from H2SO4. Wait, wait, does H2SO4 contribute 2 H+ per molecule? Yes. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 gives 0.18 mol H+.

But wait, in reality, the second H+ from H2SO4 is a weak acid. So when you mix H2SO4 with a base, does the second H+ also dissociate?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Because in the case of H2SO4, the first H+ is strong, the second is weak. So in a neutralization reaction with a strong base, perhaps the second H+ will also dissociate because the solution is strongly basic. So I think in this case, both H+ ions will be available for the reaction.

So my initial calculation holds.

So the total H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol.

So moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J = -11.4 kJ. So that's approximately -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about the same as -11.4 kJ converted into kcal. Wait, no, wait. 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. So the correct enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait, the options have B as -11.42 kcal, which would be about -48.54 kJ (since 11.42 *4.184≈47.9). Hmm, but that doesn't match with our calculation.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the enthalpy in kJ, so the answer would be -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps the H2SO4 only contributes one H+? No, I thought H2SO4 is diprotic, but perhaps in this case, only the first H+ is considered. Let me check that.

Wait, for the purpose of neutralization, when the acid is a diprotic strong acid, both H+ ions are available. So H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-.

But wait, wait, wait. Actually, H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-), but wait, no. No, wait. No, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, no, wait. Wait, no, the first H+ is strong. So H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- is complete, and then HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2- is only about 1/3 dissociated, so in a solution, only 1 H+ is strong, the second is weak.

Wait, but when mixing with a strong base, perhaps the second H+ is also deprotonated. Because in a strongly basic solution (high OH- concentration), the HSO4^- might lose another H+.

So in a neutralization reaction, perhaps both H+ from H2SO4 are available.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with the initial assumption that H2SO4 provides 0.18 mol H+.

Wait, but wait another thought: maybe Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but because it's a dihydroxide, each mole gives 2 OH-.

So, Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So, 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 mol OH^-.

So, total H+ is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 mol.

So, OH^- is 0.2 mol.

So, the reaction will neutralize 0.2 mol H+.

So, 0.2 mol H+ reacting with 0.2 mol OH^- to form 0.2 mol H2O.

Each mole releases 57 kJ, so 0.2 *57 =11.4 kJ.

So, the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.5 kJ, which is way off. Option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ (since 2.72 kcal *4.184≈11.4 kJ). So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the question asks for the enthalpy of neutralization, which is typically per mole of reaction, but in this problem, we're being asked for the total enthalpy change when these specific amounts are mixed.

So the answer would be -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, the question says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization... when ... are mixed." So it's the total enthalpy change for the entire mixture.

So the calculation is 0.2 mol H+ neutralized, so 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options have D as -16.0 kJ. That doesn't match. Did I make a mistake in moles?

Wait, let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.5 L *0.2 M= 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL =0.3 L. 0.3 *0.3=0.09 mol H2SO4. Since it's diprotic, 0.09 *2=0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL=0.2 L. 0.2 *0.5=0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol.

So moles of H+ neutralized = 0.2 mol.

So enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm. So that's not matching. Did I miscalculate the moles?

Wait, maybe the H2SO4 only contributes one H+? Let me see.

Wait, in some cases, especially when the second H+ is weak, perhaps only the first H+ is neutralized. So H2SO4 might only contribute 0.09 mol H+.

Wait, if that's the case, total H+ would be 0.1 (HCl) +0.09 (H2SO4) =0.19.

OH- is 0.2.

So H+ neutralized is 0.19, OH- is 0.2. So H+ is limiting, 0.19 neutralized. Then, OH- remaining is 0.01 mol.

Wait, but then the neutralization would only be 0.19 mol H+ reacting with 0.19 mol OH-.

Enthalpy change would be 0.19 * (-57) = -10.83 kJ ≈-10.83 kJ.

But none of the options match this exactly either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but perhaps the neutralization reaction produces more than just water.

Wait, wait, perhaps the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, but that's a precipitation reaction. So perhaps this is a metathesis reaction where BaSO4 precipitates out, but the enthalpy would then include both the acid-base neutralization and the formation of a precipitate.

Ah! That complicates things. Because not all the H+ is for neutralization; some is for making a precipitate.

Wait, because H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 can react to form BaSO4, which is a precipitate.

So the reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O.

In this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of water.

So let's figure out the moles.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

So H2SO4 is the limiting reactant here, as 0.09 < 0.1.

So 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 to produce 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

So in this reaction, the H+ from H2SO4 is consumed in forming water, but also part of it is tied up in making BaSO4.

Wait, but how does that affect the total H+ available for neutralization?

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think.

The neutralization reaction is an acid-base reaction, but when the cations form an insoluble compound, it affects the H+ available.

In this case, the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 will consume some of the H+ and OH- to form BaSO4 and water.

So perhaps the total H+ and OH- in solution after this precipitation would be less than the sum.

So perhaps I should approach this by first considering the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

The balanced equation for this is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

Each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of water.

So moles of H2SO4:0.09, Ba(OH)2:0.1.

So H2SO4 is limiting.

So after reaction:

H2SO4: 0.09 -0.09 =0.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 -0.09=0.01 mol.

BaSO4: 0.09 mol (precipitate, so removed from solution).

H2O: 0.18 mol.

But wait, what about the H+ and OH-?

In the reaction, for each mole of H2SO4, 2 H+ are provided, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

So the reaction consumes 2 H+ and 2 OH- per mole of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but that's not quite right. Let's look at the acid-base aspect.

In the reaction:

H2SO4 (strong acid) donates 2 H+.

Ba(OH)2 (strong base) donates 2 OH-.

So the reaction between them would involve H+ and OH-.

But in the reaction equation, it's more about the metathesis. So the H+ from H2SO4 and OH- from Ba(OH)2 combine to form water, while the sulfate and barium hydroxide ions form the precipitate.

So, for each mole of H2SO4, 2 H+ are available. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

So in the reaction, 2 H+ + 2 OH- → 2 H2O.

But for each mole of H2SO4 reacting with one mole of Ba(OH)2, 2 H+ and 2 OH- are consumed to form 2 H2O.

But the moles are H2SO4: 0.09, Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

So, the H2SO4 is the limiting reagent.

So, 0.09 moles of H2SO4 will react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2.

Each of these contributes 2 H+ and 2 OH- respectively, so 0.09 * 2 =0.18 H+ from H2SO4, 0.09 *2=0.18 OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So in this reaction, 0.18 H+ and 0.18 OH- are consumed to form 0.18 H2O. Wait, no, because each H2SO4 provides 2 H+, each Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

So 0.09 moles of H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 OH-.

So H+ from H2SO4:0.18, OH- from Ba(OH)2:0.18.

They react to form 0.18 H2O.

So after this reaction, the remaining H+ is from HCl and any unreacted H+ from H2SO4 or Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but after the reaction, the H+ and OH- from the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 that reacted have been consumed.

Wait, but let's think about the total H+ and OH- in solution.

The total H+ prior to reaction is from HCl and H2SO4.

HCl:0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4:0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ =0.28.

OH- comes from Ba(OH)2:0.1 mol →0.2 OH-.

So, before any reaction, the solution has 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

But when you mix them, the H+ and OH- will react.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the reaction as follows:

The total H+ is 0.28.

The total OH- is 0.2.

So the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

The moles that will react are the minimum of H+ and OH-.

So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- will react, producing 0.2 moles of H2O.

The remaining H+ is 0.28 - 0.2 =0.08 moles.

But wait, I'm getting back to the same conclusion as before, that 0.2 moles are neutralized. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

But that's not matching any of the options except when converting to kcal, I get about -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, the options have B) -11.42 kcal, which is roughly -48.5 kJ.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me check all calculations again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is using the standard enthalpy of neutralization as -57.3 kcal/mol. Because 57.3 kJ is approximately 13.72 kcal (since 57.3 /4.184 ≈13.72). No, wait, wait:

Wait, 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 57.3 kJ is 57.3 /4.184 ≈13.69 kcal.

So, if the question is using the value in kcal, perhaps the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-13.69) ≈-2.74 kcal, which matches option A (-2.72 kcal).

Wait, but why would they use 57.3 kcal per mole? Because normally, the standard enthalpy is given in kJ.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done with the assumption that the enthalpy per mole is about 57.3 kcal, which is not correct. Because 57.3 kJ is correct, not kcal.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacted.

So, 0.2 moles → 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

Which is approximately -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. That's not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the neutralization is considering the total H+ from all sources, but in reality, some of the H+ is used to form the precipitate, so less H+ is available for neutralization.

Wait, in the case where Ba(OH)2 reacts with H2SO4 to form BaSO4 precipitate, the H+ from H2SO4 is consumed in that reaction, not available for neutralization with OH-.

So, the H+ available for neutralization would only be from HCl, since the H+ from H2SO4 is tied up in making the precipitate.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the H+ from H2SO4 is available, but perhaps that's incorrect because some of it is used in forming the precipitate.

Wait, let's model this:

The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O.

In this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+, each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

So for each mole of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reacting, 2 H+ and 2 OH- are consumed to form 2 H2O.

So, in our case, 0.09 moles of H2SO4 react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, consuming 0.18 H+ and 0.18 OH-.

So after this reaction:

H2SO4: 0.09 -0.09=0.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 -0.09=0.01.

H+ remaining: from HCl (0.1) and any unreacted H2SO4.

Wait, but H2SO4 has been completely consumed in this reaction, so remaining H+ is 0.1 (from HCl).

Now, the OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.01 * 2 =0.02 mol.

Wait, but before the reaction, the OH- was 0.2 mol. After reaction, 0.09 *2 =0.18 OH- has been consumed in the neutralization (producing water), and the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.01 mol, which gives 0.02 OH-.

So the remaining OH- is 0.02 mol.

So now, the H+ available is 0.1 (from HCl), and OH- is 0.02 mol.

So the neutralization reaction would involve H+ and OH- combining.

So the H+ from HCl: 0.1, OH-:0.02.

They will react in a 1:1 ratio, so 0.02 mol of H+ and OH- will react, producing 0.02 mol H2O.

The remaining H+ is 0.1 -0.02 =0.08 mol.

So the total enthalpy change is from two sources:

1. The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4 and water, releasing enthalpy.

2. The neutralization of 0.02 mol H+ with OH-.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me try another approach. Let's calculate the moles of H+ and OH- after all possible reactions, including the precipitation.

Total H+ initially: 0.1 (HCl) +0.18 (H2SO4) =0.28.

Total OH- initially:0.2.

But some of the H+ and OH- will react to form water and precipitate.

The reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O.

Moles H2SO4:0.09, Ba(OH)2:0.1.

H2SO4 is limiting.

So, 0.09 moles H2SO4 react with 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2.

Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+, each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-.

So in this reaction, 0.18 H+ and 0.18 OH- are consumed.

So after this reaction, H+ remaining:0.28 -0.18=0.10.

OH- remaining:0.2 -0.18=0.02.

So now, 0.10 H+ and 0.02 OH- are present.

These will react in a 1:1 ratio, consuming 0.02 H+ and 0.02 OH-.

So total H+ neutralized:

In the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

In the neutralization of remaining H+ and OH-: 0.02 mol.

Total H+ neutralized:0.20 mol.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.20 mol * (-57.3 kJ/mol) =-11.46 kJ.

Which is approximately -11.46 kJ, which is -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.5 kJ, which is much larger. Option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ. So close.

Wait, but 0.2 mol * (-57.3 kJ/mol) is -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.74 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

Ah, but why would the enthalpy change be 0.2 mol *57.3? Because in this approach, 0.2 mol of H+ were neutralized (0.18 in precipitation reaction, 0.02 in neutralization).

Wait, but for the purpose of enthalpy of neutralization, the precipitation reaction also releases enthalpy.

Wait, perhaps I should model this correctly.

The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 produces water and BaSO4 precipitate. The enthalpy change for this reaction is different from the neutralization enthalpy.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization, which typically refers to the reaction between an acid and a base to form water. The precipitation would have its own enthalpy change, but perhaps the question is only considering the neutralization part.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all the H+ that ends up being neutralized, regardless of how it got there.

So, the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 mol, so 0.2 * (-57.3) =-11.46 kJ.

Which is approximately -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options:

Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching.

Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.5 kJ.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach.

An alternative approach is to calculate the total H+ and OH- available, and then compute the heat released.

So total H+ =0.1 +0.18 =0.28.

Total OH- =0.2.

The neutralization will involve min(0.28,0.2) =0.2 mol.

So, 0.2 mol H+ reacting, releasing 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ.

So the total enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.4 kJ. So that's not matching.

So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but only the first H+ is considered, so 0.09 mol H+ from H2SO4. So total H+ would be 0.1 +0.09=0.19.

OH- is 0.2.

So H+ is limiting, 0.19 neutralized.

Enthalpy change:0.19 * (-57.3) =-10.89 kJ.

None of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the enthalpy per mole of reaction, but the total isn't matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the heat released from the neutralization, considering which is the limiting reagent.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of total equivalents.

HCl provides 0.1 eq H+.

H2SO4 provides 0.18 eq H+.

Total H+ eq:0.28.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 eq OH-.

So the reaction can neutralize 0.2 eq, releasing 0.2 *57.3 kJ=11.46 kJ.

So the answer is approximately -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is off by about 4.5 kJ.

But none of the other options match this.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the enthalpy of the reaction between all three solutions, including the precipitation.

In that case, the reaction would be:

HCl + H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → products.

But that's more complex. Let me think.

But perhaps the neutralization enthalpy is calculated as the amount of heat released from the H+ and OH- reacting, regardless of the other reactions.

So, the total H+ and OH- reacting is 0.2 mol, so 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ.

Which is about -11.46 kJ.

But none of the options show this except if the question uses kcal.

Wait, 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 kcal (since 11.46 /4.184≈2.738).

So the enthalpy change is approximately -2.74 kcal, which matches option A (-2.72 kcal).

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But earlier I thought that the neutralization of 0.2 mol H+ would give -11.4 kJ, which is around -2.72 kcal.

So, given the options, A is the correct one.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are considered:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl dissociates completely, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).

   - **H₂SO₄ (diprotic acid):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ dissociates into 2 moles of H⁺, so it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).

   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 moles of OH⁻, so it contributes \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \).

2. **Identify the limiting reactant:**
   - Total H⁺ available = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Total OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - The limiting reactant is OH⁻, as it is present in the smaller amount (\( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \)).

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O} \), which releases \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) of energy.  
   - Moles of H⁺ neutralized = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \times (-57.3) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).

4. **Convert to kcal (if necessary):**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   - \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \approx -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).

5. **Match with the options:**
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) is closest to the calculated value of \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).  
   - Option D (\( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \)) and Option B (\( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \)) do not match the calculated value.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.
