Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about dissolving a certain amount of Fe(OH)3 in an acidic solution and figuring out the minimum volume of a strong monobasic acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, okay. Let's see.

First, I need to figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. The problem states 0.1 grams of it. I remember that the formula for iron(III) hydroxide is Fe(OH)3, right? So I should find its molar mass to convert grams to moles.

The molar mass of Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH- group has a molar mass of 17.01 g/mol (since O is 16 and H is 1). Since there are three OH groups, that's 3 * 17.01 = 51.03 g/mol. Adding Fe gives 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol. So for 0.1 grams, the number of moles is 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol. Let me write that as approximately 9.36e-4 mol.

Now, the next part is dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, reacting with a strong acid will produce Fe^3+ ions, water, and the conjugate base of the acid. The reaction should be something like: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Oh wait, yeah, because each OH- from Fe(OH)3 will react with H+ from the acid.

So, the Fe(OH)3 will provide 3 moles of OH- per mole of Fe(OH)3. Wait, no, wait. Actually, each Fe(OH)3 has 3 OH- groups, so each mole of Fe(OH)3 will react with 3 moles of H+.

So, for 9.36e-4 mol of Fe(OH)3, the H+ required is 3 * 9.36e-4 = 0.002808 mol. Because each Fe(OH)3 needs 3 H+ to neutralize each OH-.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is Fe(OH)3, which has three OH- per formula unit. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 produces 3 moles of OH-, which means it requires 3 moles of H+ to neutralize. So yes, 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3 gives moles of H+ needed.

So, 9.36e-4 mol * 3 = 0.002808 mol of H+ needed.

The acid provided is 0.1 M, monobasic. So that means each mole of acid provides one mole of H+. So the volume of acid solution needed is moles of H+ divided by concentration.

So, volume = moles / Molarity = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but let me check the options. Option C says 28.05 cm³, which is very close. But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the molar mass.

Wait, let me recalculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 more accurately. Fe is 55.845 g/mol. Each OH is 17.0074 g/mol. So three OHs would be 3*17.0074 = 51.0222. Adding Fe: 55.845 + 51.0222 = 106.8672 g/mol.

So 0.1 g / 106.8672 g/mol = approximately 0.0009357 mol. So that's correct. Then 3 times that is 0.002807 mol of H+.

Volume is 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³. So looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. That's very close. So that's probably the correct volume. But wait, what about the total volume after adding the acid? Because the initial solution is 100 cm³. Oh, wait, the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume of the acid added plus the initial solution equals 100 cm³?

Wait, wait, no. Let me read the question again. It says: "dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So the total solution volume is 100 cm³. So 100 cm³ is the final volume after adding the acid.

Wait, but the acid you add is part of the 100 cm³. Hmm, so the initial solution's volume is 100 cm³, but when you add the acid, you have to mix it in. So the volume of the acid solution you add (V_acid) plus the volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution (which I think is considered as solid, maybe? Or perhaps they're assuming that the volume of the solid is negligible compared to the solution. Maybe the 100 cm³ is the final solution's volume, including the acid added. So the volume of the acid is V_acid, and the rest is the solution (maybe 100 - V_acid cm³ from the initial solution? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the solution is prepared by adding the acid to the Fe(OH)3. So let's say the initial solution is 100 cm³, and we need to find the volume of 0.1 M HCl (as
