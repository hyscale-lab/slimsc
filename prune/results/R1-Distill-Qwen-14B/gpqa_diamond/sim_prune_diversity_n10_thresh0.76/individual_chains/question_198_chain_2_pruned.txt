Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Alright, let me break this down.

First, the problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN⁻ concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think the stability constant tells us about the stability of the complex formed.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, β is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. So for each complex, higher β means more stable. The complexes probably form in a stepwise manner, adding SCN⁻ ions one by one.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I'm not exactly sure which one that is, but I think it's the Co(SCN)_n²+ complex with n=2 or 4. Wait, the options are for the dithiocyanato, which has two SCN⁻ ligands. Or maybe it's something else. Oh, but the blue color is a characteristic of Co with certain ligands. I think the dithiocyanato is Co(SCN)₂²+.

So, the possible complexes are Co²+, Co(SCN)²+, Co(SCN)₂²+, and Co(SCN)₃²+, Co(SCN)₄²+? Wait, but the stability constants given are β1 to β4. Let me think: the stability constant for each step is when each SCN⁻ binds. So the first β is for Co²+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)²+, β1=9. The second β is for Co(SCN)²+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₂²+, β2=40. Then β3=63 for the next step, adding another SCN⁻ to make Co(SCN)₃²+? Or wait, maybe each β is for the overall complex formation. Oh wait, no, I think each β corresponds to the nth complex. So for each Co
