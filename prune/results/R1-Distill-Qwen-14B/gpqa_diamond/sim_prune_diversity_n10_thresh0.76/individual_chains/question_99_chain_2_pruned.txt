Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different structures, and I have to pick the right one based on the spectral data.

First, the FTIR data: there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So the compound has a hydroxyl group, maybe a carboxylic acid since that's a common functional group with O-H. Also, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So probably a ketone or aldehyde, but wait, carboxylic acids also have that. But carboxylic acid carbonyls are usually a bit lower, maybe around 1700. Wait, sometimes higher? Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. Hmm, not sure. But for now, the presence suggests a carbonyl group, maybe from a carboxylic acid.

Now looking at the 1H NMR: several peaks, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. That means there are no double bonds, or any sp² hybridized carbons with adjacent hydrogens. So the molecule is probably entirely single bonds, or any double bonds are in a part without adjacent hydrogens, like maybe an aromatic ring with no ortho hydrogens. But in the options, I don't see any aromatic compounds. So, maybe no double bonds at all. So the structure doesn't have any vinyl groups. So that's a clue.

Next, the NMR has a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, complex splitting. Let me think: splitting in NMR arises from neighboring protons. Each neighboring set with n+1 peaks. But when multiple neighboring groups are present, you get more complex splitting. For example, a doublet of doublets comes from two neighboring sets each splitting the peak.

So, a doublet of triplets of quartets is a triple split from one set, then each of those split into triplets, and then each triplet splits into quartets. Wait no, the order is from the number of splitting groups. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's break it down.

In NMR splitting, each neighboring group adds a splitting. The multiplicity is determined by the number of neighboring Hs plus one. So, for each group of neighboring Hs, you multiply the splitting.

So, each neighboring group contributes a certain number of splits. So, if a proton is next to two different groups, each with a different number of Hs, the splitting combines. For example, if a CH2 is next to a CH3 and a CH2, each with 3 and 2 Hs respectively, the splitting would be a triplet from the CH3 (n=3 → triplet) and a triplet from the CH2 (n=2 → triplet), so the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is 3*3=9 peaks. But that's a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in the question, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Let's parse that. So, each part is a split from a neighboring group.

Doublet → split by a group with 1 neighboring H (like a CH2 group with two Hs, but that's a triplet. Wait, no, a doublet comes from a neighboring group with 1 H. Wait, no, the number is n+1. So a neighboring group with 1 H would produce a doublet, because n=1 → 2 peaks. So, for example, a proton next to a CH2 (with 2 H) would be a triplet.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of neighboring Hs. So if a proton is next to a CH2 and a CH3, each of those groups would split the signal. The CH2 has 2 H, so it would cause a triplet. The CH3 has 3 H, causing a quartet. So when you have two neighboring groups, the splitting is the product
