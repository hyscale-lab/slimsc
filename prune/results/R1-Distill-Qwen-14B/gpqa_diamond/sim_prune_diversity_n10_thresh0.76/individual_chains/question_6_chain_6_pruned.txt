Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle moving in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Oh wait, that's in polar coordinates. So I think maybe I should convert this into Cartesian coordinates or see if it's separable.

Wait a second, the potential has terms involving r squared and cos squared theta. Let me think about this. I remember that in polar coordinates, r is the radial distance, and θ is the angle. So the potential has two terms: one that's purely radial and another that depends on cos²θ.

Hmm, cos squared theta can be expressed using the double-angle identity. Oh right, cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me compute that:

(3/2)k r² * (1/2) [because 3/2 multiplied by (1/2 from the identity)] gives (3/4)k r². So the potential becomes:

V = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, wait, actually, let me do that again. The second term is (3/2)k r² ( (1 + cos2θ)/2 ). So (3/2)*(1/2) is 3/4, so the second term becomes (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). So expanding that, it's (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

So the entire potential is:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Adding the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) is 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (
