Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science question about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The question is a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the setup: They've identified a new ligand-receptor pair. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets making a binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices. 

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Wait, bicistronic means it has two coding regions in one construct, right? So the vector has two ORFs. The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive? Upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. IRES is involved in internal ribosome entry sites, allowing for the translation of the second gene in a bicistronic message. So the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES, meaning that the receptor's expression is dependent on the ligand's promoter? Or maybe the IRES allows for the receptor to be translated as a separate ORF.

There are stop cassettes. Between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a stop in lox2272-stop-lox2272. I'm a bit rusty on the details, but I think that loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites recognized by Cre recombinase. So when Cre is present, it can excise the stop cassette. So if the construct is in a cell that has Cre, then the stop would be removed, allowing expression of the mCherry (after ligand) and eGFP (after receptor).

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression via Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, which is a control for loading. So the blot is working.

They made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is probably under the SOX10 promoter. Cre would be active in neural crest cells, leading to recombination.

After the offspring are born, they visualize under confocal. They expected some green signal (from eGFP) but didn't see it. So why no green?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if the ligand and receptor are in the same cell, autocrine signaling would happen. I'm not sure how this affects expression. If they're paracrine, maybe the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells. But why would that cause no eGFP signal? Because the eGFP is on the receptor, so if the receptor isn't expressed, then no eGFP. But the construct is supposed to express it in neural crest via Cre.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. So the GFP wouldn't be expressed on the surface. But the Western blot uses total proteins, so if it's stuck in the Golgi, it's still present in the cell, so the antibody should detect it. Unless the eGFP is not properly processed. But would that prevent detection? Maybe not, since the blot is for the protein. So B might not explain the lack of signal.

Option C: Enhancer for expression is missing. Well, the construct has the CBA promoter for the ligand. CBA is a strong promoter, so probably doesn't rely much on enhancers. But the IRES for the receptor's expression. If the IRES is not functional, perhaps the receptor isn't expressed. Alternatively, if the enhancer is missing, but the promoters are present, maybe the expression is low. But the Western blot showed that the proteins were expressed when transfected into astrocytes. So maybe the issue isn't the enhancer.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, wait. The receptor's ORF is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. If they are not in frame, then the eGFP might not be properly expressed. But wait, the vector is designed so that the ORFs are in frame. Unless during cloning, the frame was messed up. But the question says that they raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, so both should be expressed if the construct works.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic with loxP and lox2272 stops. So when Cre is introduced, the stop cassettes are removed. For the ligand (5'), the loxP-stop-loxP would be between ligand and mCherry. Cre would excise that, so ligand-mCherry would be expressed as a fusion, right? No, wait, no, because the stop cassette is between the ORF and the fluorescent protein. So the ligand ORF is first, then a stop with a loxP cassette. So without Cre, the ligand's stop is in place. Wait, no, the stop is in the lox cassette. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the stop prevents the mCherry from being expressed. With Cre, the stop is removed, so the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed.

Similarly, the receptor has a stop in the lox2272 cassette. Cre would remove it, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be co-expressed.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So when they breed with SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells, the Cre would excise the stop cassettes in those cells. So in neural crest cells, both ligand and receptor should be expressed, along with their respective fluorescent proteins.

But in the experiment, when they looked for eGFP under confocal, they didn't see green. Why?

Possible issues:

1. The Cre wasn't active, so the stop cassettes were not removed. But since they crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is a strong promoter, the Cre should be active in the neural crest cells.

2. The IRES didn't work. So the receptor's expression is not happening. Because the ligand is under CBA (constitutive), and the IRES is for the receptor. Maybe the IRES isn't functional in the cells, so the receptor isn't expressed. But then, why would the eGFP not be expressed? Because the receptor's ORF is followed by a stop, unless Cre removed it.

Wait, but in the construct, the receptor's ORF is after the IRES, which is after the ligand's ORF. So the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES. So when the stop between receptor and eG
