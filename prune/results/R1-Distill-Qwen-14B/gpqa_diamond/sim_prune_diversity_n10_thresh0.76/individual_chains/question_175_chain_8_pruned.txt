Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charge distributions and radiation. Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they can emit electromagnetic radiation. The setup is a spheroid shape with symmetry along the z-axis, so that's probably an electric dipole or something similar.

The question says the oscillation leads to radiation at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and they're asking for the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, plus the form of f.

Wait, I think the radiation pattern for a dipole has to do with the angle. For a dipole antenna, the radiation is maximum when the angle is 90 degrees, and it falls off as you go towards 0 or 180 degrees. The pattern is something like sin(theta), or maybe sin^2(theta). Oh wait, I think the radiation intensity for an electric dipole in the far field is proportional to (sin(theta))^2. So maximum at theta=90 degrees.

But wait, in this problem, the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped, which might imply a different radiation pattern. Or maybe it's similar to a dipole? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem states that the charge distribution is oscillating and spheroidal, so perhaps it's a higher multipole moment, but maybe it's approximating a dipole for simplicity. Or perhaps the main contribution is from the dipole term.

The maximum power is A. So if the maximum occurs at theta where the function f is maximum. For a dipole, the maximum intensity is at theta=90, which would be the maximum of sin^2(theta). But in this problem, the maximum power A is given as the overall maximum, so perhaps the angle where A occurs is theta=90, but wait, the question is what fraction of A is radiated at theta=30 degrees.

Wait, wait. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. So the total power is the integral of f over all solid angles. The maximum value of f is A, I think. Or maybe A is the maximum value of f. Let me read the question again.

The maximum power thus radiated is A. So A is the maximum value of f. So f(theta) has a maximum value
