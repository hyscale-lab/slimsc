Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll read through the problem again and list out the reactions and clues.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, used as a solvent.

Hmm. Let me think about possible substances that fit these descriptions.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. A is a solid, B is a gas, C is bright red. Bright red product... Maybe sulfur-related? Or maybe something like copper(II) sulfate? Wait, but copper compounds can be various colors. Alternatively, maybe A is something like sodium or another metal reacting with a diatomic gas.

Wait, another thought: when a metal reacts with a diatomic gas like O2 or Cl2, it forms a compound. For example, aluminum reacting with chlorine gas to form AlCl3, but that's not red. Alternatively, if A is sodium, B could be chlorine. 8 equivalents... That might not fit. Wait, let me think about the mole ratios.

If A is a metal, say sodium (Na), and B is chlorine (Cl2). The reaction would be 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl. But the problem states 8 equivalents. So perhaps the reaction is more like 8 moles of B. Let's see: if A is sodium, and B is Cl2, the stoichiometry is 2:1. So if 8 equivalents of B (Cl2) are used, maybe the formula is NaCl with a higher ratio, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe A is something else.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider reaction 4: D + B → H, a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, etc. But D and B are gases, reacting in 1:1 ratio.

Wait, D reacting with B to form H (a solvent). If B is Cl2, then D could be something like H2, but their reaction would form HCl,
