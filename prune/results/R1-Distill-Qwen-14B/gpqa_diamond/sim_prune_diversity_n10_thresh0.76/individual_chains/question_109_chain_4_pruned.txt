Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, let's think. 

Alright, the problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So, first, I need to remember what 1S0 means. I think the notation is (2S+1)L, where S is the total spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So 1S0 would be (2*0 +1)S, so it's S=0, L=0, and J=0. So the initial state is spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0, total angular momentum 0.

Then, particle X is emitted. X has intrinsic parity -1. Wait, parity is related to angular momentum, right? Parity for orbital angular momentum L is (-1)^L. So for X, since its parity is -1, that would mean that (-1)^L for X is -1. So L for X must be odd. Because (-1)^L = -1 implies L is odd. So X must be in an L=1, 3, etc., state. But since the options give specific letters, like S, P, D, F, etc., which correspond to L=0,1,2,3... So X is in a state with L odd. So X's orbital state is P, D, F, etc. So X can't be in S state because L=0 is even, which gives parity +1, but X's intrinsic parity is -1. So X must be emitted in a P, D, F, etc., state.

Wait, but the problem says X is emitted with intrinsic parity -1. So maybe I'm mixing up the intrinsic parity of X and the orbital part. Wait, intrinsic parity is a property of the particle itself, independent of how it's moving. So the parity of the emitted particle is -1, but when considering the overall parity change, it's also about the orbital angular momentum state.

The initial state is 1S0, which has parity (-1)^0 = +1 because L=0. After emission, the final state is two nucleons (NN) in some state, and the emitted particle X in some state. The problem says Pauli statistics require certain conditions on isospin, angular momentum, and spin. The equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So T, S, L are the isospin, spin, and orbital angular momentum of the NN system. Wait, but the emitted particle X will carry away some angular momentum, so the NN system's angular momentum (L_NN) will change.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0, so J=0. After emission, the total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial total angular momentum is J_initial =0. The final state consists of two nucleons (NN) in state T, S, L, and the emitted particle X in some state (like 7D1, etc.). So the total angular momentum of NN and
