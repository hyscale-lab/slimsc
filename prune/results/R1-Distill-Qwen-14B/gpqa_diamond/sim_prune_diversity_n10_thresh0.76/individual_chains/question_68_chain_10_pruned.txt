Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question says.

Alright, the setup is a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma multiplied by the Sz component. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off, and another one turns on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm. I remember from my studies that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin of a particle precesses around the field direction. The magnetic moment mu interacts with the magnetic field, leading to energy levels and transitions.

Wait, the initial state is with the field along Z. So the particle's spin is aligned along Z. Since the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz, the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. So the z-component of the magnetic moment is just gamma times the eigenvalue of Sz.

But then the field is turned off in the Z direction and turned on in the Y direction. So now the magnetic field is along Y. The particle's spin will now precess around the Y-axis because the magnetic field is in Y. I think that the oscillation of the expectation value of the spin components is related to the energy difference between the spin states.

Wait, the spin states in a magnetic field are quantized. When the field is along Y, the eigenstates of Sy will determine the energy. So the energy levels are proportional to Sy. The energy is given by E = -mu Â· B, which for a magnetic moment is E = -gamma B S_y (since mu = gamma S).

But wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so when the field is in the Y direction, the energy is E = -gamma B S_y. Alternatively, the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y.

Wait, no, the correct expression is H = - mu Â· B. So since mu is gamma S, H = - gamma S Â· B. So when B is in Y direction, H = - gamma B S_y.

Right. So the eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of S_y, which are |+y> and
