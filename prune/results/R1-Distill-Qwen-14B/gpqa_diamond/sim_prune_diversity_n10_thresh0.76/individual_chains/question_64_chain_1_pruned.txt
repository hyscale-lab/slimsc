Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. I'll start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, totaling 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases was formed. These gases were then passed through three different tubes or solutions. Let's break down what each of these tubes did.

The first tube is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can absorb water vapor. So, probably, the gas passing through here must have some water in it, and the tube's weight increased by 3.60 grams. That suggests that 3.60 grams of water were absorbed by tube №1.

Then, the gas goes through Ca(OH)2 solution, which is tube №2. The weight of this tube didn't change. Ca(OH)2, or slaked lime, is used to absorb CO2 gas. If the weight didn't change, that implies no CO2 was present in the gas mixture. Because if CO2 were present, the solution would have reacted, increasing the weight. So, no CO2 here.

The third tube has red-hot copper. The weight of tube №3 increased by 0.80 grams, and CuO was formed. Red-hot copper usually reacts with certain gases. The reaction I'm thinking of is with CO, where CO is oxidized to CO2. The reaction is 2Cu + CO → 2CuO + C. Alternatively, maybe it's reacting with something else, but CO seems likely. Wait, if the gas has CO, the copper would react, producing CuO and carbon. The increase in weight is due to the oxygen from the CO combining with copper.

So, the gases going in must have contained CO and H2O, perhaps? Because the first tube absorbed H2O, and the third reacted with CO. But wait, no CO2 in tube 2, so the initial gas must not have had CO2, but after reaction in tube 3, it could have produced some CO2.

But wait, let's think again. The gas after tube 3 would have passed through all of
