Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. The key is understanding the brightness limits of each instrument.

From the information given: ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So anything with V mag less than 17 (since lower numbers are brighter) is observable by ESPRESSO. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, stars with V mag less than 16 are observable.

Wait, wait, no. Wait. The question says "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO. Oh wait, wait—apparent magnitude scale works such that lower numbers are brighter. So a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So if the instrument can observe stars brighter than (i.e., magnitude lower than) a certain value, then any star with V mag less than that limit is observable.

So for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude and see whether it's below both 17 (for ESPRESSO) and 16 (for HIRES). Or wait, no—because the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star must be observable by both. So the star's apparent V mag must be less than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and less than 16 (so HIRES can see it). Wait, but that would mean the apparent V mag has to be less than 16, because HIRES can only see brighter than 16. So any star with V mag less than 16 is observable by both. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so anything <17 is okay. But HIRES can only go up to 16, so if a star is brighter than 16 (V<16), HIRES can see it, and if it's also V<17, then ESPRESSO can see it. So the stars that are observable by both must have V mag less than 16.

Wait, but let me
