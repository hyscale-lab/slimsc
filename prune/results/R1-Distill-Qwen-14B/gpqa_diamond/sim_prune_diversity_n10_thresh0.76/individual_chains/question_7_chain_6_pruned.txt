Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The question is asking at what energy the gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with photon-photon interactions and maybe pair production. 

Let me think. The process given is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. This is a reaction where two photons collide and produce an electron-positron pair. For this to happen, the energy of the photons must be sufficient to create the rest mass of the particles. Wait, the rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, right? So each photon needs to have enough energy, but since they're colliding, maybe their combined energy must be at least that of the rest mass.

But wait, the problem states that the average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV. Oh right, the CMB photons are low energy, so the gamma-rays are the high-energy ones. So one photon is from the CMB (low energy) and the other is the high-energy gamma-ray. 

I think the key here is the cross-section for this process. The cross-section determines the probability of the interaction. At high energies, the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation increases, but there's a threshold energy required for it to occur.

The threshold occurs when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to produce the electron and positron. Since the rest mass is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV, but wait, no. Each e+ and e- has 0.511 MeV, so together, the rest mass energy is 1.022 MeV. But since the two photons are colliding, their energies must add up to at least that. 

But wait, in the center of mass frame, the total energy should be at least 2 m_e c^2. So the condition is sqrt(s) ≥ 2 m_e c^2, where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. 

Alternatively, the condition for the reaction to be possible is that the energy in the center of mass frame is at least 2 m_e c^2. So the invariant quantity s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since photons are massless, E = pc for each. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 (because p1 c = E1 and p2 c = E2, so vectors add). Wait, no, I think I messed that up. Let me think again.

The photons are moving in opposite directions, I assume. So their momenta are opposite. So the total momentum is (p1 - p2), but wait, that depends on their directions. Let me model this properly. Suppose the gamma photon is moving in the +x direction, and the CMB photon is moving in the -x direction. Then their momenta are p1 and p2 in opposite directions. So the total momentum is p1 - p2 (if p2 is in the opposite direction
