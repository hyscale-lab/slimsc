Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. 

Wait, the system's state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And the operators P_x, P_y, P_z are given in matrix form. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means that the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z.

Uncertainty in P_z is given by the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

But wait, since the state is already in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value of P_z should be the eigenvalue corresponding to that state. Because in an eigenbasis, the expectation value is just the eigenvalue. So that's a point to consider.

Let me write down the state vector. It's a 3x1 column vector: the first component is -1/2, second is 1/sqrt(2), third is -1/2. So |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

But wait, is this state normalized? Let me check. The sum of the squares of the magnitudes should be 1. Let's calculate:

| -1/2 |² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|1/√2 |² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

| -1/2 |² is again 1/4.

Adding them up: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1/4 * 2) + 1/2 = (1/2) + 1/2 = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each basis vector corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. So the state |ψ⟩ is a linear combination of these eigenstates. Let me think, what are the eigenvalues of P_z?

Looking at the matrix given for P_z:

P_z = 
[ [ ħ, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, -ħ ] ]

So the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ. The basis vectors are the standard basis vectors, probably |+⟩ = [1,0,0], |0⟩ = [0,1,0], and |-⟩ = [0,0,1].

So our state is |ψ⟩ = (-1/2)|+⟩ + (1/√2)|0⟩ + (-1/2)|-⟩.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the expectation value of P_z. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of (probability of each state
