Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO₄³⁻, in this solution. The Ka values for H₃PO₄ are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay. So the first thing I think of is that these salts are related to phosphoric acid, H3PO4, which is a triprotic acid. The salts given are K hydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and sodium hydrogen phosphate (but the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which I think is the decahydrate, but wait, maybe it's a typo? Or maybe it's the monohydrate? No, wait, the formula given is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So when it dissolves, it will release Na+ ions and HPO4^2- ions, along with water.

Wait, no. Let me think. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, but considering the water, but perhaps the water is just part of the formula and doesn't affect the ions much.

So the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But I'm trying to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but wait. How do these ions relate? Because H3PO4 can donate three protons. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (with Ka1). The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2), and the third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3).

But in this solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- as the main species. So to find PO4^3-, perhaps I need to consider the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. If the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, perhaps they form a buffer solution. Alternatively, maybe the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and any PO4^3- would come from the third dissociation of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the concentration of PO4^3- ions. So perhaps I can find the concentration of PO4^3- by considering the third dissociation of HPO4^2-.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Calculate the moles of each salt in the solution.
2. Find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.
3. Assume that PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.
4. Use the Ka3 value to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Alternatively, maybe there's some contribution from both salts, but perhaps the main source of PO4^3- is from the HPO4^2- dissociation.

So step 1: moles of each component.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass / molar mass. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that.

1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007336 mol.

Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol.

1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005603 mol.

Now, the solution volume is 200 mL, which is 0.2 L. So concentrations.

Concentration of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.007336 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03668 M.

Concentration of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.005603 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.028015 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check: Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus 2 H2O. But in solution, it's Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So yes, 0.005603 mol of HPO4^2- in 0.2 L gives 0.028015 M.

Now, the next step is to figure out the concentration of PO4^3-.

Hmm, so in solution, HPO4^2- can dissociate into H+ and PO4^3- via the third dissociation:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So the equilibrium expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

Wait, but what is the concentration of H+ here? I need to find [PO4^3-], but I might need to know [H+].

But wait, in a solution containing both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH might be determined by their equilibrium. So perhaps I need to consider the buffer solution formed by H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (that's the second dissociation, so the Ka2 is 6
