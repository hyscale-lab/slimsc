Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. Oh right, and I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero because momentum is conserved. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. That makes sense.

First, I think I should find the masses of the two fragments. The initial mass is M. Let me denote the masses of the fragments as m1 and m2. It says m1 is twice as massive as m2, so m1 = 2*m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Because the sum is 99% of M.

So substituting m1 as 2m2 into the second equation: 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. Then m1 is 0.66 M. Wait, 0.33 plus 0.66 is 0.99, which matches. So m1 is 0.66M and m2 is 0.33M.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total energy before fission is just its rest mass energy, which is 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy should be the sum of the rest energies plus their kinetic energies.

But wait, the problem states to ignore electrons, so probably electrons aren't involved, but I'm not sure how that affects it. Maybe it just means we don't have to consider binding energy with electrons or something like that.

So, in the rest frame of the nucleus, after fission, the two fragments have kinetic energies T1 and T2. The total energy is (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2). But since the nucleus was at rest, the total energy must be conserved.

Wait, but the initial energy is just M c², so:

M c² = (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2)

Which simplifies to:

M c² = (m1 + m2)c² + (T1 + T2)

But m1 + m2 is 0.99 M, so:

M c² = 0.99 M c² + (T1 + T2)

Subtracting 0.99 M c² from both sides:

0.01 M c² = T1
