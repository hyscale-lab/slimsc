Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what this unknown compound is based on the spectral data. Let's break down each part step by step.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the highest point so that's the molecular weight. Then there's a peak at 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, the molecular ion is usually the highest, so 156 is the molecular weight. The 158 could be a fragment, maybe with a chlorine or something else. Wait, but 158 is two units higher than 156. Chlorine has a mass of about 35.5, so maybe it's something else. Wait, if the molecule has a Cl, would that make sense? Let me think.

Looking at the IR data: there's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's usually indicative of O-H or N-H stretching. But since the options given don't have nitrogen, it's likely O-H. Then there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is probably a carbonyl group (C=O). So the compound has a carbonyl and an O-H group. Wait, but waitâ€”carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches because they're strong acids and have hydrogen bonding. Also, the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is around 1700 cm^-1. So maybe a carboxylic acid? But wait, let me check the options.

Looking at the 1H NMR: 11.0 ppm singlet (s, 1H). That's a strong peak, probably an O-H proton from a carboxylic acid because those are usually around 10-12 ppm. The next peaks are 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Those are aromatic protons. The doublets suggest they are adjacent to each other, maybe on a benzene ring. The coupling would make sense if it's a para-substituted benzene. Let me think: if the aromatic protons are in a para position, each would be a doublet, coupling with each other. So the structure would have substituents on the benzene ring in para positions.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: That's 2-hydroxy-3-chlorobenzaldehyde. The structure would have an aldehyde group, which would have a peak around 9-10 ppm as a singlet in the NMR. But the NMR here doesn't show that. So maybe not A.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: That's a benzoic acid with Cl in the para position. The structure is Cl-C6H4-COOH. The O-H would be around 11 ppm, which matches the NMR. The aromatic protons would be ortho and meta to the substituents. Wait, let's think: in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1. If the Cl is at position 4 (para), then the aromatic protons would be in two sets: the two ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) and two meta (positions 3 and 5). But wait, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are para to each other. So the ring has Cl at position 4 and COOH at position 1. Then the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Each of the protons adjacent to the COOH would be in a certain pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the ring is 1 (COOH), 4 (Cl), and the other positions have H. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. For a para-substituted benzene (like 4-chlorobenzoic acid), the aromatic protons would have certain coupling. Let me think about the NMR. The 8.02 and 7.72 ppm could be the protons ortho and meta to the substituents. Wait, for benzoic acid, the ring protons are usually split into a triplet or doublets depending on substituents. Alternatively, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has two substituents in para positions (Cl and COOH). The two H in the ortho positions (positions 2 and 6) would be equivalent, and the two H in the meta positions (positions 3 and 5) would be equivalent. Each of these sets would couple with their adjacent protons. Let me think about the splitting. For example, the H in position 2 would be next to the H in position 3. So each would couple with each other. So this would result in a doublet of doublets? Or perhaps a doublet for each. Alternatively, maybe the splitting isn't that complex and shows as a doublet. Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets: d, 2H each. So that suggests that each set of two equivalent H are coupling with each other. So the two H in positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would each be adjacent to H in positions 3 and 5. Or wait, maybe the ring is such that each H is only adjacent to one substituent. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the substituents.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows two doublets: one at 8.02 (2H) and the other at 7.72 (2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene where each set of two protons is equivalent. So maybe the substituents are at para positions, and each group has two protons in a doublet. That could fit with 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let's think: the COOH is in position 1, Cl in position 4. Then the ring positions 2 and 6 would each have H, and positions 3 and 5 would have H. The H in 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. The H in 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. So in terms of chemical shifts, the ortho to COOH (positions 2,6) would deshield more, so higher ppm. The meta to Cl (positions 3,5) would be more shielded? Wait, substituents on a benzene ring can have varying effects. Electronegative groups like Cl are meta directors. But in this case, the COOH is a strong electron-withdrawing group. So the protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear downfield, at higher ppm. The Cl is at position 4, so the H in positions 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl, which is electron-withdrawing. So those H would also be deshielded, but perhaps less than the ortho to COOH.

So in the NMR, the more deshielded H (ortho to COOH) would be at higher ppm, maybe around 8.02. The others (meta to COOH and ortho to Cl) would be at lower ppm, like 7.72. That fits with the NMR data: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So that would support option B.

Option C, phenyl chloroformate: that's Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the structure would be Cl-CO-O-C6H5. The OCOCl group. But wait, phenyl chloroformate is an acid chloride, right? So the functional groups would be Cl and OCOCl. The IR would have a strong carbonyl, which it does (1720 cm^-1, which is a bit higher than a car
