Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is the reaction between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Part B is the reaction between 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile, with KOH and water. I need to find the major products for both and choose the correct option from the given choices.

Starting with reaction A. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is the starting material. Ethyl acrylate is another reagent, and t-BuOK is the base. Hmm, I think this is a Claisen condensation reaction. Claisen is usually between esters, but wait, the starting material is a ketone, not an ester. Oh wait, but ethyl acrylate is an ester. So maybe it's a crossed Claisen or perhaps a conjugate addition?

Wait, another possibility: when a ketone and an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester (like acrylate) react under basic conditions, it might be a conjugate addition, like the Michael addition. Or perhaps it's a Michael reaction? Or could it be a Claisen-like condensation?

Alternatively, maybe it's an aldol reaction? But the starting material is a ketone, and ethyl acrylate is an ester. Aldol typically involves enolates adding to carbonyls. Wait, but in this case, the acrylate has a conjugated double bond. Maybe the base deprotonates the acrylate to form an enolate, which then attacks the ketone?

Wait, no, the starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So structure-wise, the cyclohexanone has substituents at positions 2 (ethyl) and 6 (methyl). Let me draw that. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. So positions 2 and 6 each have a substituent: position 2 is
