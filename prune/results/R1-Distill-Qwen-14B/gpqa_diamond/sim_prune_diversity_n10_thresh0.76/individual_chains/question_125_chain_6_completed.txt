Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². Oh right, this is the Hooke's law kind of force, so it's a harmonic oscillator scenario in 3D.

The question is about finding the energy of the third excited state and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions exist for that energy. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving some energy and a number.

Wait, I remember that in three dimensions, the energy levels of a harmonic oscillator are quantized. The energy depends on the quantum numbers in each direction, but since it's isotropic and spherically symmetric, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers.

In 3D, the energy for a harmonic oscillator is given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Each direction is a 1D harmonic oscillator, so the total energy is the sum of the energies in each of the x, y, z directions. In 1D, each state is (n + 1/2) ħω, so for 3D, it's (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. But wait, sometimes the total quantum number n is used, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy becomes E = (n + 3/2) ħω. Oh, right, that's a standard formula.

So the ground state is n=0: E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = 3/2 ħω. The first excited state would be when n=1: energy is 5/2 ħω. Second excited state is n=2: 7/2 ħω. Third excited state is n=3: 9/2 ħω. So that narrows down the energy part. Looking at the options, option A and C have (9/2) ħω, so those are possible.

Now, the second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (the degeneracy) for that energy level. So for each n, the degeneracy is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2, or something like that? Wait, no, that might be for 2D. Let me think. In 3D, the degeneracy for each energy level (same n) comes from the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers (n_x, n_y, n_z). So the number of solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = n, where each n_i ≥ 0. That's a stars and bars problem. The formula is (n + 3 - 1 choose 3 - 1) ) → (n+2 choose 2). So for each n, the degeneracy is (n+2)(n+1)/2.

So if the third excited state is n=3, then the degeneracy is (3+2 choose 2) = 5C2 = 10. So the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

Let me check the options. Option A says (9/2) ħω, 10. That matches. Option C says same energy but 3, which isn't right. So the correct answer should be A.

Looking at the other options: B and D have different energy expressions, so they can't be right. B has some pi squared terms which don't fit the harmonic oscillator scenario. The correct energy is (n + 3/2) ħω, so answer A or C.

So putting it together, the energy is (9/2) ħω, and the degeneracy is 10. So the correct option is A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels of such a system are quantized and given by \( E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \), where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the total quantum number, and \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are the quantum numbers in the \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) directions, respectively.

The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), with energy \( E = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega \). The first excited state corresponds to \( n = 1 \), with energy \( E = \frac{5}{2} \hbar \omega \). The second excited state corresponds to \( n = 2 \), with energy \( E = \frac{7}{2} \hbar \omega \). The third excited state corresponds to \( n = 3 \), with energy \( E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \). Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \).

The degeneracy of an energy level in a 3D harmonic oscillator is determined by the number of ways to distribute the total quantum number \( n \) among the three directions, which is given by the combinatorial formula \( \text{Degeneracy} = \binom{n + 2}{2} \). For \( n = 3 \), the degeneracy is \( \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10 \). Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the third excited state.

Among the options provided, only option A matches both the energy \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \) and the degeneracy of 10. The other options are incorrect because they either provide the wrong energy or the wrong degeneracy.

Answer: A
