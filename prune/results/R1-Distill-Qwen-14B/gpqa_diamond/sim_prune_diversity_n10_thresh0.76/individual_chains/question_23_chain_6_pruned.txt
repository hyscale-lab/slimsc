Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a reaction between ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene and hydrogen bromide. After some time, the researcher checked using TLC and found that the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots. So, I need to figure out what products are formed and pick the correct option from A to D.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the structure of the starting material. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Breaking that down: the benzene ring has an ether group (oxy) attached. The substituent on the oxygen is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let's draw that part.

So, the butenyl group: but has four carbons. The substituent is at position 3, which is a double bond between C3 and C4, right? The structure would be: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, maybe I should number it properly. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with substituents.

Wait, wait, but it's 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let me think again. The but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that can't be right. Oh wait, but the double bond is between C3 and C4 if it's but-3-en-1-yl. Wait, but but is four carbons, so positions 1,2,3,4. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would actually be: the substituent is on the first carbon (the point of attachment to oxygen is the first carbon
