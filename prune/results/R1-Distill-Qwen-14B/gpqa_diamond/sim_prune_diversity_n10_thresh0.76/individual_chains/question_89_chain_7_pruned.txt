Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and see what's happening.

First, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I remember is around where carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb. So maybe there's an elimination reaction happening here. Since KOH is a strong base, it's likely an E2 mechanism. 

Elimination would remove two bromine atoms and form a double bond. Wait, but the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, so elimination would form an alkene. The product might be adamantylene or something similar. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bridged bicyclic compound. Heating with KOH would lead to dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond. So product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene or maybe something else? Hmm. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose HBr twice to form a diene? No, wait, elimination of two HBr molecules would form a diene. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is likely an -OH group or maybe some other deshielded protons. Wait, but with KOH, perhaps it's an epoxide? No, because epoxides typically have protons around 3-4 ppm. Wait, wait, 4.79 is maybe a carbonyl oxygen adjacent group. Oh wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, so product 1 is likely an epoxide? Or maybe a ketone?

Wait, no. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH. That's a classic case for elimination. Each Br is on adjacent carbons, so eliminating two HBr would form a double bond. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bridged bicyclic structure. So, maybe it's a transannular elimination? Oh wait, I think when you have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination of two HBr would form a bicyclic diene, which would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something like that. But that's not a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is strong for a carbonyl. So maybe the product isn't a diene but an epoxide or a ketone. But how? Because 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on adjacent bridgeheads. Maybe when KOH is added, it does a ring-opening or some other reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a solvolysis. But more likely, it's an elimination. Wait, no, if it's elimination, you get a double bond, no carbonyl. So perhaps the product isn't from elimination but something else. Wait, maybe the base is causing an oxidation? I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH might form a cyclohexene. No, wait, but the structure is more complex. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. That might be a geminal diol, but if that were the case, the IR would show an O-H stretch, but there's no mention of that. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group adjacent to two equivalent protons. Wait, if the product is a ketone, that would make sense. So maybe the KOH is causing some kind of oxidation, but I thought KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's an epoxide. Epoxides can form from dihalides via a SN2 mechanism, but with KOH, which is a strong base, it's more likely E2. So perhaps the product is an epoxide. The NMR at 4.79 would be the two protons on the oxygen. But wait, epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm, but maybe in a strained ring like adamantane, they could be upfield or downfield. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. If product 1 is a ketone, then the carbonyl is at 1720 cm⁻¹. But where would the protons be?

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a diketone. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would need to lose two HBr and form two ketones. But that seems unlikely because eliminating two HBr from vicinal dihalides usually forms alkenes.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of product 1's structure based on the NMR. The NMR shows 2H at 4.79, 10H in a multiplet around 2.2-2.41, and 2H at 1.94.

Wait, 4.79 ppm for 2H. Maybe it's an ethylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an epoxide. But if it's an epoxide, the two protons are usually a triplet or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol, but again, that would have an O-H stretch in IR, which isn't mentioned.

Wait, another thought: the IR peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl, so it must be a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. How does that happen? Maybe the starting material undergoes a oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol. Wait, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester, but that doesn't fit with KOH.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the next steps. After product 1 is formed, it's heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)3) is often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is a ketone, then maybe it's undergoing some kind of acylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. Hmm. Wait, maybe product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, like a norbornene derivative. Then, when heated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it's undergoing some ring-opening or further reaction. But I'm not exactly sure.

Moving on, product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, which is a work-up step in ozonolysis. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyls where the double bonds were in product 2.

The question is about the NMR coupling of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, excluding exchangeable protons.

So, I think the key is to figure out the structure of product 3 and then determine the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.

Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ → likely a carbonyl; NMR suggests something with 2H at 4.79, maybe adjacent to O or C=O).

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is a ket
