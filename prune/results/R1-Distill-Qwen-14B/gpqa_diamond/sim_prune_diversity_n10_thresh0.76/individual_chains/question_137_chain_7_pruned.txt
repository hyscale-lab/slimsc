Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I need to find out how many revolutions a proton makes. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons are types of particle accelerators. But wait, what exactly is a synchrocyclotron? I think it's a cyclotron that uses a varying magnetic field to keep the particles in sync with the accelerating electric field. Oh right, because as the particles gain energy, their mass increases, so the magnetic field has to change to keep them moving in a circle.

The problem states that a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, so the voltage is varying with time. The general idea is that the electric field accelerates the proton each time it's moving through a particular region, right? And each acceleration happens as the proton passes through the gap between the dees (the D-shaped electrodes in a cyclotron) during each half-cycle of the voltage.

But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the accelerating voltage isn't fixed because the magnetic field is changing. The frequency ν(α) depends on the radius α, which in turn depends on the particle's momentum. So ν(α) = (qB(α))/(2πm), where q is the charge, m is the mass, and B(α) is the magnetic field at radius α.

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relation here. Let me think. The key thing might be to relate the kinetic energy gained by the proton to the number of times it's accelerated. Each time it goes around, it gets a little kick of energy from the electric field. So the total number of revolutions N would be the number of times it's accelerated until it reaches T1.

Wait, but the voltage is U(t), and the energy gained each time depends on the voltage. Oh, but wait, the change in kinetic energy each time is equal to the work done by the electric field, which is the voltage multiplied by the charge
