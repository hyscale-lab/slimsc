Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and sequenced the target gene in mutants. The changes are in the first exon. The question is which mutation would eliminate the compound.

Hmm, so the idea is that the gene product (probably a protein) is causing the anti-nutritional effect. If we mutate the gene, perhaps we can disrupt its function, thus stopping the compound's synthesis.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change in the first exon. I should compare the wild type and each mutant to see what kind of changes occurred.

The intact gene sequence starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. So the first part is the beginning of the coding sequence.

Let me look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild type: The wild type starts with ATGTTTCTC, while mutant 1 has ATGTTCTAC. So the sixth and seventh bases change. Wild is TTC, mutant is TCT. Wait, let's see:
Wild: position 6-8: T T C
Mutant1: position 6-8: C T A. Wait, maybe I should count the letters.

Wait, the wild type is: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
So first part: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT... So let me compare:

Wild: positions 1-20: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT...
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

So the difference is at positions 4-6. Wild is TTT, mutant is TCT. Wait, wait, looking again.

Wait, the wild is 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA... So positions 4-6 would be TTT (positions 4: T, 5: T, 6: C? Wait, maybe I'm getting the position wrong. Let me count each nucleotide.

Let's break down the first part:

Wild: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So each set is a triplet. So the first codon is ATG (start), then TTT (Phe), then CTC (Leu), etc.

Mutant1: 5’-ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

Wait, no. Let me look at the mutants again.

Wait, the given sequences are a bit confusing. Let me write each of them as lines:

Intact:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant1:
ATG TT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, no. Looking at the sequences:

Mutant 1's sequence starts as:
ATG T T C T A C G... Wait, the way it's written is a continuous string, so perhaps it's easier to look for the differences.

Wait, the wild type starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Looking for differences:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG
