Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Their masses are 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I'll tackle the relative speed part. Wait, wait. When dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally because of the effects of special relativity. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²), but wait, which way? Let me get that right. So if astronaut A is moving at u and astronaut B at v, from A's frame, what is B's speed?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The formula for the relative velocity v_rel is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, I'm a bit confused about the directions here. Wait, both are moving in the same direction, right? So astronaut 1 has mass 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 has mass 3m moving at 0.5c. So from astronaut 1's perspective, astronaut 2 is moving at what speed?

Wait, I think the formula is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c²), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that in relativity, velocity doesn't just add like that. So maybe to find the relative speed of astronaut 2 from astronaut 1's frame, it's (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, let's compute the numerator and denominator. The numerator is (0.5c - 0.6c) = (-0.1c). The denominator is 1 - (0.5 * 0.6) c² / c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, but the question is about the speed, so the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed should be around 0.14c.

Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel = 0.14c. So that's a clue. So the relative speed is either C or D.

Next, the total energy of the system. Oh, right, in special relativity, the total energy of an object is given by gamma * m c squared, where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So each astronaut's energy is their rest energy multiplied by their gamma factor.

Wait, but wait. The problem says 'the total energy of the system.' So I need to calculate the total energy of both astronauts combined.

So astronaut 1 has mass 2m and speed 0.6c. His gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2). 0.6 squared is 0.36, so 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is 2m * 1.25c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2 has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660, so gamma is approximately 1.1547. So his energy is 3m * 1.1547 c² ≈ 3 * 1.1547 = ~3.464 m c².

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 3 * 1.1547 is 3.4641 m c².

So adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and D says 5 mc². So the energy must be around 5.96 mc².

So putting it together, the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². Which matches option C.

Wait, but wait another thing! Is the total energy additive in their rest frames? Or should we consider the conservation of energy in another way? Oh wait, no, because each astronaut's energy is calculated in their own rest frame? No, wait, no, their energies are measured in the same frame, I think. Wait, the problem is talking about the total energy of the system. So perhaps we should compute each energy in the same frame, perhaps the rest frame of the combined system? Or maybe the energies are each in their own frame, but wait, that would complicate things. No, probably the question is considering each astronaut's energy in the same frame, like the lab frame. Or maybe in their own rest frames, but I'm not sure. Wait, but the problem states that the astronauts are moving at those speeds. So the total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies in that frame.

Wait, but if they're moving in the same direction, perhaps the frame in which I'm calculating their velocities and energies is the same. So the sum of their energies as measured in, say, the lab frame would be 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². So that would align with option C, which has E=5.96 mc².

So the correct option should be C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, astronaut 1 (mass \(2m\)) moves at \(u = 0.6c\), and astronaut 2 (mass \(3m\)) moves at \(v = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the speed is the magnitude:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 1:
Mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 2:
Mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.4641mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 \approx 5.9641mc^2
\]

### Final Answer:
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
