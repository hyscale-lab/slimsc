Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Let me think about what that does.

Wait, Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene catalyst, right? It's used in olefin metathesis, which is a reaction where the positions of substituents on a double bond are exchanged. So, in this case, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. I should probably draw the structure to visualize it better.

3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pent-1-ene has five carbons, with the double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the pent chain is five carbons, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Wait, no, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would be a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait, that can't be right because that would make it pent-1-ene with a methyl on C3, which is correct.

Wait, but the starting material is racemic, so it's a racemic mixture. That means the molecule has a chiral center, and the mixture contains both enantiomers in equal amounts. So, where is the chiral center here?

Looking at the structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, C2 is attached to CH2CH3 (from the pent chain), and C3 has a methyl group. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me number it again. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH
