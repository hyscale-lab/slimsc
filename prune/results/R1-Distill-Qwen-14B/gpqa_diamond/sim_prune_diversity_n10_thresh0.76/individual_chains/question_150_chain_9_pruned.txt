Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and the compound undergoes a series of reactions. I need to determine the final product from the given options.

First, let me write down the NMR data to understand the structure better.

The 1H-NMR shows:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, I remember that protons on carbonyl groups, like aldehydes, typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So the triplet at 9.72 is likely an aldehyde proton. Wait, but a triplet? Aldehyde protons are usually singlets because they don't have adjacent hydrogens. Unless there's something else going on. Oh wait, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Could it be an enal, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde? The coupling in a triplet might come from two neighboring protons. Oh, right, in an enal, the aldehyde proton is adjacent to a double bond, so it might couple with two protons on the adjacent carbon. So that would make it a triplet.

Then, looking at the aromatic region. The doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 ppm each have 2H. That suggests two sets of aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. The 6.98 is more deshielded, so maybe an electron-withdrawing group is present, while 6.51 is less deshielded, perhaps with an electron-donating group. Alternatively, maybe these are two different para-substituted benzene rings.

The broad singlet at 6.27 ppm for 2H could be some aromatic protons that are deshielded but not in a typical para-substituted pattern. Alternatively, maybe they're part of a conjugated system, like in a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring. Wait, but 2H as a broad singlet... Hmm. Or perhaps they're protons on a diene or a conjugated enal system.

The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H suggests a CH2 group attached to something that splits the signal into a doublet. Maybe an oxygen nearby, like an ether or an ester. Wait, but in this molecule, the formula includes an O (from NO), so maybe it's an ether or an alcohol.

Putting this together, I'm thinking of a structure that has an aldehyde group (from the 9.72 ppm triplet), two para-substituted benzene rings (from the two doublets in the aromatic region), and a CH2 group attached to something else (maybe an oxygen). Let me sketch a possible structure.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So it's (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (9)/2 = 4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So:

Degree of Unsaturation = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be, say, two benzene rings (each contributing 3, but if they're
