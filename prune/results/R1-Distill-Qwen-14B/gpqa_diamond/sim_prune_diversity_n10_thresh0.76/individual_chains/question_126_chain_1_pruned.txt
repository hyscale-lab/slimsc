Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Then, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and chiral. The task is to determine how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

First, I'll break down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is lithium aluminum hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone. Let me draw its structure. Hexan-3-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3? Wait, wait. Wait, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CH2, but the structure would be: 

Maybe it's better to number the carbons. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Let me get that right.

Wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan has six carbons. So hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Let me think: Position 3 is the carbonyl.

So the structure would be CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, that can't be right. Let me count the carbons:

Hexan means six carbons. The carbonyl is at position 3.

So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that would be seven carbons. Oh, wait, perhaps not. Let me write it properly.

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C=O
