Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what it's asking. Okay, so the question is about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. The problem says to ignore their spin angular momentum, which probably means we're only considering the orbital part here.

The state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has an l of 1, meaning they're in p orbitals. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1. 

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z for each electron. We need to find the joint probability that both L₁z and L₂z have eigenvalues of -ħ. 

Wait, wait. Let me think. For a single electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 1, so the possible m values (the z-component) are -1, 0, +1. So each Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ. 

But in the problem, we're told that the total state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1. That means when we add the individual angular momenta, the total l is 2 and m is -1.

Wait, but how does this state relate to the individual electrons' states? I'm a bit fuzzy on coupled angular momentum states. Let me recall. When you have two particles, each with angular momentum l₁ and l₂, the total angular momentum L is l₁ + l₂ in some way. The state is a combination of all possible ways to get l=2 from l₁=1 and l₂=1. 

So for two particles, each with l=1, the possible total l values are 2, 1, 0. Because when adding angular momenta, the possible total l is |l₁ - l₂| to l₁ + l₂ in integer steps. So 1+1=2, 1-1=0; so l can be 2,1,0.

In our case, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. So it's the state where the total l is 2 and m is -1. But how does this relate to the individual m₁ and m₂ values?

The total angular momentum state can be expressed as a combination of states with definite m₁ and m₂. Because the total m is m₁ + m₂. So in the state |1,1,2,-1>, the m is -1. So m₁ + m₂ must equal -1.

But we're trying to find the probability that both m₁ and m₂ are -1. Because L₁z and L₂z each have eigenvalues related to m₁ and m₂. Since Lz |m> = mħ |m>, so if m₁=-1, then L₁z eigenvalue is -ħ. Similarly for m₂=-1.

So, in this state, what is the probability that m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1?

But wait, let's
