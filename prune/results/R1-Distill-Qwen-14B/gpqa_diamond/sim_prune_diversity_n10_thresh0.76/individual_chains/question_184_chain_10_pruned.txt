Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, A to D, each with a different sequence of reactions. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I should probably sketch the target molecule. So it's benzene with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 is a tert-butyl group, and position 3 is a nitro group (NO2). Wait, but waitâ€”how are the positions arranged? Let me think: numbering the benzene ring, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, and 3 is nitro. Alternatively, maybe the numbering is different because sometimes substituents are numbered based on their priority. Oh wait, substituent priority goes: nitro (highest), then tert-butyl, then ethoxy. But wait, the substituents are in specific positions regardless of priority; the numbering is based on the substituents' order. Hmm, maybe I should focus more on the synthesis steps rather than the numbering.

So, the target molecule has three substituents on benzene: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. The question is about the order of reactions to get these substituents in the correct positions.

In electrophilic substitution reactions, each substituent directs the incoming electrophile. Depending on the substituents, the next substitution will occur in a specific position.

Let me list the substituents and their directing effects:

- Ethoxy (OEt): This is an activating group (since it's an ether) and is an ortho/para director.
- tert-Butyl: This is a bulky, activating group (alkyl) which is a strong activating (since it's electron-donating) and an ortho/para director.
- Nitro (NO2): This is a deactivating, meta-directing group.

So, when adding substituents, the order in which they're added will affect where the next substituent goes.

The target has three substituents, so we need three substitution reactions. But wait, sometimes the order might involve more steps, like nitration, sulfonation, etc., which might be part of the synthesis.

Wait, the target has 1-ethoxy, 2-t-Bu, and 3-nitro. So looking at the benzene ring, ethoxy is at 1, nitro at 3, and t-Bu at 2. That suggests that when adding the substituents, maybe each step directs the next.

But wait, let's think about the directing effects in the order of addition.

Let me plan the steps:

1. Start with benzene.

2. Add the first substituent. Let's say we add the tert-butyl group first. But wait, why? Because tert-butyl is a strong activating group. Or maybe we should add the nitro group first as a meta director. Hmm, but nitro is deactivating, so once it's on, the next substitution would be harder.

Alternatively, perhaps we should add the ethoxy group first because it's an activating group, making the ring more reactive, which would be easier in the next steps.

Wait, but wait: the order of adding substituents is going to determine where the next substituent goes.

Let me think about whether each substituent will be added via nitration, alkylation (like Friedel-Crafts), or sulfonation.

So, Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically adds an alkyl group (like tert-butyl), but it's tricky because benzene with a strong activating group can undergo multiple substitutions. But you have to control the order.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added last, as it's deactivating, making further substitution harder.

Wait, but let's plan out the possible steps.

The target molecule has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me imagine the benzene ring with substituents placed in adjacent positions.

Wait, let's consider the substituent positions:

If the ethoxy is at position 1, the nitro at 3, and t-Bu at 2. So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, and 2 and 3 are adjacent, forming a sort of 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Wait, but benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent to each other. So substituents are at 1, 2, and 3.

The order of adding substituents is crucial because each
