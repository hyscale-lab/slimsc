Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem talks about two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, and the periods between primary eclipses are 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. So, period is the time it takes for them to orbit each other. I remember that binary stars orbit their common center of mass, and the period is the time they take to complete an orbit.

Then, there's some data about radial velocity (RV) variations. In system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm, okay. I think radial velocity variations in binary stars are used to determine the masses. Because as the stars orbit each other, their velocities change due to the gravitational pull of the other star. The more massive a star is, the less it moves, because it's closer to the center of mass.

Wait, right! In a binary system, the more massive star will have a smaller orbit (less velocity), and the less massive star will have a larger orbit (higher velocity). So the RV amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses of the stars. Because velocity is inversely proportional to mass when they're orbiting a common center of mass.

So for system_1, the stars have velocities of 10 and 5 km/s. Let me think: since their velocities are in a ratio of 2:1, their masses should be in the inverse ratio, 1:2. So the more massive star would have a mass twice that of the other. So in system_1, the two masses would be M1 and M2, where M2 is twice M1. Wait no, wait. Because the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So if star A has velocity v, and star B has velocity 2v, then star A is more massive. Because M proportional to (v * something). Let me get this right.

The center of mass condition is M1 * v1 = M2 * v2, because their momentum vectors are equal and opposite. So M1/M2 = v2/v1. So in system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So their masses would be in the ratio of 5:10, which is 1:2. Wait, no: velocity is inversely proportional to mass. So if M1 is more massive, its velocity would be smaller. So in system_1, star A has velocity 10, star B has 5. So M1/M2 = v2/v1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half of M2. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, I think I
