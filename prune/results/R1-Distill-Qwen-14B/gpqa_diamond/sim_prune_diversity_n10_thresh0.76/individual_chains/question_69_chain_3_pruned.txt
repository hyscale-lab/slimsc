Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime is τ₀ = 8×10^-16 seconds. They're asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are given in meters, so I'm guessing this is about the distance the particles travel before decaying, which relates to the resolution of the detector.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, the lifetime of a particle as observed in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime because of time dilation. The formula for that is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Right, γ depends on the velocity of the particle relative to the speed of light.

So I need to find γ first. But to calculate γ, I probably need the velocity of the particle X⁰. Alternatively, I can find the velocity using the energy and mass. Oh, because energy E is related to mass and momentum, so E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Wait, but since the particle is moving, we can find its momentum and then its velocity.

Let me jot down the given data:

Energy (E) = 27 GeV
Mass (m) = 3.41 GeV
Proper lifetime (τ₀) = 8e-16 s

I think I should calculate the velocity of the particle X⁰. Because if I can find v, then I can find γ, which will give me the dilated lifetime. Then I can find the average distance the particle travels before decaying, which is the mean path length. The resolution of the detector needs to be such that it can detect at least 30% of these decays, so I guess 30% of the particles must be within the resolution length.

Wait, but what exactly is the 'minimum resolution'? I think it's the minimum distance the detector can resolve so that a certain percentage of the decays are within that distance. So if the mean path length is L, then the 30% would correspond to some fraction, maybe the mean or perhaps something else. Hmm, maybe it's about the decay length and the detector's ability to detect the decay within a certain distance. So the minimum resolution would be the distance up to which the detector can still see the decay, and we need at least 30% of the particles to decay within that distance.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the detection efficiency. The detector can only see the decay if the particles decay within a certain length. So to capture at least 30% of the decays, the resolution (the smallest detectable distance) should be such that 30% of the decay lengths are within it.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the mean decay length and then find a distance that corresponds to 30% of the particles decaying beyond that? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the decay probability. The probability that a particle decays before traveling a certain distance is 1 - e^(-t/τ), where t is the time it takes to travel that distance. But for that, I need to find the time.

Wait, but the decay length L is given by L = v * τ. Because τ is the dilated lifetime, so the average path length before decay is v * τ.

So first, I need to find v and γ.

Calculating the velocity:

E (energy) is given as 27 GeV. So E = gamma * m c². Wait, the energy is the total energy, so E = γ m c², right? And the rest mass energy is m c² = 3.41 GeV.

So γ = E / (m c²) ) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.915. Approximately 7.915.

Then, the relation between γ and velocity: γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So let's compute v. Let me rearrange:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) → sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/γ → 1 - (v²/c²) = 1/γ² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/γ².

So v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).

Plugging in γ ≈7.915, 1/γ² ≈ 1/(62.64) ≈ 0.016.

So 1 - 0.016 = 0.984. So sqrt(0.984) is about 0.992. So v ≈ c * 0.992. Approximately 0.992c.

Hmm, that's a high velocity. So v ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute γ more precisely. 27 / 3.41 is exactly 27 ÷ 3.41.

Let me calculate that: 3.41 × 7 = 23.87, 27 – 23.87 = 3.13. So 3.13 /3.41 ≈ 0.917. So 7.917 approximately.

So γ ≈7.917. So γ² is approx 62.68.

So 1/γ² ≈ 1/62.68 ≈ 0.01595.

So 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405. The square root of 0.98405 is approximately 0.992, yes. Because 0.992 squared is 0.984064, which is very close. So v ≈ 0.992c.

So v ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Now, the dilated lifetime τ is γ τ₀.

τ = gamma * tau_0 = 7.917 * 8e-16 s.

Let me compute that: 7.917 *8 = 63.336, so 63.336e-16 s = 6.3336e-15 s.

Wait, no, 7.917 *8e-16 is 63.336e-16 s = 6.3336e-15 s.

Wait, actually, 8e-16 *7.917 = 63.336e-16 s. Which is 6.3336e-15 s. Hmm, okay.

So the mean path length L is v * τ.

So L
