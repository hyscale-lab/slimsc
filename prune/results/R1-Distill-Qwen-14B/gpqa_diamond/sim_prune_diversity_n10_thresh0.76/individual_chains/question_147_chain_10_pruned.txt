Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about protons and antiprotons annihilating into two particles each of charge + and -, so 2A+ and 2A-. Wait, no, wait, the reaction is p + bar p → 2A+ + 2A−. So that's four particles in total, two positive and two negative.

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh wait, no, it says 'the antiproton is slowly moving'. So the proton is presumably at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly? Or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton's speed is low. Hmm, not entirely sure, but maybe it's implying that the kinetic energy is small compared to the rest mass energies.

The mass of A is given as 300 MeV/c². Wait, no, m_A c² is 300 MeV. Because the units are in MeV, which is an energy unit. So, m_A c² = 300 MeV. So the rest mass of each particle A is 300 MeV divided by c², but since in these equations c is often set to 1 in units, maybe I don't need to worry about it here.

The question is to find the velocity of particle A. So the product particles are each moving at velocity v, I guess. But wait, how are the particles moving? Are they all moving in the same direction, or maybe in opposite directions? Hmm, perhaps in a symmetric way, but I'm not sure. Oh, maybe the process is symmetric, so the two A+ and two A- are moving in pairs.

But wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. So the proton is a matter particle and the antiproton is antimatter. When they annihilate, they produce other particles. But in this case, the products are two A+ and two A−. So each A+ has charge +1, and each A− has charge -1. So maybe these are pions or something else, but the specifics probably don't matter.

The key here is to apply conservation of energy and momentum. Since the initial particles are a proton and antiproton, but perhaps one is at rest and the other is moving slowly. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some small velocity. Or perhaps the proton is moving, but the antiproton is slow. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let's read it again: "antiproton is slowly moving and m_A c² = 300 MeV." Hmm. So the antiproton's speed is low, so its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So we can perhaps approximate its energy as just its rest energy plus a small kinetic term.

But wait, in reality, the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So if the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is much less than 938 MeV, so maybe it's non-relativistic. So perhaps in the initial frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some slow
