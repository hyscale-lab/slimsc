Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I remember that uncertainty principles can be tricky. But let me take it step by step.

The question is about estimating the minimum uncertainty in the energy of an electron. The given information is that the electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed v of 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nanometers. The options are all different orders of magnitude in joules, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that this relates to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. Specifically, the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) should be on the order of Planck's constant divided by 4π. So the equation is Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, but the question is about energy uncertainty. Oh right! Because the electron has kinetic energy, and the uncertainty in momentum relates to the uncertainty in kinetic energy. So the process would be to find the uncertainty in momentum first using the uncertainty principle, then convert that into an uncertainty in energy.

Let me jot down the formula. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for momentum and position is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So Δp is approximately ħ/(2Δx). Once I have Δp, I can find the uncertainty in energy, which is ΔE. But wait, how is Δp related to ΔE?

I recall that the kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So the uncertainty in energy ΔE would come from the uncertainty in p, which is Δp. Let me think about how to relate these.

Perhaps I can take the derivative of E with respect to p and use that to find the uncertainty. So E = p²/(2m), so dE/dp = p/m. Therefore, ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, I think that's an approximation based on the idea that if p is much larger than Δp, then the change in E can be approximated by the derivative. Alternatively, maybe I can use the same uncertainty principle approach but
