Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

So, there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The question is about photometric observations showing brightness variations because the star is rotating, which makes the spots come into and out of view. The scenario resembles an exoplanet transiting the star. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness change as the spotted star. The options are given.

Hmm, I think I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. Like, (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is the area of the planet over the area of the star.

But wait, this is about spots instead of a planet. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears a bit dimmer than normal. The variation in brightness would be due to the spots rotating into and out of view. So, the key here is to compute the effective change in brightness caused by the spots, and then find an exoplanet's radius that would cause the same change.

Let me think step by step.

First, the star's radius is R_star = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, the filling factor is 20%, but since only one hemisphere is spotty, the total area covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere. Wait, no, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface that's covered. Oh, wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots. Wait, no, the problem says 'one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%'. So the filling factor is 20% on that hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere).

Wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR^2. The hemisphere is 2πR². So the spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Each spot is cooler by 1000 K. The star's Teff is 6000 K, so the spots are at 5000 K.

The brightness variation comes from the spots being cooler. So when the star rotates, parts of the spotted hemisphere come into view. The total brightness is the sum of the unspotted regions and the spotted regions.

Wait, but when we look at the star's light, the flux we receive depends on the temperature of each region. The total flux is the sum over all surface elements of their fluxes. The flux from a blackbody is proportional to T^4 per unit area.

So normally, without spots, the star's flux is F0 = σTeff^4 * (4πR^2) / (4πR^2) )? Wait, no, the flux is per unit area. Wait, the star's total luminosity is 4πR²σTeff^4. The flux at Earth (assuming we're at a distance D) would be L/(4πD²) = σTeff^4 (R^2/D^2).

But for the brightness variation when spots are present, the total flux would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spotty areas.

So let's model the average flux when a certain portion of the spotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots are moving into and out of view. The maximum effect would be when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible. Then, the flux would be lower because the spots are cooler.

Wait, but the brightness variation is periodic, like a transit. So the maximum dip would occur when the maximum amount of spotted area is blocking the light. Wait, no, because the spots are on the star's surface, not an object blocking the light. So the dip in brightness is due to the spots being cooler, not blocking any part of the star's disk.

Wait, that's a key point. When a planet transits, it blocks part of the star's light. But when spots are present, it's more about the variation in the star's emission due to the spots being cooler. So when a spot is on the near side, the star's overall brightness is slightly less than when it's not.

But wait, the problem says that the observed variation can resemble an exoplanet. So we're to find the planet's radius that would cause the same amplitude in brightness variation as the spotted star.

Wait, so I need to find the 'signal' from the spots and equate it to the transit signal from a planet.

So first, compute the fractional change in brightness (ΔF/F0) caused by the spots. Then, set that equal to the fractional change from a planet transit, and solve for R_planet.

So, let's think about the star without spots. Its total flux is F0 = σTeff^4 * 4πR² / (4πD²) )? Wait, I think I'm complicating things. Since we're dealing with relative changes, maybe I can ignore the distance and focus on the relative luminosity.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = σTeff^4 * (4πR²) / (4πR²) )? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, the star emits a total luminosity L = 4πR²σTeff^4. The flux at a distance D is F = L/(4πD²) = (R²σTeff^4)/D².

But when spots are present, the total flux is L' = L_unspotted + L_spots.

L_unspotted is the flux from the part of the star without spots. The spotted area is 0.2 * (hemisphere's area). Wait, the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So the area with spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR².

So the area without spots in the hemisphere is 0.6πR², and the area of the other hemisphere is 2πR². So the total unspotted area is (2πR² + 0.6πR²) = 2.6πR².

Wait, no. Wait, the star has a total surface area of 4πR². One hemisphere (2πR²) is covered with spots at 20% filling factor. So the area of spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the unspotted area is 4πR² - 0.4πR² = 3.6πR².

When the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum change happens when the entire spotted area is visible. Wait, no. The hemisphere can be either facing us or not. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible, and when it's the other hemisphere, they're not.

Wait, but the flux depends on the temperature of each area. So the average flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us would be:

F_spotted = (unspotted area * Teff^4 + spotted area * Tspots^4) / total area * F0.

Wait, let me model this more carefully.

Each square meter of the star emits flux σT^4.

So the total flux without any spots is F0 = 4πR² * σTeff^4 / (4πD²) ) = (R² σ Teff^4) / D².

With spots, the flux would vary depending on which part is visible.

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view. So the total flux is the sum of the unspotted area (which is 2πR², since the other hemisphere is unspotted) and the spotted area (which is 0.4πR², but at a lower temperature).

Wait, wait. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_spotted = [ (2πR²) * Teff^4 + (0.4πR²) * Tspots^4 ] * σ / (4πD²)

Because the total area visible is 2πR² (the hemisphere) but part of it is cooler.

Wait, no, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire hemisphere is visible. So the area contributing is 2πR², but 20% of it (0.4πR²) is at Tspots, and the rest (1.6πR²) is at Teff.

So the flux in that case is:

F_spotted = [ (1.6πR²) * Teff^4 + (0.4πR²) * (Teff - 1000)^4 ] * σ / (4πD²).

Wait, but wait, Teff = 6000 K, so Tspots = 5000 K.

So:

F_spotted = [ (1.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 * 5000^4 ) * πR² σ ] / (4πD² )

Simplify denominator: 4πD². So π from numerator cancels with 4π in denominator, so 4D².

Wait, actually, let's compute F_spotted relative to F0.

F0 = (4πR² σ Teff^4) / (4πD²) ) = (R² σ Teff^4) / D².

But F_spotted would be:

F_spotted = [ (1.6 * Teff^4 + 0.4 * Tspots^4 ) * (π R²) σ ] / (4π D² )

The π in numerator and denominator cancels, so:

F_spotted = [ (1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 Tspots^4 ) * R² σ ] / (4 D² )

Which is [ (1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (Teff - 1000)^4 ) / 4 ] * (σ R² / D² )

But F0 is (Teff^4) * (σ R² / D² )

So F_spotted / F0 = [1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (Teff - 1000)^4 ] / (4 Teff^4 )

Simplify:

[1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (Teff - 1000)^4 ] / (4 Teff^4 )

Let me compute this.

Compute each term:

Teff =6000 K.

Tspots =5000 K.

Compute Teff^4: 6000^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio.

Compute (Teff - 1000) =5000.

So (Teff - 1000)/Teff =5/6.

So (Teff-1000)^4 = (5/6)^4 Teff^4.

So 5/6 is about 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.482.

So (5000/6000)^4 ≈ 0.482.

So, the numerator becomes 1.6 * 1 + 0.4 * 0.482 = 1.6 + 0.1928= 1.7928.

Divide by 4: 1.7928 /4 = 0.4482.

So F_spotted = 0.4482 * F0.

Wait, wait, that can’t be right. Because F_spotted would be less than F0, but 0.4482 is more than half. That would mean a big dip. Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, F_spotted is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, but the other hemisphere's flux is not considered. When the star is not rotating, the entire star's flux is F0, which is Teff^4.

But when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, perhaps the flux is the average of the two hemispheres? Wait, no, because if the star is rotating and we're looking at one hemisphere, the other is on the far side and doesn't contribute. So the flux is from the hemisphere facing us.

Wait, but in reality, the star's brightness is integrated over all its surface, but when a hemisphere is facing us, the flux comes from that hemisphere. So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is from that hemisphere's surface. So the area is 2πR², but part is cooler.

So to compute F_spotted, it's (unspotted part of hemisphere + spotted part) times their respective fluxes.

So F_spotted = [ (unspotted area) * Teff^4 + (spotted area) * Tspots^4 ] * σ / (4πD² )

But wait, the unspotted area in the hemisphere is 2πR² * (1 - 0.2) = 1.6π R².

No, wait, filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of spots in the hemisphere is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So unspotted area is 1.6πR².

So F = [ (1.6πR²) * Teff^4 + (0.4πR²) * Tspots^4 ] * σ / (4πD² )

The π terms cancel out, so:

F = [ (1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 Tspots^4 ) * R² σ ] / (4 D² )

But F0 is the flux when the star is unspotted and viewed from any hemisphere: F0 = (4πR² σ Teff^4 ) / (4πD² ) = (R² σ Teff^4 ) / (D² ).

So F_spotted = [1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 Tspots^4 ] / (4 Teff^4 ) * F0

Because F0 has (R² σ Teff^4 ) / D², and F_spotted is [ ... ] * (R² σ ) / D².

So the ratio is [1.6 + 0.4*(Tspots^4 / Teff^4)] / 4.

We can compute Tspots^4 / Teff^4 = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482.

So the numerator inside the bracket: 1.6 + 0.4 * 0.482 = 1.6 + 0.1928 = 1.7928.

Divide by 4: 1.7928 /4 ≈ 0.4482.

So F_spotted ≈ 0.4482 F0.

Wait, that's a 55% dip in brightness? Because F_spotted is 0.4482 F0, so the brightness is down by 55%? That seems huge. But when a planet transits, the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2. So if a planet causes a dip of, say, 1%, its radius would be about 0.1 R_star, since (0.1)^2 = 0.01, which is 1% dip.

Wait, but wait. The maximum dip in brightness when the entire spotted area is visible is this 55% dip? That can't be right. Because the star's total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is lower than when the other hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the other hemisphere is unspotted. When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux would be higher than F0? No, F0 is the average.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Because when the star is viewed from the side where the unspotted hemisphere is, the flux would be higher, but that's not the case. Because the star is a sphere, and the flux we receive depends on which part is visible.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The star has two hemispheres: one with spots (20% filling factor) and one without. So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is F_spotted = [1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (Teff-1000)^4 ] * σ R²/(4 D² ), which is 0.4482 F0.

When the other hemisphere is facing us, which is completely unspotted, the flux is F_unspotted = [2 Teff^4 ] * σ R²/(4 D² ) = (2/4) Teff^4 * (σ R²/D² ) = 0.5 Teff^4 * (σ R²/D² ) = 0.5 F0.

Wait, that would mean when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is 0.5 F0. But that can't be right, because F0 is the total flux when the star is at effective temperature, which is the average.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because the star's total flux is the sum of all the surface areas. So when you look at a hemisphere, the flux would be the average of the entire star's flux.

Wait, no. Because the star is a sphere, the flux from any hemisphere is half the total flux. Because the entire star emits L = 4πR²σTeff^4; each hemisphere emits L/2. But when part of the hemisphere is cooler, the flux is less than L/2.

So, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is [ (1.6 π R² Teff^4) + (0.4 π R² Tspots^4) ] * σ / (4π D² )

Wait, let me compute that again.

The numerator would be 1.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² Tspots^4.

Multiply by σ: (1.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² Tspots^4 ) σ.

Denominator: 4 π D².

So F = [ (1.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² Tspots^4 ) σ ] / (4 π D² )

Simplify: π cancels, R² σ / (4 D² ) is (R² σ)/(4 D²) ), same as R²/(4 D²) ) * σ.

So F = [1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 Tspots^4 ] * (R² σ) / (4 D² )

Then, F0 is when the entire star is at Teff: F0 = (4 π R² σ Teff^4 ) / (4 π D² ) ) = (R² σ Teff^4 ) / (D² )

So the ratio F / F0 is [1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 Tspots^4 ] / (4 Teff^4 )

Which is [1.6 + 0.4 (Tspots^4 / Teff^4 ) ] / 4.

Compute Tspots^4 / Teff^4 = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482.

So numerator: 1.6 + 0.4 * 0.482 = 1.6 + 0.1928 = 1.7928.

Divide by 4: 1.7928 /4 = 0.4482.

So F_spotted = 0.4482 F0.

Wait, that's when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. But when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_unspotted = (2 π R² Teff^4 ) * σ / (4 π D² )

Which is (2 Teff^4 ) * (R² σ )/(4 D² ) = (Teff^4 R² σ )/(2 D² )

So F_unspotted = (Teff^4 R² σ )/(2 D² ) = (F0) * (Teff^4 )/( R² σ Teff^4 ) * (R² σ )/(2 D² ) ) Wait, perhaps better to compute F_unspotted in terms of F0.

Wait, F_unspotted = (2 π R² Teff^4 * σ) / (4 π D² )= (2 R² Teff^4 σ) / (4 D² ) = (R² Teff^4 σ )/(2 D² ) = (F0) * ( R² Teff^4 σ )/( D² ) * 1/2 * (R² Teff^4 σ )/ R² Teff^4 σ ) ) Wait, perhaps it's better to see that F_unspotted = (2 π R² )/(4 π R² ) ) * F0 * 2? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, F0 is the total flux when the entire star is at Teff. When we look at a hemisphere, the flux is (2 π R² / 4 π R² ) ) * F0 * 2? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps F_unspotted is [2 π R² Teff^4 * σ ] / (4 π D² ) = [ Teff^4 R² σ ]/(2 D² ) = (F0) * (2 π R² )/(4 π R² ) ) * 2? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, F0 = (4 π R² σ Teff^4 )/(4 π D² ) ) = (R² σ Teff^4 )/( D² )

So F_unspotted = [2 π R² Teff^4 σ ] / (4 π D² ) ) = [ (2 π R² Teff^4 ) / (4 π D² ) ) ] σ = [ (R² Teff^4 )/(2 D² ) ) ] σ.

Which is [ (R² σ Teff^4 )/( D² ) ) ] * (1/2 )

So F_unspotted = F0 * 0.5.

So when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is 0.5 F0.

Wait, but that's not possible. Because when the entire star is viewed, the flux is F0, but when looking at a hemisphere, the flux should be half of F0, because you're seeing half the area. But that can't be right because the star's flux isn't uniform.

Wait, no, the star's total flux is F0, which is when we're seeing the entire star. When we can only see a hemisphere, the flux is half of F0. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted = 0.4482 F0, and when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, it's F_unspotted = 0.5 F0.

Wait, but that's not correct because when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux should be higher than F0, because that hemisphere isn't spotted. But no, because F0 is the average. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing things.

Wait, the star's total flux is F0. If you look at a hemisphere, you see half of the star's surface. If all of it was at Teff, the flux would be (2 π R² * Teff^4 σ ) / (4 π D² ) )= (R² Teff^4 σ )/(2 D² )= F0/2. So F0 is the sum of all flux, and viewing a hemisphere would give F0/2.

But if part of that hemisphere is cooler, the flux would be less than F0/2.

Wait, but in the case where the star's entire surface is at Teff, the flux when viewing any hemisphere is F0/2.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted = [1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 Tspots^4 ] * (R² σ )/(4 D² ) = [1.6 + 0.4*(5/6)^4 ] * (F0/2) * (4 Teff^4 )/(R² σ ) * (R² σ )/(4 D² )) Wait, perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip in brightness is when the maximum amount of spotty area is visible. But in this setup, the star is only showing one hemisphere at a time. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is 0.4482 F0, and when the other hemisphere is visible, the flux is 0.5 F0.

Wait, but that can't be, because the other hemisphere is at Teff, so the flux should be higher than when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recompute F_spotted.

Compute F_spotted = (1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (Teff - 1000)^4 ) * (R² σ )/(4 D² )

But F0 is (R² σ Teff^4 )/( D² )

So F_spotted / F0 = [ (1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (5000)^4 ) ] / (4 Teff^4 )

Wait, Teff is 6000, so (5000/6000)^4 is (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482.

So numerator: 1.6 * 1 + 0.4 * 0.482 = 1.6 + 0.1928 = 1.7928.

Divide by 4: 1.7928 /4 ≈ 0.4482.

So F_spotted = 0.4482 F0.

And when the other hemisphere is facing us, which is unspotted, the flux is F_unspotted = (2 Teff^4 ) * (R² σ )/(4 D² ) = (2/4) Teff^4 (R² σ/D² )= (0.5 Teff^4 ) (R² σ/D² ) = 0.5 F0.

But wait, that implies that the average brightness would be the average of F_spotted and F_unspotted, but actually, the star rotates and the flux varies between these two extremes. So the maximum dip is when F_spotted is 0.4482 F0, and the maximum peak is 0.5 F0.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because the star's total flux when the entire surface is unspotted would be F0. But when viewed from a hemisphere, the flux is F0/2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the brightness variation as the star rotates.

The brightness variation depends on how much of the spotted area is visible. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. The maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted area is on the near side.

Wait, but the problem says that one hemisphere is covered in spots, so the maximum amount of spots we can see is the entire hemisphere's spotty area. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted = 0.4482 F0, and when the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us, the flux is F_unspotted = 0.5 F0.

Wait, but that would mean that the star's brightness varies between 0.4482 F0 and 0.5 F0. So the amplitude of the variation is (0.5 - 0.4482) F0 = 0.0518 F0.

Wait, but that's not a very big variation. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in assuming that the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us is 0.5 F0. Because when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire hemisphere is at Teff, so the flux should be higher than when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the star's total flux is F0 when viewed from any direction, but when you block part of it (as in a transit), the flux drops. But in this case, the spots are cooler, so the flux drops when the spotted area is visible.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the average brightness change caused by the spots, and then compare that to the change caused by a planet transit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to compute the fractional change in brightness when the star is spotted, and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

Wait, the problem says that the variation in brightness is due to rotational modulation of the spots, and that it resembles an exoplanet transit. So the amplitude of the brightness variation should be the same as that caused by a planet of radius R_planet transiting the star.

So the variation amplitude is the difference in brightness when the spotted area is visible, compared to when it's not.

Wait, but when the star is viewed from the unspotted hemisphere, the flux is higher than when the spotted hemisphere is viewed, because the spots are cooler.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip occurs when the spotted area is fully visible, and the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible.

So the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Wait, but let's compute the dip. The dip would be F_unspotted - F_spotted.

F_unspotted = 0.5 F0.

F_spotted = 0.4482 F0.

So the dip is 0.5 F0 - 0.4482 F0 = 0.0518 F0.

The amplitude is 0.0518 F0 / F0 = 0.0518, or 5.18% dip.

Wait, but when a planet transits, the dip is (R_planet / R_star )^2.

So we have:

(R_planet / R_star )^2 = 0.0518.

So R_planet = sqrt(0.0518) * R_star.

Compute sqrt(0.0518): sqrt(0.05) is about 0.2236, sqrt(0.0518) is a bit more. Let's compute 0.0518:

0.0518 is approximately 5.18e-2.

sqrt(5.18e-2) = sqrt(5.18) * 1e-1.

sqrt(5.18) ≈ 2.277.

So 2.277 * 0.1 = 0.2277, about 0.228 R_star.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~0.32, option C) ~0.11, etc.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because I think the dip is (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/F_unspotted, which is (0.5 - 0.4482)/0.5 = (0.0518)/0.5 = 0.1036, or about 10.36% dip.

Wait, that's a 10% dip. So the amplitude is 10%.

So then, (R_planet / R_star )^2 = 0.1036.

So R_planet = sqrt(0.1036) R_star.

sqrt(0.1) is about 0.316, so sqrt(0.1036) is about 0.322, so approximately 0.32 R_star. Which would be option D) ~0.32.

Alternatively, let me compute it accurately:

0.1036: square root.

I know that 0.32^2 = 0.1024, which is very close to 0.1036. So 0.32^2 = 0.1024, which is 0.0012 less than 0.1036. So the actual value is a bit higher than 0.32.

So sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322.

So R_planet ≈ 0.322 R_star, so option D) ~0.32 is correct.

But wait, earlier when I computed the dip as 0.0518 F0, which is a 5.18% dip, but that was when comparing to F0. However, the planet's dip is relative to F0 as well. So perhaps I made a mistake in the dip calculation.

Wait, no. When the planet transits, the dip is (Area_planet / Area_star) = (R_p^2 / R_star^2 ), because the planet blocks that area. So the dip is (R_p/R_star)^2.

In the case of the spots, the dip is the change in flux when the spots are visible. So the maximum dip is when the star shows the spotted hemisphere, which is F_spotted. The maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, which is F_unspotted.

So the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Wait, no, the amplitude is the change in brightness. So when the planet transits, the dip is (R_p^2 / R_star^2 ) in flux.

In the spotted case, the dip is (F_unspotted - F_spotted ) / F_unspotted.

Which is (0.5 F0 - 0.4482 F0 ) / 0.5 F0 ) = (0.0518 F0 ) / (0.5 F0 ) ) = 0.1036, or 10.36% dip.

So the dip is 10.36%.

So setting (R_p/R_star)^2 = 0.1036.

So R_p = sqrt(0.1036) R_star ≈ 0.322 R_star.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~0.32.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's surface is only partially spotted, so the dip is from when the entire spot is in view, which is a certain fraction.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The brightness variation caused by the spots is due to the spots being cooler. So the relative change in brightness is the difference between the average flux when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, the star's brightness without spots is F0.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted = 0.4482 F0.

When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_unspotted = 0.5 F0.

So the average flux is (F_spotted + F_unspotted ) / 2 = (0.4482 + 0.5 ) / 2 F0 = 0.4741 F0.

Wait, but that's not the case. The star's rotation would cause the flux to vary between F_spotted and F_unspotted. The amplitude would be (F_unspotted - F_spotted ) = 0.0518 F0, which is a 5.18% dip.

Wait, but that's a 5% dip. So if a planet causes a 5% dip, then R_p = sqrt(0.05) R_star ≈ 0.223 R_star. Which isn't one of the options.

Hmm, but earlier calculation with the dip as 10% gives R_p ~0.32, which is option D.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the dip the wrong way around. Because when the star is rotating, the brightness varies between F_spotted and F_unspotted. So the maximum brightness is F_unspotted = 0.5 F0, and the minimum is F_spotted =0.4482 F0.

So the amplitude is (0.5 - 0.4482) F0 = 0.0518 F0, which is about 5.18% of F0.

So the dip is 5.18%, which would correspond to (R_p/R_star)^2 =0.0518.

R_p = sqrt(0.0518) R_star ≈ 0.2277 R_star.

Looking at the options, option B is ~0.07, option C ~0.11, option D ~0.32, option A ~0.39.

Hmm, 0.2277 isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should model this differently. Because the problem states that the situation resembles an exoplanet, so the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as that caused by the planet.

Wait, perhaps the dip caused by the spots is the same as the dip caused by the planet.

So the dip when the star is spotted is (F_unspotted - F_spotted ) / F_unspotted = (0.5 - 0.4482)/0.5 = 0.0518 / 0.5 = 0.1036, or 10.36% dip.

So setting (R_p/R_star)^2 = 0.1036 → R_p = ~0.32 R_star, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the dip is (F_unspotted - F_spotted ) / F0, which would be 0.0518 F0 / F0 = 5.18% dip.

But that's not matching any options except perhaps option B or C, which are around 0.07 or 0.11. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I calculate the dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the maximum dip when the entire star is covered by spots, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem as the star being completely covered by spots, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation is continuous as the spots rotate, leading to a sinusoidal variation with an amplitude of (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/2.

Wait, when the star is viewed edge-on, the spots would cause a dip when the spot is on the limb, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum dip is when the maximum number of spots is on the visible hemisphere. But in this case, the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, which is the case when the star's rotation brings that hemisphere into view.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the relative change in brightness when the star is spotted as compared to when it's not.

The star's luminosity without spots is F0 = sigma * Teff^4.

With spots, the effective temperature is lower, so the total flux is lower. But the problem says that the star is observed with spots on one hemisphere, so the flux depends on the rotation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the average flux when the star is spotted.

The fractional change in brightness would be the difference between the flux when the star is unspotted (F0) and the average flux when the spots are present (F_avg).

Wait, no, because the star's rotation causes the spots to come into and out of view, leading to a periodic brightness variation. So the amplitude of this variation would be the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

Wait, when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_unspotted = (2 π R² ) * Teff^4 * sigma / (4 π D² ) = (R² sigma Teff^4 )/(2 D² ) = F0/2.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted = [ 1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (5000)^4 ] * (R² sigma )/(4 D² )

Which is F_spotted = [ 1.6 + 0.4*(5/6)^4 ] * (R² sigma )/(4 D² ) / Teff^4 * Teff^4.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute F_spotted relative to F0.

F_spotted = [1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (5000)^4 ] * (R² sigma )/(4 D² )

= [1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (5/6 Teff )^4 ] * (R² sigma )/(4 D² )

= [1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (5/6)^4 Teff^4 ] * (R² sigma )/(4 D² )

= Teff^4 [1.6 + 0.4 (5/6)^4 ] * (R² sigma )/(4 D² )

But F0 = Teff^4 (R² sigma )/( D² )

So F_spotted = [1.6 + 0.4 (5/6)^4 ] /4 * F0

= [1.6 + 0.4 * (625/1296) ) ] /4 * F0

Wait, (5/6)^4 = 625/1296 ≈ 0.482.

So 1.6 + 0.4 * 0.482 = 1.6 + 0.1928 = 1.7928.

Divide by 4: 1.7928 /4 = 0.4482.

So F_spotted = 0.4482 F0.

Similarly, F_unspotted = 0.5 F0.

So the brightness variation when the star rotates is between 0.4482 F0 and 0.5 F0.

The amplitude of the variation is (0.5 - 0.4482) F0 = 0.0518 F0, which is a 5.18% dip.

But wait, when a planet transits, the dip is (R_p / R_star )^2 * F0.

So setting (R_p / R_star )^2 = 0.0518 → R_p = sqrt(0.0518) R_star ≈ 0.2277 R_star.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, but the star is rotating such that only a portion of the spots is visible at any time. So the maximum dip occurs when the maximum number of spots is visible.

Wait, but the problem states that the filling factor is 20% on the hemisphere, so when the hemisphere is facing us, 20% of that area is spots.

So the maximum dip is when the entire 20% spotted area is visible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is being modeled as the star's brightness varying when the spots are on the limb, leading to a smaller dip.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness variation is calculated as the difference between the flux when the spots are on the far side and when they're on the near side.

Wait, but when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F_unspotted = 0.5 F0.

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_spotted = 0.4482 F0.

So the amplitude is (0.5 - 0.4482) F0 = 0.0518 F0, which is about 5.18% dip.

So the same dip would be caused by a planet with R_p such that (R_p/R_star)^2 = 0.0518 → R_p ≈ 0.227 R_star.

But that's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to compute the relative change in brightness when the star is spotted compared to when it's not. So the change is (F_spotted - F_unspotted) / F_unspotted.

Wait, but F_unspotted is 0.5 F0, and F_spotted is 0.4482 F0.

So the change is (0.4482 -0.5)/0.5 = (-0.0518)/0.5 = -0.1036, which is a 10.36% decrease. So the amplitude is 10.36%.

So (R_p/R_star)^2 =0.1036 → R_p= sqrt(0.1036) R_star≈0.322 R_star.

Which matches option D) ~0.32.

So I think the correct answer is D) ~0.32.


To solve the problem, we analyze the brightness variation caused by the star's spotted hemisphere and compare it to the brightness variation caused by a hypothetical exoplanet transiting the star. The goal is to determine the radius of the exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Star Properties**:
   - The star has a radius equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \).
   - The effective temperature of the star is \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%, meaning 20% of the hemisphere's surface area is covered by spots.
   - The spots are cooler, with a temperature \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is \( F_{\text{unspotted}} = 0.5 F_0 \), where \( F_0 \) is the total flux of the star without any spots.
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is calculated as:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = \frac{1.6 T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.4 T_{\text{spots}}^4}{4 T_{\text{eff}}^4} F_0
     \]
     Substituting \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), we find:
     \[
     \left(\frac{T_{\text{spots}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.482
     \]
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = \frac{1.6 + 0.4 \cdot 0.482}{4} F_0 = \frac{1.7928}{4} F_0 \approx 0.4482 F_0
     \]

3. **Amplitude of Brightness Variation**:
   - The brightness variation amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux:
     \[
     \Delta F = F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}} = 0.5 F_0 - 0.4482 F_0 = 0.0518 F_0
     \]
   - The relative amplitude is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.0518 \, \text{(5.18% dip)}.
     \]

4. **Comparison to Exoplanet Transit**:
   - The brightness dip caused by a transiting exoplanet is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = \frac{\Delta F}{F_0}
     \]
   - Substituting \( \Delta F / F_0 = 0.0518 \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.0518} \approx 0.227
     \]

5. **Revisiting the Amplitude**:
   - The problem states that the brightness variation caused by the spots resembles that of an exoplanet. However, the earlier calculation of the dip as 5.18% does not match any of the provided options. Reassessing the problem, the amplitude is interpreted as the relative change in brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible compared to the unspotted hemisphere:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = \frac{0.5 F_0 - 0.4482 F_0}{0.5 F_0} = \frac{0.0518 F_0}{0.5 F_0} = 0.1036 \, \text{(10.36% dip)}.
     \]
   - Setting \( \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.1036 \), we find:
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1036} \approx 0.322
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - The radius of the exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve is approximately \( 0.32 R_{\text{star}} \), which corresponds to **Option D**.
