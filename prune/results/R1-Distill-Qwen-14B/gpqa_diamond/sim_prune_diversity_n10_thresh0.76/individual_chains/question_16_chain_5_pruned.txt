Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many of these compounds exhibit optical activity. I remember that optical activity is when a compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which usually means the compound is chiral. Chiral compounds have at least one chiral center or some other element of chirality, like a plane of asymmetry or a center of inversion. Let me go through each compound one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Hmm, so the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. But-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl attached to C1, with another CH2 group on C1. Wait, maybe I should draw it. But wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would mean the Cl is on C1. So structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So the molecule is Cl-C(=CHCH2CH3). Wait, no, but wait but-1-ene has four carbons. Oh wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro is Cl on the first carbon. So it's
