Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about gene interactions and disease resistance in white lupine. Hmm, let me try to unpack this.

The setup is that three genes, G1, G2, and G3, are candidates for contributing to anthracnose resistance. They made knock-out mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The idea is to figure out how these genes interact based on the resistance levels.

So the resistance levels are given as percentages of the control (which is 100% resistant). Higher percentage means more resistance. The data is:

- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

And the question is about the interactions among these genes. The options suggest some conclusions about transcription factors, pleiotropy, gene redundancy, and epistasis.

First, I remember that epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that can indicate epistasis.

Looking at the single mutants: g2 has 0% resistance, which is the lowest. That suggests that G2 is critical because without it, there's no resistance. If a gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, knocking it out would disable the pathway, leading to loss of resistance.

Now, the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% resistance. Both g1 and g2 are knocked out. Since g2 alone is 0%, adding g1 knockout doesn't change it. So maybe G2 is upstream of G1? Or perhaps G2 is necessary for G1's function.

Wait, but when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%. So if both G2 and G1 are knocked out, it's still 0%. That suggests that G2's function is required for resistance, and perhaps G1 isn't the main one. Hmm.

Looking at g1g3, the resistance is 10%. The single mutants g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So combining g1 and g3 gives a much lower resistance. That might suggest that they have additive or synergistic effects.

But wait, let's think about the double mutant where both are non-functional. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream, perhaps G2 activates both G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 would be expressed, leading to no resistance. That matches the data: g2 is 0%, and all the double mutants that include g2 are also 0%. So that makes sense.

So G2 might be the transcription factor. Because when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, indicating that all downstream genes (like G1 and G3) are not functioning. So in the double mutant g1g3, both G1 and G3 are non-functional, but their combined knockout gives 10% resistance. Hmm, that's lower than either single mutant. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and each contributes some level of resistance. So without both, the resistance is much lower.

Wait, but what's the hierarchy here? Let me think about the possible options. The options say things like G2 is a transcription factor, others show pleiotropy, or gene redundancy, and which is epistatic towards another.

Looking at the single mutants:

g1: 75% resistance. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance by a quarter. But G2 is completely knocked out (0%), so maybe G2 is upstream of G1. If G2 is a transcription factor for G1, then when G2
