Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through each step carefully.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that name is a bit complex. Let me break it down. The main ring is a cyclohexanone, which is a six-membered ring with a ketone group at position 1. Then, at position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group. So that's like a CH₂OH attached to the ring. At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Propene is CH₂=CHCH₂, but since it's prop-1-en-2-yl, the substituent is on the second carbon. Wait, no—prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH₂CH₂– but wait, no. Let me think again. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH₂=C(CH₂–). No, that's not right. Oh wait, propene is CH₂=CH₂, but as a substituent, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH₂=CH–, but attached at the 2nd carbon. Wait, no—I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to draw it mentally. So, the substituent is (CH₂) attached to the cyclohexane ring. Wait no, the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is (CH₂) with a double bond. So, it's CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl group: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂– but attached at the second carbon, right? So, when you take propene (CH₂=CHCH₃), and substitute the methyl group with a cyclohexane ring. So the substituent is CH₂=CH– attached to the ring. So the group is an allyl group, but attached at the middle carbon. So, the structure at position 5 is CH₂–C(H)=CH₂? No, wait, it's CH
