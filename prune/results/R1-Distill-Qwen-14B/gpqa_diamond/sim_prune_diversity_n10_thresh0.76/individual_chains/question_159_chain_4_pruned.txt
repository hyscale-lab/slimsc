Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at around 790 nm in the near infrared, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that in quasars, sometimes emission lines are prominent, and the peak might indicate the rest-frame wavelength of a particular emission line, like Lyman alpha or something else. Wait, Lyman alpha is about 121 nm in the UV. But here the observed wavelength is near 790 nm. Oh wait, that's in the infrared. So maybe this is a redshifted emission line.

Redshift z is calculated by (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. Let's calculate that. The rest wavelength for Lyman alpha is about 121.6 nm. So if observed is 790 nm, then z = (790 / 121.6) - 1. Let me compute that. 790 /120 is about 6.58, so 6.58-1=5.58. So z is approximately 5.58.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the peak is from another line. For example, the Balmer series in hydrogen: H-alpha is about 656 nm in rest frame. If observed is 790, then z = (790/656) -1 â‰ˆ 1.20 -1 = 0.20. Hmm, that's a much lower redshift. But H-alpha is a prominent line in optical, so depending on the quasar's emission, maybe that's possible.

Wait, but in the question, the peak is in the near infrared. So the observed wavelength is longer. If it's a higher redshift object, like a quasar, then the Lyman alpha line is more likely to be observed in the infrared if the quasar is at a high redshift. Because Lyman alpha is in UV, and when we observe it from a high-z object, it gets redshifted into optical or IR.

So probably z is about 5.58, using the Lyman alpha line. But wait, another thought: the question says the flux drops significantly below 790 nm. That
