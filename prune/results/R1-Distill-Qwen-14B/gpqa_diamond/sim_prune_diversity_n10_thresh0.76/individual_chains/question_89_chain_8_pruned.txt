Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows specific signals: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). There's also an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with it, especially under high heat, elimination reactions are common. Since both bromine atoms are on the adamantane structure, likely adjacent to each other (1,3-dibromo implies they're on opposite faces?), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the structure of adamantane.

Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, a polycyclic structure, right? The structure has a diamond-like lattice. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons that are diagonally opposite on the structure. But when KOH is added, probably an E2 elimination occurs, leading to the formation of an alkene. Because two adjacent bromides would allow for a double elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromo might not be adjacent. Maybe the positions are such that elimination would form a bridge. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, which would complicate elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dibromide, so elimination forms a double bond.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Oh, perhaps each Br is on a different bridge. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meso compound. But when KOH is used, for vicinal dihalides, elimination (dehydrohalogenation) occurs to form alkenes. So product 1 is probably an adamantane derivative with a double bond.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's usually a carbonyl group. So maybe the product isn't an alkene.

Wait, wait. Wait, KOH could also do an elimination to form an epoxide? No, wait, epoxide formation usually comes from peracids or other oxidizing agents. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl.

Ah, wait a minute, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes dehydrohalogenation twice, perhaps it forms an allene or something else, but that wouldn't give a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the base induces a substitution, but with two leaving groups, perhaps it's more likely to eliminate.

Wait, but 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl peak, which could be an ester, ketone, or maybe an epoxide (but I don't think so, as epoxides are around 1250 cm⁻¹). Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination forming a ketone?

Wait, wait, another possibility: perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms a carbonyl group. Wait, but elimination typically forms alkenes, but in some cases, if there's a possibility for forming a carbonyl, perhaps via a neighboring group participation or something else.

Wait, when dibromides undergo elimination,
