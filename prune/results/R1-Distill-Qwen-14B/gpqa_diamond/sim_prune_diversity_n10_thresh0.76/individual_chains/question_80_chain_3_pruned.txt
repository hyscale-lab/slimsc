Okay, so I've got this science question here about an algorithm that takes DNA sequences as input and gives some numerical outputs. The question provides two examples, and I need to find out what the third input gives. Hmm, let me think through this.

The examples given are:
AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

And the question is, what does ACAGTGACC give? The options are A) 315, B) 185, C)333, D)351.

First, I need to figure out the pattern or the rule that the algorithm is using to convert these DNA sequences into numbers. DNA sequences are made up of the bases A, T, C, G. So each of these letters must be contributing something numerically.

Looking at the first example: AGG. Let's break it down. Each letter is a nucleotide. So A is the first, G is the second, another G is third. The output is 115. Wait, that's the sum of their individual contributions, maybe? Let me see.

If I think each nucleotide has a certain value:

A = ?
G = ?
C = ?
T = ?

Wait, but in the first example, AGG, so A, G, G. If I can find the individual values, that would help. Let me see if adding them gives the output.

AGG is three nucleotides. Let me assume each has a value, and the output is the sum. So A + G + G = 115.

Similarly, the second example: TGCTGA. That's six nucleotides. T, G, C, T, G, A. Sum would be T + G + C + T + G + A = 176.

So I have two equations:

1. A + G + G = 115 → A + 2G = 115
2. T + G + C + T + G + A = 176 → 2T + A + 2G + C = 176

Hmm, but that's two equations with four variables. Maybe I can find another clue.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair of nucleotides contributes a certain value. Wait, but the inputs are of different lengths. AGG is length 3, TGCTGA is length 6. So maybe the algorithm sums each pair or something else.

Wait another thought: perhaps each nucleotide's position in the sequence contributes a weight. Like the first position has a certain weight, the second another, etc. For example, A in position 1 might be multiplied by 1, G in position 2 by 2, etc.

Let's test that idea with the first example. AGG:

A is in position 1 → 1 * A's value.
G in position 2 → 2 * G's value.
G in position 3 → 3 * G's value.

So total would be (1*A) + (2*G) + (3
