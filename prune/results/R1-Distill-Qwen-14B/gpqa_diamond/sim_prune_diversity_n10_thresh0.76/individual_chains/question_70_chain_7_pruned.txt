Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the reactions and seeing what each step tells me.

First, the problem says solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. I'm thinking, what compounds react in such a way? 8 equivalents are a lot. Maybe something like a metal reacting with a halogen? Like, say, sulfur reacting with something, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps a transition metal reacting with a diatomic gas like O2 or something else.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like sulfur trioxide, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's a transition metal compound. Another thought: if C is a product of a metal and a gas, maybe it's a metal oxide? But then, what would be red? Alternatively, perhaps it's a compound of vanadium or chromium, which have colored compounds.

But wait, another possibility: maybe A is a metal and B is chlorine gas. 8 equivalents would mean the metal is combining with Cl2 in a high ratio. For example, for every mole of A, 8 moles of Cl2 are used. Wait, but metals typically form chlorides with lower ratios. For example, FeCl3 requires 3 Cl2 per Fe. Hmm, maybe it's not Cl2. Alternatively, maybe B is oxygen? But O2 would form oxides with ratios like 1, 2, 3, etc.

Wait, another angle. The second reaction is C reacting with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C + 2D → E. Hmm, what reacts with something in a 2:1 ratio to form a dangerous product. Maybe E is something like sarin gas or another nerve agent, but that's speculative. Alternatively, perhaps E is something like phosgene or another toxic gas.

Looking at the third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C is probably an anhydride because reacting with water would produce two acids. For example, sulfuric anhydride (which isn't common, wait) or more likely, something like a metal oxide reacting with water to form an acid. Wait, but in that case, if C is a metal oxide, reacting with water would form a single acid. Hmm, maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, another common reaction: if C is a compound that upon hydrolysis gives two different acids. Maybe something like a sulfite or similar. Alternatively, think about the cracking of sulfuryl chloride (but I'm not sure).

Wait, another thought. What about if C is a compound like SO3 (sulfur trioxide)? SO3 when reacted with water would form H2SO4 (strong acid) and another acid? Wait, no. H2SO4 is a strong acid, but I don't think SO3 plus water gives two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed anhydride.

Wait, another possibility. Suppose C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a metal hydroxide (which would be a base, not an acid) but that's not matching the description. Alternatively, maybe C is a salt that, when reacted with water, hydrolyzes into two acids. For example, if C is a salt like (NH4)2CO3, which would hydrolyze into NH4OH (a weak acid, but actually a weak base) and H2CO3 (which is a weak acid). Hmm, but that's not exactly two different acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a salt like Na2SO3, which upon hydrolysis gives H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But that's not two acids either.

Wait, perhaps C is something like a sulfonamide or another compound. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound that when reacted with water, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is a nitride (like AlN), but that would react to form NH3 and the corresponding metal hydroxide, which isn't an acid. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's think about another clue.

The fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, D + B → H. H is a solvent, which makes me think of something like H2O, but B is a gas. Alternatively, maybe H is something like HCl, but that's a gas. Or perhaps H is a diethyl ether or another solvent. Wait, another possibility: H could be H2O, but D and B would have to be something that reacts in 1:1 ratio to form H2O. Let's think, if B is O2 and D is H2, then 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, if D and B are both diatomic gases, and they react in a 1:1 ratio, what could that be? For example, if B is Cl2 and D is H2, they could form HCl, but that's a 1:1 reaction (H2 + Cl2 → 2HCl). So that would fit the 1:1 ratio. H is HCl, which is a gas but not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe H is NH3? But how? If B is N2 and D is H2, but their reaction would need more H2. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is something else.

Wait, another possibility: B is O2 and D is H2. Then, 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So that's a 2:1 ratio, which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Let me try to bring it all together. Let's think about what E is. E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, going back to the first reaction. A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. 8 is a lot, so perhaps B is a diatomic molecule, and each molecule contributes two atoms. So, 8 equivalents would be 8 moles of B per mole of A. For example, if B is Cl2, then 8 moles would mean A is combining with 16 Cl atoms. So, perhaps A is a metal with a +1 charge, but that would require 16 Cl per metal atom, which seems high. Alternatively, if B is O2, each O2 molecule has two O atoms. 8 moles would mean 16 O atoms per A. Wait, perhaps A is Fe, and B is O2? 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. But that's 3 equivalents of O2. Hmm, not matching the 8.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur. Sulfur reacting with something? Wait, sulfur reacting with oxygen would form SO3, but that's 1 S per 3 O2 molecules. So, 3 moles of O2 per mole of S. But that's 3 equivalents, not 8.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal like vanadium. Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) has the formula V2O5, which
