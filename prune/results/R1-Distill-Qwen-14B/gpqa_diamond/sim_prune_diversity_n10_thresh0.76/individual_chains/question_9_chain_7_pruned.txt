Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which molecule has C3H symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that C3H is a type of molecular symmetry. The "C" stands for "proper rotation," and the subscript 3 means it's a three-fold rotation. The "H" part I think refers to having a horizontal mirror plane. So, C3H symmetry would involve a molecule that can be rotated 120 degrees and look the same, and also have a mirror plane that's horizontal. Wait, no, I might be mixing things up. I think the notation can be a bit confusing. Oh right, C3H means a three-fold rotation followed by a horizontal mirror plane. Or wait, maybe it's the combination of a rotation and a reflection. Alternatively, maybe it's the same as the dihedral group D3h, which has a combination of a rotation and a horizontal mirror.

So, the molecule must have a three-fold axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane that includes that axis. So, looking for a molecule that's symmetric both in rotation and reflection.

Now, let's look at the options given. There are four molecules to consider: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The options are labeled A to D, with each option being one of these four molecules.

I'll go through each option and see their structures.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. I remember that triisopropyl borate has three isopropyl groups attached to a boron atom. The structure is something like B with three isopropyl substituents. Isopropyl groups are symmetric themselves, but how does the overall molecule look?

In triisopropyl borate, each isopropyl group is attached to boron. Boron is in the center, and each substituent is the same. So, if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees, it should look the same. So, does it have a three-fold rotational symmetry? I think yes. But what about a mirror plane? Since the molecule is symmetrical around the central B, maybe it has multiple planes of symmetry. Wait, but what kind of symmetry?

Wait, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule. The three isopropyl groups are arranged symmetrically around B. So, any rotation by 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. So, it has a C3 axis. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, a horizontal mirror plane would cut through the plane of the molecule. If the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane would exist. Wait, but triisopropyl borate is in a trigonal planar geometry, which is a type of planar arrangement. So, yes, it
