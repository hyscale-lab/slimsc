Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's look at each reaction and see what each product might be. The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? So it has a six-membered ring with a ketone group.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2) forms product 1. Bromine is a dienophile, I think. Oh wait, cyclohexanone has a conjugated diene? No, wait, cyclohexanone is a ketone. So when aldehydes or ketones react with bromine, it's usually a halohydrin formation? Or maybe it's an addition to the carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: cyclohexanone reacts with bromine under certain conditions. Oh wait, when ketones react with bromine in a solution that's maybe acidic or something, it's a halogenation. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening? No, that's more for epoxides. Hmm.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh! Could it be a dihydroxylation? No, that's for alkenes. Wait, cyclohexanone has a C=O. Adding bromine to a carbonyl group. Hmm, maybe it's a bromination. Oh, wait! I think when ketones react with bromine in the presence of a base, it could form a dibromide. Or is it a ketone undergoing some kind of addition?

Wait, another angle: Maybe it's a ring-opening via some mechanism. No, cyclohexanone is a saturated ring except for the ketone. Oh wait, maybe it's a bromohydrin formation. Because if you have a ketone reacting with bromine and water, you get a bromohydrin. But the question doesn't mention water, so maybe it's an addition of bromine across the carbonyl group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible reactions of ketones with Br2. Oh wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. The carbonyl oxygen is a good leaving group if something attacks the carbonyl carbon. But bromine is more likely
