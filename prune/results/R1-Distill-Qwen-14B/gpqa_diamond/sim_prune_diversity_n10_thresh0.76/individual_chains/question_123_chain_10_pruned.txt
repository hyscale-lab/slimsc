Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the problem says that a supernova occurred, and part of the ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, which means no acceleration involved. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, waitâ€”wait, so in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is coming at them at 60,000 km/s. But since both are inertial, I think this implies that from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at the same speed, right? Because in inertial frames, velocities just switch signs, considering relative motion.

The question is asking: What distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame? Oh wait, so time is passing in the ejecta's frame, but we need the distance in the Galaxy's frame. So it's a question involving time dilation due to relativity maybe?

Wait, but the problem says to ignore gravity and rotation and revolution. So we don't have to worry about curved spacetime or anything like that. Probably just a straightforward velocity and time problem, but considering time dilation between the frames.

Wait, but if the frames are moving relative to each other, and time is different in each frame, then how do I relate the time in one frame to the other?

So, first, I think I need to establish the relationship between the two reference frames. Let's denote the Galaxy's frame as S and the ejecta's frame as S'. The problem states that in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta (S' is the ejecta's rest frame). So if in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity u towards the Galaxy's center, then in S', the Galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta at velocity u as well.

Wait, but in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. Wait, but maybe in this case, since the problem is set up as such, perhaps it's a case where u is 60,000 km/s in the S' frame towards the ejecta. So the relative
