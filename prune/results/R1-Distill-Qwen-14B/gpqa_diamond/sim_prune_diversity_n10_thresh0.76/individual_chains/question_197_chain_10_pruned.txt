Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for something like the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, but wait, isn't that usually with HBr? Or maybe it's about something else. Oh, right! I think red phosphorus is used in the Halogenation of alkenes, particularly in the presence of HI. Or wait, maybe it's for the formation of diiodides. Alternatively, I recall that in some cases, especially with alkenes and HX, there's addition, but red phosphorus might be involved in catalysis or maybe in a different kind of reaction.

Wait, no, another thought: red phosphorus and HI is used in the production of iodoalkanes from alkenes via the hydroiodination reaction. Oh right, that's it! The reaction of alkenes with HI in the presence of red phosphorus is called the Weitz-Scheffer reaction. Or wait, is it the other way around? I think the Weitz-Scheffer reaction is when an alkene reacts with HX (like HI) in the presence of a diethyl ether solution, and it's for adding HX across the double bond in a more controlled way. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics here. Alternatively, red phosphorus is used as a catalyst for the addition of HX to alkenes, leading to the formation of the more substituted (more stable) alkyl halide—maybe that's the case here.

So, to approach this, first, I need to figure out what Compound X is. The question gives me the IR and NMR data. Let's look at the IR first.

The IR shows strong absorption in the range 3400–2500 cm-1. That's a broad region, which often indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But looking at the other peaks, 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which suggests a ketone, aldehyde, ester, carboxylic acid, or maybe an acid derivative. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretching, so maybe the compound has an aromatic ring.

So, looking at the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is likely an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm, and they are usually split but here it's a broad singlet. Alternatively, 10.5 is a bit high for an aldehyde. Could it be a carboxylic acid proton? Those are usually around 10-12 ppm as broad singlets. So that's a possibility.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of an aromatic ring with two substituents, possibly para-substituted. Like a para-substituted benzene, with two substituents in the para positions, leading to two doublets each integrating to 2H.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 2.9, maybe a CH group adjacent to something, perhaps a carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, maybe a CH2 group adjacent to something, perhaps the carbonyl.

-1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet or doublet of three hydrogens, like a CH(CH3) group. Wait, a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) would suggest it's a methyl group attached to something else, perhaps a CH2CH(CH3) or similar.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet
