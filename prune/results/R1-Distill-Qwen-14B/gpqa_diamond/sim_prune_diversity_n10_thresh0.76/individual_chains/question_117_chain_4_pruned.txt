Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, let me think about what optical isomerism is. Oh right, it's about whether a compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which usually happens when there's a chiral center present. A chiral center is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. If a molecule has one or more chiral centers, it can exhibit optical isomerism, meaning it has enantiomers.

The question lists four compounds and asks which of them show optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each a combination of the four. Let's go through each one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**. Hmm, biphenyl rings connected at position 1. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions, and the other substituents are methyl esters at 2 and 2'. Wait, wait. Let me visualize this. The central biphenyl has two nitro groups on each ring at the 6 position (which is opposite the point where the rings connect) and two ester groups at 2 position (which is adjacent). So each ring has a nitro, a carbonyl (from the ester), and two methyl groups attached. Wait no, the structure is two ester groups on each ring attached to the 2 position. So, each ring has a nitro at position 6, and an ester group (OOCR where R is methyl) at position 2.

Wait, but can this compound have any chiral centers? The biphenyl structure is connected as 1,1', so the two rings are attached at position 1. Now, each ring's substituents: on each ring, at position 2, there's a COOCH3 group. At position 6, there's a nitro group. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Are any of the carbons in the structure chiral?

Wait, the central carbon where the two rings are connected? No, because it's a single bond between the two rings, so it's a single carbon attached to two rings. But wait, the biphenyl structure can have a plane of symmetry if the substituents are arranged symmetrically. Oh wait, in this case, each ring has the same substituents: a nitro and an ester group. So maybe the molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral. Alternatively, because the nitro and ester are on opposite ends, perhaps it's creating a chiral center.

Wait, no. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl rings. Each ring has a nitro and an ester. But looking at each ring, the substituents are in positions 2 and 6. Wait, maybe the biphenyl structure can't rotate freely if the substituents are in certain positions. So maybe there's a possibility of geometric isomerism (cis or trans), but not optical isomerism.

Wait, no, optical isomerism is about the presence of a chiral center. Are there any carbons attached to four different groups here? The est
