Okay, so I have this question about quasars and neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, let me try to think through it. I remember that quasars emit a lot of light, including at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms. Oh wait, that's in the ultraviolet range, right? Because I think the Lyman series is part of the UV spectrum.

So the question is about detecting these clouds using optical ground-based telescopes. But wait, optical telescopes typically observe in the visible range, which is about 400-700 nm or 4000-7000 Angstroms. So if the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is in UV, how would ground-based optical telescopes detect it?

Oh wait, the clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb the light from the quasars at Lyman alpha. So the quasar emits light, and when this light passes through the hydrogen clouds, some of it gets absorbed at the Lyman alpha wavelength. But how does this affect what we observe?

Redshift! Right, because the quasar might be at a high redshift, making the absorbed wavelength shift into the visible spectrum. So the idea here is that the Lyman alpha absorption line from the hydrogen cloud is redshifted into the optical range, which we can observe with ground-based telescopes.

So the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift such that this absorption is detectable. That probably means we need the redshifted wavelength to be within the optical range.

Let me recall the redshift formula. The observed wavelength lambda_obs is equal to lambda_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. The rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms (which is 121.6 nm, so UV).

We want lambda_obs to be in the optical range. Let's say the lower end of optical is about 400 nm. So I can set up the equation:

lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) >= 400 nm.

Wait, no, wait. Wait the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms. When the quasar is at a high redshift, that emission line would be redshifted. But when it's absorbed by a cloud, the cloud's absorption line is also at rest frame 1216 Angstroms. But wait wait, no, the cloud is the one absorbing, right? So the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms in its rest frame. If the cloud is at a redshift z, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z). 

Wait the quasar is behind the cloud, so the cloud is at a certain redshift. The quasar's light comes through, with some absorption at the cloud's Lyman alpha. So the quasar's emission line (say, its Lyman alpha at 1216) would be redshifted, but the cloud's absorption would be at a different wavelength? Or is the cloud at the same redshift as the quasar? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait no, think again. The quasar emits light, including a strong emission line at Lyman alpha (1216 Angstroms). As this light travels, it passes through neutral hydrogen clouds. These clouds absorb light at their own Lyman alpha wavelength, which is 1216 Angstroms in their rest frame. So when we observe this absorption, the wavelength we see is 1216*(1 + z_cloud), where z_cloud is the redshift of the cloud.

But wait, the quasar's light is also from a very distant object, so the quasar's Lyman alpha would be at a longer wavelength. So the cloud's absorption is at a wavelength longer than 1216 Angstroms but shorter than the quasar's emission line. Or maybe they're separate.

But the question is about detecting the absorption line with an optical telescope. So the absorption line must be in the visible spectrum, i.e., between
