Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the reactions given.

First, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm trying to think of a reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in a high ratio. Oh wait, maybe something like sulfur reacting with something? Or perhaps a metal reacting with a gas. Wait, another thought: if A is a metal and B is a halogen, maybe they form a compound. But the product C is bright red. Hmm, bright red could be something like CuO? No, wait, CuO is black. Oh, wait, maybe it's a transition metal sulfide or something else. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide and B is a diatomic gas. Let me think.

Wait another angle. When C reacts with D, which is a gas, in a 2:1 ratio, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous. Also, C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, if C is reacting with water to form A and two acids, that suggests C might be a salt. Because when salts react with water, they can hydrolyze into acids and bases, but in this case, it's forming two acids. So maybe C is a sulfide? Because sulfides reacting with water can produce H2S (a weak acid) and another acid if it's a metal sulfide. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, it would form NH3 and another acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, when C reacts with D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Hmm, D reacting with B in 1:1. Let me think of common gas reactions. Maybe D is H2O, but that's a liquid. Oh wait, H is used as a solvent, so perhaps H is something like ethanol or another organic solvent. Alternatively, maybe H is something like HCl. No, wait: D and B in 1:1 ratio. Oh, wait, if B is a diatomic gas, like O2 or Cl2, and D is H2, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is H2,
