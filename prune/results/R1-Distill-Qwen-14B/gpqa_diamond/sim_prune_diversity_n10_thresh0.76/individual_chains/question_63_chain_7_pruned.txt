Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon it absorbs to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are given as A to D, but I'm not sure which is correct yet.

First, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model. Oh wait, right, the non-rigid rotor model. So this model includes both rotational and vibrational energy states.

In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. The total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think it's a transition from the ground state to the first excited state. But which part—rotational or vibrational—changes here?

The problem states it's modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so perhaps the transition could involve either. But I think in the context of the question, they're considering the fundamental vibrational state. Oh wait, no, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, and the next state could be higher in rotation or vibration.

Wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, the next state is the first available higher energy state. So that would mean the first possible transition either in rotation or vibration. But which requires less energy?

I remember that for diatomic molecules, the vibrational energy levels are quantized, and the spacing between them is higher than the rotational spacing. Because the vibrational energy is given by (n + 1/2)ħω, so each step is ħω. Whereas rotational energy is (J(J+1)ħ)/(2I), so each step is on the order of ħ times something else. So if the photon's energy is ħω, it's a vibrational transition. But wait, the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So to go to the next state, perhaps it can either increase J or increase n.
