Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all its edges equal and all angles equal too. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees each. The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance... Oh right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance is something like d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² + 2lm cos(alpha) + 2ln cos(beta) + 2mn cos(gamma)) ), but wait, no, that might not be right. Or maybe it's another formula.

Wait, no, I think for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance d(hkl) is given by the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (h k (cos α + cos β - cos γ))/(a²) + ... Hmm, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps for a cubic system, it's simpler, but this is rhombohedral.

Wait, rhombohedral is a special case where a = b = c, and all angles are equal. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron. So for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance for (hkl) plane can be
