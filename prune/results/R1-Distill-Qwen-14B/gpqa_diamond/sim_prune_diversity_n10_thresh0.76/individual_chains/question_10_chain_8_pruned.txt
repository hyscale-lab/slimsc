Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which exoplanet has the highest density from the given options. I remember that density is mass divided by volume, right? So the formula is density = mass/volume.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So I can assume this one's density is the same as Earth's.

Option b) has 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. So wait, if the density is already given as 5.5, that's the same as Earth's. Since density doesn't change, this one's density is 5.5. But wait, the mass is double, but density is fixed. Hmm, but how does that affect anything? Because if the composition is same, density would stay same. But in this case, the question says density is about 5.5, so that's fixed.

Option c) is a planet with the same composition as Earth but five times more massive. If the composition is same as Earth, then the density should be same as Earth, right? Because density depends on the material. So same composition means same density, regardless of mass. So this planet should have density 5.5 g/cm³.

Option d) is a planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition, so density is same as Earth, 5.5. So all these planets (b, c, d) have same density as Earth?

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Wait
