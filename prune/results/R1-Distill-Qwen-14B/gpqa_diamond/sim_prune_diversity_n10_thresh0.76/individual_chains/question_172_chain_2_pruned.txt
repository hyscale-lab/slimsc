Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere, it relates to something called the Boltzmann distribution. Let me think about that.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, but which energy levels are we talking about? Oh, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but I don't think I need the exact energy value for this problem, because the options are about the relation between temperatures. So maybe it's a ratio problem.

Since the photospheres are in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the excitation states follow the Boltzmann equation. Right, the Boltzmann factor tells us the relative population of two energy levels. The formula is something like (n2/n1) = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is Î”E = E2 - E1. Wait, but in the question, star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. Let me clarify: when they say "twice as excited", I think they're referring to the population in the higher energy level. So, for star_1, the population in level 2 (n2) is twice that of star_2's n2.

Wait, no, actually, the wording is a bit tricky. It says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." Oh, perhaps each star's iron atoms are in different levels. Or wait, maybe both are comparing the same level, but star_1 has twice the excitation. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as the ratio of the populations of the same two levels in each star.

Wait, let me rephrase. For each star, the ratio of the excited state (n2) to the ground state (n1) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, the ratio is (n2_1)/(n1_1) = something, and for star_2, it's (n2_2)/(n1_2) = another thing.

But the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Hmm, perhaps it's the same level. Wait, maybe the energy level being considered is the same for both stars, but the population in that level is twice as high in star_1? Or maybe it's comparing the same level, but considering the excitation. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think step by step.

The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of populations in two energy levels. Let's say the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 > E1. Then for each star, the ratio of the populations is:

For star 1: n2_1 / n1_1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T1) )

For star 2: n2_2 / n1_2 =
