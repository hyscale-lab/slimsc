Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that astronomers have observed the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, each a power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is distance. Or wait, more accurately, plx in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So if distance increases, parallax decreases.

So the given relation is number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1 / plx^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, I can express plx as 1/d. Wait, no, plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.

Wait, let me clarify. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / (distance in parsecs). So if distance (d) increases, plx decreases.

So the number of stars is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let's substitute plx with 1/d. Plugging that in: N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's simplify that exponent. (1/d)^5 is 1/(d^5), so taking reciprocal gives d^5. So 1 over (1/d)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. Wait, no, it's about how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance. Hmm. Wait, maybe I need to think about the differential, like the change in N with respect to r (distance). Or perhaps it's about the number density, like how many stars are there per unit volume or per unit distance.

Wait, the question states: "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps it's about the number of stars per unit distance. Or the rate of change of the number of stars as a function of distance.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And since plx is 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with d^5. But that seems counterintuitive because usually, as you go further away, you can see fewer stars because they are dimmer or farther apart. Wait, but the question's setup is specific. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should model this. Let's say N = k / (plx)^5, where k is a constant. And since plx = 1/d, substituting gives N = k * (d)^5. So N increases as d^5, which suggests that the
