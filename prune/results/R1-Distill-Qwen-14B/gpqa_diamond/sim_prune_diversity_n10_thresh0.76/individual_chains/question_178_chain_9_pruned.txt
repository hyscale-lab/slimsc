Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I remember that the Lagrangian is a key part of the theory, especially in quantum field theory. The question gives me a specific Lagrangian: L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and asks about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

First, I think I need to figure out the mass dimension of each field in the Lagrangian. Mass dimension is important because it affects renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the terms in the Lagrangian have mass dimension ≤4, because in four spacetime dimensions, the action needs to be dimensionless.

So, let me list the fields involved here: ψ is a spinor field, F is the field strength tensor, and σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices. Let me recall the mass dimensions for each type of field.

Fermion fields ψ usually have mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the action is the integral of the Lagrangian, which must be dimensionless. The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Wait, but wait. The terms in the Lagrangian each have to have mass dimension 4 because when you integrate (which has dimension -4 in mass units), the overall action is dimensionless (since the integral is over four spacetime dimensions). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So, for the term L_int here, which is part of the Lagrangian, each part's dimensions must add up to 4.

Let's break down the term κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So, the fields involved are ψ̄ (same as ψ, as it's a Dirac adjoint, which I think has the same dimension as ψ), σ_{μν}, and F^{μν}.

I need to find the mass dimensions of each.

The Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ also has 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would have dimension 3. But wait, no: the term is ψ̄ σ ψ, and then multiplied by F^{μν}.

Wait, σ_{μν} is a product of γ matrices. Each γ matrix has dimension 1 (since γ^μ are dimensionless in 4D, because they're just matrices, not fields). So σ_{μν} is [γ, γ], which is dimension 2? Wait, no. Because each γ is dimensionless, so their commutator is also dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Let me think again. The gamma matrices are just constants in the field theory sense, so they don't carry mass dimension. So any product or commutator of them would also be dimensionless.

So σ_{μν} is [γ, γ], which is dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ has the dimensions of ψ̄ * dimensionless * ψ. So ψ̄ and ψ each have 3/2, so that term has mass dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_mu. Each A is a vector field, which in four dimensions has mass dimension 1. Because the kinetic term for A is (∂A)^2, which would be (mass^1 * A)^2, and that term needs to have dimension 4. So (∂A)^2 is (mass^1 * A)^2 → (mass^2 * A^2) = 4 → A has dimension 1.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The term (∂A)^2 would be (∂μ Aν)². ∂ has dimension 1 (since it's like d/dx, which is mass^1). So each derivative adds 1. A has dimension d_A. So (∂A)^2 has dimension (1 + d_A) * 2. Because each term is (mass^1 * A)^2 → mass^2 * A^2. So the term must have dimension 4. So 2*(1 + d_A) =4 → 1 +d_A=2 → d_A=1. So A has dimension 1.

So F^{μν} is made from derivatives of A, so each F has dimension 2 (because each ∂ adds 1, and each A is
