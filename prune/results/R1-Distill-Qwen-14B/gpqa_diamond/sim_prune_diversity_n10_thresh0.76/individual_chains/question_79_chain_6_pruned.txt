Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then they give the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product. I need to figure out what X was from the options provided.

Wait, wait. Oh right, the reaction. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? It's often used as a catalyst in certain reactions. And the solvent is nonpolar, which might suggest an elimination reaction or maybe some kind of ring-opening if X is an epoxide or something.

Wait, but the product's NMR is given. So maybe X is an epoxide that undergoes some kind of ring-opening with that base. Oh, wait, but the product's NMR is provided, so perhaps the reaction is an epoxide ring-opening. Or maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, so the product has a certain structure that we can determine from the NMR. Let me analyze the NMR data.

Looking at the 1H NMR first:

Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s): So two singlets each integrating to 3H. These are likely to be methyl groups attached to something deshielded, maybe aromatic rings or something else. Since they're singlets, they have no neighboring protons.

Then, we have:

6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Hmm, that's four peaks in the aromatic region. Let's think about the splitting.

The 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d) are likely to be doublets with coupling to one neighboring proton each. The 7.08 (2
