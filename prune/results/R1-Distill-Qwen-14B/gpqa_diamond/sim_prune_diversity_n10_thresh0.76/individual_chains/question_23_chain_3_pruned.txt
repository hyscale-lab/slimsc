Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, TLC showed the reactant spot diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to figure out which product options are possible.

Hmm, so first, I need to identify the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that structure. The benzene ring has an ether group, O connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is 3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but wait, butenyl has four carbons. Wait, 3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CHCH2 with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, the butenyl group is CH2-CH-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Let me think: the structure is (but-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the butenyl group is CH2CH2CHCH2? No, wait, buten-3-en-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, no, butenyl has four carbons. But-3-en-1-yl: position 3 is the third carbon. Wait, no, for but-3-en-1-yl, the chain is four carbons long, with the double bond starting at carbon 3. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, but butenyl is four carbons in total, so but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-? No, wait, the butenyl group is -CH2CH2CH2CH2-, but with a double bond at position 3.
