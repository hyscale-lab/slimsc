Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting objects using optical telescopes. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, I remember that when quasars emit light, some of it is absorbed by intervening hydrogen clouds. The Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 A, but if the cloud is moving away from us (redshifted), this wavelength would be stretched. So the observed wavelength would be lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

But how does this affect detection? Oh right, if the observed wavelength is in the optical range, then ground-based telescopes can see it. Because if it's in the infrared, optical telescopes wouldn't pick it up as effectively, since they're designed for visible light.

Wait, so optical telescopes operate in the visible spectrum, roughly 400-700 nm (4000 A to 7000 A). So the absorbed light (the Lyman alpha) must be shifted into this range for us to detect it with optical telescopes.

The rest wavelength is 1216 A, which is in the ultraviolet. So when it's redshifted, we need 1216*(1+z) to be less than or equal to 7000 A (since 7000 A is 700 nm, which is red). Or wait, no, because if it's longer than 7000 A, it's in the infrared, which optical telescopes can't see as well because the atmosphere is opaque at those wavelengths. So the observed wavelength needs to be <= 7000 A for optical detection.

So, set up the equation:

1216 * (1 + z) ≤ 7000

Solve for z:

1 + z ≤ 7000 / 1216

Let me compute that. 7000 divided by 1216. Hmm, 1216 times 5 is 6080. 6080 + 1216 =
