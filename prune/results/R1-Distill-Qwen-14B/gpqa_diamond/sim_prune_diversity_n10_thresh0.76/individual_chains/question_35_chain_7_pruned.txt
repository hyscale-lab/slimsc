Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm. The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix.

Wait, what's the structure of S? Oh right, the first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. 

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But the question isn't just about calculating them; it's about which statement is correct regarding the process. The options are A to D.

First, let's recall how to find eigenvalues. The eigenvalues a of Ay satisfy the equation det(Ay - a I) = 0. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, this should be manageable.

So let's write Ay explicitly. Since c is h/(4π), Ay is:

c * S = [ (h/(4π))*0   (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
         [ (h/(4π))*i    (h/(4π))*0 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0       -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)  0       ]

So the matrix Ay is:

[ 0          -i c ]
[ i c         0  ]

Because c is h/(4π), so I can substitute that in.

To find the eigenvalues, we set up the characteristic equation:

det(Ay - aI) = 0

Which is:

| (-a)        (-i c)      |
| (i c)       (-a)       | = 0

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (i c)(-i c) = a² - (i c)(-i c). Let's compute (i c)(-i c). 

Wait, (i)(-i) is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So (i c)(-i c) = c² (i * -i) = c² * (1) → c². So determinant becomes a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are a = c and a = -c. 

Wait, but c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues have real parts, no imaginary parts. Because c is real.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh or something, and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real here. Oh wait, no, because the matrix Ay is Hermitian? Wait, is Ay Hermitian? Let me check. The matrix Ay has elements [0, -i c; i c, 0]. The conjugate transpose would be [0, i c; -i c, 0], which is not equal to Ay, because the (2,1) element is i c, but in Ay it's i c. Wait, no, wait, let me compute.

Original matrix:
Row 1: 0, -i c
Row 2: i c, 0

The conjugate transpose would be:

Column 1: 0, i c (because the (1,2) element was -i c, its conjugate is i c)
Column 2: -i c, 0 (since (2
