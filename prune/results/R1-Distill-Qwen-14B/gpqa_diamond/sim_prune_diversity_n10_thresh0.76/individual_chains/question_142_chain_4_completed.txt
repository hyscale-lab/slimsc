Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1| ). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. So this ρ is a mixed state because it's a probabilistic mixture of |0> and |1>.

Wait, what's the geometrical position? Oh right, in the Bloch sphere representation, any single qubit state can be represented as a vector on or inside the unit sphere in three-dimensional space. For pure states, the vector lies on the surface, and for mixed states, it's inside.

The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix and σ are the Pauli matrices. The vector r determines the position on the Bloch sphere. So when we have ρ expressed in terms of r, the components of r correspond to the expectation values in the x, y, and z directions.

Let me write out the given ρ. It's (|0><0| + |1><1| ) multiplied by 1/2. Let me compute each term. |0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, multiplying by 1/2, ρ becomes (1/2)I.

But wait, the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if ρ equals (I)/2, that would mean r·σ must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 is I/2. So r must be the zero vector (0,0,0).

Wait, but let me double-check. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Their sum with r's components would be r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. If that sum is zero, then each component must be zero, so r is (0,0,0).

So the density matrix ρ is the completely mixed state. Its Bloch vector is at the origin. So the geometrical position is (0,0,0), which is option C.

Options:
A) (1,1,0) → that's somewhere on the Bloch sphere surface, but our state is mixed, so r is zero.
B) (0,0,1) → that's the north pole, which would be the pure state |0> perhaps. But our matrix is I/2, so no.
C) (0,0,0) → the completely mixed state, which fits.
D) (1,1,1) → that's way outside the sphere, but the Bloch vector can't have a magnitude greater than 1, so that's impossible.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, as it is a probabilistic combination of the pure states \(\left|0\right\rangle\) and \(\left|1\right\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector in three-dimensional space that determines the state's position on or inside the Bloch sphere. For pure states, \(\mathbf{r}\) lies on the unit sphere, while for mixed states, \(\mathbf{r}\) lies inside the sphere.

The given density matrix simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

since \(\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| = I\). Comparing this with the general form \(\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}\), it is clear that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This implies that \(\mathbf{r}\) must be the zero vector, \(\mathbf{r} = (0,0,0)\), corresponding to the completely mixed state.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \((1,1,0)\):** This corresponds to a mixed state inside the Bloch sphere, but it is not the origin.
- **B) \((0,0,1)\):** This corresponds to the pure state \(\left|0\right\rangle\), not the mixed state.
- **C) \((0,0,0)\):** This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which matches the given density matrix.
- **D) \((1,1,1)\):** This vector lies outside the Bloch sphere, which is not possible.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \((0,0,0)\).

Answer: C
