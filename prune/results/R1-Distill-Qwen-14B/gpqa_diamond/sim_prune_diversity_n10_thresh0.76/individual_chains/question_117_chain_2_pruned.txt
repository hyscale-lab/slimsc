Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can think this through.

The question gives four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D. I remember that optical isomerism arises when a molecule has chiral centers, meaning they're not superimposable on their mirror images. So, I'll need to check each compound for the presence of such centers.

Let's go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, so biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at 2,2’ and 6,6’ positions. The groups are nitro and carboxylate esters. Wait, could the biphenyl have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are symmetrical, maybe there's no chirality. Let me think. If the substituents are in positions that mirror each other, like both nitro on opposite ends, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. But wait, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it's chiral. Oh wait, the substituents are at 6,6' and 2,2'... If the substituents on each ring are the same, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Hmm, but wait, the substituents on each ring are different. One ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, and the other has the same. Wait, no, actually, the 6,6’ are both nitro, and 2,2’ are both esters. So each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate in the 2 and 6 positions. But are the substituents arranged in a way that creates a chiral center? Wait, the biphenyl's single bond can rotate, but for each ring, the substituents are symmetrical in position. So perhaps each ring is itself symmetric, making the molecule as a whole not chiral. Hmm, but wait, maybe the overall structure isn't symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry
