Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, let me see. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which I guess means their radii might be similar if they're Earth-like. They were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because according to Kepler's third law, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. So a shorter period implies a smaller orbit.

The host stars have the same radii, but the star with Planet_1 is twice as massive as the one with Planet_2. Wait, but same radius? That's interesting. More massive stars can have larger radii, but in this case, both have the same. So maybe they're main-sequence stars, with Planet_1's star being more massive, but perhaps not larger.

I need to calculate the probability of transit for each planet. The probability is given by (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (1 / (a_planet / R_star)), wait no, wait. Let me think again.

The transit probability formula I remember is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s)) ), but wait, no, perhaps it's more like (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s)), but that doesn't seem right. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the distance over which the transit can occur. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by a function of the orbital distance and the star's radius.

Wait, I think the transit probability P is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a/(a c)) where a is the semi-major axis? No, maybe I should think in terms of the formula. The transit probability for a circular orbit is given by R_p² / (R_s²
