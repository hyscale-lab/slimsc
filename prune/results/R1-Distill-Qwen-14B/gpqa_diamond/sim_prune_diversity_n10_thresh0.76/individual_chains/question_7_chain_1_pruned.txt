Okay, so I have this physics problem about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, let's see. I remember from my studies that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's all around the universe. The problem is about gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV.

Wait, what's the process here? So, when a high-energy gamma-ray meets a CMB photon, they can annihilate into an electron and a positron. But why would that limit the gamma-ray's lifetime? Oh, right, because if they annihilate, the gamma-ray is no longer present. So, the lifetime would be how long it takes for the gamma-ray to interact with a CMB photon.

I think this is related to the concept of photon-photon interactions. I recall that the cross-section for such a reaction depends on the energy of the photons involved. The cross-section (σ) is a measure of the probability of the interaction. The higher the cross-section, the more likely the interaction, and thus the shorter the mean lifetime before annihilation.

So the formula must involve the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation. I remember that the cross-section for two photons to produce an electron-positron pair is given by:

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2/(m_e^2)) * (1/(x^2 + 1))^2 * (1/(1 + (1/x)^3))

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. Oh, right, the cross-section for γγ → e+e− is often approximated using the formula:

σ ≈ (8π α²)/(3 s) * (1/(1 + (E_cm/(2E_γ))²)^2 )

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the center-of-mass energy. The process requires that the combined energy of the two photons is at least twice the electron rest mass, which is 2*m_e*c². Wait, but m_e is about 0.511 MeV, so in terms of energy, each photon would need to have enough energy in the center of mass frame.

Alternatively, the cross-section might depend on the photon energies. Let me try to think of the process. The CMB photon has a low energy, about 1e-3 eV. The gamma-ray has much higher energy, say E. The interaction rate depends on the product of their fluxes and the cross-section.

The lifetime τ of the gamma-ray is inversely proportional to the interaction rate. The interaction rate R is given by σ * n * v, where n is the number density of CMB photons, and v is the relative velocity. But since both photons are moving at the speed of light, v is approximately c.

Wait, but in the frame of the CMB, the CMB photons are isotropic and have a number density n. So the number density n would be the CMB photon density. The CMB has a temperature T, and from blackbody radiation, the number density can be found using the formula for blackbody photons.

The CMB temperature is about 2.7 K. The number density n can be calculated using the formula n = (8π g / (c^3 h^3)) * (k T)^3 * (1/(e^{h c/(k T)} - 1)) ), but for photons, g=2 (two polarizations). But maybe I don't need to calculate it exactly because perhaps it's a standard value.

Wait, I think the number density of the CMB is approximately 411 photons per cm³. Let me check: for T=2.7 K, the photon number density is about n ~ (2.7)^3 * (g) * ... Wait, maybe it's better to recall that n is about 1e8 photons per m³, which is 1e8 per m³, which is 1e4 per cm³ (since 1 m³ is 1e6 liters, and 1 cm³ is 1e-6 liters). Wait, no, wait: 1 m³ is 1e6 liters, but 1 liter is 1000 cm³, so 1 m³ is 1e6 * 1000 cm³ = 1e9 cm³. So 1e8 photons/m³ is 1e8 / 1e9 cm³ = 0.1 photons/cm³. Hmm, that's not matching what I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the photon number density. The number density of photons in the CMB is n = (a photon's energy distribution) integrated over all energies. The formula for number density is (2ζ(3)/π²) * (m_k T)^3, where m is the mass for photon, but photons are massless so m=0, but wait, no. Wait, the formula is actually n = (8π g / (c^3 h^3)) * (k_B T)^3 * ζ(3), where ζ(3) is the Riemann zeta function evaluated at 3, approximately 1.202... and g is the number of degrees of freedom, which for photons is 2 (two polarizations), but since in the CMB, each photon is counted once with g=2, but wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that the number density of CMB photons is approximately n = 1e8 photons/m³. Wait, no, that can't be
