Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta * E), right? Beta is 1/(kT), but for this problem, I just need to account for beta in the expressions.

First, I need to figure out all possible states the system can be in. Each spin has two possible states, so three spins would have 2^3 = 8 possible states. So each state is a combination of +1 and -1 for S1, S2, S3.

But wait, considering that the spins are identical in their interactions, maybe some states are equivalent. But no, for partition function, each distinct state is considered, regardless of symmetry. So all 8 states need to be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider different cases based on the number of +1 and -1 spins. But maybe a better approach is to compute the energy for each possible state.

Wait, maybe another approach: The energy E depends on the products of each pair of spins. Let's denote H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J H.

So for each possible state (each possible combination of S1, S2, S3), I can compute H, then E, then the Boltzmann factor.

But with 8 states, it's manageable. Let me list all states and compute H for each.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to classify the states based on how many pairs are aligned. Because each pair contributes to H.

Each pair (S1S2, S1S3, S2S3) can be +1 or -1. The product S_i S_j is +1 if the two spins are the same, and -1 if different.

So for each of the three pairs, we can have +1 or -1. Let's think about how many pairs are aligned (i.e., +1) for each state.

Wait, let's think about the possible values of H. Each term in
