Okay, let's try to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best to work through it step by step.

So, the problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, actually, that should probably be normalized. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as unit vectors. So I need to normalize this state first before doing anything else.

The state vector is (-1, 2, 1). To find its norm, I calculate the square of each component and add them up. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding those: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state vector ψ is:

ψ = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T

Okay, next, we have two operators, P and Q. The question asks about the probability of getting 0 when measuring P and then -1 when measuring Q after that. Wait, but no, actually, the measurements are done in sequence: first P, then Q. Or wait, no, the question says someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the measurements are P first, then Q. But the probability we're looking for is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in their respective measurements.

Wait, but when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So first measuring P will collapse the state into an eigenstate of P, and then measuring Q on that new state.

Alternatively, perhaps the measurements are done one after the other, so first P is measured, then Q. So the process is: initial state → measure P → state collapses → measure Q.

But wait, the way the problem is phrased, it's about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So I need to find the probability that when you first measure P and get 0, then you measure Q and get -1.

Alternatively, perhaps the measurements are simultaneous, but the way it's phrased suggests sequential measurements. Hmm.

Let me think. So, step 1: measure P. The possible eigenvalues of P are the possible outcomes. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Alternatively, maybe not, because I've been given the matrix for P. Let me look at operator P's matrix.

Operator P's matrix is:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, that's a 3x3 matrix.

Wait, I need to find the eigenvalues of P because when measuring P, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues. So perhaps I should diagonalize P to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Alternatively, maybe P is Hermitian, which it should be because it's an observable. So let's check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. The given matrix for P has real elements, so the conjugate transpose is the same as the transpose. Let me see if P equals its transpose.

P's transpose would have first column (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second column (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third column (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Comparing to the original P matrix, which is the same. So yes, P is Hermitian. So its eigenvalues are real.

To find the eigenvalues, I can solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me write out the matrix P - λI:

Row 1: [ -λ , 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ]

Row 3: [ 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

Now, the determinant of this matrix is:

| -λ   1/√2     0   |
|1/√2  -λ    1/√2 |
| 0    1/√2  -λ   |

I can compute this determinant. Let me expand along the first row.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 * something.

So,

= -λ [ λ^2 - (1/2) ] - (1/√2) [ (-λ)/√2 - 0 ] 

= -λ (λ² - 1/2) + (1/√2)( λ /√2 )

Simplify each term:

First term: -λ^3 + (λ)/2

Second term: (1/√2)( λ /√2 ) = (λ) / (2)

So combining:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ

So the characteristic equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² + 1 ) =0 → λ (1 - λ²) = 0 → λ = 0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, but when you measure P, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues. So the possible P measurement results are -1, 0, and 1.

We are interested in the probability of getting 0 when measuring P. So that's one part.

Once we have that, the state collapses into the corresponding eigenstate of P for the eigenvalue 0. Then, we measure Q on that new state to find the probability of getting -1.

Wait, but perhaps I should approach this in two steps.

First, find the probability of measuring P=0.

Second, given that P=0 is measured, find the probability of measuring Q=-1.

But wait, when you measure P and get 0, the state collapses to the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue
