Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova ejecta and distance traveled. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember that when dealing with different reference frames, especially moving ones, I might need to use the concept of relative velocity and maybe even some special relativity if speeds are really high. But wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so that simplifies things a bit.

The problem states that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. Interesting. So from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's a huge speed! Let me think about the units. 60,000 km/s is 60,000,000 meters per second. Wait, but the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 km/s is 0.2c. So that's a significant fraction of the speed of light, which makes me think that maybe relativistic effects could come into play. But wait, the question is about the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So I might need to consider time dilation or length contraction.

Wait, the problem says both frames are inertial, so they are moving at a constant velocity relative to each other. Now, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center, right? Because velocities reverse when you switch frames if they're moving at each other. So the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy.

But wait, in the problem, we have to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So time is moving at a different rate in each frame. So maybe I should think about time dilation. The time experienced in one frame is different from the other due to relative velocity.

Let me recall the time dilation formula. The proper time (the time in the moving frame) is related to the time in the stationary frame by the Lorentz factor gamma
