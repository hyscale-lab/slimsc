Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, particles being collided, detectors, Lorentz factors... right, this is probably a question about relativistic particles and how their speed affects their path in a detector.

So the question says that particles are collided in the center of a spherical detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The particles produced are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds reach the inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? Gamma equals 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So higher gamma means the particle is moving closer to the speed of light.

The key here is understanding why different fractions of the particles reach the walls. I remember that when particles decay, their decay products might travel a certain distance before decaying themselves. Or perhaps the particles are unstable and decay after traveling a certain proper distance. But in this case, the particles themselves are the ones traveling, and we're concerned with how far they go before they reach the detector walls.

Wait, maybe it's about the time they take to reach the walls. Since they're moving at relativistic speeds, time dilation could affect how far they go. Oh, right, length contraction! Because from the particle's frame, the distance might be contracted.

Wait, no. Let me think. The detector is at rest, so in the lab frame, the distance is 30 meters. The particle is moving at a high speed towards the wall. The time it takes to reach the wall is distance divided by speed.

But wait, the particles are produced in the center, so they have to travel 30 meters to reach the wall. But since they're moving at a relativistic speed, their speed is a significant fraction of c. Let's see, gamma is 20, so v is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) * c.

Wait, but if the particle is moving at a high speed, the time it takes to reach the wall is t = 30 meters / (gamma * beta * c) because from the lab frame, the distance is 30m, and the particle's speed is beta*c, but gamma is involved in time.

Wait no, wait. The time measured in the lab frame is the proper time, right? Or is the proper time the time experienced by the particle? So the proper time tau is the time experienced by the particle. So tau = t / gamma, where t is the lab frame time.

Wait, let me get this straight. The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall in the lab frame is t = (30 m) / (beta c). Because in the lab frame, the particle is moving at v = beta c, so distance is speed multiplied by time.

But for the particle, its own proper time (tau) would be t / gamma. Because in its frame, the time is dil
