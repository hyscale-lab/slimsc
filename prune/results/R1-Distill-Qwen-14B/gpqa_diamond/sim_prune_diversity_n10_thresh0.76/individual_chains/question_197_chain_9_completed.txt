Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these types of questions. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. Oh wait, no, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, I think. Wait, no, wait. Maybe it's the other way around. Oh right, the Bouveault-Blanc reduction uses something else, and the Clemmensen uses HCl and Zn(Hg). Wait, or maybe red phosphorus and HI is another kind of reaction. Oh wait! I think that when you have a carbonyl group and you use red phosphorus and HI, it's a way to reduce the carbonyl. Like, maybe it's a ketone or aldehyde being reduced to an alcohol? Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, in the Clemmensen reduction, the carbonyl (like aldehyde or ketone) is reduced to an alkane. But wait, that requires acid conditions and Zn(Hg). Hmm. Alternatively, I think that when you use red phosphorus and HI, it's for the reduction of esters or maybe acid chlorides. Or wait, another possibility: maybe it's for the elimination reaction, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, eliminating would be more like with strong bases. Hmm.

But wait, the reaction in question is with red phosphorus and HI, which I think is a way to reduce a carbonyl group. Let me think: For instance, esters can be reduced to alcohols using HI and red phosphorus. Alternatively, maybe it's a way to do a reduction of a carbonyl group to an alkane? Or perhaps it's more about transforming a carbonyl into a methylene group. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should first figure out what compound X is. Because without knowing that, I can't figure out the product.

The IR data: the peaks are at 3400-2500 cm^-1, which is a broad region, so maybe an -OH stretch or maybe an alkyne. But wait, OH is usually a broad peak around 3300, but 3400–2500 might be an O-H stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's an alkyne C-H stretch, which is around 3300-2500. Also, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Then 1610 and 1450 cm^-1, which could be aromatic ring (C=C) stretching. 

So, putting that together, the IR suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, acid, or amide), aromatic rings, and possibly an alkyne or OH group. Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, so more likely an ester or ketone or acid. An acid's carbonyl is usually around 1700, but acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300. Wait, the IR here says 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, so maybe that's an O-H from a carboxylic acid? So if there's a carboxylic acid group, that would explain the broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol, but the 1720 would not fit with an alcohol. Wait, but the 1720 is more likely an ester, ketone, or acid. Also, the 1610 and 1450 are probably aromatic C=C, so the compound might be an aromatic ester or aromatic ketone or acid.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but the integration is 1H. Wait, aldehyde is a triplet? No, maybe a carboxylic acid proton, which is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. So maybe this is a COOH proton. So that supports the idea of a carboxylic acid.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, probably para-substituted, as it's a doublet with 2H. So maybe two protons in a para position.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons, also doublet. So that suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions? Or perhaps one substituent with two protons each on adjacent carbons. Wait, no, the two sets of doublets suggest two substituents on the ring. Wait, wait, let me think. For example, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent being a group that deshields the protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a monosubstituted benzene where the protons are split into two doublets. Wait, in a monosubstituted benzene, the protons are typically split into a triplet or a doublet. Wait, but for a para-substituted compound, the ring protons would be two sets of doublets. Hmm.

So, perhaps the aromatic part is a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Or maybe it's a substituent that's an electron-withdrawing group, causing the adjacent protons to be deshielded. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative, with the COOH group in the para position relative to another group.

Looking at the rest of the NMR:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, perhaps a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Or maybe a CH in a ketone or ester group. Or perhaps it's a secondary alcohol or something else.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, maybe CH2 groups adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a chain.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons as a doublet? Wait, a doublet with 3H. That's probably a CH(CH3)2 group or something. Wait, no, a doublet with 3H integration is more likely a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, but 1.4 ppm is a bit higher for a simple methyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal di-substitution, but that's less likely.

Wait, wait, 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): that's a doublet with 3H. So that suggests a methyl group attached to a CH group which is split into a doublet by coupling with another CH2 or similar. Alternatively, it's a CH2CH(CH3) group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H, which is likely a methyl group at the end of a chain, like an ethyl group's terminal methyl.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a substituted benzoic acid with some substituents. Let me think: the 10.5 ppm peak is the carboxylic acid proton. Then, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that suggests a para-substituted benzene. For example, if the substituent is a group attached to the benzene ring at the para position relative to the COOH.

Wait, but the substituent would have its own protons. Let's see: the substituent would be attached to the benzene ring, and the substituent's structure would explain the other NMR signals.

So, the substituent is connected to the benzene ring. Let's think about the substituent.

Looking at the substituent's NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) and 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

Hmm, let's think about the substituent structure. The 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a methyl group at the end of a chain, such as CH2CH2CH3. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, perhaps a CH2 connected to something else. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. Wait, that's 3H and a doublet. So maybe it's a CH(CH3) group attached to something else.

Putting this together, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Wait, let's see. A sec-butyl group would have the structure CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)- but I think more accurately, it's CH(CH2CH2CH3) but wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, let me think: the substituent could be a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with branching.

Wait, let me think about the substituent's structure. Suppose the substituent is a butyl group attached to the benzene. The substituent's structure would have a chain leading from the benzene ring, perhaps as a side chain.

Looking at the NMR:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group attached to another CH2. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is another methyl group at the end of a chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached in such a way that the chain is something like CH2CH(CH2CH3). But let's try to draw this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but I don't think that's the case. Let's see. Let me think about the substituent as a branch: perhaps something like CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. But wait, no, that would give more protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the substituent as a butyl group with a branching point. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's a pentyl group. Hmm.

Wait, the substituent could be a secondary butyl group, like -CH(CH2CH2CH3), but that's a tertiary butyl group? No, wait, the substituent would be attached to the ring as a substituent, perhaps as a secondary carbon. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituent: the NMR signals suggest a chain where there's a CH group (2.9 ppm, 1H), then a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, 2H), then a CH3 group (1.4 ppm, 3H as a doublet), and another CH3 (0.9 ppm, 3H as triplet). Wait, that might fit a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, perhaps it's a propyl group where one of the CH2 is next to a branch.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Like, it's a isobutyl group. Let me think: isobutyl is (CH2)2CHCH3. Wait, no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Hmm, no, wait, the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, no. The structure of an isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- but I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, the isobutyl group is actually -(CH2)CH(CH3)2, but that's not quite right. Wait, no, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, I think the isobutyl group is -(CH2)2CH(CH3), but that's the butyl group in a certain configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but that seems complicated.

Wait, another thought. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH that's next to another CH2. So, perhaps it's a structure like CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-something. But then the 0.9 ppm triplet would be the end CH3 of a CH2CH2CH3 chain. Let me try to sketch this:

- The substituent is attached to the benzene ring as a group: perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with branching. Let me think about the substituent as -(CH2)CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, but that would make it a pentyl group. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show that many protons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the ring. So, the substituent is a secondary carbon attached to the ring, with a chain leading to a CH2CH2CH3 group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon. Let me think: the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). So, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the ring. That would make the substituent a secondary butyl group. Wait, but wait, the substituent would then be a pentyl group if it's longer than four carbons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituent as a propyl group with a branch. So, the substituent is a propyl group where the middle carbon is attached to a methyl group. So, it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)-. But then the substituent would be a secondary propyl group, which is actually an isobutyl group. Wait, because the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, no. The isobutyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. So, if the substituent is an isobutyl group, then the substituent has a structure where it's attached to the benzene via a CH2 group, then a CH(CH3)2. Wait, but that would make the substituent a tertiary butyl group if it's CH(CH3)2 attached to the benzene. So, maybe the substituent is a tertiary butyl group, but in that case, the NMR would show different signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but that's getting complicated. Let me think again.

Looking at the NMR signals again:

- 10.5 ppm: the carboxylic acid proton (maybe).
- 8.0 and 7.2 ppm: aromatic protons, para-substituted.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH group attached to an electronegative group.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to that CH.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl group.

Putting this together, the substituent on the benzene ring would be a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that gives a butyl group. Wait, but that would be a pentyl substituent, but maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, that would make the substituent a secondary butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent is a propyl group attached to a CH group, which is attached to the benzene ring. So, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Hmm, but that's a pentyl group, and the NMR doesn't seem to have that many protons.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group where one of the CH2's is next to a CH(CH3) group. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-CH3. No, that's still a butyl group, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. Hmm, maybe that's the case. So, the substituent is a secondary butyl group attached to the ring.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the substituent as a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, that can't be because the substituent is attached to the ring, so it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, another approach: looking at the integration of the NMR signals, the substituent seems to have 1+2+3+3=9H? No, the substituent's signals are 1H (2.9), 2H (1.7), 3H (1.4), and 3H (0.9), totaling 9H. But that seems too much for a substituent. Wait, but that's only for the substituent's H. Wait, the substituent is part of the molecule, so perhaps it's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group: the substituent would have -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that would give more protons than in the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps it's a four-carbon chain with branching.

Wait, another thought: the substituent could be a propyl group where the middle carbon is attached to a methyl group. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. But that would be a tertiary butyl group.

Wait, let's think about the substituent's structure: the 1.4 ppm is a doublet of 3H, which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm is a triplet of 3H, which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2. So perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group? No, that's a tertiary butyl group. But that would have a methyl group attached to a CH2, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which would be from the CH2CH2CH3 group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent is attached to the benzene as a CH group, which is connected to a CH2CH2CH3. So, the substituent would be a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So, it's a secondary butyl group. Let me think about that. Then, the substituent would have the structure: benzene ring connected to CH2, which is connected to CH(CH2CH3). So, the substituent would be a tertiary butyl group. Wait, no, because the CH(CH2CH3) would have three substituents: the CH2 from the ring, and two CH2CH3 groups. No, that's not possible because CH can have only four bonds. So, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group, but that's getting complicated.

Hmm, maybe I should try to look at the options provided and see if any fit the data.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, but the question is about the product after the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. So, I should first figure out what X is before the reaction, then apply the reaction to get the product.

Wait, but perhaps identifying X is the first step. Let's look at the options as possible structures for X.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So, the benzene has a COOH group at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4? Wait, wait, in benzene, positions 2 and 4 would be adjacent. Wait no, the numbering may vary. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta-substituted benzene.

But wait, the NMR shows two doublets of 2H each, which suggests para substitution. So the substituents are in para positions. So, the COOH would be in one position, and another group in the para position.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the benzene has a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4 (para). That would explain the NMR.

Wait, for option C, the structure would be benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position. Let's think about the NMR of that.

The benzoic acid's COOH proton would be around 10 ppm, which matches the 10.5 ppm signal.

The aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets because of the substituents in the para positions. So, for example, the two protons ortho to the COOH would be deshielded and appear as one doublet at 8.0 ppm, and the two protons ortho to the sec-butyl group would appear as another doublet at 7.2 ppm. That matches the NMR.

Now, looking at the substituent (sec-butyl group) attached to the benzene: the structure is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, that's a tertiary butyl group. The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, actually, the sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH2CH3). No, wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's clarify: the butyl group can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. A sec-butyl group is a four-carbon chain where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, actually, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as -CH(CH2CH2CH3). Hmm. I think I'm getting a bit stuck on the substituent structure.

But regardless, let's think about the NMR of option C, which is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. So, the substituent would have:

- The CH2 group attached to the ring (let's call it CH2-).
- Then a CH group attached to that CH2, which is connected to a CH2CH3 group.

So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a secondary butyl group. The NMR signals would then include:

- The CH2 group attached to the ring: perhaps as a triplet or something else.
- The CH group: which might show up as a triplet or a multiplet.
- The CH2CH3 group: which would be a triplet at around 1.4 ppm or something.

Wait, but in the given NMR data, there's a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could correspond to the CH group in the substituent. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be the methyl from the substituent, but wait, no, the substituent's CH2CH3 group would be a triplet around 1.4 ppm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is more like -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- or not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branching, leading to the NMR signals we're seeing.

But perhaps I can think about the substituent's NMR signals:

Looking at the substituent's protons:

- The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): this would be the CH group in the substituent, attached to two CH2 groups and a methyl group.
- The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps the two CH2 groups adjacent to the CH and the ring.
- The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): the methyl group attached to the CH.
- The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): the terminal methyl group of the substituent's chain.

Wait, that would suggest a substituent where the CH is connected to a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, the substituent would be -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene ring. But that would be a pentyl group with a branch, which might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group where the middle CH is attached to a methyl group. So, substituent would be -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- attached to the ring. But that would give more protons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. So, the substituent is attached to the ring as a CH2 group, then a CH(CH3), then a CH2 group leading to a CH3.

But in that case, the NMR would show the CH(CH3) as the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), the adjacent CH2 as 1.7 ppm (2H), and the terminal CH2CH3 as 0.9 ppm (3H). But where is the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)? That's confusing. Because the CH3 on the CH(CH3) would be split by the adjacent CH2, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH2CH3). Hmm, but that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, but that's a tertiary butyl group.

Wait, another thought: the substituent's NMR shows a 1.4 ppm doublet (3H). That suggests a methyl group attached to a CH that is split by a neighboring CH2. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group? No, that would be a pentyl substituent. But then the NMR would have more signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Hmm, but that's a pentyl group again.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, which would give the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) as the CH, and the 1.7 ppm as the adjacent CH2, and the 1.4 as the CH3 attached to the CH, but I'm not confident.

Well, perhaps I should try to match the substituent's NMR to a possible structure.

The substituent's NMR has:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): likely a CH group adjacent to a CH2.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): a CH2 group adjacent to the CH.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to the CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl group.

So, the substituent would be a chain like CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's a butyl group with a branch. Let's see: the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, no, that would have more than four carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH2CH3), but that's a five-carbon substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. Wait, but that would be a tertiary butyl group, which would have a CH(CH3)2 attached to the ring. Then, the NMR would show the CH as a triplet, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring. So, the substituent would be a secondary butyl group.

Wait, let me think about the substituent as a butyl group. So, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. Hmm, but that's a four-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituent as a propyl group attached via a CH group, which has a methyl branch. So, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring. So, the substituent is a isoamyl group? No, isoamyl is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the NMR again. The substituent's signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): probably a CH group adjacent to a CH2.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two protons in a CH2, adjacent to the CH.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to the CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a methyl group at the end of a CH2.

So, the substituent's structure is:

CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3

But that would be a pentyl group, but then the substituent would have more protons than accounted for.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the ring. So, that's a four-carbon substituent with a branch on the second carbon.

In that case, the substituent would have the structure:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

But that's a pentyl group, which would have more signals than we see. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the ring. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Hmm, but that's a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group attached to the ring. So, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-CH3. That's a pentyl group, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the ring, making the substituent a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

But then, the substituent's CH2 groups would show up at 2.9, 1.7, and 0.9 ppm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group attached to the ring, making the structure -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- attached to the ring. Then, the substituent would have a CH (2.9 ppm), a CH2 (1.7), and the terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm), with the CH(CH3) group giving the 1.4 ppm doublet.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the substituent would be a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group attached to the benzene ring. So, the substituent is a pentyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

Wait, but the substituent's NMR shows a 1.4 ppm doublet (3H), which would correspond to the methyl group attached to the CH. Then, the CH is at 2.9 ppm. The CH2 group next to it is at 1.7 ppm, and the terminal CH3 is at 0.9 ppm.

So, the substituent's structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, no, that would be a six-carbon substituent. I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2-CH2- group attached to the ring, but that's a four-carbon substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the ring. Then, the substituent would be a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon.

In that case, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring. So, the substituent is a tertiary butyl group? No, because the substituent would have three substituents on the central carbon.

Wait, if the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring, then the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-

But that's a four-carbon substituent, and the 0.9 ppm triplet would be the terminal CH3 of the CH2CH2CH3 group? Hmm, no. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3, which would make it a pentyl group. But then the NMR would have more signals.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group at the para position to the COOH.

The structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, the correct structure is -CH(CH2CH2CH3). Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring. So, the substituent is a secondary butyl group.

In that structure, the substituent would have:

- The CH2 group attached to the ring (let's say at position 4) would have a CH2 group connected to a CH(CH3) group, which is connected to a CH2CH3 group.

So, the substituent's structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

Wait, but that's a pentyl group. Hmm.

But perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-, which is a butyl group. So, the substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-

But that leaves the last CH2 with nothing attached, which doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. That would be a tertiary butyl group. So, the substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)2

In that case, the substituent's NMR would show:

- The CH2 attached to the ring would be a triplet or something else.
- The CH(CH3)2 would have a singlet or a multiplet.

But the given NMR doesn't show a singlet, so this might not fit.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Let me think about the reaction now. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which I think is a way to reduce the carbonyl group to a methylene group.

Wait, wait, when you have a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid) and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it's a reaction to reduce the carbonyl to a methylene group. So, for example, an ester would be reduced to an alcohol, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydroxy group that gets reduced to a CH2 group.

Wait, no, I think that reaction with red phosphorus and HI is used for the reduction of ketones to alkanes. For example, a ketone would be reduced to a methylene group, turning R-CO-R' into R-CH2-R'.

Wait, or perhaps it's for the reduction of acid derivatives. For example, an ester (R-O-CO-R') would be reduced to R-O-CH2-R' when treated with HI and red phosphorus. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: I think that when you treat an ester with HI and red phosphorus, it leads to the formation of an alkane. For example, an ester RCOOR' would be reduced to RCH2OR', but I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis or elimination, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, but considering the reaction of X (which has a carbonyl group, as indicated by the IR at 1720 cm^-1) with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a reduction. So, the carbonyl group would be converted into a methylene group (-CH2-).

So, if X is a benzoic acid (with a COOH group), then the reaction would reduce the COOH to a CH2OH group? Or perhaps to a CH3 group? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group (like in an ester) to an alcohol. But without knowing the exact structure of X, it's hard to determine.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the options and see which product makes sense based on the reaction.

The options for the product are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, but after the reaction, the product would have a different functional group. So, if X is a benzoic acid (option C), then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the COOH group. But how?

Wait, the reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI might not proceed as I thought. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the ester group if X is an ester.

Wait, in the IR data, the 1720 cm^-1 suggests an ester or possibly a ketone. But the NMR has a broad peak around 10.5 ppm, which would fit a carboxylic acid's O-H proton, so perhaps X is a benzoic acid derivative.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and it's treated with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction reduces the COOH group to a CH2 group. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol? Or maybe 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH3 group instead of COOH.

Wait, no, the reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus... I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of an ester group in X to an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, which upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI would be reduced to an alcohol. But without knowing X's structure, it's hard to say.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me look for the answer based on the options and the reaction.

If X is a benzoic acid (option C), then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, which is a reducing agent, the COOH group would be reduced. But how? Wait, I think the reduction of a carboxylic acid with such reagents would not typically occur because carboxylic acids are relatively stable towards such reductions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of an ester group present in X.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction reduces the ester to a methylene group.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 10.5 ppm peak suggests a COOH group. So, maybe X is a benzoic acid, and the reaction does something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a ketone. If X has a ketone group, then red phosphorus and HI would reduce it to a secondary alcohol. But the IR data doesn't show a strong peak for a ketone; the 1720 cm^-1 is more indicative of an ester or acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of an ester. If X is an ester, then the ester group (RCOOR') would be reduced to RCH2OR' or perhaps to RCH2R'.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure of X, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each option and see what the reaction would produce.

Assume X is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, it's a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position.

If X undergoes reaction with red phosphorus and HI, which is a reducing agent, perhaps the COOH group is reduced. But how?

The reduction of a COOH group typically requires more vigorous conditions. For example, using LiAlH4 would reduce a carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol. But in this case, the reagents are red phosphorus and HI, which I'm not certain about.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is the reduction of the benzene ring's substituent. But that doesn't make much sense because the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is an alkyl chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the COOH group and the formation of a CH2 group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, but that usually requires heat and may not involve red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each option and see which one's reaction makes sense.

If X is option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), and the reaction converts the COOH group into a CH2 group, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, but that's not an option either.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl and a methyl group in the para positions. But I'm not sure how that would form from X.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of an ester group present in X to a CH2 group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of an alkane from a carbonyl group. So, if X has a carbonyl group (like a ketone), the product would have a CH2 group in its place.

But again, without knowing X's structure, it's challenging.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reactivity. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of acid chlorides to alkanes. For example, RCOCl + HI, P → RCH2I. Or perhaps it's the reduction of esters.

Wait, but if X is an ester, say RCOOR', then upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it would be reduced to RCH2OR', but that's not a typical reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's the reduction of the ester to an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, but the question specifies red phosphorus and HI, which suggests a reduction.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of an ester to a primary alcohol. For example, RCOOR' → RCH2OH + R'OH.

But again, without knowing X's structure, it's hard to be precise.

Well, perhaps I should look back at the NMR data to better determine X's structure.

The 1H NMR of X shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): likely a carboxylic acid proton.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): para-substituted aromatic protons.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): adjacent CH2 group.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): methyl group attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal methyl.

So, X is likely a benzoic acid with a substituent that has a chain leading to a terminal methyl group.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group at the para position.

The substituent's structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-

Wait, but that would make the substituent a butyl group, and the NMR would show the CH2 groups and the CH group.

So, in the substituent, the CH2 attached to the ring (Ph-CH2-) would be adjacent to a CH(CH3) group (from the sec-butyl), and then another CH2 group leading to a CH3.

So, the substituent's NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the ring as a triplet (if next to a CH group).
- The CH(CH3) as a multiplet.
- The terminal CH2CH3 as a triplet.

Wait, but in the given NMR, the substituent's protons are at 2.9 ppm (1H), 1.7 ppm (2H), 1.4 ppm (3H), and 0.9 ppm (3H). That suggests a substituent where the CH is attached to a CH2 group and a methyl group, and a CH2 group leading to a terminal methyl.

So, the substituent would be a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group attached to the ring. So, the substituent is a butyl group where the middle CH is attached to a methyl group. So, the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group, making it a pentyl substituent, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2- group, making it a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the ring.

In that case, the substituent would have:

- The CH2 attached to the ring (Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3), but that's a pentyl group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let me think about the reaction again.

If X is option C, and the reaction reduces the COOH group to a CH2 group, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol. But looking at the options, none of them match that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the COOH group but another part.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction reduces the ester to a CH2 group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol. But in that case, X would have a ketone group, which the IR would show a peak around 1720 cm^-1. The NMR would then have a CH2 group near the oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the options and the reaction details. Let's consider each option and the product.

If X is option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), and the reaction reduces the COOH group to a CH2 group, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group where the COOH was. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would have a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in para positions. How would that form from X?

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction reduces the COOH group to a CH3 group (which would be a decarboxylation followed by reduction?), then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, but that's not option D. Option D has a methyl group in the para position, but it's 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which would imply that the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, but benzene doesn't have a position 1 and 4 if it's para; they're the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't affecting the COOH group but another part of the molecule. For example, if X is an ester, then the reaction reduces the ester group to a CH2 group.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C, because the IR and NMR data fit benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group, and the reaction doesn't change the structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the reaction must change the structure. So perhaps the reaction reduces the COOH group to a CH2 group, making a benzyl alcohol derivative. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the reaction would have removed the COOH group and added a methyl group. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of an ester group in X to a CH2 group, leading to option D.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Based on the NMR data, X is likely 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the COOH group to a CH2 group, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, but that's unclear.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the ester group in X to an alcohol, but I don't see any ester signals in the NMR. The IR has a 1720 cm-1 peak, which could be an ester. So, if X is an ester, then the reaction would reduce it to an alcohol. But looking at the options, option D is a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction reduces it to a primary alcohol, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to go with my initial thought that X is option C, and the reaction reduces the COOH group to a CH2 group, but since that's not an option, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect X's structure, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recap.

The IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more characteristic of an ester than a carboxylic acid, which typically have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm-1. Wait, but the IR data includes 3400–2500 cm-1, which could be O-H for a carboxylic acid. So, perhaps X is a benzoic acid with an ester group? No, that would be a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester with a benzene ring and a substituent. But then the 10.5 ppm peak would be from an aldehyde, but that's less likely.

Wait, perhaps the 1720 cm-1 is from an ester, and the 3400-2500 is from an O-H group. So, X is an ester with a hydroxyl group, perhaps as a hemiacetal or something else. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a methyl benzoate, but that wouldn't have a 10.5 ppm peak.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction doesn't change the structure, which isn't possible, so I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the ester to a primary alcohol, but I'm not seeing that in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the reagents. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of esters to alkanes. So, if X is an ester, the product would be an alkane.

Looking at option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. The structure would have a phenyl group with an ethyl substituent and a propanoic acid group. But how would that form from an ester reduction?

Wait, perhaps if X is the ester, then the product would be an alcohol.

But I'm not making progress, so I'll have to make a guess.

Based on the NMR and IR data, I think X is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the COOH group. But I'm not sure how. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the COOH group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the reduction of an ester group to an alcohol. So, if X is an ester like phenyl benzoate, the reaction would produce phenyl methanol. But again, I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with option C as the structure of X, and the reaction reduces the COOH group to a CH2 group, but since none of the options match, perhaps the correct product is not listed. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the COOH group, which would mean X is option C and the product is the same, but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the ester group in X to a CH2 group, leading to option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. But I'm not certain.

I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option C, and the reaction doesn't change the structure, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the COOH group into a CH3 group, leading to option D. So, I'll go with option C as X, and the product being option D.


The question involves identifying compound X based on its IR and NMR data and determining the final product when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR data shows a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, aromatic C=C stretching at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹, and a broad signal in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range, likely corresponding to an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid. The NMR data includes a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton, and two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring. The remaining signals (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm) suggest a substituent with a CH group, CH₂ groups, and terminal methyl groups.

From the analysis, X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (option C), as it fits the IR and NMR data. The substituent on the benzene ring is a sec-butyl group at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.

The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is a reduction. Typically, this reagent combination reduces carbonyl groups to methylene groups. In this case, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). This transformation results in the product **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** (option D), where the carboxylic acid is replaced by a methyl group, and the sec-butyl group remains in the para position.

Critical analysis of the options:
- **Option A**: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid does not match the IR and NMR data, as it lacks the correct substitution pattern and functional groups.
- **Option B**: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene does not fit the data, as it lacks a carboxylic acid group and the correct substitution pattern.
- **Option C**: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid matches the IR and NMR data and is consistent with the structure of X.
- **Option D**: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene is the product formed after the reduction of X, as the carboxylic acid group is converted to a methyl group.

Thus, the final product of the reaction is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

Answer: D
