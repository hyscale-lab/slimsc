Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step. 

The question says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We're asked about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I need to figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Dilution uses the formula M1V1 = M2V2. So the initial volume is 20 cm³, concentration 0.05 M. Adding another 20 cm³ of water makes the total volume 40 cm³.

Calculating M2: M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Wait, wait, wait, no. Wait, no, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L is 0.001 moles. Then, after adding 20 cm³ (another 0.02 L), the volume is 0.04 L. So concentrations are moles divided by volume. 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's right. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume at equivalence point can be calculated. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

The moles of acetic acid initially is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed is same as moles of acetic acid, 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume V = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

So for 25% titration, let's find the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the reaction is 1:1, that means 0.00025 mol of acetic acid has been neutralized, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate ion.

So the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. After adding 2.5 cm³ NaOH, moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume at this point is initial solution (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Wait, since this is a buffer solution, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) ) which is around 4.74 (since 1e-5 is 5, and 1.85 is a bit more, so maybe 4.74).

So pH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647 )

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.74 - 0.477 ≈ 4.263. Hmm, which is approximately 4.26. That would match option A or D. Looking at options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52, option D says 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, maybe I should do exact calculations.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. But since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, in water it will hydrolyze to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

The concentration of acetate at equivalence point is moles divided by total volume. Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol. Total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.
