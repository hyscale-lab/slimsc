Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm, let's read through it again.

We have 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy from motion or anything like that. 

The setup is this: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. So the 13th is stationary, and the others are all 2 meters away from it. 

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula. The energy U between two charges is U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But wait, the system has multiple charges, so I need to consider all the pairwise interactions. Since all the 12 charges are identical and located at the same distance from the 13th, I can calculate each of their contributions and then sum them up. 

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy. Is the system already in a state where the charges are as far apart as possible, so their potential energy is minimized? Or do we need to arrange them in a way that minimizes the total potential energy?

Hmm, I think in this case, the 12 charges are constrained to be at 2 meters from point P. So their positions are fixed relative to the 13th charge. Therefore, I don't need to consider their arrangement relative to each other because they're all at the same distance. So the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the 13th, plus the potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges themselves. Oh, right, because each of the 12 is interacting with the others as well.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but what about their distance from each other? Are they all at the same point 2m away from P,
