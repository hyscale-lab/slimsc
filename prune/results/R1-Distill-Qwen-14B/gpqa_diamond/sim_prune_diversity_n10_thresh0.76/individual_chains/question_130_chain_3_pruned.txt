Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting neutral hydrogen clouds using quasars. Hmm, let me think. I remember that neutral hydrogen emits or absorbs light at a specific wavelength. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha line is around 1216 Angstroms. Wait, that's in the ultraviolet range, right?

The question says these clouds absorb light from background quasars. So when the quasar's light passes through the hydrogen, it gets absorbed at 1216 Angstroms. But wait, ground-based optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the atmosphere absorbs it. So the observed wavelength must be in the optical range when it reaches us.

Redshift comes into play here. The formula I remember is z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength. But since the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen, the absorption line we see is redshifted. So the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha is 1216 Angstroms, which is in UV. But for us to observe it in optical, the observed wavelength must be longer than what the atmosphere allows for UV.

What's the cutoff? I think the atmospheric transmission for optical is about 3000 Angstroms and above. So the observed wavelength has to be at least around 3000 Angstroms. Wait, but 3000 Angstroms is 300 nm, which is near ultraviolet, but maybe ground-based telescopes can observe up to that? Or wait, optical telescopes generally can't see below about 3
