Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question says that a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other to produce two A+ and two A- particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D with various fractions of the speed of light.

Wait, I remember that in annihilation processes, particles and their antiparticles convert into other particles. So, in this case, a proton and antiproton are annihilating. The products are four particles, two of each charge. So I guess each A+ and A- has some mass.

But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, that's an important clue. If it's moving slowly, maybe we can use non-relativistic approximations. Or perhaps not, but let's think about the conservation laws here.

Conservation of energy and momentum must apply here. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial momentum isn't too high, but I'm not sure yet. Let's break it down.

First, what are the rest masses involved? The proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². The antiproton has the same mass, so each is 938 MeV/c². So the total rest mass before annihilation is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV.

Wait
