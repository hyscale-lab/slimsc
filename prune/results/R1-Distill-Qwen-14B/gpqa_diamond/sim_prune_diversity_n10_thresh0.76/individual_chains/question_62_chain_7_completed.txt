Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents needed to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the target molecule: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a mouthful. Let me visualize its structure. So, the molecule has a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it is another cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde). Wait, the numbering is 1, so the substituents are on the same carbon? No, wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The formula might have a cyclohexane ring where one carbon is attached to a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a carbonyl (aldehyde) group.

Wait, perhaps it's more like: the main chain is cyclohexane, and at position 1, there's a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which in turn is attached to a CH2CHO (carbaldehyde) group. Oh, wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons is connected to three groups: a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and a formyl group (CHO). Wait, that doesn't seem possible because one carbon can't have three substituents unless it's a bridge or something. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me focus on the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond) attached, so it's something like cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached.

The goal is to convert ethynylcyclohexane into this more complex molecule. So, I need to figure out the steps to add the necessary groups. Let's think about the reactions.

First, ethynylcyclohexane is an alkyne. So, maybe the first step is to perform a substitution or addition to the triple bond. One common reaction for terminal alkynes is the use of a strong base like NaNH2. This could deprotonate the alkyne, making it a strong nucleophile. Wait, but methyl chloride is a methylating agent. Oh, so if we have NaNH2 and methyl chloride, perhaps this is an alkylation step. So, the triple bond would react with methyl chloride in the presence of a base. But wait, NaNH2 is a strong base; maybe it's used to deprotonate, then the methyl chloride would methylate the adjacent carbon.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has the structure cyclohexane-C≡CH. Treating this with NaNH2 would deprotonate the terminal hydrogen (since it's acidic in terminal alkynes), giving a cyclohexynide ion (cyclohexane-C≡C⁻). Then, adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would perform an alkylation: the methyl group would attack the triple bond, adding a methyl to the sp-hybridized carbon. So, the product would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that's just propargylcyclohexane. Hmm, does that make sense?

Wait, or perhaps the reaction is using a different approach. Maybe the NaNH2 is used for elimination, but in this case, the starting material is already an alkyne. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard-like reaction. Wait, no, NaNH2 and CH3Cl would be more like a deprotonation followed by alkylation. So, the product would be a longer alkyne. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to convert the ethynyl group into an alkyne with a leaving group. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne. Using NaNH2 (a strong base) would deprotonate it, making a strong base that could then react with an alkyl halide. So, the reaction would add a methyl group to the triple bond, giving cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3? Or maybe it's an alkylation using methyl chloride, leading to an alkyne with a methyl group added. So, that would be the first step: adding a methyl to the ethynyl group, making it propargylcyclohexane.

But wait, the options have different reagents. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Wait, that seems like multiple steps.

Option B: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li, liq NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH.

Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li, liq NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Hmm, so the question is, what's the correct sequence of reactions to get the target molecule.

Let me outline what needs to happen.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring, a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and a formyl group (CHO) all attached. Wait, no, maybe the structure is such that the cyclohexane has a substituent which is a cyclohexyl group connected to a CH(OH)CH2CHO group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH2 group, which is further connected to a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and a formyl group. Wait, that's three substituents on a single carbon, which is possible if it's a cyclohexane substituent with a branch.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon is connected to a CH2 group. That CH2 group is connected to three things: a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and a formyl group. So, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-C(OH)(Cyclohexyl)(CHO). Or maybe it's cyclohexane-CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO? I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a side chain that includes a cyclohexyl, hydroxymethyl, and aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the target is made by first adding a methyl group to the ethynylcyclohexane, then hydrogenating the triple bond, then oxidizing to form a carbonyl group. But I'm not exactly sure.

Let me think about the possible reactions. The first step in all options is NaNH2 and some chloride. So, for the first step, maybe adding a methyl group to the triple bond.

So, step 1: ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and CH3Cl. This would add a methyl group to the triple bond, giving prop-1-ynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3). But wait, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Adding a methyl would give cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Then step 2: H2/Pd. That would hydrogenate the triple bond. Hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd would typically add two H2 molecules across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond, so prop-1-ynyl becomes propane. So, cyclohexane-CH2CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait, the structure would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond to a single bond would make it a single bond; the molecule would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no, because the triple bond is between two carbons. So, cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? That doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps the product is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again: hydrogenation of an alkyne (C≡C) to a single bond (C-C) would require two moles of H2. So, for propargylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3), hydrogenation would give cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's just a longer chain. But that's not matching the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding the methyl group, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a trans or cis alkene, depending on the catalyst. But in the options, the second step for option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is a hydrogenation catalyst. So, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene.

Wait, but hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd usually adds two H2's to make a single bond, but under certain conditions, like Lindlar catalyst, it can hydrogenate to cis alkenes. Alternatively, maybe they're using a different catalyst here. Wait, in option C, it's H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate, which I think is a standard catalyst for hydrogenation, possibly leading to full hydrogenation to a single bond.

Wait, but then step 3 in option C is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. So, if after the second step, we have an alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. But wait, I'm getting a bit lost. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps are to add a methyl group to the ethynyl, then hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond, then perform some dihydroxylation or epoxidation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule involves a cyclohexyl group attached via an oxygen, but no, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the substituent is a cyclohexyl, a hydroxymethyl, and a carbonyl group on the same carbon of the cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2 group attached to the cyclohexane, and that CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group, and the same CH2 is connected to a carbonyl group. Hmm, maybe the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and that's further connected to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a methyl group to the ethyne, then hydrogenating the triple bond, then introducing an epoxide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule is formed via a series of reactions that include adding substituents, hydrogenation, oxidation, and elimination.

Let me think about the steps in each option.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → methylate the triple bond to make propargylcyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond, making a longer chain: maybe cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps a Birch reduction or some kind of elimination? Or maybe Ba(OH)2 is for epoxide opening or for elimination reactions. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols or elimination.

Wait, the target has a hydroxymethyl group and a formyl group. So perhaps after hydrogenation, there's a need to form a diol or something, but I'm not sure. The next reagent in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like oxidation conditions, perhaps Jones oxidation, which oxidizes alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids. So, maybe after hydrogenation, we have an alcohol which is then oxidized.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how this would lead to the target.

Option B:

1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → this would add an ethyl group to the triple bond, making a longer alkyne.

2. Li, liq NH3 → that's a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation or elimination. Alternatively, it's used in the formation of Grignard reagents, but that's usually with Mg. Li in NH3 is used for deprotonating or for elimination reactions, like the formation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation.

3. O3, H2O → ozonolysis to break double bonds into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → work up for ozonolysis, perhaps to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure how this would form the target.

Option C:

1. Same as option A: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → add a methyl to the triple bond.

2. H2, Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, making a longer chain.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes, but if the product after step 2 is a single bond, maybe it's not applicable. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different. Wait, wait, (CH3)2S is a reductant used in the workup after ozonolysis. So, maybe the product from step 2 is an alkene, which is then ozonolyzed.

Wait, but step 2 in option C is hydrogenation using H2 and Pd. That would typically fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. Unless they hydrogenate only partially to an alkene, but I'm not sure. Pd is usually a catalyst for full hydrogenation. So, if step 2 gives a single bond, then step 3's ozonolysis wouldn't do anything because there's no double bond.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction sequence is different.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps a deprotonation followed by methylation, but methanol is a poor methylating agent. Maybe this is a way to form a Grignard-like compound, but more likely, it's a way to form an alkyne with a hydroxymethyl group. Wait, methanol has a hydroxyl group; if we deprotonate the alkyne (making it a strong base), then use methanol as an electrophile, perhaps we would get a substitution where the alkyne's terminal carbon bonds to the methanol's oxygen. But that would give an ether linkage? Or perhaps a geminal diol after hydrolysis. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to make a cyclohexyne methyl ether or something, but I'm not sure how that would lead to the target.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the target molecule again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a CH2 group that is attached to a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and a formyl group.

Wait, that substituent would have the structure CH2-C(OH)(Cyclohexyl)(CHO). Wait, that's not possible because a carbon can't have four bonds. Oh, wait, maybe it's a branch where the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CH2CHO group. No, that doesn't seem right either.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to the cyclohexane, and that CH2 is further attached to a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and a formyl group. But that would require four bonds on the CH2 carbon, which isn't possible. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2CHO group. So, the substituent would be -CH(OH)(CH2CHO)cyclohexyl. Hmm, that might make sense. So, the main ring is cyclohexane, and one of its carbons is attached to a CH group, which has a cyclohexyl, a hydroxyl, and a CH2CHO group.

Wait, but how to get that from ethynylcyclohexane?

Hmm, perhaps the steps involve:

1. Add a methyl group to the triple bond, making propargylcyclohexane.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to help form the substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to an alkene, and then that alkene is used in some cyclopropanation or other reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into an epoxide or something else.

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed. Let's think about the target molecule: it has a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl, and a formyl group attached to the main cyclohexane. So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding these groups one by one.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, perhaps step 1 adds a methyl group to the triple bond (using NaNH2 and CH3Cl), making propargylcyclohexane.

Then, step 2 could hydrogenate the propargyl group. If we hydrogenate it with H2 and a catalyst that stops at the alkene stage (like Lindlar), we'd get a cis-alkene. Alternatively, with a different catalyst, it could hydrogenate all the way to a single bond.

Wait, but in the options, the second step varies. For example, option C's second step is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which I think would hydrogenate the triple bond all the way to a single bond.

But then, after that, the molecule would have a longer chain. But perhaps after that, we need to form a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps after the first two steps, the molecule is cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3. But that doesn't seem to help with introducing the substituents needed.

Alternative approach: Maybe the target can be formed via a cyclopropane ring-opening or some conjugate addition.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group. Ozonolysis of an alkyne could produce something else. Or perhaps the alkyne is used to form a carbonyl via some oxidation.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is first converted into a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule's substituent has a formyl group, so perhaps one of the steps involves oxidation to form a carbonyl group.

Let me think about each option's steps.

Option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2, CH3Cl → add methyl to triple bond, making propargylcyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd-c → hydrogenate triple to single bond, making cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But if the product from step 2 is a single bond, then ozonolysis won't act. Hmm, that seems confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond in step 2. Wait, but H2 and Pd usually hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. But maybe in some cases, it can stop at the alkene. I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps step 2 in option C is a partial hydrogenation, stopping at the alkene. So, if the triple bond becomes a double bond, then step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, for example, if after step 2, we have a cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2-CH3 group, but if step 2 only hydrogenates the triple bond to a double bond, then step 3 would cleave that.

Wait, but if the triple bond is CH2-C≡C-CH3, then partial hydrogenation would give CH2-C=CH2, but that's a less likely scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the propargyl group becomes a CH2-CH2-CH3 group after hydrogenation, so no double bond. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which after step 1 becomes propargylcyclohexane. Step 2, with H2 and Pd, hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, giving cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then step 3, O3 would not act because there's no double bond. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe step 2 is a different reaction. Let's think about the reagents.

In option C, step 2 is H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate is often used as a support for catalysts, but maybe it's just the catalyst. So, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, making a longer chain. Then, perhaps step 3, ozonolysis is not applicable as there's no double bond, so that's confusing.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in thinking that the first step is alkylation. Maybe the first step is a substitution. Wait, NaNH2 and methyl chloride: in some cases, NaNH2 can deprotonate a terminal alkyne to form an acetylide ion, which can then react with an alkyl halide in an alkylation. So, the triple bond becomes longer.

So, step 1: ethynylcyclohexane + NaNH2 + CH3Cl → propargylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3).

Then, step 2 in option C is H2/Pd. So, hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, giving cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that doesn't seem to help with introducing the necessary substituents. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule is formed via an oxidation after hydrogenation. Let me think: after step 2, we have a longer chain. Then, step 3 in option C is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. But if the product of step 2 is a single bond, then ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So, perhaps step 2 doesn't fully hydrogenate the triple bond but only adds one H2, turning it into a trans double bond.

Wait, if that's the case, then after step 2, we have an alkene, and step 3 would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. For example, if the structure was cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure after step 2 is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's just a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps are leading to a ring-opening or forming a diol or something similar. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the target molecule is formed via a Grignard reaction. For example, the ethynyl group is converted into a magnesium bromide, which then reacts with some electrophilic species.

Wait, but the options don't include Grignard reagents. So, perhaps that's not the right path.

Alternatively, maybe after the first step (alkylation), the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, which is then epoxidized, and then the epoxide is opened to form diol, which is further oxidized.

Hmm, but that doesn't align with the reagents in the options.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule again. It's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that has a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a formyl group. So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group that's attached to the ring and has three substituents: cyclohexyl, hydroxyl (from hydroxymethyl), and formyl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group with a formyl attached. So, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO group. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to the cyclohexane, which in turn is connected to a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and a formyl group. But that's four bonds on a single carbon, which isn't possible. So, perhaps the structure is a branching point where the substituent is a CH group (with three substituents: cyclohexyl, hydroxymethyl, and formyl).

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, which is attached to a CH2CHO group. So, the substituent would be CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CH2-CHO. That would require the substituent to be a two-carbon chain, which might be possible.

But how to get that from ethynylcyclohexane.

Hmm, perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene.

3. Ozonolyze the alkene to form carbonyl groups.

4. Perform some kind of oxidation or reduction to form the necessary functional groups.

Wait, let's try this with the options.

Looking at option C:

Step 1: Add methyl to the alkyne → propargylcyclohexane.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate to single bond → cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, but that's a longer chain, but doesn't seem to help introduce the necessary substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation stops at the alkene stage. If step 2 is H2 and a catalyst that stops at the alkene (like Lindlar), then the product would be an alkene. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, for example, if after step 2 we have cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2 (but that doesn't make sense), wait, no—the product after step 1 would be propargylcyclohexane (C≡C-CH3). Hydrogenation with Lindlar would turn that into cis-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's just a single bond again.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try looking at the target molecule and think about the necessary functional groups. The target has a formyl group, which suggests oxidation of an aldehyde group. So, perhaps one of the steps is an oxidation.

Another approach: The target has a hydroxymethyl group and a formyl group attached to the cyclohexane. Perhaps those are formed via oxidation of alcohols or via some addition reactions.

Wait, perhaps the target is formed via a conjugate addition or via a dihydroxylation followed by oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group. For example, using O3 would cleave the alkyne into two carbonyls. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone via some oxidation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached. Maybe that's introduced via a cyclopropane ring-opening or via a substitution reaction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reagents in the options can give a clue. For example, option C's third step is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S (a reductant) would break double bonds into carbonyl groups without further oxidation. So, perhaps there's an alkene in the molecule at that step.

Putting it all together, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkylation of the ethynyl group to add a methyl (step 1 in all options except B uses methyl chloride).

2. Partial hydrogenation to an alkene (maybe using a different catalyst, but in the options, it's H2/Pd, which usually goes all the way. Hmm.)

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a different catalyst. For example, using H2 and Lindlar catalyst would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis-alkene. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis to cleave the alkene into two carbonyls. Then, step 4 would be Ba(OH)2, which might be for epoxide opening or elimination.

But none of the options have that sequence.

Wait, maybe I should consider each option's steps.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So, deprotonate the ethynyl group, making an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. Methanol would act as an electrophilic source of a methyl group. So, the acetylide would attack the CH3O- group, leading to substitution. So, the product would be cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3? Wait, no, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the acetylide attacks a methyl group from methanol, but that's not likely as methanol is a poor electrophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deprotonation followed by alkylation, but with methanol as the alkylating agent. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and need to think differently. Let me think about the target molecule again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the substituent is on carbon 1 of the cyclohexane. The substituent has a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a formyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and that's connected to a CH2CHO group. So, the substituent would be CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CH2-CHO.

Wait, that seems plausible. So, how to form that?

Maybe the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → add a methyl to make propargylcyclohexane.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, giving a longer chain.

3. Introduce a cyclohexyl group via some kind of alkylation or substitution.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to an alkene, and then that alkene is subjected to some dihydroxylation to form a diol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, but I'm not seeing how that would introduce the necessary groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via a conjugate addition of a Grignard reagent to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, I think I'm going around in circles. Maybe I should approach this systematically by considering each option's possible product.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps deprotonate the ethynyl group, then react with methanol. Since methanol has an -OCH3 group, maybe the acetylide attacks the methyl group. But that might lead to a substitution where the triple bond becomes C-OCH3, which doesn't align with the target.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydroxymethylation, but I'm not sure.

Option C:

After step 3, which is ozonolysis and (CH3)2S, perhaps the molecule is cleaved into two carbonyl groups. Then, step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which could cause elimination or ring formation.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure after each step, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to add a methyl group, hydrogenate the triple bond to an alkene, ozonolyze to form a diketone, and then perform some elimination or oxidation.

Wait, let me imagine that:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → add methyl → propargylcyclohexane.

2. Hydrogenate to alkene (cis or trans) → cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3? No, that doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, no. If step 2 is partial hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a double bond. So, after step 2, we have cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 → becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond becomes a double bond, so propargyl becomes allyl.

Wait, perhaps the correct pathway is to first add a methyl group, then hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond, then ozonolyze the double bond to form two carbonyl groups, which can then be oxidized or reduced to form the substituents needed.

So, for example:

Step 1: Add methyl → propargylcyclohexane.

Step 2: Hydrogenate to double bond → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2 (no, that doesn't make sense for a double bond).

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't have a double bond. So, step 3 would have nothing to ozonolyze.

Hmm, this is getting quite tangled. I think I'm stuck and perhaps should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule can be made by forming a cyclohexyl-substituted alcohol and then oxidizing it to form a carbonyl group. For example, via some dihydroxylation followed by oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into an epoxide, which is then opened to form a diol, which is then oxidized.

But I'm not certain about the reagents involved in the options.

Wait, another approach: the target has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde. Perhaps one of the steps is an oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

So, perhaps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → add a methyl group → propargylcyclohexane.

2. Hydrogenate → single bond → cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3.

3. Oxidize the end CH3 to a COOH group, but that doesn't directly form an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps partial oxidation to form a ketone or aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps the target's substituent has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. That suggests that the substituent is formed by a two-carbon chain where one end is an aldehyde and the other is a hydroxyl group.

Wait, could that be from ozonolysis of a diene? For example, if there's a diene in the molecule, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure how to get a diene from the starting material.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about each option.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → add methyl to triple bond → propargylcyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond → single bond → cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so nothing happens.

Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps step 2 isn't full hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the catalyst in step 2 is different. Pd-calcium carbonate is a catalyst for hydrogenation, but sometimes it can be used for dehydrogenation or other reactions. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination.

Wait, but the starting material after step 1 is propargylcyclohexane, which is a triple bond. So, hydrogenation would add H's.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group.

Wait, here's an alternative approach: Maybe the first step converts the ethynyl group into a ketone.

But how? Ozonolysis of ethynylcyclohexane would produce two carbonyl groups, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is oxidized to a diketone. Wait, that's possible with certain oxidizing agents, like O3 followed by workup.

But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Wait, another thought: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached. Maybe that's introduced via a ring-opening or some substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexyl group is added via a Grignard reaction, but I don't see Grignard reagents in the options.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on the reagent sequences.

Looking at the options again:

The target requires adding a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl, and a formyl group. So, perhaps the steps involve:

- Adding a methyl group (step 1 in options A, C, D).

- Hydrogenating the triple bond (step 2 in options A, C).

- Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups (step 3 in options C, D).

- Workup (step 4 in options C, D).

But I'm not sure.

Option C's steps:

1. Add methyl → propargylcyclohexane.

2. Hydrogenate → single bond → maybe that's cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3.

3. Ozonolysis → but no double bond, so nothing. So, perhaps option C is wrong.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps form a geminal diol after hydrolysis. For example, the alkyne would be converted into a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to add a methyl, then hydrogenate to a single bond, then perform some oxidation to form the necessary groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think why.

Option C:

Step 1: add methyl → propargylcyclohexane.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate to single bond → cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3.

But I'm not sure how that leads to the target.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3 after step 2 is then ozonolyzed, but there's no double bond, so that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, but I don't know if Pd would do that.

Another thought: Ozone could cleave the triple bond after step 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is option D.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps the alkyne is converted into a methyl ether.

Step 2: Li and liq NH3 → perhaps a strong base for elimination or deprotonation.

Step 3: Ozone and (CH3)2S → cleave a double bond into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option B.

Wait, option B:

Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → add ethyl group to alkyne → longer alkyne.

Step 2: Li and liq NH3 → perhaps deprotonate and form a strong base.

Step 3: Ozone and H2O → cleave any double bonds into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup.

But again, without seeing the intermediates, it's tough.

I think I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess.

The target has a formyl group, which suggests an oxidation step. Ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (like in options C and D) could form carbonyl groups. So, perhaps the correct sequence includes ozonolysis.

Between options C and D, perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, option C's steps are:

1. Add methyl → propargylcyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to single bond → cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so nothing.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So, perhaps option C isn't correct.

Option D's steps:

1. Methanol and NaNH2 → perhaps form a methyl ether.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Because the steps include ozonolysis which could form the necessary carbonyl groups, then Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination or other reactions to form the substituent.

Wait, perhaps after ozonolysis, we have two carbonyl groups, which are then subjected to Ba(OH)2, which could cause some kind of elimination or aldol condensation. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C.


The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent containing a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a formyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: This step likely adds a methyl group to the terminal alkyne, forming propargylcyclohexane.
2. **H₂/Pd**: This step fully hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in a longer alkane chain.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: This step could involve elimination or oxidation, but it is unclear how this would introduce the hydroxymethyl or formyl groups.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: These reagents suggest oxidation, but the sequence does not clearly align with the formation of the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: This step adds an ethyl group to the terminal alkyne, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **Li, liq. NH₃**: This step likely involves deprotonation or elimination, but it is unclear how this would lead to the target structure.
3. **O₃, H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but there is no double bond in the intermediate after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: This step is a workup for ozonolysis, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: This step adds a methyl group to the terminal alkyne, forming propargylcyclohexane.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: This step hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in a longer alkane chain.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but there is no double bond in the intermediate after step 2, making this step unclear.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: This step could involve elimination or oxidation, but the sequence does not clearly align with the formation of the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: This step likely forms a methyl ether or introduces a hydroxyl group, but the exact reaction is unclear.
2. **Li, liq. NH₃**: This step involves a strong base, possibly for elimination or deprotonation.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but it is unclear how this step contributes to the target structure.
4. **NH₄OH**: This step is a workup for ozonolysis, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule requires the introduction of a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a formyl group. Among the options, **Option C** is the most plausible because it includes steps that could potentially form carbonyl groups (via ozonolysis) and introduce the necessary functional groups. However, the sequence is not entirely clear, and the role of Ba(OH)₂ in the final step remains ambiguous.

**Answer: C**
