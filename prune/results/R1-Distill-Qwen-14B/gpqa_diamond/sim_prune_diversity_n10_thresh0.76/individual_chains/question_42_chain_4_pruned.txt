Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But maybe that's not super relevant for solving the problem. Anyway, the main points are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and we need to find the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's. All have the same albedo, which is 0.3, like Earth.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star and the star's luminosity, among other things. The formula, if I recall correctly, is something like T = [ ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * d²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance from the star.

Wait, but for planets around the same star, the luminosity L and σ would be constants, so the temperature ratio would depend on the square of the distance. Oh, but wait, the equilibrium temperature also depends on the square root of the planet's distance because the flux goes as 1/d². So the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L(1-a))^(1/4) / (d)^(1/2), assuming all other factors are constant.

But wait, the problem says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. Similarly, T2/T3 is 2.3. Wait, no, the question says between 1 and 2 is approx 1.4, and between 2 and 3 is 2.3. So T1/T2 is 1.4, T2/T3 is 2.3, so T1/T3 would be 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22.

But wait, maybe I should write the equations. Let's think about the equilibrium temperature formula. Since all planets are around the same star, L is the same for all. Albedo is the same (0.3) for all. So T is proportional to (1/d)^(1/2). So T is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius d.

So T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1) = 1.4. So sqrt(d2/d1) =1.4 → d2/d1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 is about 1.96 times d1. Similarly, T2/T3 = sqrt(d3/d2) =2.3 → d3/d2 = (2.3)^2 =5.29. So d3 is 5.29 times d2. Then, d3/d1 is d3/d2 * d2/d1 → 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ let
