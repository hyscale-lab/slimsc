Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products, A and B, from the given reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The first reaction is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol treated with THF, KH, and then H+. I'm a bit rusty on my mechanisms, but let me think. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, right? So in this case, the spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol would have a three-membered ring and a five-membered ring connected at the same carbon, which is also where the vinyl group is attached.

When dealing with such compounds under basic conditions, especially with something like KH (which is potassium hydride, a strong base), I remember that elimination reactions are common. Maybe an E2 mechanism is happening here. But wait, elimination generally requires a good leaving group and a base. Here, the starting material is a secondary alcohol. Under strong base conditions, the hydroxyl group would deprotonate, but wait, the starting alcohol is already a primary or secondary alcohol. Let me think about the structure.

The structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The spiro atom (carbon 1) is connected to a vinyl group (CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?), wait no, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So it's a spiro structure where one ring is three members (like cyclopropane) attached to another ring which is five-membered, both connected at the same carbon which has the -OH group and a vinyl substituent.

In such a case, treating with a strong base like KH would likely deprotonate the alcohol to form an alkoxide. But wait, the alcohol is a primary or secondary? Probably secondary because the spiro structure would have two rings, so the carbon with the OH is connected to two other carbons from each ring.

But wait, maybe it's more about the possibility of forming a conjugate base. Alternatively, in some cases, especially with cyclic ethers or other structures, elimination can happen to form a larger ring.

Wait, another thought: when an alcohol is treated with a strong base, maybe it can lead to an elimination reaction, forming a double bond. But in this case, the molecule already has a double bond (the vinyl group, which is a double bond). So maybe it's a different type of elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol-type rearrangement, but the structure doesn't seem to fit. Pinacol is when two adjacent diols lose water to form a carbonyl. But here, we have only one hydroxyl group. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the base could abstract a proton that's anti to the leaving group, leading to an E2 elimination. But the leaving group here is the hydroxyl group, which isn't a good leaving group unless it's activated. Oh, but in THF and with a strong base, perhaps the -OH is deprotonated to form an alkoxide. Wait, but after deprotonation, the alkoxide would be a poor leaving group. So maybe that's not the case.
