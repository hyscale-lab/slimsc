Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the problem is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and when a strong acid is added, they should react. Right, the acid will donate H+ ions, and the base will accept them, leading to a neutralization reaction.

The question gives me 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 and asks for the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to dissolve it in 100 cm³ total volume. Also, they want the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each with a volume and pH value.

First, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 there is in moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would be helpful here. Let's calculate that. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and Hydrogen is 1. So, Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3*(OH). Wait, wait, no, wait: Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)3, so each molecule has Fe, 3 O, and 3 H. So the molar mass is:

55.85 (Fe) + 3*(16 + 1) (O and H for each OH group). Let's compute:

Each OH group is 17 g/mol, so 3 *17=51. Then 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

So, moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass/molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Wait, let me compute that exactly. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 mol.

Fe(OH)3 is a base, and when it reacts with a strong acid like HCl (monobasic), the reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So, the stoichiometry is 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacting with 3 moles of H+ ions.

So, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. That's 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 moles of H+.

Now, the acid is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter, so volume (in liters) = moles / concentration.

We have 0.002808 moles of H+ needed. Since the acid is monobasic, each mole of acid provides one mole of H+.

So, volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L =
