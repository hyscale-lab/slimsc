Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that a solution has a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The 1H NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. We have to pick which two compounds are present from the given options.

Hmm. All the options are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me check: each tetramethylbenzene would be C8H10, because benzene (C6H6) plus four methyl groups (each CH3 adds a C and 3 H, so 4*CH3 is 4C and 12 H; but benzene's formula is C6H6, so together it's C10H14. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, let me compute that. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl is CH3, so four methyl groups add 4*(CH3) = 4 C and 12 H. So the total would be C6+4= C10 and H6 +12= H18. Wait, but the molecular formula here is C10H14. So that doesn't add up. Therefore, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Benzene has six carbons and six hydrogens. Each methyl group is CH3, so adding four methyl groups (CH3) would add four carbons (so 6+4=10 C, which matches the formula C10H14). But for H: each CH3 adds 3 H, so four of them add 12 H. Benzene has 6 H, so total H is 6 + 12 = 18. But the compound is C10H14. That's a problem because 18 â‰ 14. So perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Alternatively, maybe the compounds
