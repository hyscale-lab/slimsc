Okay, so I've got this question about planet transits and which one is more likely to transit from the given options. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

So, the scenario is that researchers are choosing between observing Planet_1 or Planet_2. They want to pick the one with the higher probability of a transit because they have limited time. Both planets have been detected via the RV method, so their minimum masses and orbital periods are known.

Wait, both have the same mass. So that part doesn't affect the transit probability directly. The orbital periods are different, though. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has a period P, Planet_1's is P/3. But how does the period relate to the probability of transit?

Oh, right, the probability of a planet transiting is higher when the orbit is edge-on. It depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The formula for the transit probability is something like R_p / (R_s * a), where R_p is planet radius, R_s is star radius, and a is the orbital distance. But wait, no, maybe it's more about the orbital inclination. Oh, I think the probability also depends on the planet's orbital distance and the star's size.

Wait, another approach. The probability of a transit is given by the formula (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by ( (a)/(R_s) )² or something else? No, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Actually, I remember that the transit probability (P) is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a/(R_s)) ) or something like that. Alternatively, another formula I've heard is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)² * ( (1 / (a/R_s)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's more like the probability is (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by the probability of the orbital plane being edge-on enough, which depends on the relative size of the star and the distance.

Wait, I think the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / ( (a/(R_s)) ) ), but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, another approach is considering the relative size of the star and the planet's orbit. The planet's orbit must be such that the line of sight is within the disk of the star. The probability is roughly (R_s / a)^2 * (R_p / R_s)^2. Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s) / a ) ), but I'm not certain. Let me try to think about the geometry. For a transit, the planet must move across the line of sight, so the condition is that the distance between the planet's orbital plane and our line of sight is small enough. The probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit.

Wait, I remember the transit probability formula is:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a ) * (1 / (1 + (m_p / M_s)^0.5) ) )
