Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two parts, each involving a reaction with certain reagents. I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the given options.

First reaction:
Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Second reaction:
2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different A and B reagents.

Hmm, let me start with the first reaction. So, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. Adding NaCN, which I think is sodium cyanide. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, under what conditions?

Wait, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. For example, in the presence of an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (which is option A's A), the ketone becomes more electrophilic because it gets protonated. So, the cyanide ion (CN-) would attack the carbonyl carbon. This would form a cyanohydrin. But wait, what's a cyanohydrin? Oh right, a cyanohydrin is a compound where the carbonyl group is replaced by -OH and -CN groups.

So the product of the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That structure makes sense because butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so adding -OH and -CN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN—so 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Yes, that's correct.

So the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone. But for that to happen, the ketone needs to be activated. So the reagent A is probably a protic acid,
