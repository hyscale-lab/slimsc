Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength Î» is shining straight on it, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. Hmm, that's interesting.

Wait, what's an apothem again? Oh right, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So if all apothems are the same, this must be a regular polygon, maybe like a regular N-gon. And when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle. Oh, so this is like a circular aperture problem.

Wait, no, the question says the polygon has apothems of same length a. So when N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle with radius equal to a. Because the apothem is the distance from center to the side, so in the limit, the radius would be a.

But the problem is talking about the diffraction pattern. So for a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern (Fraunhofer diffraction) has a central bright spot and then alternating rings of dark and light. The minima occur at specific angles determined by the Bessel function zeros.

Wait, but since the problem says N is very large, approaching infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So the question is about the minima in the diffraction pattern of a circle. The first minima beyond the central maximum would be at a certain
