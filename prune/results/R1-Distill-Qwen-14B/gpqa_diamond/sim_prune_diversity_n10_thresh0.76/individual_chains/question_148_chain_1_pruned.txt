Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five of them. Let's see the clues.

First, substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. So, the decomposition reaction probably involves fluorine being released. The oF (I think that stands for oxidation state of fluorine) in A2 is 31.96%. Wait, that doesn't make sense because oxidation states are usually integers. Oh wait, maybe it's the percentage composition of fluorine by mass. Hmm, but 31.96%? That's close to 32%, which is about a third of 96. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula.

If A2 has fluorine at 31.96% by mass, let me think about possible fluorides where F is about 32%. Let me calculate. Suppose the formula is YF. Then the molecular weight of Y would be (100-31.96)/(31.96/19). Wait, because F is 19 g/mol. So 31.96% is (19/(Y+19)) * 100 = 31.96. Let me compute that.

31.96 = (19/(Y+19)) * 100
Divide both sides by 100: 0.3196 = 19/(Y+19)
Multiply both sides by (Y+19): 0.3196(Y+19) = 19
Expand: 0.3196Y + 6.0724 = 19
Subtract 6.0724: 0.3196Y = 12.9276
Divide: Y = 12.9276 / 0.3196 ≈ 40.5 g/mol. 

Hmm, that's close to 40. So Y could be calcium (Ca is about 40). Or maybe another element near that. Wait, but let me think about other possibilities.

Alternatively, if the formula is YF3, then fluorine is 3 × 19 = 57 g/mol. So the percentage would be (57/(Y+57)) ×100 = 31.96. Let me solve:

(57/(Y+57)) = 0.3196
Multiply both sides by (Y+57): 57 = 0.3196(Y+57)
57 = 0.3196Y + 18.1772
Subtract: 57 - 18.1772 = 0.3196Y → 38.8228 = 0.3196Y → Y ≈ 121.5. That's about 1
