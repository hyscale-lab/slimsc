Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine plants. The question is a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the setup is that they did an experiment to find genes contributing to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They found three genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). 

The key point is that at least one of these is a transcription factor acting upstream of another gene. So, transcription factors usually regulate other genes by binding to their promoters. So if one is upstream, it's likely that it activates or represses another gene which is downstream.

The resistance levels are given for each mutant. The control (wild-type) has 100% resistance. The mutants' resistance percentages are as follows:

- g1: 75% → So, 75% of the control's resistance. So, less than wild-type, but not completely susceptible.
- g2: 0% → Complete susceptibility. All plants infected.
- g3: 50% → Half the resistance of wild-type.
- g1g3: 10% → Very low resistance.
- g2g3: 0% → All infected.
- g1g2: 0% → All infected.

Hmm. I need to figure out the relationships between these genes based on their mutant phenotypes.

First, looking at the single mutants:

g2 knockout has 0% resistance. That's pretty severe. So G2 might be a crucial gene for resistance. Since at least one is a transcription factor, perhaps G2 is that TF. Because if you knock out a TF, it might inactivate multiple downstream genes, leading to a more severe phenotype.

g1 knockout is at 75%, so less severe than g2. So G1 might be involved, but perhaps not as critical as G2. Or maybe G1 is in a different pathway.

g3 knockout is at 50%. So it's contributing, but not as much as G2.

Now looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → Both mutations together. Oh, but since each single mutant's resistance is already 75% and 0% respectively, but the double is 0%. Wait, but what does that tell us? Let me think.

If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1, then knocking out G2 would disable G1's regulation. But wait, in the single mutant g1, the resistance is 75%, so perhaps G1 is a downstream gene of G2.

Wait, but the double mutant g1g2 is 0%. So if both are knocked out, perhaps the effect is additive or synergistic. Or maybe there's redundancy or some other interaction.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is epistatic to G1. Epistasis means that the phenotype of one mutation masks the effect of another. So if G2 is epistatic, then the double mutant would have the same phenotype as g2, which is 0%. Which is what is observed in g1g2 (0%), g2g3 (0%), and g1g2 (0%). Wait, but in the data, g2 single is 0%, so any double with g2 is 0% as well, which fits with G2 being epistatic.

Additionally, for g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, resistance drops a lot. But what's the relationship between G1 and G3?

Looking at the single mutants: g3 is 50% and g1 is 75%. So when both are knocked out, their combined effect is worse than either alone. So that suggests they function in parallel pathways, perhaps. Or maybe G3 is downstream of G1 or vice versa.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it regulates both G1 and G3. So if G2 is knocked out, then both G1 and G3 wouldn't be expressed. But in the data, the single g2 mutant is 0%, so no resistance. But in the g1 mutant, which is 75%, perhaps G2 is not the only regulator of G1. Or maybe G2 is the only regulator of another gene that's more critical.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates another gene X, and that X is directly involved in resistance. So in the g2 knockout, X isn't expressed, leading to 0% resistance. Then, G1 and G3 might be other genes in the same pathway or different pathways.

But wait, the g3 knockout is 50% resistance. So perhaps G3 is involved in a different pathway or maybe it's partially redundant with G1 or something else.

Let me think about the double mutants:

When G1 and G3 are both knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%. That's worse than either single mutant. So the combined effect is additive or more. So maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, and knocking both out leads to lower resistance than each alone.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 are redundant or partially redundant. If they are redundant, then knocking out both would lead to a more severe phenotype than either single knockout.

Wait, redundancy means that each can compensate for the other. So if both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than each single. For example, if each gene contributes 50% to resistance, then knocking both out would give 0% (if they are completely redundant). But in this case, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and their double is 10%. So maybe there's some redundancy, but not complete.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their combined knockout is worse. But I'm not sure.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Also, if G2 is epistatic to G1, then when both are knocked out, the phenotype would be same as G2. So in g1g2, the phenotype is 0% which matches G2. Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, which matches. But what about the other option?

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1. Same promoter? That would mean they are co-regulated, perhaps. But I don't see evidence of that in the data.

Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm. Pleiotropy again. If G1 is epistatic, then the double mutant g1g3's phenotype would be same as G1. But g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than G
