Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The star is being observed, and because of the spots, photometric observations show brightness variations as the star rotates. The setup is similar to what we might see with an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness.

The question is asking: what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve if there were no spots? So, basically, comparing the brightness variation caused by the planet to that caused by the spots.

Hmm. So the problem is about transit photometry. When a planet transits (passes in front of) a star, the observed brightness drops because part of the star's light is blocked. The depth of the dip depends on the ratio of the areas (since flux is proportional to area). But in this case, the star isn't uniform because of the spots. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible side, they contribute less flux, making the star appear dimmer. So the observed variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view.

Wait, but the star's hemisphere is covered in spots, so when it's facing us, the spots are either on the side we see or not. So the variation would be based on the area of spots as a fraction of the star's surface.

But wait, the filling factor is 20%, so the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. So first, let me think about the area of the star that's covered by spots. The star's radius is R, same as the Sun. The area of a hemisphere is (1/2) * 4πR² = 2πR². But the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the spot area is 0.4πR², and the star's total area is 4πR². The area covered is 0.4πR² / 4πR² = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface is spots. Wait, but the problem says one hemisphere is covered, so when the star rotates, that hemisphere comes into view and then goes away.

Wait, no, because the star is a sphere. One hemisphere is the front, and the other is the back. So when the star rotates, the spots rotate from being on the front (visible) side to the back (invisible) side. So the maximum effect would be when all the spots are on the front, and the minimum when they're on the back.

Wait, but the star's rotation period would cause the spots to come into and out of view. So the brightness variation comes from
