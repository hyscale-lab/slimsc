Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the products are (R) and (S) for each reaction respectively. So reaction A gives the R product, and reaction B gives the S product.

Wait, no, the question says:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyl...
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyl...

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. I remember that LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3, or is it the other way around? Hmm, wait, no. I think that BH3 is typically used as a milder reducing agent, maybe in certain conditions. But wait, wait, wait. LiAlH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters and amides, but LiBH4 is a milder one. Oh wait, no, LiBH4 is less reactive than LiAlH4 but more than other borohydrides. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Let me think. Oh, right, I think that BH3 is typically used in a less harsh environment, perhaps under less acidic conditions, and LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent, maybe able to do reductions that BH3 can't. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no—I think that LiBH4 is more reactive in terms of reducing certain functional groups. Or maybe it's the concentration or the conditions that matter. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reaction mechanisms involved here.

But wait, the product in both cases is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one with an ethyl group at position 4. Both are cyclic ketones. So perhaps the starting materials are ketones with some protecting groups, or maybe they're epoxides or something else that, upon reduction, forms the cyclic ketone.

Wait, another thought: The products are both tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one derivatives. So maybe the starting materials are epoxides. Wait, when you reduce an epoxide, you typically get an alcohol, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones. Hmm, but that seems unlikely because adding a reducing agent to a ketone usually doesn't do much. Wait, wait, no, wait, perhaps it's a reduction of a carbonyl group to an alcohol, but in a ring structure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters, like lactones. Because when you reduce a lactone (cyclic ester), you would open it up. Hmm, but how would that form a tetrahydro-pyranone? Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides that upon ring-opening would form the cyclic ketone after some rearrangement. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reduction process here. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure is a six-membered ring, with the ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. So the ring is a tetrahydropyran ring with substituents.

Wait, another approach: The products are (R) and (S) configurations. That suggests that the reduction step involves some kind of stereoselectivity. So maybe the starting materials have a chiral center that is being affected during the reduction.

Wait, when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, you can get stereochemistry. Wait, no, wait, in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the resulting alcohol is typically a secondary alcohol, and the stereochemistry depends on the starting material. But wait, in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, and the reduction is opening the ester to form an alcohol, which then forms the ring after a rearrangement, perhaps, into a pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reduction is opening the epoxide. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are enol ethers or something like that. Or maybe the starting materials are esters that, upon reduction, form alcohols which then cyclize to form the pyranone.

Wait, another thought: The product is a tetrahydro-pyran-2-one. That's a six-membered ring with the ketone at position 2. So if I imagine the ring as O-C5H9-O, but that's not right. Wait, the structure of tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, and the ketone is at position 2. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So position 2 is the ketone (O=C), then the ring is saturated, so it's a cyclohexane ring with an oxygen and a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide. When an epoxide is treated with a reducing agent, what happens? Well, BH3 is a reagent that can perform epoxide ring-opening. Wait, BH3 is typically used for the reduction of epoxides to alcohols. So when an epoxide is treated with BH3, it can add across the epoxide, opening it to form an alcohol.

Wait, but the product here is a ketone. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone group, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reactions themselves. So for the first reaction, the starting material A is treated with LiBH4 and then H+. The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

In the second reaction, starting material B is treated with BH3 and then H+, giving (S)-4-ethyl... same product.

So the question is about the starting materials A and B, which must be enantiomers, because the products are enantiomers. Because when you have a reaction that forms a chiral center, the configuration of the starting material affects the product's configuration.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different reagents. So maybe the way they reduce the starting material affects the stereochemistry of the product. So the configuration of the starting material and the reagent determine the product's configuration.

So let me think: If the starting material is a chiral ketone or ester, and the reduction leads to a new chiral center, then the configuration of the starting material (A and B) would influence the product.

Wait, another thought: The product is a diastereomer or enantiomer of the starting material. So perhaps the starting material is an epoxide with a chiral center, and the ring-opening by the reducing agent forms a new chiral center in the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters that, upon reduction, form diols, which then cyclize to form the pyranone.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are β-keto esters. Because when you reduce a β-keto ester, you can get a diol, which can then cyclize into a cyclic ketone.

Wait, let me think about this. For example, if you have a β-keto ester, like ethyl acetoacetate, and you treat it with a reducing agent, you would get the corresponding diol. But how does that form a cyclic ketone like tetrahydro-pyranone?

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic β-keto esters. So, for example, a cyclic ester with a β-keto group. When you reduce that, you might form a diol, which could then undergo cyclization to form a six-membered ring with a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) with a neighboring carbonyl group. For example, a five-membered ring lactone with a ketone next to the ester. When you reduce that, perhaps the ester is converted to an alcohol, and the ketone is also reduced, but wait, LiBH4 can reduce esters? Hmm, no. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent but I think it can't reduce esters. Wait, no, actually, I'm not so sure. Let me think: LiBH4 can reduce esters under certain conditions—perhaps in the presence of a Lewis acid. Wait, or maybe esters are reduced by LiAlH4, not LiBH4. So LiBH4 can reduce ketones, aldehydes, amides, but maybe not esters. Hmm.

Wait, but in the reaction, the product is a ketone. So the starting material must have a functional group that, upon reduction, forms a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Because you can't reduce a ketone to get another ketone. Oh wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Maybe the starting material is a carbonyl that gets converted into an alcohol, which then cyclizes to form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides with a ketone group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options given. The options for A and B are both (S) or (R) versions of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, so the starting materials are pentanoic acids with substituents at positions 3 and 5. So the structure would be:

Position 1: COOH (since it's pentanoic acid)
Position 3: ethyl group
Position 5: isobutoxy and oxo groups.

So the structure is:

CH2-COOH
|
CH(CH2CH2CH3)-O-... Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to draw the structure.

Wait, the formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but the substituents are at positions 3 and 5.

So the structure would be:

Position 1: COOH (carboxylic acid)
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: C connected to ethyl (CH2CH2CH3) and another substituent.
Position 4: CH2?
Position 5: O connected to iso-butyl (O-CH(CH2CH3)2) and a ketone (oxo) group.

Wait, no, perhaps I should number the chain correctly.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the carboxylic acid is at position 5 (if we number from the COOH end as 1). Wait, no: numbering for pentanoic acid is from the COOH end as 1. So the structure is:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH2
4: CH2
5: CH3

But in this case, substituents are at positions 3 and 5.

So 3-ethyl would be on carbon 3, and 5-isobutoxy and 5-oxo. Wait, but position 5 is the end (CH3), so 5-oxo would imply a ketone at the end, which isn't possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, the compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So positions are:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH2 (with ethyl substituent)
4: CH2
5: CH3

Wait, but the substituents are at position 3 and position 5.

So, position 3: ethyl group (CH2CH2CH3)
Position 5: isobutoxy and oxo.

Wait, but position 5 in pentanoic acid is the methyl group. So 5-oxo would imply a carbonyl group, which would be O=C-O-? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is pentanoic acid with substituents at position 3 (ethyl) and at position 5, which has both an isobutoxy group and a keto group.

So perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)-CH2?

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe it's:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH(OIsobutyl)-CO ?

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about the reaction.

When the starting material (either A or B) is treated with LiBH4 or BH3, followed by H+, it produces the tetrahydro-pyran-2-one.

So the reaction likely involves the reduction of a carbonyl group. Let's say the starting material has a carbonyl that is reduced to an alcohol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, but looking at the starting material, it's 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O)-OCH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, that's not possible as it's pentanoic acid. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-C(OCH(CH2CH3)2)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO ?

Wait, maybe I should draw it as:

The molecule is CH2(COOH)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O)-OCH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain, which wouldn't be pentanoic acid. Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)-CH(CH2CH2CH3).

No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a β-keto acid. Because when you reduce a β-keto ester, you get a diol which can cyclize to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, for example, when you have a β-keto ester, like ethyl acetoacetate, and you reduce it, you get the diol, which can undergo cyclization to form a cyclic ketone.

So maybe the starting material is a β-keto acid, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the tetrahydro-pyranone.

So, let's imagine that the starting material is a β-keto acid, like A and B.

When you reduce a β-keto acid (RCOCH2COOR') with LiBH4, you would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, but wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent but perhaps can't reduce the ester group. Wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the starting material isn't a β-keto acid but another structure.

Alternatively, if the starting material is an ester with a neighboring carbonyl group, like an acetoacetic ester, then upon reduction, you get the diol, which can form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester, which when reduced forms a diol that cyclizes to form the pyranone.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the reaction steps.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring has a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4.

Let me imagine the structure of the product: it's a six-membered ring with one oxygen. The positions are 1 (O), 2 (C=O), 3 (CH2), 4 (CH2CH2CH3), 5 (CH2), 6 (CH2). So the ring is O-C(=O)-CH2-CH2CH2CH3-CH2-CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it as:

Positions:

1: O
2: C=O
3: CH2
4: CH(CH2CH2CH3)
Wait, no, the product is 4-ethyl, so position 4 is CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, not sure about the exact structure, but it's a six-membered ring with a ketone and an ethyl group.

So, the product is a cyclic ketone with an ethyl substituent.

So the starting material must be a compound that, when reduced, forms this structure.

Assuming that the starting material is a β-keto ester, such as CH2(COOH)CH(CH2CH2CH3)COO-R, where R is isobutoxy.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the options for A and B.

The options for A and B are all the same compound, either R or S configuration.

Looking at the options:

Options:

A) A = (S), B = (S)

B) A = (R), B = (R)

C) A = (S), B = (R)

D) A = (R), B = (S)

So, the starting materials are enantiomers if the configurations are different (like options C and D). So if the reaction conditions (LiBH4 vs BH3) cause the starting material's configuration to determine the product's configuration, then the starting materials (A and B) must be enantiomers to produce enantiomeric products.

Wait, but in the problem statement, reaction A gives the R product, and reaction B gives the S product.

So, if A is R and B is S, or A is S and B is R, then that's when the products are R and S, respectively.

Wait, but let me think about the reagents. LiBH4 and BH3 are different in how they reduce. I think that BH3 is a weaker reducing agent compared to LiBH4. Or is it the other way around? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of the starting material affects the selectivity of the reduction. So, for a β-keto ester, the configuration of the starting material would influence the product's configuration.

Wait, another thought: When you reduce a β-keto ester with LiBH4, the reduction occurs at the ketone, converting it into an alcohol. The stereochemistry of the addition would depend on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, but in a β-keto ester, the carbonyl is part of a conjugated system, so the reduction would proceed in a certain way, perhaps leading to a specific stereochemistry.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an epoxide, and the reducing agents cause different ring-opening pathways, leading to different stereoisomers.

Wait, let's consider that. Epoxides can be opened by nucleophilic attack. If the reducing agent is BH3, perhaps it adds across the epoxide in a certain way, leading to a specific configuration. Similarly, LiBH4 might add differently.

But I'm not entirely confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a substituent that, upon reduction, forms the cyclic ketone.

Wait, another angle: The product is a dihydro-pyranone, which is a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone. So, the starting material might be a cyclic ester (lactone) with a substituent that, upon reduction, forms the pyranone.

Wait, but if you reduce a lactone (cyclic ester), you would get a diol, which could then form the pyranone via cyclization. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reduction with LiBH4 or BH3 leads to the diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Let me think about that. For example, a β-keto ester: RCOCH2COOR'. Upon reduction, it would form RCH(OH)CH2COOR' (the ketone is reduced to an alcohol). Wait, but that's not right; the β-keto ester would have two carbonyl groups. So, perhaps the reduction would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, but the ester remains.

Wait, let's take ethyl acetoacetate as an example:

CH3-C(O)-CH2-COOEt.

Reduction with LiBH4 would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, giving CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-COOEt. Then, under acidic conditions, perhaps this diol would cyclize to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the diol would form an hemiacetal or something else that rearranges into the pyranone.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this again.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester. So, for example, a five-membered ring with an ester and a ketone group. When reduced, it would form a diol, which would cyclize into a six-membered ring, the pyranone.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Let me think about the stereochemistry. The product is either R or S configuration. So the starting material must have a chiral center that determines the configuration of the product.

If the starting material is a β-keto ester with a chiral center, then the reduction would proceed in a way that the stereochemistry is preserved or inverted.

Wait, another thought: When you reduce a ketone to an alcohol using a borohydride, the attack of the hydride occurs from the less hindered side, leading to the formation of the alcohol with a specific configuration. So, if the starting carbonyl has a certain configuration, the hydride would attack from the less hindered side, leading to the product's configuration.

But in the case of a β-keto ester, the ketone is conjugated to the ester. So maybe the reduction would proceed in a way that the hydride attacks from the less hindered side, leading to a specific stereochemistry in the product.

But I'm not entirely clear on the specifics.

If I go back to the options, I think the correct answer is D, where A is R and B is S. Because when the starting material is R, the product is R, and when it's S, the product is S. But the reagents are different. So the question is, which reagent (LiBH4 or BH3) would cause the configuration to invert or retain.

Wait, no, I think the reagents influence the reaction pathway, which could influence the stereochemistry of the product.

Wait, perhaps LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and causes a different addition pattern than BH3.

In the case of a cyclic ketone, LiBH4 would open it with a certain stereochemistry, whereas BH3 would open it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, and LiBH4 and BH3 open the epoxide in different ways, leading to different configurations.

Wait, epoxide ring-opening by BH3 would typically proceed via a three-membered transition state, leading to anti addition. So the nucleophile attacks from the opposite side of the leaving group.

Wait, but in the case of BH3 as a reducing agent, perhaps it's acting as a Lewis acid catalyst, causing the epoxide to open in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of an epoxide to an alcohol, which would form a diol, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another approach: Since both products are the same compound but with R and S configurations, the starting materials must be enantiomers. So in the options, A and B must be enantiomers. Looking at the options, options C and D have A and B as enantiomers.

Options C and D:

C) A = (S), B = (R)

D) A = (R), B = (S)

So, the question is which pair of starting materials (A and B) would produce the R and S products when treated with LiBH4 and BH3, respectively.

Assuming that the configuration of the starting material determines the product's configuration, and the reagent's strength influences whether retention or inversion occurs.

So, if A is R and B is S, then reaction A (with LiBH4) would produce R, and reaction B (with BH3) would produce S.

But I'm not sure about the influence of the reagents on the stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses the configuration of the starting material to form the product's configuration, and the reagents have no influence on the stereochemistry, only on the reaction's occurrence.

Wait, but the problem states that different reducing agents (LiBH4 and BH3) are used, leading to different products. So perhaps the reagents influence the way the product is formed, affecting the stereochemistry.

Wait, another thought: LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and may cause a different reaction pathway than BH3. For example, LiBH4 may lead to a more substituted or less substituted product, affecting the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions (like the presence of acid) influence the stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto acid, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone. The configuration of the starting material's stereocenter would influence the configuration of the product.

In this scenario, if the starting material is R, the product would be R, and if it's S, the product would be S. So the reagents (LiBH4 and BH3) might not directly influence the stereochemistry, but perhaps the reaction conditions do.

Wait, but the question says that the reducing agents are different—LiBH4 and BH3. So perhaps the choice of reagent affects the outcome, such as the stereochemistry of the product.

Wait, another angle: The reagents might influence the mechanism of reduction, which in turn affects the product's configuration. For example, BH3 might lead to a different transition state than LiBH4, causing the hydride to attack from a different face.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the specifics of how LiBH4 and BH3 would affect the reduction stereoselectivity.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and LiBH4 and BH3 open the epoxide in different ways to form the diol with different configurations.

When epoxides are treated with BH3, typically the borane adds to the less substituted oxygen, leading to anti addition. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent, and perhaps it adds in a different manner.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or another structure that upon reduction forms the diol, leading to the pyranone.

Another possibility is that the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reduction converts the ketone into an alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

In that case, the configuration of the starting material's chiral center would influence the configuration of the product.

So, if the starting material is R, the product would be R, and if it's S, the product would be S.

But since reaction A uses LiBH4 and reaction B uses BH3, perhaps one reagent leads to retention of configuration, and the other leads to inversion.

Wait, perhaps LiBH4 leads to retention, and BH3 leads to inversion, or vice versa.

But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions (like the presence of acid) during the workup influence the configuration.

Wait, in the problem statement, after the reduction, the product is treated with H+. So, perhaps the acid workup causes the diol to cyclize into the pyranone.

In that case, the stereochemistry of the diol would determine the configuration of the product.

So, the key is to determine whether the diol's configuration is the same as the starting material's.

Assuming that the reduction of the starting material (β-keto ester) leads to a diol with the same configuration, then the product's configuration would mirror the starting material's.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to inversion of configuration.

Wait, but in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered side, leading to the formation of an alcohol with a certain configuration.

So, if the starting material is a β-keto ester with an R configuration, the hydride would attack in a way that forms an S configuration in the diol, or vice versa.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mechanism. The ketone is planar, so the hydride can attack from either side, but the presence of certain substituents may direct the attack.

Wait, in a β-keto ester, the carbonyl is adjacent to another carbonyl group (the ester). This can influence the approach of the hydride.

The hydride would attack from the less hindered side, which is determined by the substituents around the carbonyl.

So, if the starting material's chiral center is R, then the hydride would attack from a certain face, leading to a specific configuration in the diol.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the options. Since the products are R and S, the starting materials must be enantiomers, and the reagents determine which product is formed.

So, if A is R and B is S, then reaction A (with LiBH4) would produce R, and reaction B (with BH3) would produce S. Or vice versa.

But why would the reagents cause the product to be R or S?

Wait, perhaps the reagents affect the way the hydride attacks the carbonyl. If LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent, perhaps it causes the hydride to attack from the same face, leading to retention of configuration, whereas BH3 causes the attack from the opposite face, leading to inversion.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around.

So, if the starting material is R and the reaction with LiBH4 leads to R in the product, and the same starting material with BH3 would lead to S, but that's not the case here because reactions A and B have different starting materials.

Wait, no, because in the problem, A and B are different starting materials. So if reaction A uses LiBH4 and gives R, and reaction B uses BH3 and gives S, then A and B must be enantiomers that, when reacted with their respective reagents, produce the corresponding enantiomers.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed to the conclusion.

I think the correct answer is D: A is R and B is S. Because the reagents (LiBH4 and BH3) would cause the starting materials' configurations to produce the respective R and S products.


The problem involves two reactions where different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, are used to reduce two starting materials, A and B, to produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The goal is to determine the correct starting materials A and B from the given options.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reagents and Stereochemistry**:
   - LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent compared to BH3 and may influence the reaction pathway differently, potentially affecting the stereochemistry of the product.
   - The stereochemistry of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reagent used.

2. **Structure of the Product**:
   - The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry (R or S) is determined during the reduction and cyclization steps.

3. **Starting Materials**:
   - The starting materials are given as 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which is a β-keto acid with a chiral center. The configuration of this chiral center (R or S) determines the stereochemistry of the product.

4. **Reaction Pathway**:
   - The reduction of the β-keto acid likely involves the reduction of the ketone group to an alcohol, followed by cyclization to form the pyranone. The stereochemistry of the starting material influences the configuration of the product.

5. **Enantiomeric Relationship**:
   - Since the products are enantiomers (R and S), the starting materials must also be enantiomers. This means A and B must have opposite configurations (R and S).

6. **Reagent Influence**:
   - LiBH4 and BH3 may influence the stereochemistry of the product differently. For example, one reagent might favor retention of configuration, while the other might favor inversion.

7. **Correct Option**:
   - From the options, only options C and D have A and B as enantiomers. Among these, option D (A = R, B = S) aligns with the expected stereochemical relationship, where the reagents produce the corresponding enantiomeric products.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

**Answer: D**
