Okay, so I've got this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, in our universe, I remember that magnets always have both north and south poles; you can't isolate them. Like, if you break a magnet, you just get two smaller magnets, each with their own poles. So that must be a key difference here.

The question is asking which of Maxwell's equations would be different in such a scenario. The options are A, B, C, D, each pointing to different equations.

Wait, Maxwell's equations. Let me recall them. There are four main equations. The first one is Gauss's Law for electricity, which relates the electric field to the charge density. The second is Gauss's Law for magnetism, stating that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, which implies that there are no isolated magnetic charges, i.e., monopoles. Oh right! So in our universe, the divergence of B is zero because there are no monopoles.

Third is Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction, which deals with the curl of the electric field and changing magnetic fields. The fourth is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition, involving the curl of the magnetic field and current plus displacement current.

So in our universe, the second equation is ∇·B = 0. But in this parallel universe, they have isolated north or south poles, so magnetic monopoles exist. That would change the second equation. Because if monopoles exist, the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Instead, it would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. So equation two is definitely different.

But wait, the options are about which equations are different. So which option refers to the equation involving the divergence of B?

Looking at the options: option A is about the divergence of B. Option D mentions both divergence and curl of B.

Wait, but what about other equations? Let me think. The other equations—do they change? Let's see.

If magnetic monopoles exist, does that affect the other equations? For example, the curl of B is involved in Ampère's Law. In our equations, the curl of B is equal to μ₀ times (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t). But with magnetic monopoles, would that equation change? Or perhaps Faraday's Law, which is about the curl of E.

Wait, Faraday's Law
