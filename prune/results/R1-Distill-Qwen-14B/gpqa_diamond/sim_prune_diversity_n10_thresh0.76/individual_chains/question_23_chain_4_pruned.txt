Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves reacting ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, the researcher checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot was getting smaller, with two new spots appearing. The options are four different sets of products, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material to visualize it better. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let's break it down. The benzene ring has an ether group (oxy) attached. The substituent on the oxygen is a butenyl group. Specifically, but-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, wait. Wait, but for butenyl, the numbering starts from the substituent. So, but-3-en-1-yl would have a four-carbon chain, with the double bond starting at the third carbon relative to the substituent. Wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So 1-yl would be the point of attachment. So the structure is: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CHO... Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-O- attached to benzene. Wait, no. Let me number from the oxygen. The oxygen is attached to the first carbon. So, the group is (but-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the chain is: O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, that's butyl. But with a double bond at position 3. Oh wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O- attached to benzene? No, wait, but the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but wait, the total is four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4. So the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but double bond between 3 and 4? That can't be because but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but butenyl is four carbons, so positions are 1, 2, 3, 4.

So, but-3-en-1-yl would be: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? That doesn't make sense because for four carbons, the double bond can't be at 3-4. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Maybe I should think of it as the substituent is at position 1, and the double bond is at position 3. So, the
