Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and its energy states. Hmm, let me think. The question is about a transition from the |3,0,0> state to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions between energy levels follow certain selection rules. For electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So, when an electron emits or absorbs a photon, it changes its orbital angular momentum quantum number l by one unit, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, +1, or -1.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. So, n=3, l=0 (s orbital), and m=0. The final state is |1,0,0>, so n=1, l=0 again. Wait a minute, but wait—l goes from 0 to 0? That can't happen in a single dipole transition because Δl must be ±1. So this must be a two-step process, as the problem states.

So the atom must go from n=3, l=0 to some intermediate state, then to n=1, l=0. Let me think about what the intermediate state could be. Since l starts at 0, the first transition must change l to 1 (because Δl=+1). So the first transition is from l=0 to l=1, which means it goes to a p orbital. Then, the next transition must bring l from 1 to 0, so that's a Δl=-1 step.

Now, considering the possible m values for each step. From m=0, in the first transition, m can change by 0, +1, or -1. So the possible m values for the first state are m=0, +1, or -1. But since the initial state's m is 0, the first transition could go to m=1, m=0, or m=-1. Wait, but wait: for an l=0 state, m can only be 0 because l=0 implies m=0. So when it transitions to l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1.

Let me outline the possible steps:

Initial state: |3,0,0> → intermediate state: |n', l=1, m> → final state: |1,0,0>.

So for the first transition, the electron goes from n=3 to a higher or lower n. But wait, wait, the atom is going from higher energy (n=3) to lower (n=1), so the two transitions must lower the energy each time.

Wait, no. The overall transition is from 3 to 1. So the two steps must be 3 → some n' → 1. So n' has to be between 1 and 3. So possible n' could be 2, or maybe 3 → 2 → 1.

Wait, but if the first transition is from n=3 to n=2,
