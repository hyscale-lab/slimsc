Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think. The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. And I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer. The light is going through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement.

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium. But here the medium is moving relative to the lab frame. So I can't just use that formula directly. I think I need to use some sort of velocity addition formula, like from special relativity. Oh wait, but wait, the speed of light should always be c in any inertial frame. Or does that apply only in vacuum?

Wait, no, in a medium at rest, light's speed is c/n. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed of light?

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think. If the medium is moving, the light's speed relative to the lab might be different. But wait, according to the theory of relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But here, the light isn't in a vacuum; it's in a moving medium. So maybe the speed isn't c.

Alternatively, I remember something about the Doppler effect when the source and medium are moving. Or maybe it's about adding velocities in relativity. Oh, but wait, the velocity addition formula in relativity is for when you have velocities in different frames. So maybe I should consider the frame where the glass is stationary, find the speed, and then transform back to the lab frame.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. But from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving. So the light's speed in the lab frame would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass's frame, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, no, because in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The velocity addition formula is more complicated. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/cÂ²), where u is the velocity of the object in the first frame, and v is the velocity of the first frame relative to the second.

But wait, in this case, the medium is moving. So the frame of the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the light's speed in the glass's frame is u = c/n. So to find the lab's frame speed, we can use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but wait. Let me
