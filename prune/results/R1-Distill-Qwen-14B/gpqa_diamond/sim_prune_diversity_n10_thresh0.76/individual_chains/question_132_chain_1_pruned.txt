Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on NMR, but I'll think through it.

The question says that there's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. So each compound must be C5H7, wait no, wait. Wait, C10H14 is the molecular formula for the mixture. Oh wait, no, each compound has the formula C10H14 because the mixture is 1:1. Because two aromatic compounds, each has molecular formula C10H14. Wait, no. Wait, wait, the mixture is 1:1 of two compounds. Each compound must have two benzene rings? No, no, wait. Wait, each is a benzene derivative. Because if each is C10H14, that's a molecular formula. Let me check: Benzene (C6H6) with substituents. Let me see, for C10H14, the benzene has four substituents because (since C6H6 has 6 carbons, 6 hydrogens. If we add four substituents each contributing CH2 or similar, maybe.)

Wait, wait. The molecular formula for each compound is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So the substituents contribute 4 carbons and 8 hydrogens. So each substituent is probably a methyl group
