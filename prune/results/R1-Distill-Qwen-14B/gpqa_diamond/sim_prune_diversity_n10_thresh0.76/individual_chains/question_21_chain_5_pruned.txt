Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let me tackle them one by one.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between different structures (tautomer pairs) by moving a hydrogen atom and a pi bond. For example, like in ketones and aldehydes with alpha hydrogens—like in the case of tautomerism between enol and keto forms.

Benzoquinone. Wait, benzoquinone is a quinone. Quinones typically have two ketone groups. Benzoquinone is C6H4O2, right? It's a di-ketone. So, in benzoquinone, each ketone group is attached to a benzene ring. Do they have alpha hydrogens? The alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl groups) in benzoquinone would be part of the benzene ring. But benzene is aromatic, so the carbons are all sp² hybridized. Wait, but in a benzene ring, the adjacent carbons (like in para positions) don't have hydrogens that can tautomerize. Or do they?

Wait, let's think. For a compound to exhibit tautomerism, it needs to have a hydrogen on the alpha carbon. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Each has an alpha carbon attached to the ring. But those alpha carbons are part of the benzene ring, so they're sp² hybridized. Without a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl, tautomerism isn't possible. Because tautomerism requires the hydrogen to shift, which would require the alpha carbon to have a hydrogen attached.

But wait, no—wait, benzoquinone is something like O=C6H4=C=O, so the carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons. Each alpha position (the carbon next to the carbonyl) is part of the benzene ring. So, each alpha carbon is bonded to two ring carbons, a carbonyl, and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, in benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4-C(=O). No, wait, maybe it's O=C6H4-O-C=O? No, wait, no. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups in para positions. Structure is O=C6H4-C=O. So each carbonyl is on a benzene ring carbon, and the adjacent carbon is part of the ring. So the alpha position is on the benzene ring; but the ring carbons are sp² hybridized and don't have hydrogens attached. Wait, no. Benzene rings have each carbon attached to a hydrogen unless substituted. So each ring carbon has one hydrogen unless it's a substituent.

Wait, no. In benzene, each carbon has one hydrogen. But when you have a benzene ring with substituents, like two ketone groups, the structure would be O=C6H4=O, but that's not correct. Oh wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups that are adjacent. Wait, maybe it's 1,4-benzoquinone, which is para-quinone. So the structure is O=C6H4-C=O. Each of those carbonyl groups is on carbons 1 and 4 of the benzene. So the carbonyl carbons are adjacent to the ring. The alpha positions (the carbon next to the carbonyl) are part of the ring. So those alpha carbons are sp² hybridized and have one hydrogen each? No, wait, in a benzene ring each carbon is bonded to two other carbons in the ring. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring, but do they have hydrogens?

Wait, the benzene ring in benzoquinone has two ketone groups. So each of the carbonyl carbons is connected to two ring carbons (like in the case of a para arrangement), and each has a double bond to oxygen. So the alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl groups, which are the ring carbons. Those ring carbons are each bonded to two other ring carbons, a carbonyl oxygen (double bond), and a hydrogen. So each of them has a hydrogen. Hmm. So the alpha position has a hydrogen. So in that case, could tautomerism occur?

Wait, but tautomerism in a diketone like benzoquinone would require a hydrogen on the alpha position. So like, for example, in a diketone, you can have an enol tautomer if the
