Okay, so I have this problem about binary star systems, and I need to figure out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Hmm, binary stars, eclipsing systems, radial velocities... I remember that in binary systems, the stars orbit a common center of mass. The radial velocity method is used to detect exoplanets, but here it's about binary stars. 

The problem gives me the periods of the systems and the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. For system_1, the period is 2 years, and the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5 km/s. For system_2, the period is 1 year with RV amplitudes 15 and 10 km/s. I need to find the mass ratio and then find the mass of each system to compare.

Wait, how do RV amplitudes relate to the masses? I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the companion. The formula, I think, is K = ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M sin i) / ( (M + m)^(2/3) ) ), but I might be mixing up some terms. Alternatively, I recall that in a binary system, the velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass. Because the more massive star will have a smaller orbit (since it's closer to the center of mass), so its velocity is smaller. So the star with lower mass has a higher velocity.

Let me consider the mass function. The mass function for a spectroscopic binary is (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = ( (K1 P )^2 )/( 2π G ), but maybe I should think in terms of the mass ratio.

Wait, another approach: In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The ratio of their velocities is inverse to the ratio of their masses. So if star A has velocity v_A and star B velocity v_B, then M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A. Because the center of mass requires M_A * v_A = M_B * v_B. So M_A/M_B = v_B / v_A.

So given system_1: velocities are 10 and 5. So let's say star A has 10
