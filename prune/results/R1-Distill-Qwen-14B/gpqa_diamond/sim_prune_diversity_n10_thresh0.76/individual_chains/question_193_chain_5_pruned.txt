Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5, which I can write as N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. Specifically, it's asking about the change per unit range of distance, r.

Hmm, right. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh wait, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. Or wait, is it the other way around? No, no, parallax is measured in arcseconds, and it's the reciprocal of distance in parsecs. So if something is closer, its parallax is larger. So d = 1/plx. That makes sense.

So if parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance, then plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. 

The problem states that N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let me substitute plx with 1/d because plx = 1/d. So 1/plx is d. So substituting, N ∝ (d)^5, right? Because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. Let me see: 1/( (1/d)^5 ) = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

Wait, but the question isn't directly about N and d. It's about how the number of stars changes with distance. Oh, wait, the way the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So maybe they're looking for the differential change, like dN/dr.

Hmm, because when you look at a certain volume of space, the number of stars depends on the volume. Let me think. The number of stars in a region should be proportional to the volume, right? But wait, wait. No, because the region is a specific part of the sky, so it's like a thin slice, but the density of stars would depend on distance. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit area (since it's a specific region of the sky, maybe a fixed solid angle) as a function of distance.

Wait, let me clarify. When you observe a certain region of the sky, the number of stars you see in that region depends on how far away you are looking. So for each distance shell, you're looking at a certain volume or area.

But wait, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be the surface area of the shell multiplied by the number density of stars at that distance. Wait, but that might be getting complicated.

Alternatively, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, substituting gives N ∝ d^5.

But wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Because as d increases, N would increase, but I thought the number of stars would decrease with distance since there are fewer stars at larger distances in the universe. Or wait, no, actually, the number of stars per unit volume might be increasing or decreasing, depending on the distribution of stars.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit volume. Let me think again. The number of stars in a certain region as a function of distance. If you have a fixed area on the sky, and you're looking at a range of distances, the number of stars you see in that area depends on the volume you're observing.

Wait, the number of stars in a volume is N = n * V, where n is the number density. But in this case, the question says N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Hmm, perhaps it's better to approach this by considering how N varies with distance.

Wait, let's try to express N as a function of distance. Since N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5.

But wait, if N is the number of stars, and d is the distance, then N increases with d^5. That would mean that as you look further away, you see more stars, which doesn't make sense because stars are more concentrated in the disk of the galaxy, and beyond a certain distance, you might see fewer stars. But maybe the question is assuming a hypothetical scenario where the number of stars increases with distance.

But the question is about how N changes with distance. Wait, but the question is phrased as "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So when plx increases (i.e., when you're looking closer), N increases as 1/(larger plx)^5, which would go down. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit volume as a function of distance. So the number
