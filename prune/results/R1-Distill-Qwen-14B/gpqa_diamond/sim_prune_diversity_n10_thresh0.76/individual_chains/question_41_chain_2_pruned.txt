Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question is asking about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, which is also towards the observer.

Wait, the light beam is propagating through the glass, which is moving. So I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects the speed of light observed in that medium. But I'm not too sure about the exact formula here.

Oh right, the index of refraction is n. The speed of light in the glass when it's stationary would be c/n, right? Because normally, the index of refraction n is given by c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So v_medium = c/n.

But wait, the glass is moving. So how does that affect the speed as observed from the lab? I think this is a case where the velocity of the medium (glass) and the velocity of light within it combine in some way. I remember something about adding velocities, maybe like in special relativity, but wait, here the speeds are probably non-relativistic since the index n is a factor. Or maybe it's using the classical velocity addition?

Wait, no. Because
