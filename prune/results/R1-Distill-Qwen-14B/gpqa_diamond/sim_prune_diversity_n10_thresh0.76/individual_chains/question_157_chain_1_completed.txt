Okay, so I've got this question about designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus outbreak. Hmm, I should think through this carefully. Let me see what I remember about retroviruses and diagnostic methods.

Retroviruses, right, they have RNA as their genetic material. So when they infect a host, they use reverse transcriptase to make DNA from their RNA, which then integrates into the host's genome. That DNA can be used to make more viruses.

The question is about creating a diagnostic kit. The options involve different methods like PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, and ELISA. Let me think about each step.

First, I need to identify the virus. How? Well, for a new virus, especially a retrovirus, I probably need to use some sequencing to figure out its genetic makeup. So maybe performing cDNA sequencing would be necessary. Because retroviruses make DNA, so cDNA (complementary DNA) would be present in the host cells after infection. So the first step is to sequence the cDNA to identify the virus.

Once I've identified it, the next step is to create a diagnostic tool. PCR is a common method for detecting viral DNA. But wait, real-time PCR is more efficient because it can quantify the amount of DNA in real time, making it both quick and accurate. Plus, it can provide results faster than traditional PCR, which might need post-amplification analysis.

Looking at the options, option B says perform cDNA sequencing first and then develop a real-time PCR kit. That makes sense because you need to know the specific sequences to design primers for PCR.

Option A uses nested PCR, which is more for when you have a small target region and need higher specificity, but it's not the first choice for initial detection. Also, relying on symptoms to identify the virus might not be accurate because symptoms can be non-specific.

Option C suggests DNA sequencing, but since retroviruses have RNA, I think cDNA sequencing is more appropriate because the virus's genetic material is RNA. Unless maybe the patient's DNA has the integrated retroviral DNA, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question is about designing a diagnostic kit, so the target is probably the virus itself, not the host's DNA. So perhaps the first step is to find the virus's RNA, but for PCR, you need DNA. Oh wait, PCR targets DNA, so for RNA viruses, you might do RT-PCR. But the question says they're designing a kit, so perhaps the initial step is to identify the viral genome.

Wait, but option B says "cDNA sequencing" first. So the process is: isolate the virus, extract RNA, make cDNA, then sequence it to find specific regions. Then, using those regions as targets, develop a real-time PCR kit.

Option D talks about IgG antibodies and ELISA. ELISA is good for detecting antibodies, which the body produces in response to the virus. But that tells you if someone has been exposed, not if they're currently infected. For a quick diagnosis, especially in an outbreak, you might want to detect the virus itself quickly, not just antibodies. Also, antibody tests take time as the immune response may take a few days to develop. So PCR would be better for acute detection.

So putting it together: identify the virus through cDNA sequencing (to get the right sequences), then make a real-time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis. That points to option B.


To design a molecular diagnostic kit for detecting a retrovirus, the first step is to identify the virus. Retroviruses have RNA as their genetic material, and they produce cDNA (complementary DNA) during infection. Therefore, performing cDNA sequencing is the appropriate method to identify the virus and determine its specific genetic sequences. Once the virus is identified, the next step is to develop a diagnostic tool. Real-time PCR is a highly efficient and accurate method for detecting viral DNA, as it provides rapid results and quantification in real time. This makes it the best choice for quick and accurate diagnosis. 

Option A suggests using nested PCR and relying on symptoms, which is less reliable for identifying a new virus. Option C proposes DNA sequencing, but this is not suitable for retroviruses, as their genetic material is RNA. Option D focuses on detecting IgG antibodies using ELISA, which is less ideal for acute diagnosis since it detects past exposure rather than active infection. Therefore, the correct approach is to perform cDNA sequencing first and then develop a real-time PCR kit.

Answer: B
