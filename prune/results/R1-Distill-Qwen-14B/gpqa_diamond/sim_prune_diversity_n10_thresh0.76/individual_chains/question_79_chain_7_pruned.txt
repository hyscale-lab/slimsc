Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of compound X based on the given NMR data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. The compound X has the formula C11H12O. It was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to identify X from the options A to D.

Wait, what's the reaction here? Oh, right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a commonly used reagent in the Wurtz reaction. The Wurtz reaction is for eliminating a molecule of iodide (or other halides) from adjacent positions in a dihalide, usually forming an alkyne or another compound depending on the structure. But wait, wait. Alternatively, since the solvent is nonpolar and the temperature is 403 K, which is about 130°C, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction, leading to an alkene or alkyne formation.

But wait, compound X has a formula C11H12O. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=11, H=12, O=1 (X=0, N=0). So (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So 6 degrees. That could be from a double bond, a ring, or an epoxide maybe. Oh, because the product's NMR shows possible aromatic protons and some other signals.

Looking at the product's NMR. Let's start with the 1H NMR. The signals are:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Wait, there are two singlets integrating to 3H each. So two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Maybe they're on electronegative atoms or in symmetric positions. For example, if they're attached to oxygen, like in an epoxide, but epoxide protons are usually around δ 3-4.5, but these are singlets, so maybe they're not on the oxygen. Alternatively, they could be geminal or in a symmetric environment, like a cyclohexane ring or attached to a carbonyl.

Looking at the 13C NMR:

δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127
