Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the mean decay distance of a meson resonance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on particles and decay processes. I remember that when a particle decays, its mean lifetime is related to its width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the width Γ. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is the decay width, which has units of energy. So ħ has units of J·s, right?

But wait, let me think again. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Ok, so τ is the mean lifetime. But how does that help me find the decay distance?

Oh, right! The mean decay distance is the product of the velocity of the particle and its mean lifetime τ. So, distance L = v * τ = v * (ħ / Γ). But wait, do I need to consider the velocity? Or maybe it's better to use another approach.

Alternatively, the mean decay length can be calculated using the formula L = (c * τ) * v, where
