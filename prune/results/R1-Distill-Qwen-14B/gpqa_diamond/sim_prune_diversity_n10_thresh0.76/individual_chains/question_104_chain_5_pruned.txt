Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected the planets by shifts in the spectral lines.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the Doppler shift. I think the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity. So if Planet #1 has a 5 mas shift and Planet #2 has 7, then K is higher for Planet #2. Because a larger shift implies a higher velocity.

But how does K relate to the orbital period and other parameters? I remember the formula for K. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π ) / P ) )^(1/3) ) / c,

Wait, maybe that's a bit too complicated. Alternatively, I think the formula can be written as:

K = ( (27 * π * G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * c ) ) * (1 / P )^(1/3)

Wait, another approach comes to mind. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G ) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3))

Wait, maybe more accurately, the formula is K = [ (G * P) / (2π c^3) ) ]^(-1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) )

But perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that when the mass of the planet is much smaller than the star, which is the case here since M_p << M_star (Neptune is much less than Sun), the formula simplifies.

In that case, the velocity semi-amplitude K is approximately:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2) * P ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2π / (c P) ) )

Wait, no, maybe another way: the formula I'm a bit fuzzy on, but perhaps the key is to consider the relation between K and the orbital period P.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (c P) )^(1/3)

Wait, maybe it's easier to compare the two planets. Since both stars have the same mass (same as Sun) and the planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), the factors involving M_star and M_p will be the same for both. So the ratio of K1 to K2 will depend only on the ratio of their periods.

Wait, but in this case, the Doppler shift is given for each planet. Wait, the problem says the shift is periodic for each. The shift depends on K, the velocity semi-amplitude. So K is proportional to the Doppler shift (since shift is proportional to velocity and wavelength, but since same spectral line is used, the proportionality holds).

So, K1 = 5 mas, K2 = 7 mas? Wait, no, wait. The Doppler shift is measured in milliangstroms. But the actual velocity is what K represents. So, the shift in wavelength (Doppler shift) is proportional to the velocity. Because the Doppler formula is Δλ/λ = v/c. So the velocity v is proportional to Δλ (since λ is the same for the same spectral line).

So for each planet, K (the semi-amplitude) is proportional to the observed shift. So K1/K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 =5/7.

Wait but wait, K is the velocity semi-amplitude. So yes, K is proportional to the shift. So K1 =5, K2=7.

Now, the question is how to relate K to the period P. So, K and P are related through the other parameters.

From the formula for K, when M_p and M_star are same for both planets, then:

K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^2 )^(1/3) * (1/P )^(1/3).

Wait, no, let me think again.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π ) / P ) )^(1/3) ) / c.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the formula as:

K = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) * (2π / (c P )) )^(1/3) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Perhaps another approach. Let me think about the relation between K and P.

I remember that for the same star and planet mass, K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^2 * P ))^(1/3) ?

Wait, perhaps from the formula I found earlier, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1/P )^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_star are same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

Wait, so K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3).

Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So if K1 =5, K2=7, then K1/K2
