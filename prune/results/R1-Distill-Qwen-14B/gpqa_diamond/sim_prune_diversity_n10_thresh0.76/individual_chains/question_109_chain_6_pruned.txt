Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem states that we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The question is about determining which partial wave is not permitted after the emission, considering conservation of angular momentum and parity, and using Pauli statistics.

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The Pauli exclusion principle says that identical fermions (like nucleons) cannot have the same set of quantum numbers. But wait, in this case, the system is NN, so they are identical particles. Hmm, but the problem mentions Pauli statistics requiring that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. I'm not exactly sure what that equation signifies. Maybe it's a condition on the total isospin T, spin S, and orbital angular momentum L? I think in some cases, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange of identical particles, which involves a combination of spin, orbital, and other quantum numbers.

The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would mean 2S+1 = 1 → S=0. So the spin part is symmetric (since S=0, the spin state is symmetric). L is S, so L=0, since it's the S orbital. J is 0, so the total angular momentum is zero.

When they emit a particle X, the final state of the NN system must have certain quantum numbers. The problem states that T(NN)=0. The equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Wait, no, the condition is that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So T is equal to (S + L + 1) mod 2. Since T is 0, that gives 0 ≡ (S + L +1) mod 2. Which implies that S + L +1 must be even. So S + L must be odd.

So the total spin S of the NN system plus the orbital angular momentum L must be odd. So S + L = odd. Let's remember that.

Now, the NN system emits a particle X. Let's think about conservation laws. Angular momentum and parity must be conserved. The initial state has L=0 (since it's 1S0), so the total initial angular momentum is J=0. The emitted particle X will carry away some angular momentum. But wait, when the NN system emits a particle, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the total angular momentum after emission (NN + X) must equal the initial J, which is 0. 

Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The initial state is the NN system, and when they emit X, the NN system becomes a different state, and X is emitted. So the total angular momentum of the system (NN plus
