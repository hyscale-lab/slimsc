Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a certain nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The nucleus is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the regular lithium-7 has 3 neutrons because it has 7 nucleons total. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, Li is element 3, so normally it's Li-7 which has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. Wait, but the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So that would make it Li-6 maybe? Because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6, so Li-6. Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me make sure: the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So the nucleus would have 3 protons (since it's Li) and 3 neutrons, making a total of 6 nucleons. So X is Li-6.

So the mass number A is 6. That's important because I'll need the mass of the nucleus for calculating energy.

The problem is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed v of the nucleus X is 0.96c. So I need to calculate the relativistic energy of the nucleus moving at 0.96c.

Wait, but wait. Wait, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, it's often referring to the kinetic energy or the total energy? Hmm, I think in this context, when they say the energy of the collider, they mean the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic). But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

The question says: What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c. So the energy would be the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. Or wait, no, the total energy is gamma times rest mass energy. So gamma is the Lorentz factor. So E_total = gamma * m * c².

So I need to find gamma first. The speed is 0.96c, so beta is 0.96. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Let me compute that.

Beta squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 0.96^2 = (96/100)^2 = (24/25)^2 = 576/625 = 0.9216.

So 1 - beta^
