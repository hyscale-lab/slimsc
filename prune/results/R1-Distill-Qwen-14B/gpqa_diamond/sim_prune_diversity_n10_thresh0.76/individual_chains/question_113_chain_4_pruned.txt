Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let me start by breaking down each piece of data given.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in the IR around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching. For example, in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a very broad peak, that might suggest it's an -OH group, like in an alcohol. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid's O-H is usually broader and sometimes around that region too. Hmm.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. I think 1700 is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl or another functional group like an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl. Wait, could it be an ester? Because sometimes esters have two carbonyl peaks. Or maybe it's a conjugated system, like a carbonyl next to something else, maybe an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe one is a ketone and another is something else.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So, the compound must have a double bond, probably in a conjugated system, maybe an aromatic ring.

Looking at the Mass Spec part, there's a fragment peak at m/z =45. I remember that 45 is a significant mass because of the (CH3CO)+ ion, which is 45 (12*2 + 1*3 + 16*2 = 24+3+32=59? Wait, no, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. CH3CO is (CH3)2CO? No, wait, CH3CO is the acetyl group. Wait, CH3CO+ would have a molecular weight of 43 (12*2 + 1*3 + 16*1) = 24 +3 +16=43. Oh wait, but the peak is at 45. Hmm, maybe another fragment. Alternatively, the molecular ion could be breaking into something else. Wait, another possibility: the m/z 45 could correspond to the (C2H5O)+ fragment. Wait, C2H5O has a molecular weight of 2*12 +5*1 +16=24+5+16=45. So that could be a fragment where an oxygen-containing group is cleaved off. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene ion or something else, but I'm not sure.

Now, let's think about each possible formula.

Option A: C6H12O2. So, degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are 0, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, the NMR suggests vinyl hydrogens, which are part of a double bond. So a ring plus a double bond? Or maybe two double bonds? Wait, for C6H12O2, the degree of unsaturation would be (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree. So it could be a single ring and/or a single double bond. But if the NMR shows vinyl Hs, then a double bond is present.

Wait, wait, let me calculate again. The formula is C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation is (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one double bond or ring. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so that's a double bond. So maybe a cyclic ether with a double bond? Or an ester with a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. Let's compute degree of unsaturation. (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. That could be one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, or two rings. But the NMR has vinyl H, so at least one double bond. Maybe a cyclic compound, like cyclopentene with an alcohol group.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation is (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. So either two rings, two double bonds, or one ring and one double bond. For example, a cyclic ester (a lactone) which has a ring and a double bond, or maybe an aromatic ring with an ester group.

Option D: C6H12O. Degree of unsaturation: (2*6+2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or a double bond. But since the NMR shows vinyl Hs, that suggests a double bond. So maybe an alcohol with a double bond, like an allylic alcohol.

Now, let's think about the FTIR peaks. The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests an O-H group. So the compound has an -OH group. So the options must have at least one O in the formula. All options except B and D have O2 or O, but I think all except B and D have O, but wait, no: B is C6H10O (so one O), D is C6H12O (one O), A is O2, C is O2.

So the O-H is present in all options except maybe where O is zero, which isn't the case here. So all options have an O and possibly another O.

Wait, the FTIR also shows peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. So 1700 is a carbonyl (C=O). 1650 could be another carbonyl, but perhaps conjugated or maybe another functional group like a C=C. Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl Hs, so a C=C is present. So the 1650 cm^-1 peak might be a conjugated carbonyl. For example, in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group (like an enone), the carbonyl peak might be around 1700, and the conjugated double bond might have a peak around 1650. Alternatively, 1650 could be a C=C stretch, but I think C=C is usually around 1600-1680 cm^-1, and the carbonyl is
