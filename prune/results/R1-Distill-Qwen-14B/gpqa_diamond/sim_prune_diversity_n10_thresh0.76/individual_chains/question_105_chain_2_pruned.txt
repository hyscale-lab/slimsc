Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Since only one hemisphere has spots, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that look like an exoplanet transit. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots.

Hmm, right. The key here is to find the relative radius of the planet (Rpl/Rstar) so that the dip in brightness during a transit is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but the star isn't actually being transited by a planet; the spots are causing the variation. The problem is asking, if instead of spots, a planet were causing the dip, what would the planet's size be?

I remember that the brightness change (the amplitude of the light curve) depends on the area of the object blocking the light. So for a planet transit, the area blocked is the area of the planet's disk compared to the star's disk.

But wait, in this case, the dark spots are causing the variation. How do their temperatures affect the brightness?

Oh right, the star emits light based on its temperature. So the spots are cooler, emitting less light. When the star rotates, more or less of the cooler spots are visible from Earth, causing the total brightness to dip or rise.

Wait, but when the spots are facing us, the total emitted light would be less because those spots contribute less. So the observed brightness variation is because the spots are blocking some of the star's light.

Wait, no, not exactly. The spots are cooler, so they emit less flux. So when the spots are on the side facing us (as the star rotates), the total emitted light is less than when they're on the far side.

Wait, but in the problem, the scenario is that the spots cover one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view. So the maximum brightness occurs when the spot hemisphere is away from us, and the maximum brightness is when the spot hemisphere is facing us. Wait, no—that's the opposite. If the spots are cooler, when they are on the near side, the total flux is lower, so the star appears dimmer. When the spots are on the far side (and the other hemisphere, which is hotter, is facing us), the star is brighter.

So as the star rotates, the brightness would vary because the visible spots change. But the problem states that this brightness variation is similar to what a planet transit would produce. So the dip in brightness when a planet transits is when the planet blocks some of the star's light.

So the dip in brightness from the spot is when the spots are on the near side—so the brightness drops. The dip in brightness from the planet is when the planet blocks the starlight. So the amplitude of these dips would be similar.

Wait, but the star's brightness is also affected by the temperature of the spots. So how do the spots' temperatures factor into this?

I think I should model both situations.

First, when a planet transits the star, the dip in brightness is given by the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula is (Rpl / Rstar)^2, since the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

But in the case of the spots, the dip is due to the spots reducing the total emitted flux. So the total flux from the star when the spots are on the near side is less than when they're on the far side.

Wait, but the star's total flux isn't just based on its radius and temperature, but individual regions (spots) have their own temperatures.

Let me think about flux. The flux from the star without spots would be the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L
