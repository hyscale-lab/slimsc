Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and see what I can figure out. So, the problem is about heating a mixture of two salts, A and B. They're equimolar, and the total weight is 7.20 grams. When heated without air, they produce gases. These gases are passed through several tubes: first anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and then red-hot copper. 

The results are that tube 1 gained 3.60g, tube 3 gained 0.80g, and tube 2 didn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure. The question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. Let's break this down. So, when salts A and B are heated, they decompose into a mixture of gases. I need to figure out what those gases are based on the reactions in the tubes.

Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong drying agent. It's used to absorb moisture, but since the salts are heated without air, maybe the gases include water vapor? But I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, Mg(ClO4)2 can react with water vapor as it can absorb it. The weight gain here is 3.60g. So, if this is water, then the moles of water would be (3.60g)/(18g/mol) = 0.2 mol. So, maybe 0.2 moles of H2O were present in the gases.

Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change. Ca(OH)2 is used to absorb CO2, right? So, if CO2 was present, it would react with Ca(OH)2 and cause the solution to become more basic, but the problem states that the weight didn't change. Wait, but Ca(OH)2 solution can react with CO2 to form CaCO3 and water. If no weight change, that suggests no CO2 was there. Because if CO2 was present, it would form a precipitate, increasing the mass. Alternatively, maybe the
