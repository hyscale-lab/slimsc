Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (like the energy from a magnetic field interacting with an electron's magnetic moment) with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think corresponds to a specific spectral line, maybe the Balmer series or something.

The magnetic field is parallel to the Oz axis, but I don't think the direction matters much for the magnitude comparison. The problem mentions small m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Hmm, I remember that m is related to the orientation of the angular momentum, but since m is small, perhaps we're dealing with a situation where m is close to zero, which might simplify things because the magnetic dipole interaction depends on m. Or maybe I'm thinking about the wrong thing.

Wait, wait. The paramagnetic coupling term is probably the Zeeman effect, right? Because that's about the interaction of a magnetic field with the atom's magnetic moment. The Zeeman effect splits spectral lines into multiple components based on the magnetic quantum number.

So, to compare the two energies, I need to calculate or estimate both the paramagnetic coupling energy (which is the Zeeman energy) and the transition energy ΔE.

First, let's calculate the transition energy ΔE. The wavelength given is λ=0.4861 μm, which is 486.1 nm. I know that the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Let me jot down the constants I'll need:

h = 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s
c = 3 x 10^8 m/s
λ = 0.4861 μm = 486.1 x 10^-9 m

So, ΔE = hc/λ.

Calculating that: (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m). Let me compute this step by step.

First, multiply h and c: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then, divide by λ: 1.9878e-25 / (486.1e-9) = approximately 4.088e-18 J. Wait, is that right? Let me check the exponents.

Wait, 486.1e-9 m is 4.861e-7 m. So 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = let me compute that.

So 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-25+7 → approx 0.4088 * 1e-18 → 4.088e-19 J. Oh, I see I made a mistake in the exponent earlier. So ΔE is about 4.088e-19 J.

But wait, that's in joules. Maybe I should convert it to electron volts because that's a more familiar unit for atomic transitions. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ΔE in eV is (4.088e-19 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 2.55 eV. That sounds reasonable for a hydrogen transition, like from n=2 to n=1 maybe? Wait, no, Balmer series transitions are from higher n
