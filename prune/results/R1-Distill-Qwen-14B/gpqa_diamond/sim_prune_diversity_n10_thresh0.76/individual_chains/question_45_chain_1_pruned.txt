Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

So the question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for the system. The options are given in terms of E, where E is pi squared hbar squared over 2mL squared. Right, I remember that for a single particle in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula is E_n = (n²) * (h²/(8mL²)), but wait, the problem defines E as (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²). Let me think about that.

Wait, ħ is h/(2pi), so plugging that into the standard energy formula. Let me recheck. The standard energy levels for a particle in a 1D box are E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), which matches the given E here because E is defined as pi² ħ²/(2mL²). So each E_n is n² times E, right? So E_n = n² * E.

But wait, the particles here are four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are fermions, they need to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each state can be occupied by at most one particle, considering their spin.

In a 1D infinite well, each particle's state is described by its quantum number n and spin. Since they're spin-1/2, each has two possible spin states: up and down. So, for each n, there are two possible states.

Now, the total number of particles is four. So we need to fill up the lowest energy states available, considering the spin. Let's figure out how the particles will be filled.

The ground state would be the lowest energy arrangement possible, right? So we start by filling the lowest energy levels.

Let me list out the possible states in order of energy, considering both n and spin.

The energy levels for a single particle are E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4, etc., each being E, 4E, 9E, 16E, etc.

But since each n can hold two particles (spin up and down), each n level can accommodate two particles.

Wait
