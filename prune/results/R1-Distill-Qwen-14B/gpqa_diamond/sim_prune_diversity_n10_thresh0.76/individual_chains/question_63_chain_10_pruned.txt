Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, will switch the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given data includes the masses of the atoms, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration.

Hmm, right. So this is a quantum mechanics problem involving molecular vibrations and rotations. I remember that in such models, the energy levels are quantized, meaning they can only take specific values.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state of a diatomic molecule, I think, is the state with the lowest energy where both vibrational and rotational modes are in their ground states. So, the molecule is in the lowest energy state possible.

Now, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state. But what's the "next state with the lowest possible energy"? I think that means the next higher energy state, but what's the order here? In quantum mechanics, energy levels are quantized, and transitions typically involve either vibrational or rotational changes. But wait, the problem mentions the rotation-vibration model, so maybe both are involved.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model includes both rotation and vibration. But in the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, but for the non-rigid rotor, the bond length can vary due to vibrations. So, the molecule's bond length changes as it vibrates, affecting the rotational energy.

But the question is about absorbing a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next state. I think that the next state would be the next higher energy state. But what does that state correspond to in terms of quantum numbers?

In the rigid rotor model (which is a simpler case), the energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number. For the vibrational energy levels, in the quantum harmonic oscillator model, the energy is E_vib = (n + 1/2) h Î½, where n is the vibrational quantum number.

Wait, but the problem says it's modeled by
