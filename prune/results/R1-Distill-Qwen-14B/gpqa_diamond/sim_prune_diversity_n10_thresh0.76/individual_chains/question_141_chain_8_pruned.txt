Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?

Hmm, wait a second. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, that d probably stands for deuterium, right? So maybe it's benzene with a bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So numbering the positions, 1 would be one position, then 2 is adjacent. So the structure is bromine at position 1, and a deuterium (which is like a hydrogen but with a neutron) at position 2.

Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so when substituents are on adjacent carbons, the molecule can have certain symmetries. But in this case, it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the molecule has a bromine and a deuterium in adjacent positions.

Now, the reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. Condensed ammonia is a solvent, maybe something like liquid NH3.

So what reactions involve NaNH2 and aromatic rings? Oh, right! The aromatic ring might undergo some kind of elimination or perhaps a substitution. Wait, but benzene is pretty stable.
