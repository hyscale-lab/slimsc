Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're all discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. But I don't think that's directly relevant here—probably just context.

The key data points given are the equilibrium temperature ratios and the mass ratios between the planets. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, so Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by that factor. Then, Planet2 to Planet3 has a ratio of 2.3. So Planet2 is hotter than Planet3 by 2.3, meaning Planet1 is even hotter.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So if T1 is the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 and T2 of Planet2, then T1/T2 ≈1.4. That would mean Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by 40%.

Similarly, T2/T3 is 2.3, so Planet2 is hotter than Planet3 by about 2.3 times. So T3 is T2 / 2.3, which is T1 / 1.4 / 2.3. Let me compute that real quick. 1.4 * 2.3 is about 3.22. So Planet3's temperature is roughly T1 divided by 3.22.

But wait, the question is about the orbital periods, not temperatures. So how does temperature relate to orbital period?

Equilibrium temperature for a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

Te = T_star * ( (L_star / (16 * π * σ * D^2) ) )^(1/4)

Wait, no, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature for a planet is given by:

Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 D)) 

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law. The flux received by the planet is F = L / (4πD²), where L is the star's luminosity and D is the orbital distance. The planet's equilibrium temperature is when the absorbed energy equals the emitted energy. So, the formula is:

Te = [ (L/(16πσ D²)) (1 - a) ]^(1/4 )

Where a is the albedo. Since all planets have the same albedo (0.3), that term is a constant for all.

But since we're comparing the planets, maybe we can relate their equilibrium temperatures to their distances from the star. Let me denote D1, D2, D3 as the orbital distances of Planet1, Planet2, Planet3 respectively.

So, Te is proportional to (1/D)^(1/2), because the flux F is proportional to 1/D², and the temperature is proportional to F^(1/4), so F^(1/4) is proportional to 1/D^(1/2).

Wait, let's re-express that. The equilibrium temperature formula can be written as:

Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2 D)) 

But wait, T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star its radius. Alternatively, another approach is to express Te as:

Te = [ (L/(16 π σ D²)) (1 - a) ]^(1/4 )

Taking the ratio of Te1 to Te2, the star's properties and albedo are the same for all, so:

Te1/Te2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2) 

Wait, because if D is larger, the temperature is lower, so the ratio Te1/Te2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2). Because if Te1 is higher than Te2, D1 must be smaller than D2.

Wait, let's think again: If Planet1 is closer to the star (smaller D), it should be hotter. So if Te1 > Te2, then D1 < D2.

The ratio Te1/Te2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2). So if we have Te1/Te2 =1.4, then 1.4 = (D2/D1)^(1/2). Squaring both sides, (1.4)^2 = D2/D1 → 1.96 = D2/D1. So D2 is about 1.96 times D1.

Similarly, the ratio Te2/Te3 is 2.3. Applying the same formula:

Te2/Te3 = (D3/D2)^(1/2) → 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2). Squaring both sides, D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 ≈5.29. So D3 =5.29 * D2.

Now, substituting D2 from earlier: D2 =1.96 D1. So D3 =5.29 *1.96 D1 = Let me compute that: 5.29 *1.96 is approximately... 5*2 is 10, but 5.29 is 5.29, 1.96 is approximately 2. So 5.29 * 1.96 = let me compute exactly.

1.96 *5.29:

1.96 *5 =9.8

1.96 *0.29 = let's see, 2 *0.29=0.58, subtract 0.04*0.29=0.0116 → 0.5684

So total 9.8 + 0.5684 =10.3684. So D3 ≈10.3684 D1.

So the distances are D1, D2=1.96 D1, D3=10.3684 D1.

Now, the orbital period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law. The law states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance), provided the mass of the star is much larger than the planet masses, which is usually the case.

So P^2 ∝ D^3. Since Kepler's law in the form P² = (4π²/G(M_star)) * D³. So P is proportional to D^(3/2).

But since all planets are orbiting the same star, M_star is the same. So the ratio of periods is P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2).

We have D3/D1 ≈10.3684. Let's compute (10.3684)^(3/2).

First, compute square root of 10.3684. sqrt(10) is about 3.1623. sqrt(10.3684) is a bit higher. Let me compute:

3.2² =10.24. 3.22² =3.22*3.22.

3.2 *3.2 = 10.24. 0.02 *3.22 *2 =0.1288. 0.02²=0.0004. So 3.22² =10.24 + 0.1288 + 0.0004=10.3692. Oh, which is very close to our D3/D1 of 10.3684. So sqrt(10.3684) ≈3.22.

So (10.3684)^(3/2) = (sqrt(10.3684))³ = (3.22)^3. Let's compute 3.22 cubed.
