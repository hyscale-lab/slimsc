Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by understanding what it's asking.

The problem says that we have an atom whose decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, 32% chance of decaying in 100 minutes. Now, after 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet, we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Hmm, wait. So the initial knowledge is that the decay probability is 32% for 100 minutes. But the question is about a different time frame after some time has already passed.

I remember that radioactive decay is a Poisson process, which means the decay is memoryless. That is, the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So, the fact that 50 minutes have gone by without decay shouldn't affect the future probability. But wait, how does that apply here?

Wait, the question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So maybe the 32% is the probability that the atom decays in 100 minutes, starting from time zero. But then, in this case, 50 minutes have passed, so the remaining time is 50 minutes (since 100 -50=50) left? Or is the 150 minutes starting from now?

Wait, wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. Oh, it says "the next 150 minutes." So after the 50 minutes have passed, the next 150 minutes would be from that point, so 50 + 150 = 200 minutes from the start.

Wait no. The setup is that the initial 100 minutes period has a 32% decay chance. So if 50 minutes have passed, maybe the remaining time in the original 100-minute period is 50 minutes left. But the question is about the next 150 minutes, which is an extension beyond the original 100.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

If the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes, that's the probability that the atom decays at any time within that 100 minutes. But once 50 minutes have
