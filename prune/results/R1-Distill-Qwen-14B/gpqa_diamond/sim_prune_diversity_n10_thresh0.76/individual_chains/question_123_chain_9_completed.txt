Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out.

Okay, so the question says that in the ejecta's frame of reference, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but I remember that in different frames of reference, especially when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I might need to use the Lorentz transformation or something like that. Oh wait, but the problem says both are inertial frames, so maybe it's just a matter of relative velocity and time dilation.

Wait, but let me think. The ejecta's frame is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy. So from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But the problem is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh right, because time might be different in each frame.

So I think I need to calculate how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Because the ejecta is moving at a high speed relative to the Galaxy, there's time dilation involved.

Wait, time dilation formula is t = gamma * t', where t is the time in the stationary frame (Galaxy) and t' is the proper time in the moving frame (ejecta). Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to compute gamma first.

But wait, what's the velocity here? The ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that to m/s because standard units are better for calculations. 60,000 km/s is 60,000 * 1000 m/s, which is 6e7 m/s. Wait, wait, the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 6e7 is 0.2 times c. Because 0.2 * 3e8 is 6e7. So v = 0.2c.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let me calculate that. The square root of 0.96 is approximately 0.98, but let's get a more precise value. Oh, wait, sqrt(0.96) is around 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206. So gamma is about 1.0206.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me square 0.98: 0.98^2 = 0.9604, which is a bit more than 0.96. So maybe sqrt(0.96) is about 0.9798... wait, perhaps I should use a calculator approach. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for small v/c. But 0.2c is not that small, so maybe better to compute it precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020605. Let me verify that: 0.96 is 24/25, so sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 ≈ 4.89898/5 ≈ 0.9798. So 1/0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So gamma is about 1.0206. 

So the time in the Galaxy frame is t = gamma * t'. t' is 50 seconds. So t ≈ 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, but wait, wait. Actually, wait. Because in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. From the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock is running slower. So the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer. Wait, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, time dilation: moving clocks run slow. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock is moving, so it runs slower. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, the Galaxy's clock shows more than 50 seconds.

So that's why t = gamma * t'. Because the proper time (t') is the time in the moving frame, which is less than the time in the stationary frame.

So yes, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

So now, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * t. Wait, no, wait. From the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v =60,000 km/s. So in t seconds, it travels v * t.

So the distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = let's compute that.

Wait, 60,000 km/s multiplied by 51.03 seconds is 60,000 * 51.03 km. Let me compute that: 50 *60,000 is 3,000,000. 1.03 *60,000 is 61,800. So total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km. Wait, but that would be option D: 3,060,000 km. Because 3,061,800 is close to 3,060,000.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 50 *60,000 = 3,000,000. 1.03 *60,000 = 61,800. So 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800. Hmm, but none of the options exactly match that. The options are A) 2,940,000 km; B)3,000,000; C)2,880,000; D)3,060,000.

So my calculation is 3,061,800, which is 3,060,000 as the closest option. So D.

Wait, but perhaps we need to be more precise with gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 60,000 km/s. So in m/s, that's 6e7 m/s. The speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. So beta = v/c = 6e7 /3e8 = 0.2.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let's compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.

We can write sqrt(0.96) as sqrt(96 * 1e-2) = sqrt(96)/10. sqrt(96) is sqrt(16*6)=4*sqrt(6) ≈4*2.4495=9.798. So sqrt(0.96)=0.9798.

So gamma is approximately 1.0206. But perhaps a more precise calculation would give a better value.

Alternatively, using a calculator-like approach:

1 - 0.2^2 = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) = 0.9798 approximately, so 1 /0.9798 ≈1.020604.

So gamma is about 1.020604.

t = gamma * t' = 1.020604 *50 ≈51.0302 seconds.

So the distance is v * t =60,000 km/s * 51.0302 s = 60,000 *51.0302 = let's compute.

60,000 *50=3,000,000.

60,000 *1.0302 =60,000 *1=60,000; 60,000 *0.0302=1,812. So total 61,812.

So total distance is 3,000,000 +61,812=3,061,812 km.

Looking at the options, D is 3,060,000, which is about 3,061,812. So the closest option is D.

But wait, the options don't have 3,061,800. So perhaps the intended approach is to ignore time dilation and just calculate distance as v*t', which would be 60,000 km/s *50 s =3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that would be incorrect because the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds.

Wait, but the problem states: "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So in the Galaxy frame, the time is longer, so the distance should be greater than 3,000,000 km. So the correct answer should be D. So why is option B 3,000,000 km? That would correspond to the case where t = t' =50 s, which ignores time dilation. So perhaps the intended approach is to not consider relativity, but that would be incorrect, as the velocities are significant (v is 0.2c), so relativistic effects should be considered.

Wait, but wait another thing: perhaps the question is simpler than that. Maybe it's a question of relative velocity without considering relativity. Because maybe the problem is intended for non-relativistic approach, but with high speed?

Wait, but v is 60,000 km/s, which is 6e7 m/s, while c is 3e8 m/s. So v is 0.2c, which is a significant fraction, so relativistic effects matter. So I think the correct approach is to consider time dilation.

So the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is more than 3 million km. So the correct answer is D)3,060,000 km.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.2^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96) ≈1.020604.

t_galaxy = gamma * t_ejecta = 1.020604 *50 ≈51.0302 seconds.

distance = v * t_galaxy =60,000 km/s *51.0302 s=3,061,812 km.

Which is approximately 3,061,812 km. The option D is 3,060,000, which is very close.

But let me compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more precisely.

sqrt(0.96) can be computed using a better approximation.

We can use the Taylor series expansion for sqrt(x) around x=1. Let me set x=1-0.04=0.96.

sqrt(1 - h) ≈1 - h/2 - h²/8 - h^3/(16) for small h.

h=0.04.

So sqrt(0.96)=sqrt(1-0.04)≈1 -0.04/2 - (0.04)^2/(8) - (0.04)^3/(16).

Calculating:

1 -0.02 = 0.98.

0.04^2 =0.0016; 0.0016/8=0.0002. So subtract 0.0002: 0.98-0.0002=0.9798.

0.04^3=0.000064; 0.000064/16=0.000004. Subtract that: 0.9798-0.000004=0.979796.

So sqrt(0.96) ≈0.979796.

So gamma=1/0.979796≈1.020604.

So t_galaxy=50 *1.020604=51.0302 seconds.

Distance is 60,000 *51.0302=3,061,812 km.

So the closest option is D: 3,060,000 km. So the correct answer should be D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a velocity \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c \) is the speed of light). The problem asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference when \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) passes in the ejecta's frame.

### Step 1: Time Dilation
Due to the relative motion between the ejecta and the Galaxy, time dilation occurs. The relationship between the time in the moving frame (\( t' \)) and the stationary frame (\( t \)) is given by:

\[
t = \gamma t'
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
\]

Thus, the time in the Galaxy's frame is:

\[
t = \gamma t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame
The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given by:

\[
\text{Distance} = v \cdot t
\]

Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t = 51.03 \, \text{s} \):

\[
\text{Distance} = 60,000 \times 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}.
\]

### Step 3: Comparing with the Options
The calculated distance (\( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \)) is closest to option D (\( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \)). While relativistic effects slightly increase the distance beyond \( 3,000,000 \, \text{km} \), option D is the most accurate choice.

### Final Answer
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference is approximately:
