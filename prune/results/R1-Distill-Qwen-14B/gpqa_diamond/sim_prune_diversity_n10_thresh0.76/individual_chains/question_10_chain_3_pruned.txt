Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Let me try to figure this out. Hmm, the question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density among the options a to d, and the options are labeled A to D. Wait, no, the options are A to D are the choices of which letter a-d is correct. Oh wait, no, the letters a-d are the four exoplanet options. The options A to D are the possible answers, each pointing to which a-d is correct.

Wait, let me read the question again to make sure I get it right. The question says: Among the following exoplanets, which one has the highest density? The options are a, b, c, d, each describing a planet with certain characteristics. Then the choices provided are A to D, each selecting one of a-d as the answer.

So I need to find out which of the four exoplanets (a, b, c, d) has the highest density.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So that's our planet Earth. The density of Earth is known, I think. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. Because the mass and radius are both Earth-like, so its density is Earth's density.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, so the density is given as 5.5, same as Earth. So if a planet's density is 5.5, regardless of mass, it's the same as Earth's density. But wait, mass and radius influence density. Because density is mass/volume. Volume depends on radius. So the same density implies the same mass divided by the same radius cubed. But in this case, the planet has 2 Earth masses but same density as Earth. Let me think: if the mass is double but the density is same as Earth, then the volume must be double. Volume scales with radius cubed, so radius would be cube root of 2 times Earth's radius.

Wait, but the question states that the planet in option b has a density of 5.5 g/cm³, same as Earth. So its density is same as Earth's, which is 5.5. So it's same as option a's density.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. So same composition implies same density? Because composition determines density. So if
