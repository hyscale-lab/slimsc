Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that an unknown compound was prepared and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My task is to determine the chemical formula from the given options.

Let me jot down the data:

1. **FTIR Spectrum:**
   - Broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Hmm, that's probably an O-H stretch, which is broad and strong. O-H could be from an alcohol, carboxylic acid, or maybe an ether (but ethers usually have sharp peaks around 1100). Since it's broad, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.
   - Strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Now, where else do I see around 1650? Maybe conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Wait, another possibility is that 1650 could be an absorption from an aromatic ring, like C=C stretching in conjugation with something else. Or maybe it's an amide? But I don't think that's the case here because the options don't include nitrogen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with conjugation or maybe an ester.

2. **1H NMR Spectrum:**
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, which would show up as a peak around 4.5-7 ppm, depending on the substitution. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests an alkene group in the molecule.

3. **Mass Spectrometry:**
   - Fragment peak at m/z = 45. Let me think about what fragments give 45. Common fragments include CH3CO+ (43?), but wait, 45 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe a CH2
