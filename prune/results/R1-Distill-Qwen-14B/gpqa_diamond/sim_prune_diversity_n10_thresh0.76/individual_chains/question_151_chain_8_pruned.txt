Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a vector in 3D space, I think. Then there's this observable P, which is a matrix operator. The matrix P has its first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0).

The question is asking for the probability that measuring this observable P will yield 0. Hmm, right. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of an observable are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P, and then determine which eigenvalue is 0, and calculate the probability of the system being in that eigenstate.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P is a projection operator, since sometimes observables can be projection operators. But I'm not sure. Let me think. The eigenvalues of a projection operator are 0 and 1. So if P is a projection operator, then the possible outcomes are 0 and 1. But the question is asking about the probability of getting 0. So maybe I should proceed under the assumption that P is a projection operator. Let me see.

But first, let me write down the matrix P in a clearer way.

P is a 3x3 matrix:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Wait, that looks a bit like a permutation matrix but with some sqrt(2) factors. Maybe it's a symmetric matrix. Let me check: yes, it's symmetric because element (1,2) is same as (2,1), and (2,3) same as (3,2). So P is a Hermitian matrix, which makes sense because observables are represented by Hermitian operators.

So to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Alternatively, maybe I can guess the eigenvalues or find a pattern. Let me see. The matrix P looks like:

0    a    0
a    0    a
0    a    0

Where a = 1/sqrt(2). Hmm, perhaps it's easier to work with a variable a for now.

So the matrix is:

[ [0, a, 0],
  [a, 0, a],
  [0, a, 0] ]

Let me compute the eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(P - λI) = 0.

So the matrix P - λ I would be:

[ -λ   a      0   ]
[ a   -λ     a    ]
[ 0    a    -λ   ]

Hmm, the determinant calculation for a 3x3 matrix. Let's compute this determinant.

The determinant can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let's expand along the first row.

The determinant is:

-λ * det( [ -λ   a
           a   -λ ] ) 
- a * det( [ a    a
           0    -λ ] )
+ 0 * ... (so that term is zero)

So the first term is -λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - a*a ] = -λ (λ² - a²)
The second term is -a [ a*(-λ) - a*0 ] = -a [ -aλ ] = a² λ
The third term is zero.

So the determinant equation is:

-λ (λ² - a²) + a² λ = 0
Factor out λ:

λ [ - (λ² - a²) + a² ] = 0
So λ [ -λ² + a² + a² ] = 0
Which is λ [ -λ² + 2 a² ] = 0

So the eigenvalues are when this expression is zero. So either λ=0, or -λ² + 2a² =0.

Solving -λ² + 2a² =0 → λ² = 2 a² → λ= ± sqrt(2) a.

But wait, a was 1/sqrt(2), so sqrt(2) a is sqrt(2) * (1/sqrt(2)) )=1. So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1? Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate that.

Wait, a is 1/sqrt(2).
