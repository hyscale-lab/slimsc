Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Since we're dealing with both strong and weak acids and a strong base, I'll have to figure out the net reaction after mixing all the solutions.

Let me list out the information given:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each substance in each solution. Molarity is moles per liter, so I'll multiply molarity by the volume in liters.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity = 0.1 M, Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L.
Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl:
Molarity = 0.2 M, Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L.
Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2:
Molarity = 0.3 M, Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L.
Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Wait, but barium hydroxide is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely into Ba²+ and OH⁻ ions. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH⁻ ions. So the moles of OH⁻ will be 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the acids in the solution are CH3COOH and HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl⁻. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. But for the neutralization reaction, I think the strong acid will donate H+ ions, and the strong base will donate OH-.

So, let's think about the total H+ and OH-.

HCl provides 0.08 moles of H+.
CH3COOH provides some H+; but since it's weak, let's see how it reacts with the OH-.

Wait, but when you mix all these solutions, the total volume changes. So I should first calculate the total volume of the mixture.

Total volume = 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

Now, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. The H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles, but wait, when you mix with a strong base, the OH- will react with H+.

The reaction between H+ and OH- is: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So first, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from HCl. Let's see:

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Moles of OH-: 0.18. So OH- is in excess. The excess will be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining.

Wait, but wait a second. What about the acetic acid? Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it can donate H+ ions, but when we add a strong base, does the OH- react with the acetic acid first before the strong acid's H
