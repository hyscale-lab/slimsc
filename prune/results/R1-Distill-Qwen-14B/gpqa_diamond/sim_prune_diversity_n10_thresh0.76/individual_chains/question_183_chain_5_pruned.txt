Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency in the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us how many rings or double bonds are present in a molecule. Each degree can be a double bond or a ring. So the index is calculated based on the formula.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the starting material. The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me visualize it. The main ring is a cyclohexene (so a six-membered ring with one double bond). The numbering is such that the formyl group is at position 2, the vinyl group at position 5, and the carboxylic acid at position 3 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene).

Wait, cyclohex-3-ene means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, right? So the ring has a double bond there. The substituents are at positions 2 (formyl), 5 (vinyl), and 3 (carboxylic acid). Wait, no, the carboxylic acid would be at position 3 because the double bond is between 3 and 4. So, in the ring:

Carbons 1,2,3,4,5,6. Position 3 is where the double bond starts. So the substituents are:

- Position 2: formyl group (CHO)
- Position 3: carboxylic acid (COOH)
- Position 5: vinyl group (CH2CH2?), wait no, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

Wait, wait. Let me draw it mentally. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond at 3-4. Then at position 2, there's a formyl group (so a carbonyl group attached). At position 5, a vinyl group (CH2=CH-). And at position 3, is the carboxylic acid. Wait, no, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 3? Or is the numbering different? Wait, the numbering for the substituents in the name would be such that the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group, so that gets the lowest possible number. Hmm.

Wait, cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid: the carboxylic acid is at position 1, perhaps? Because the suffix 'oic acid' takes priority, so the numbering starts from the carboxylic acid. Let me think again. Wait, the parent chain is cyclohexene. So the numbering starts from the end closest to the double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at carbons 2, 3, and 5.

Wait
