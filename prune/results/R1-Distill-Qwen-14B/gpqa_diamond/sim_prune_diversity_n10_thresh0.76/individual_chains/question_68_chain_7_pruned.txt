Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equals gamma times S_z. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. Then suddenly, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment.

Wait, I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes too. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the Hamiltonian is probably something like H = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma S_z, and B is in the Y direction after the change, the new Hamiltonian would be proportional to S_y.

But wait, spin operators and their commutation relations. Spin matrices for S_x, S_y, S_z. For spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Specifically, S = (ħ/2) sigma, where sigma are the Pauli matrices. But wait, in the problem, mu is given as gamma S_z. So mu = gamma S_z. So the initial magnetic moment is along Z.

Wait, but when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B = - gamma S_z * B (but wait no, because B is now in Y direction, so mu · B would be mu_y times B. Oh wait, no, mu is a vector. So when B is along Y, the dot product mu · B is mu_y * B. But mu is gamma S_z, which is along Z. So mu_y would be zero? That can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, or perhaps mu = gamma S_z? The problem says mu = gamma S_z. Oh wait, no: the problem says mu equals gamma times S_z. Wait, that's a bit confusing because S_z is just one component of the spin. So mu would be a vector whose z-component is gamma times S_z, but the other components would be zero? Hmm, that can’t be right because if the spin is in a state with S_z = ħ/2, then mu_z would be gamma*(ħ/2), but the other components (mu_x, mu_y) would be zero. But wait, that's not how magnetic moments work. Oh, perhaps the question is just defining mu as a vector where each component is gamma times the corresponding spin component. So mu = gamma * S. That would make more sense because then the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin vector.

Wait, maybe I should reread the question. It says, mu = gamma * S_z. Oh, no, wait, that's ambiguous. Is mu a vector or a scalar multiplied by S_z (a component)? Because the problem says "magnetic moment mu equals gamma times S_z". Hmm, perhaps mu is a vector where each component is gamma times the respective spin component. That is, mu_x = gamma S_x, mu_y = gamma S_y, mu_z = gamma S_z. Because otherwise, if mu is only in the z-direction, then when the field is turned to Y, the dot product would be zero, and the energy would be zero. That doesn't make sense for oscillations.

So assuming mu is proportional to the entire spin vector, so mu = gamma S. Then the initial magnetic moment is along Z because the field is along Z. The Hamiltonian when the field is along Z is H_initial = - mu · B_initial = -gamma S_z B. So the energy levels are determined by S_z, which are ± gamma B (since S_z is ± ħ/2, but maybe the constants are absorbed? Wait, let's think in terms of angular momentum and the Hamiltonian.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the system after the field is switched. Initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of S_z, so its spin is either up or down along Z. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes H = - mu · B, which now is proportional to S_y. So H = - gamma S_y B.

So the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. Since the system was in an eigenstate of S_z before the switch, it's now in a state that's not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. Hence, the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment. So we need to find <mu_z> as a function of time and determine its frequency.

Since mu_z = gamma S_z, the expectation value <mu_z> is gamma times the expectation value of S_z in the state.

So to find <S_z(t)>, we can model the time evolution under H = - gamma B S_y.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). Wait, but here, H is proportional to S_y. Let's write H as H = - gamma B S_y = - gamma B (i ħ/2) sigma_y, since S_y = i ħ/2 sigma_y. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to work in units where ħ = 1.

Wait, perhaps I should express H in terms of the Pauli matrices. Let me recall that S_x = ħ/2 sigma_x, S_y = ħ/2 sigma_y, S_z = ħ/2 sigma_z.

So, H = - mu · B = - gamma S · B. Since B is along Y, B = (0, B, 0). So H = - gamma S_y B.

Substituting S_y = ħ/2 sigma_y, H = - gamma (ħ/2 sigma_y) B.

So H = - (gamma ħ B / 2) sigma_y.

But for the purposes of finding the oscillation frequency, perhaps we can write H in terms of sigma_y, and then find the energy levels and the time evolution.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to diagonalize H and find the energy eigenstates.

Alternatively, since the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z, and the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, the state will precess around the Y axis, leading to oscillations in S_z.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the time evolution of S_z under the Hamiltonian.

Wait, the Heisenberg equation of motion for an operator A is dA/dt = (i/ħ)[H, A].

So for S_z, dS_z/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_z].

H is proportional to S_y, so [S_y, S_z] = i ħ S_x. Because the commutator [S_j, S_k] = i ħ epsilon_{jkl} S_l, where epsilon is the Levi-Civita symbol.

So [S_y, S_z] = i ħ S_x.

So [H, S_z] = [ (- gamma B S_y), S_z ] = - gamma B [ S_y, S_z ] = - gamma B (i ħ S_x )

So dS_z/dt = (i/ħ) ( - gamma B i ħ S_x ) = (i)(- gamma B i) S_x ) = (gamma B) S_x.

Wait, let me compute this step by step. So,

[H, S_z] = [ - gamma B S_y, S_z ] = - gamma B [S_y, S_z] = - gamma B (i ħ S_x )

So the commutator is - gamma B i ħ S_x.

Then,

dS_z/dt = (i/ħ) * ( - gamma B i ħ S_x )

Simplify:

i * (- gamma B i ħ S_x ) / ħ.

The i and (-i) multiply to (i*(-i)) = 1.

So,

(i * (-i)) = 1.

So,

= [ gamma B (1) * S_x ].

So,

dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x.

Similarly, what about dS_x/dt?

Using Heisenberg equation,

dS_x/dt = (i/ħ) [H, S_x ] = (i/ħ) [ - gamma B S_y, S_x ] = (i/ħ) (- gamma B [S_y, S_x ])

[S_y, S_x] = -i ħ S_z.

So,

= (i/ħ) (- gamma B (-i ħ S_z )) )

= (i/ħ) (gamma B i ħ S_z )

= (i * i) gamma B S_z )

But i * i is -1.

So,

= - gamma B S_z.

So,

dS_x/dt = - gamma B S_z.

Similarly, what about dS_y/dt? Hmm, but perhaps that's unnecessary for this problem.

So we have a system of differential equations:

dS_z/dt
