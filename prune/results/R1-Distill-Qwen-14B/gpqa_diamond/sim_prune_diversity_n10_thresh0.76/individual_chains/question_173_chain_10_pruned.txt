Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. It says: An electron is traveling with a speed v = 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its location is Δx = 0.1 nm. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron. The options are A to D, each with different orders of magnitude.

Hmm, I remember something about uncertainty principles from my studies. Oh right, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle! That's probably what I need here. The principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously.

The formula I recall is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, sometimes the equation is written without the 1/2 factor, like Δx * Δp ≈ ħ. Maybe for this problem, the exact coefficient isn't too crucial since it's about an order of magnitude estimate.

So first, I'll need to calculate the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Once I have Δp, I can relate it to the uncertainty in energy. But wait, how does Δp relate to ΔE? Oh, right, because energy and momentum are related, especially considering the kinetic energy of the electron.

Wait, let me think. The kinetic energy E is given by (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. Since ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, perhaps I can express ΔE in terms of Δp. Alternatively, maybe using the uncertainty principle's relation between energy and time? No, wait, the problem gives an uncertainty in position, not time. So I think I should stick to position and momentum.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate Δp using the uncertainty principle.
2. Find the relationship between Δp and ΔE.

Starting with step 1. The uncertainty principle says Δx * Δp ≈ ħ. So Δp ≈ ħ / Δx.

What's the value of ħ? Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718 x 10^-34 J·s. For an estimate
