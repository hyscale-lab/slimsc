Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, let's think. The question involves Pauli statistics, conservation of angular momentum and parity. I remember that when particles are identical fermions, their total wavefunction has to be antisymmetric under exchange. So the spin, orbital angular momentum, and other quantum numbers have to combine in a way that makes the overall wavefunction antisymmetric.

The initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. Wait, what's the 1S0 mean again? Oh right, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so for 1S0, that's S=0, L=0 because 'S' is the spectroscopic notation. So L=0, S=0, and J is also 0 since J = L + S. So the NN state is spin-singlet, zero orbital angular momentum, and total angular momentum zero.

They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The problem says that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is the isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So the equation is T = S + L + 1 (mod 2). The given T(NN) is 0. So substituting, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Since the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, let's plug in.

So 0 = 0 + 0 +1 mod 2. That would be 0 = 1 mod 2, which is 0=1, which is not true. That can't be right, so I must have misunderstood the equation. Wait, wait. The problem says T = S + L + 1 (mod 2). So T is 0, S is 0, L is 0. So 0 = 0 + 0 +1 mod 2 → 0 =1, which is false. That can't be. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the term symbol. Oh wait, the initial state is 1S0. So 2S+1 is 1, which means S=0. L is S in spectroscopic notation? No, wait, the term is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 is S=0, L=0, J=0.

So the condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So T=0, so 0 = (0) + (0) +1 mod 2 → 0=1, which is impossible. That suggests that perhaps the equation is T = S + L + something else. Wait, maybe the equation is T = S + L + parity of X or something else. Or maybe the equation is T = (S + L) mod 2, but the question says T = S + L +1 mod 2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I got the equation wrong. The problem states: "Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)."

Wait, no, the equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So for the final state, which is the same NN system, right? Because the system emits a particle X, so the NN are in a final state. Oh, wait, no. The NN are the initial state, and after emitting X, they become the final state. Wait, wait. Let me re-read.

The initial state is NN in 1S0. They emit X, so the final state is NN plus X. Or wait, wait, maybe the final state is the NN system with different quantum numbers. No, no, the problem says "the final NN state has T(NN)=0." So the NN after emission are in a state with T=0.

Wait, that's confusing. So the initial state is NN in 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. The final state is NN after emitting X, so their quantum numbers change. The final NN state has T=0.

So the equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So T=0. So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = -1 mod 2 → which is 1 mod 2. So S + L must be odd. So S and L must have opposite parity (one even, one odd).

But the initial state is S=0, L=0, which are both even. So after emission, the final NN state has S and L such that their sum is odd. So either S is even and L is odd, or S is odd and L is even.

Wait, but the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0. So when they emit X, their spin and orbital angular momentum may change? Or does it involve the orbital angular momentum due to the emission?

Wait, maybe the process is that the NN emits a particle, so their relative orbital angular momentum may change. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a decay process. The initial state is NN in 1S0, and they emit a particle X, so the final state is NN in some state plus X.

Wait, but the problem says "the final NN state has T(NN)=0." So the NN system after emission has T=0. So the question is about what possible
