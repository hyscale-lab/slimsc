Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond. The examples given are Cope and Claisen rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically controlled, meaning they form the more stable product.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different starting materials and conditions. I need to figure out each product and match them with the options provided. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction 1:
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like a molecule where the central nitrogen is attached to two methoxy groups and an ethyl group. So, structure-wise, it's (CH3O)2NCH2CH3. But wait, I think the actual structure is more like CH2=N(OCH3)2. Because ethan-1-amine has NH2CH2CH3, but with two methoxy groups on the nitrogen? Hmm, not sure, but maybe it's (CH3O)2NCH2CH3.

But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CHCH2OH. Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=C(OH)CH2. Oh wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is (CH2)2CHOH with a double bond between C2 and C3. So structure is CH2=CHCH2OH? No, wait, but the formula is but-3-en-2-ol. Oh, but butenol would be four carbons. So positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between C3 and C4, but wait that can't be because but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2-CH3? No, maybe I should write it as CH2=CHCH(OH)-. Wait, maybe it's CH2CH2 but that can't be. Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol: the structure would be CH2CH2(OH)CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2=CHCH2OH. Wait, but that's but-2-en-1-ol. Wait, maybe I messed up the numbering. Let's see: but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2(OH)CH2, but how? Maybe it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but that would be pentenol. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CHCH2OH. Or perhaps CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3 but with a double bond. Hmm, perhaps but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3 but with a double bond between C3 and C
