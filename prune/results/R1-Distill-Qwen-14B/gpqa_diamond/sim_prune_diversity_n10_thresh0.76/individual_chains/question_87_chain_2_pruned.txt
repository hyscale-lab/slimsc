Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total, and there are peaks in the FTIR indicating a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, let's think about the structure. A 6-membered aromatic ring with two substituents. The total carbon count is 8, so the ring itself has 6 carbons, leaving 2 more carbons from substituents. Wait, no, wait, the substituents can add more. Wait, the compound is di-substituted, so the ring has two substituents. Each substituent would add some carbons beyond the ring.

Wait, the molecule has 8 carbons in total. The ring is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 carbons. But wait, substituents can be like two single substituents each adding one carbon, or maybe one substituent adding two. Hmm.

But wait, the IR has a carbonyl. So the substituents might include a ketone or an aldehyde. Oh, but wait, another substituent has an aromatic-halogen bond, so one of the substituents is a halogen, like Cl or Br. So maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) and a halogen.

Wait, but in a benzene ring, substituents can be in different positions. Let's think about possible structures. Let me consider the possible substituents.

The substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. So the compound is something like para-substituted or meta-substituted. Wait, but the ring is di-substituted, so two substituents: one carbonyl (like a ketone) and a halogen.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the carbonyl could be part of a substituent. For example, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, so maybe a benzophenone structure but in a 6-membered ring). Or maybe it's an aldehyde, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm in the NMR. Let me think.

Wait
