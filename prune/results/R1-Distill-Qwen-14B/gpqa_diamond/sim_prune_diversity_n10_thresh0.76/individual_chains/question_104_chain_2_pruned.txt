Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the question says that two stars with the same mass as our Sun have each been found to host a planet using the RV method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. 

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. I remember that the radial velocity method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble. The shift is related to the mass of the planet and its orbital period, I think.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ (some exponents)). Oh wait, maybe another approach. I recall that the RV method's semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star.

More accurately, the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * P) / (2π) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * c )

But since the planet mass is much smaller than the star's, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so that part simplifies. Also, since both stars have the same mass (solar masses), and the planets are Neptune-like, the M_p for each is similar, so maybe we can ignore their masses as a factor. Wait, but in reality, the formula relates K to the planet's mass and the orbital period. So let's think about how K relates to the period and other variables.

Wait, let me get the formula correct. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (2π)^(1/3) * c )) ) * (1 / P
