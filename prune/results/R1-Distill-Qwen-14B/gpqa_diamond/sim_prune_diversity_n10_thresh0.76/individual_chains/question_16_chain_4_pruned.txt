Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic chemistry. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a compound has chiral centers. So I need to figure out which of these compounds have chiral centers and maybe consider any other factors that could affect optical activity, like meso compounds or internal planes of symmetry.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, this structure... So the double bond is between C1 and C2. At C1, there's a Cl and a CH2CH(CH3) group. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, but-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl-C=CH-CH3? No, wait 2-methyl would mean a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl on C1, and C2 has a methyl and double bond to C1.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2. But wait, but-1-ene means four carbons with double bond starting at 1: so position 1 and 2. So the molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, 2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-? No, wait butene is four carbons, so but
