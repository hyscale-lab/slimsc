Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, I remember from my physics and math classes that divergence has something to do with how a vector field spreads out or converges. And Gauss's Law comes to mind, which relates the divergence of an electric field to the charge enclosed. Wait, but this problem isn't about electric fields directly, but the principles might be similar.

So, the vector field is purely radial and its magnitude is 1/r². Let me write down what I know about the divergence in spherical coordinates. For a vector field that only has a radial component, the divergence is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r), where A_r is the radial component of the vector field. In this case, A_r is 1/r².

Wait, so substituting A_r into the divergence formula: ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Let me compute that. r² multiplied by 1/r² is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. That would make the divergence zero everywhere except maybe at the origin.

Wait a minute, but wait. If the divergence is zero everywhere except r=0, then the integral of the divergence over any volume that doesn't include the origin would be zero. But if the volume does include the origin, like in this case where it's a sphere of radius R, then the divergence isn't defined there because r=0 is the center.

So the integral of the divergence over a volume that includes the origin. But wait, I thought about Gauss's Law. If I have a vector field like this, which is similar to the electric field of a point charge, but let's think. The electric field of a point charge is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q/r²) r̂, and its divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it has a delta function due to the charge
