Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The question says we need to calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as ħ/2 multiplied by specific 2x2 matrices.

Wait, the question is about finding the normalized eigenvector. So I need to find a vector that, when the operator P acts on it, gives the same vector multiplied by +ħ/2.

First, I remember that the operator P is a vector operator, so it's like the sum of its components multiplied by the respective direction unit vectors. But wait, the direction given is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the operator we're concerned with is P along n, which would be P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But wait, n is in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero. Oh right, because the x-z plane means any direction where y-component is zero. So n = (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, but the problem says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane." So I need to construct the operator P_n as a combination of P_x and P_z. Because the y component of n is zero, so P_y won't contribute.

So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me write down each component matrix:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

But since n_y is zero, we don't need P_y here.

So P_n = (n_x * P_x) + (n_z * P_z) = (ħ/2) [n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix.

Matrix for P_n:

First element (1,1): (n_x * 0) + (n_z * 1) → n_z
(1,2): n_x *1 → n_x
(2,1): same as (1,2) because the matrix is symmetric for P_x and P_z.
(2,2): n_x*0 + n_z*(-1) → -n_z

So the matrix is:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]] multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, no. Because each P_x and P_z are multiplied by ħ/2. So when we take n_x P_x, it's n_x * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], and same for n_z and P_z. So the total is:

(ħ/2) * [
