Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting from Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. I need to figure out each step and identify which statement is incorrect.

First, Compound A is C3H6. I remember that C3H6 can be either propene (propylene) or cyclopropane. But considering the first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride, which is a nonpolar solvent. Bromination of alkenes is typically done via addition, so maybe A is propene.

So, propene (CH2=CHCH3) undergoing bromination (probably with Br2 in CCl4) would add bromine across the double bond. That forms 1,2-dibromopropane, which is compound B. So B is CH2BrCHBrCH3.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually causes elimination reactions. Since B is a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent Br atoms), when treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it should undergo dehydrohalogenation—elimination of two HBr molecules. So, the two Brs are on adjacent carbons; removing them would form a double bond. So the product C would be propene again, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, wait. B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When two Brs are adjacent, elimination would give either 1-propene or 2-propene, but since the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane, the elimination would produce propene (CH2=CHCH3) again. Hmm, but that's the same as A. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 mechanism, so the geometry might not matter here. So C is propene.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. The dihalide is 1,2-dibromopropane. When you treat it with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So yes, it would eliminate both Br atoms and form propene. So compound C is propene again.

Next, compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube. I think that refers to a dehydrohalogenation or possibly some kind of
