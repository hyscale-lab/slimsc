Okay, so I've got this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts, δ0 to δ4, and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that phase shifts are related to partial waves in scattering theory. 

Wait, the scattering amplitude, right. The general formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) involves a sum over all the partial waves, each with a coefficient involving the phase shift. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k²) Σ ( (something) * e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l) ) ... Oh wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Oh right! The scattering amplitude f for each partial wave l is given by f_l = (1/(k)) * [ (something with the Legendre polynomials) * e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ] or maybe it's f_l = (1/(2ik)) [ e^{i δ_l} (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) ]? No, maybe that's not quite right. Wait, I think the formula is f_l = (1/(2ik)) [ (e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ) ] times the spherical Bessel functions or something? Wait, no, perhaps it's simpler.

Wait, in the case of elastic scattering, the scattering amplitude for each partial wave is given by f_l = (1/(2ik)) (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) * (2l + 1) * something? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me recall the basic expression.

Oh yes, the scattering amplitude for each partial wave l is f_l = (1/(k)) * [ (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) * (u_l) ], where u_l is the unitary transformation. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f_l = (1/(2ik)) * (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) * (2l + 1) * something? Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, another approach: the total scattering amplitude f is a sum over
