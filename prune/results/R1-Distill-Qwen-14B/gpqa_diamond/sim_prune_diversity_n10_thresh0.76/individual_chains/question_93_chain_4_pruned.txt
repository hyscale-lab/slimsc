Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about qPCR and a calibration curve that a scientist made. I remember that qPCR is used to quantify the amount of a specific nucleic acid in a sample. The calibration curve helps determine the starting quantity based on the Ct values.

The scientist used a positive control with known copy numbers and diluted it in serial dilutions. He ran three technical replicates for each concentration. The efficiency was 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect, so each cycle doubles the target. RÂ² being 1 implies a perfect linear relationship, so the data fits the model well. The slope is -3.3. Wait, what's the usual slope value? Oh right, the slope for a standard qPCR curve is usually around -3.33 or -3.3, which makes sense because of the logarithmic relation. So that's normal.

Looking at the results, each concentration has three Ct values. Let's see the Ct values across the concentrations. Starting from 100,000 copies, the Ct's are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. Then 10,000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Next, 1000: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. Then 100: 24, 24.3, 24.6. Finally, 10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3.

Wait, wait. I'm supposed to find the discrepancies. Let's look at each set. For each concentration, the Ct values are about 0.3 apart. For example, 33.9, 34.2 is a 0.3 difference. That's within what's considered acceptable for technical replicates, I think. Usually, a variation of less than 0.5 cycles is okay. So the deviations here are within acceptable range. So option D says the deviation is more than 0.3, but in reality, it's exactly 0.3 or 0.33. So maybe D is not the issue.

But looking at the Ct values, do they make sense with the concentration? The higher the concentration, the lower the Ct. Because with more copies, you reach the threshold faster. So 100000 has a higher Ct (33.9) than 10 copies (20.7). That makes sense because lower copy number gives a lower Ct.

Wait, but looking at the data, each ten-fold dilution (like from 100000 to 10000 is a tenfold decrease) leads to a change in Ct of about 3.3 cycles. Because 33.9 - 30.6 is 3.3. Similarly, 30.6 -27.3 is 3.3, and so on. So each tenfold dilution is about a 3.3 Ct change. That's exactly what you'd expect with 100% efficiency and a slope of -3.3. So that's correct.

But the question says there are discrepancies. Hmm. Wait, the options: option C says ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. But in this case, each ten-fold is exactly 3.3. So that's correct, not a discrepancy. So C isn't the issue.

Option B is about Ct values not agreeing with target amount. But according to the data, they do. Each tenfold decrease in copy number leads to a 3.3 cycle increase, which aligns with theory.

Option A says qPCR can't be used for quantification. But the results are consistent with the theory, so qPCR is working fine. So A is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The question is about the discrepancies in his results. So perhaps the Ct values are not varying as expected
