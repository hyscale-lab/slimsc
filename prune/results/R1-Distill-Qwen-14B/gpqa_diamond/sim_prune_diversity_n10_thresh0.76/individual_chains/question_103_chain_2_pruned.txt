Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can be tricky. But I'll take it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about finding the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps. I need to figure out the right order.

First, I'll visualize the target molecule. It's a phenyl group substituted with two groups: a nitro group (NO2) and a bromo (Br) group. The ketone is on the ethanone part, which is attached to the benzene ring. Wait, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 of the benzene ring, and the ketone is at position 1. So the benzene has three substituents: a nitro at position 5, a bromo at position 3, and the ketone (from ethanone) at position 1.

Wait, wait. Actually, the name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ethanone. So the structure is: the benzene ring has a substituent at position 3 (Br), another at position 5 (NO2), and the ethanone is attached at position 1. So the substituents are at positions 1 (the ketone comes from the ethanone), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2). So the ring has three substituents in the 1,3,5 positions, which are meta to each other when considering each pair.

Wait, no. Let me think. Benzene is a six-membered ring. If the ketone is in position 1, the Br is in position 3, and the nitro is in position 5, that's correct. So all three substituents are in the 1,3,5 positions, which are all meta to each other. That suggests that the substituents have been introduced in a way that allows each new substituent to be added in a position that's meta to the existing ones, which probably involves activating and deactivating groups.

Now, the
