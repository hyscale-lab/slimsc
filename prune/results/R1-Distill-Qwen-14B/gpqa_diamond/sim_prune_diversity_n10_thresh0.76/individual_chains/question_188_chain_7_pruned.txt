Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work it out. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the unit cell and some formula involving Miller indices and lattice parameters.

The problem states that the crystal is rhombohedral, which I think means all the edges are of equal length, but the angles between them aren't necessarily 90 degrees. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral system, all a, b, c are equal, and all angles α, β, γ are equal too. So in this case, α = β = γ = 30 degrees, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance? Oh, wait, maybe that's the lattice parameter 'a'? Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be the same as 'a', but for other structures, it might vary. But for a rhombohedral structure, I think a is the edge length, so maybe that's 10 Angstroms here.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember the formula for interplanar spacing is d_{hkl} = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )) )). Wait, is that right? Or was it another formula? Oh right, the general
