Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let me read the question again. So, for part A, there's a starting material: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Then it's treated with BuLi followed by H+. BuLi is a strong base, so I'm thinking maybe it's an elimination reaction or some kind of conjugate addition.

Wait, the starting molecule is a benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is OCH2CH(C(CH2) something... Let me draw it. The substituent is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl, which is connected to benzene. So, structure-wise, the benzene has a group like OCH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)-CH2... Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH2-CH=CH-? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond between carbons 2 and 3? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with the substituent on the first carbon. So, the structure is OCH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So, the oxy is connected to CH2, which is connected to the butenyl group.

Let me break it down. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. So, the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH
