Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let's try to work through it. Hmm, the question is about the probability of an atom decaying after a certain time, given that it hasn't decayed yet.

Alright, the setup is this: we have an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it's decayed. But wait, we're told that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. Now, we need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, no, the next 150 minutes after the 50 that have already passed. So total time would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, the initial 100 minutes probably refers to a certain time frame.

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me read the question again. The decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So after 100 minutes, 32% of the atoms would have decayed. But we're considering a single atom, so it's a bit different. Since each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, which follows an exponential decay model, I think.

Oh right, the decay process is memoryless. So the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So even if 50 minutes have
