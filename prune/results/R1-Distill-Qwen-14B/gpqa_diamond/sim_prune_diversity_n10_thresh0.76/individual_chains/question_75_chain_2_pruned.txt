Okay, I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. So, the setup is that the researcher introduced a coding sequence for GADD45G with an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with this plasmid and are using Lipofectamine for that. But when they check, the protein isn't overexpressed. They looked at the sequence of the plus strand, and I need to figure out what's wrong.

Let me look at the options again. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about each possibility.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Hmm, the construct includes a HA tag at the N-terminus. If there's a missense mutation in the HA sequence, that would mean the tag isn't correctly made. But wait, the HA tag is probably at the beginning of the coding sequence. So if the tag has a mutation, maybe the protein isn't expressed because the cloning is wrong. Or perhaps the tag disrupts proper processing. But without knowing the exact sequence, it's hard to say, but I'll keep this in mind.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. A premature stop codon would cause this. If the construct has a stop codon (like TAG, TGA, or TAA) in the middle, the ribosome would stop early, making a truncated protein. But the question is about the plus strand sequence. Let me look for in-frame stop codons in the given sequence. The reading frame would be determined from the start codon, which is at the beginning. The first part of the sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine, start codon. I'll scan through the sequence.

Looking at the sequence: The first few codons are ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA etc. Let me write them out as triplets. ATG is Met. TAC is Tyr. CCC is Pro. ATA is Ile. CGA is Arg. TCC is Ser. AGA is... wait, AGA is a stop codon? No, wait. AGA is arginine. Wait, no, the stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA. So I need to look for those. Let's translate a few parts.

Looking at the sequence, I'll go through in triplets. Let me take the first part:

5' ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TCC AGA GAA GCT GCC ... etc.

Wait, the codons are in the mRNA. The DNA is plus strand, so the mRNA would be the same as the plus DNA, except T becomes U. So, the first codon is ATG, which is the start. Then TAC is Tyr. Next is CCC (Pro), then ATA (Ile), CGA (Arg), TCC (Ser), AGA (Arg), GAA (Glu), GCT (Ala), GCC (Ala)... So far, no stop codons. Hmm, but wait, looking further down:

Wait, I see a part that says TGA. Let me look. Let's split the DNA into triplets. Let me look for the exact spot.
