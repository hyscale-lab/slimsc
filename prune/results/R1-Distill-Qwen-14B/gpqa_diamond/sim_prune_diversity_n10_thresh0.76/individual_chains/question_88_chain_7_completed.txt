Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice science question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about an experiment involving rotavirus and some immunological processes. Let me break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is that they've tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP. They delivered these to mice via oral gavage. Then, they used in vivo imaging and observed two main issues: some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cell population. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain gene, they saw high variability. The question is asking which process is taking place.

Hmm. So the key here is the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene after immunization. I remember that during an immune response, B cells undergo several processes that affect their antibody genes.

Let me think about the options:

Option A: Somatic hypermutation. I recall that this is a process where B cells can mutate their antibody genes after the initial antigen binding. This happens in the germinal centers during the immune response. Somatic hypermutation increases the diversity of antibodies, which explains the high variability in the variable regions.

Option B: Complement activation. The complement system is involved in enhancing the immune response, maybe by marking pathogens for destruction. But I don't think it directly causes changes in the variable regions of the antibodies. So probably not this one.

Option C: Class switching recombination. This is when the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG) changes. The variable regions aren't altered here; it's more about the constant region. So this wouldn't explain high variability in the variable heavy chain.

Option D: VDJ recombination. Wait, VDJ is during the formation of the initial B cell receptor. This happens during lymphocyte development in the bone marrow. Each B cell gets a unique combination of V, D, and J segments. But the question is about after the initial immune response, right? Because they're sequencing after immunization, so VDJ is already done. Somatic hypermutation happens later.

So putting it together: The experiment involved immunizing mice (oral, so it's an immune response), and the B cells in the Peyer patches are proliferating. The high variability in the variable heavy chain suggests that the genes are being mutated. That points to somatic hypermutation.

Wait, but where does this happen? Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. So after the rotavirus is taken up, the B cells in the Peyer patches would be activated. In the germinal centers, they undergo somatic hypermutation and selection. So the cells they isolated are likely germinal center B cells, which have undergone this process.

So the correct answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence was observed in the Peyer patches, and sequencing the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating cell population revealed high variability. This variability suggests a process that alters the antibody genes after the initial immune response.

- **Option A: Somatic hypermutation**  
  This process occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, where B cells mutate their antibody genes to increase diversity. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene, making it a strong candidate.

- **Option B: Complement activation**  
  While the complement system enhances immune responses, it does not directly alter the variable regions of antibodies. Therefore, this option is unlikely.

- **Option C: Class switching recombination**  
  This process changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not affect the variable regions. Thus, it does not explain the observed variability.

- **Option D: VDJ recombination**  
  VDJ recombination occurs during the initial development of B cells in the bone marrow, generating unique antibody combinations. However, this process has already occurred by the time of immunization, so it cannot account for the post-immunization variability observed in the experiment.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in germinal centers during the immune response. This process is consistent with the observations in the experiment.

Answer: A
