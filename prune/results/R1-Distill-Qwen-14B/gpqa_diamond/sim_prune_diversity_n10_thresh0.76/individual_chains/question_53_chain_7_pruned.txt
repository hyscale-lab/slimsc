Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows an ester group, so that tells me there's an ester functional group present. Ester groups typically show a strong absorption around 1730-1750 cm⁻¹ in the IR spectrum, so that makes sense.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let me break down each signal description.

First, two signals correspond to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons can have varying splitting depending on the substituents. But wait, aromatic protons in di-substituted rings can be ortho, meta, or para. But without knowing the substituents, it's a bit tricky. But the number of signals can help. Two signals suggest maybe two sets of aromatic protons. Like, maybe two equivalent sets, perhaps if the substituents are in the para position, each set is equivalent. Or perhaps it's ortho and para, but with some symmetry.

Next, two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets if they're on a double bond, like in an ester group. Wait, esters have a carbonyl group attached to an oxygen, which is connected to an R group. If that R group is an alkyl chain with a double bond, or possibly part of a substituent like a vinyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, the vinyl-H in NMR are split based on neighboring protons. A doublet would mean each proton has one neighbor. So perhaps they're adjacent on a double bond. A doublet of quartets could mean each proton is next to another set of protons. Maybe a coupling between the vinyl protons and another set, like from a CH2 group? But wait, the problem states there are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Hmm, that's interesting. So any CH2 groups must be in a way that their signals are missing, perhaps due to equivalence or being in a different environment.

Then, two signals for –CH3 groups. Those are typically singlets if they're attached to an electronegative atom or in an environment with no neighboring Hs. But wait, if they're attached to an oxygen (like in an ester), maybe they are part of a methyl ester. Or maybe they are attached to another part of the molecule.

Putting this together: the molecule has an ester group, so the structure might involve a benzene ring with an ester substituent. Let me think of possible structures.

A di-substituted benzene with an ester group. The ester would be O-CO-O-R, but more accurately, esters are R-O-CO-R', so maybe one substituent is an ester. Wait, but the ring is di-substituted, so perhaps one substituent is the ester group, and the other is another group, maybe a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like benzene with two substituents: one is an est
