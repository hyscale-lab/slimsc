Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay reaction.

The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. And the pion is stationary. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very tiny masses, but in these kinds of problems, I think we usually neglect the neutrino's rest mass compared to the others. So the neutrino's mass might be considered zero for this calculation.

So the problem is to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. Right, because in a decay, the initial rest mass energy gets converted into the rest mass of the products plus their kinetic energies. Since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite to conserve momentum. That's an important point.

Let me write down what I know:

Initial particle: Pi+ (at rest)
Decay products: mu+ (mass m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²) and nu (mass m_nu ≈ 0 MeV/c²).

The initial energy is just the rest energy of Pi+, which is 139.6 MeV.

The decay must conserve both energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

Let me denote the energy of the muon as E_mu and the neutrino as E_nu. Since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its energy is just its kinetic energy, right? Because E = pc for massless particles. So E_nu = p_nu * c.

Similarly, the muon's energy will be its rest mass plus kinetic energy. So E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu.

But let's think in terms of four-momentum. The total four-momentum before decay is (E_initial/c, 0), where E_initial = m_pi c². After decay, the four-momenta of mu and nu add up.

So the sum of their energies is E_initial, and the sum of their momenta is zero.

So E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

And the magnitudes of their momenta are equal and opposite, so |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

But for the muon, E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2.

And for the neutrino, E_nu = p c.

So putting it all together:

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

E_nu = p c

And E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c².

So substituting E_nu into the energy equation:

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c = m_pi c².

Let me let x = p c. Then the equation becomes:

sqrt( x² + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + x = m_pi c².

Wait, but m_mu c² is 105.7 MeV, and m_pi c² is 139.6 MeV.

So substituting the numbers, the equation is:

sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6.

Let me call this equation (1):

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x.

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root.

Left side: x² + (105.7)^2.

Right side: (139.6 - x)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

The x² terms cancel out.

So:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute the squares.

105.7^2 = approx (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

139.6^2: Let's see, 140^2 is 19600. So 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So plug back in:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x.

Wait, because 2*139.6 is 279.2.

So rearranging:

279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 -11172.49:

Let me subtract:

19488.16
-11172.49
= (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 -0.49) → 8316 - 0.33 → 8315.67?

Wait, 19488.16 minus 11172.49.

19488.16
-11172.49
= 8315.67 (because 19488 - 11172 is 8316, and 0.16 -0.49 is -0.33, so 8315.67).

So 279.2 x = 8315.67.

Solving for x:

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Approximate:

279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67.

So 30 gives 8376, which is 60.33 higher than 8315.67. So 30 - (60.33/279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

279.2 * 29.784 = 279.2 *29 + 279.2 *0.784.

29 *279.2 = 279.2 *30 = 8376 → 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

0.784 *279.2 ≈ 279.2 *0.7 = 195.44; 279.2 *0.08 = 22.336; 279.2 *0.00
