Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Okay, the question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a given spin state. The state is (3i, 4), right? And they've provided the sigma_y matrix as well.

Wait, I remember that for expectation values, the formula is the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, then multiplied by the state vector. So, like, if the state is |ψ>, the expectation value <S_y> is ψ† σ_y ψ. Oh wait, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on whether I need to consider the reduced Planck constant ħ here.

Right, because in quantum mechanics, spin operators are often written with ħ. For example, S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. Oh yeah, because the spin angular momentum is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. So the operator S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the sigma_y matrix given.

So the state vector is (3i, 4). Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state is usually a column vector. So our state ψ is [3i, 4]^T. The conjugate transpose, ψ†, would then be [ -3, 4i ] because the first component is 3i, so its conjugate is -3? Wait, no. Wait, the original state is (3i,4). So ψ is [3i,4]^T. So the conjugate transpose, ψ†, would be [ -3, 4i ] because (3i)* is -3i? Wait, no, wait: (3i)* is -3i? Wait, no, wait: (a + b i)* is a - b i. So 3i is 0 + 3i. Its conjugate is 0 - 3i, which is -3i. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ] ?

Wait no, wait. Let me double-check. The original state is [3i,4]^T. So the conjugate of each component: the first component is 3i, so its conjugate is -3i. The second component is 4, which is real, so its conjugate is 4. So ψ† is a row vector: [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, wait again. Wait, wait: (3i)* is actually -3i? Because 3i is the same as 0 + 3i. The complex conjugate would flip the sign of the imaginary part, so it's 0 -3i, which is -3i. Oh right. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

But wait, when I do matrix multiplication, I think I need to multiply ψ† (a 1x2 matrix) by σ_y (a 2x2 matrix), then by ψ (a 2x1 matrix). So let's write down σ_y:

σ_y is [[0, -i],
         [i, 0]]

So the expectation value is ψ† σ_y ψ.

Wait, but let me think about the steps. So first, I need to compute ψ† σ_y, then multiply by ψ.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute σ_y multiplied by ψ first, then multiply by ψ†.

Let me compute σ_y times ψ. ψ is [3i,4]^T.

So σ_y ψ is:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) + 0 *4 = 3i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, multiply ψ† [ -3i, 4 ] by this vector.

Wait, ψ† is a row vector, so it's [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, wait, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ]? No, wait: ψ is [3i,4]^T. So ψ† is [3i 4]^* , which is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† multiplied by (σ_y ψ) is [ -3i, 4 ] times [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Hmm, wait, no, let me think: the multiplication is (ψ†) (σ_y ψ) which is a scalar, the inner product.

So it's the sum of the products of the corresponding elements.

So:

First component: (-3i) * (-4i) = (3i)(4i) = 12 i². i² is -1, so that's 12*(-1) = -12.

Second component: 4 * (-3) = -12.

Adding these together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by this because S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y.

Wait, because σ_y is just the Pauli matrix, and S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. So the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the expectation value of σ_y, which was (-24).

Wait, wait. Wait, no, because S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So the expectation value is <S_y> = (ħ/2) <σ_y>.

So the expectation value of σ_y is (ψ† σ_y ψ) = (-24). So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, that doesn't match any of the options. Wait, let's check the options again.

Options are:

A) -12*hbar/25

B) 12*hbar/25

C) 25*hbar/2

D) -25*hbar/2

Hmm, my calculation gives -12 ħ, but the options don't have that. So something's wrong in my calculation.

Wait, where did I go wrong? Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ψ† σ_y ψ.

Wait, let me recalculate ψ† σ_y ψ.

ψ is [3i, 4]^T.

So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ] (since (3i)* is -3i, and (4)* is 4).

Compute σ_y ψ: 

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) +0*4 = 3 i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, compute ψ† (σ_y ψ): [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i, -3 ].

Wait, the inner product is the sum of products of each component.

So:

(-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

4 * (-3) = -12.

Sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So yes, that part seems correct.

So <σ_y> is -24. Then <S_y> is (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12 ħ.

But wait, the options don't have -12 ħ. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the state is not normalized. Because expectation values require the state to be normalized (i.e., ψ† ψ = 1). Let me check ψ† ψ.

ψ is [3i,4], so ψ† ψ would be (3i)*(3i) + 4*4.

Wait, (3i) is the first component, (3i)* is -3i. So ψ† ψ is (-3i) * (3i) + (4) * (4).

Wait no, wait: ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ] and ψ is [3i,4].

So ψ† ψ is (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4).

Compute each term:

(-3i)(3i) = -9 i² = -9 (-1) =9.

4*4=16.

So sum is 9 +16 =25.

Ah! So the state isn't normalized. So when calculating the expectation value, I need to normalize it by dividing by the norm squared.

Wait, right, because the expectation value is given by (ψ† A ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ), where A is the operator.

So in this case, the expectation value of σ_y is (ψ† σ_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ) = (-24)/25.

So <σ_y> = (-24)/25.

Then <S_y> is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-12 ħ)/25.

Which matches option A.

Ah, so that's where I went wrong. I didn't normalize the state. So the correct expectation value is -12 ħ /25, which is option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the formula:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \psi^\dagger \psi \) (Normalization)
The state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \) has the conjugate transpose \( \psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \). The norm squared is:

\[
\psi^\dagger \psi = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.
\]

Thus, the state is not normalized, and we must divide by \( \psi^\dagger \psi = 25 \) in the expectation value calculation.

### Step 2: Compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \)
The Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) is given as:

\[
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

First, compute \( \sigma_y \psi \):

\[
\sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, compute \( \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) \):

\[
\psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).
\]

Calculate each term:
- \( (-3i)(-4i) = 12i^2 = 12(-1) = -12 \),
- \( (4)(-3) = -12 \).

Thus:

\[
\psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) = -12 - 12 = -24.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \langle S_y \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
