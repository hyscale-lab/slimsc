Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, the question is about figuring out the distance the ejecta travels from the galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, I think this has something to do with reference frames and maybe special relativity because we're dealing with high speeds.

Let me read the problem again. The supernova's ejecta is moving directly towards the center. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, wait. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s? Or is it the other way around?

Wait no, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Oh, right, because in relativity, the speed is the same in either frame when considering relative motion. So if the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v in the ejecta's frame, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at v, which is 60,000 km/s.

Wait, no. Because in special relativity, when two objects are moving towards each other, each sees the other approaching at the same speed relative to them. So if the ejecta's frame measures the Galaxy moving at v, then the Galaxy
