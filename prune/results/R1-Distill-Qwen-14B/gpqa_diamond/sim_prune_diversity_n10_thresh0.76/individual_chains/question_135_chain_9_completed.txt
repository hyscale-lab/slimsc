Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question gives me the Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I should parse this correctly. Oh right, the term probably represents the interaction between the boson X and fermions ψ_f. So the interaction is something like a Yukawa coupling, maybe? Because Yukawa interactions typically have a term like g ψ ψ X, but the exact form might vary.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, what particles can X decay into, considering their masses?

Right, in particle physics, for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than the mass of the boson. Because, you know, energy and mass are related, and the decay products can't be more massive than the original particle.

So first, I need to figure out which fermions can be produced by X. The possible decay channels would be X → f f̄, where f is a fermion.

Looking at the Lagrangian, it involves ψ_f, so I think X couples to all the fermions ψ_f. But wait, in the Lagrangian, the term is λ f f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe that's a typo, or perhaps it's a different notation. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction term is something like λ X ψ_f ψ_f. So X couples to fermions of type ψ_f.

Wait, the given Lagrangian is a bit unclear to me. Let me re-express it. The interaction term is -λ f f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it's supposed to be something like X ψ ψ? Or maybe the term is -λ (ῡ + X) ψ ψ, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, could it be that X is interacting with each fermion type ψ_f, and that the interaction term includes λ times X times the product of two ψ_f fields?

Assuming that X couples to all fermions, the possible decay products would be any fermion-antifermion pair, provided their combined mass is less than X's mass.

So X has a mass of 6 GeV. Let me list the masses of the known fermions (excluding the top quark, which is way heavier than 6 GeV). The fermion masses are approximately:

Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
Up quark (u): ~0.0035 GeV
Down quark (d): ~0.0047 GeV
Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
Bottom quark (b): ~4.13 GeV
Top quark (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, but the top quark is way too heavy because 173 GeV is way beyond 6 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks.

Now, when X decays, it must produce a pair of fermions. So the total mass of the two fermions (each of which is half the pair) must be less than 6 GeV. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The sum of their rest masses must be less than the mass of X. Because when a particle decays, the energy available is the rest mass energy of X, and the decay products must have a total invariant mass less than or equal to that.

Wait, no, actually the rest mass of the parent is the total mass of the decay products when they're produced at rest. So when X is at rest and decays, each fermion can have some kinetic energy, but their rest masses must be such that each is less than X/2. Because if a fermion has mass m, the other must have at least m as well. So the sum would be 2m ≤ m_X → m ≤ m_X/2.

Wait, that's correct. Because for each fermion in the pair, their rest mass must be less than or equal to half the mass of X. Because if X is at rest, each daughter particle has to have enough energy to have their rest mass, and the other has to have the rest of the energy. So for example, if X is 6 GeV, the maximum mass of each fermion would be 3 GeV. Because 3 +3 =6. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

So looking at the fermion masses:

e, μ, τ: all are well below 3 GeV.

Quarks: u, d, s, c, b. Let's see their masses:

u: ~0.0035 GeV → yes
d: ~0.0047 → yes
s: ~0.095 → yes
c: ~1.27 → yes
b: ~4.13 → wait, 4.13 is greater than 3 GeV. Because 4.13 is more than 3, so b quarks can't be produced. Because X is 6 GeV, and each b would require at least 4.13 GeV, but 4.13*2 is 8.26, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks.

Wait, so if X is 6 GeV, and the maximum allowed for each fermion is 3 GeV, then the bottom quark at 4.13 GeV is too heavy. So X can't decay into b quarks. So any option that includes b quarks as decay products is invalid.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar etc. So since X can't decay into b's, this option is wrong.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, etc. c is 1.27 GeV, so each c is 1.27 ≤ 3 GeV → allowed.

Option C: includes t tbar → which is impossible as t is 173 GeV, way too heavy. So option C is wrong.

Option D: includes b bbar → can't happen. So option D is wrong.

Wait, wait, so the possible decay products are any fermion pairs where each fermion has mass ≤3 GeV.

So the fermions that satisfy this are:

e, μ, τ (each less than 3 GeV)

u, d, s, c (each less than 3 GeV)

But not b or t.

So the possible decay channels are:

X → e+ e−, μ+ μ−, τ+ τ−,

u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

So looking at the options, which one lists these correctly.

Option A: Includes b, which is wrong. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Doesn't include b. So B is X → c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So correct.

Option C: Includes t, which is wrong. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Includes b, which is wrong. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau, mu, e.

Yes, that's all the allowed fermions except b.

So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait wait, but what about the top quark? It's not in any of the options except C. But in our case, X is 6 GeV, and top is 173 GeV, so no decay to top.

So the allowed are all fermions except b and t.

So the correct decay channels are all the fermion pairs except b and t.

Looking again at options:

Option A has b, so no.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Yes.

Option D includes b, so no.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. For a boson to decay into a pair of fermions \( f \bar{f} \), the rest mass of each fermion must be less than or equal to half the mass of the boson (\( m_f \leq m_X / 2 \)). This ensures that the total energy of the decay products does not exceed the rest mass energy of \( X \).

The fermion masses are approximately:

- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 0.0035 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.13 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

Since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the maximum allowed fermion mass is \( m_X / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Fermions with masses greater than 3 GeV (\( b \) quark at \( 4.13 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( t \) quark at \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \)) cannot be produced in the decay of \( X \). Therefore, the kinematically allowed decay products of \( X \) are:

- \( e^+ e^- \)
- \( \mu^+ \mu^- \)
- \( \tau^+ \tau^- \)
- \( u \bar{u} \)
- \( d \bar{d} \)
- \( s \bar{s} \)
- \( c \bar{c} \)

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since the \( b \)-quark mass exceeds \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since the \( t \)-quark mass is \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \), far exceeding \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Hence, this option is incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decay products of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
