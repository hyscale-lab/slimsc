Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to picture the structure. So, cyclohexanone with substituents on carbons 3 and 5. Carbon 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (so that's -CH2OH), and carbon 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2CHCH2 group, but with the double bond at the first position. So it's CH2-C(CH2)-? Wait no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2? No. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached to C2. So it's CH2CH2- but as a substituent. Oh wait, no. Let me think. The structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2- where the substituent is attached to the middle carbon (C2). So that would be isopropenyl group. So, the substituent is CH2-C(CH2-) where? Wait, perhaps it's CH2-C(CH2)-, no, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the first and second carbon. So for prop-1-en-2-yl group, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-, but attached via the middle carbon (C2). So, the substituent is CH2-C(CH2-), but perhaps that's getting a bit tangled. Maybe it's better to think of it as a vinyl group attached to another methyl. Wait, maybe it's an isopropenyl group. So, for example, structure is CH2=C(CH2-) something.

So, the starting compound is a cyclohexanone (so a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 1). At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is CH2-CH-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the substituent is CH2=C(CH2)- attached to the ring at position 5.

Alright, now the first reaction step is treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide. NaH is a strong base, typically used to deprotonate compounds, especially those with acidic protons like those in alcohols, phenols, amines, or carbonyl alpha positions. Since the starting material has a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), which is an alcohol, NaH would de
