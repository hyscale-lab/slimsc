Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a scientific experiment involving rotavirus and some immunological processes. Hmm. Let's break it down step by step.

So, the setup: They tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave it to mice orally. Then, through imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid. Others got stuck in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. But they managed to identify fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability. The question is about which process is happening.

Wait, what do I remember about rotavirus and immune responses? Rotavirus is a virus that causes diarrhea, right? The inner capsid proteins are probably the VP6 or something like that. But the GFP tagging is for tracking.

Stomach acid is strong, so some proteins would be broken down. But the ones that make it past the stomach and through the intestines... Oh, wait, but the mucus in the intestines can trap things. But how do they get to the Peyer patches?

Peyer patches are specialized areas in the small intestine's mucosal lining. They're part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are important for immune responses against enteric pathogens. So when the rotavirus proteins reach the Peyer patches, they probably interact with immune cells there.

They isolated the proliferating cell population. Proliferating cells in the immune system are likely B cells undergoing division. High variability in their variable heavy chain genes—variable regions are part of the B cell receptor, which is crucial for recognizing antigens.

Now, the processes listed: somatic hypermutation, complement activation, class switching, VDJ recombination.

I think VDJ recombination happens during B cell development in the bone marrow. It's when the V (variable), D (diversity), and J (joining) gene segments are recombined to form the heavy chain. But that's before the cells go to the periphery, and it's a primary diversification.

Somatic hypermutation occurs after the B cell has been activated by an antigen. It's a process where the variable regions of the B cell receptor are mutated, increasing the diversity and affinity for the antigen. This happens in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer patches, I think. So when B cells are activated, they undergo somatic hypermutation, leading to different variants of the same B cell receptor. That would explain the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

Class switching is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), which is also a process that happens after activation. But the question is about the variability in the variable region, not the constant region. So probably not class switching.

Complement activation is part of the immune response, but it's more about opsonization and lysis of pathogens, not about the variation in B cell receptors.

So putting it all together: the GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins are delivered, some make it to the Peyer patches. The B cells there recognize the antigens, get activated, and start proliferating. During this proliferation, they undergo somatic hypermutation to increase the diversity and specificity of their receptors. So the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is due to somatic hypermutation.

Wait, but wait—another thought. When B cells are activated, they can also undergo VDJ recombination again? No, I think VDJ happens early in development. Once the B cell receptor is formed, any further changes come from somatic hypermutation.

So the correct process here is somatic hypermutation. So the answer should be option A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Fluorescent Peyer patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells reveals high variability. The question asks which process is responsible for this variability.

Peyer patches are specialized lymphoid tissues in the small intestine that play a key role in mucosal immunity. When rotavirus proteins reach these patches, they interact with immune cells, such as B cells, which recognize the antigens. Proliferating B cells in these patches undergo processes that increase the diversity of their B cell receptors.

Among the options provided:

- **VDJ recombination** occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, where variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are recombined to form the heavy chain. This process is not relevant here, as the experiment involves mature B cells in secondary lymphoid tissues.

- **Class switching recombination** involves the switch in the class of antibody produced by B cells (e.g., from IgM to IgG). However, this process does not explain the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes, as it primarily affects the constant region of the antibody.

- **Complement activation** is a part of the immune response that targets pathogens for destruction but does not involve changes to the B cell receptor itself.

- **Somatic hypermutation** is a process that occurs in activated B cells after antigen recognition. It introduces mutations in the variable regions of the B cell receptor, increasing diversity and affinity for the antigen. This process explains the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cell population in the Peyer patches.

Given the context of the experiment and the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes, the process taking place is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
