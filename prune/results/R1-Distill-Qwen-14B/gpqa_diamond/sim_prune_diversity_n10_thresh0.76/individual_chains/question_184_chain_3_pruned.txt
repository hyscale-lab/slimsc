Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The question gives four options, A to D, each with a series of reactions. I need to determine which sequence will yield the desired product with high yield.

First, let me try to draw the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: an ethoxy group (OEt) at the para position relative to the tert-butyl group, a nitro group (NO2) at the meta position relative to the tert-butyl, and the tert-butyl group itself. Wait, actually, let me get the numbering right. For benzene rings, the numbering starts with the substituent in the first position, then others are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. So, if the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3, that makes sense. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.

Wait, no, benzene is a ring, so the positions are ortho, meta, para. Let me think: The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, numbering the benzene ring starting with the ethoxy as position 1. Then the tert-butyl is position 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and nitro is position 3 (meta to ethoxy, adjacent to tert-butyl).

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the benzene ring. Let me sketch it mentally. The substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So, ethoxy and tert-butyl are at ortho positions, and then nitro is at meta. So, the substituents are at 1, 2, 3 positions.

Now, to synthesize this, I need to perform a series of electrophilic substitutions on benzene. The order of substitution matters because each substituent will direct the next substitution.

Let's think about each substituent's directing effects:

1. tert-Butyl group: It's a bulky, para-directing group because it's an activating (electron-donating) substituent. Wait, no, wait. Wait, tert-butyl is an alkyl group. Alkyl groups are activating, so they are electron-donating via +I effect. So, they are ortho/para directors. But because they're bulky, when directing, steric hindrance can cause para to be more favored if possible.

2. Ethoxy group: OEt is an ether group. The oxygen is more electronegative, so the lone pairs on oxygen can donate into the ring, activating it. So, OEt is an activating, ortho/para director. But, wait, when the substituent is an ether, the ring is activated, so it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.
