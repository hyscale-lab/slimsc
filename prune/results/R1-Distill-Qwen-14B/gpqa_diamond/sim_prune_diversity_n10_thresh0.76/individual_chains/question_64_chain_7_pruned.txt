Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex. But let's take it step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand each part.

The question says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams was heated to 200°C without air. When heated, a mixture of gases formed. These gases were passed through several tubes: first anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. The results were: tube 1 gained 3.60g, tube 3 gained 0.80g (forming CuO), and tube 2 didn't change. Then, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. Okay, let's break this down. 

First, I think the heating caused the salts to decompose. Since there's no air, it's likely a thermal decomposition reaction. The products are gases, which then reacted in the tubes.

Looking at the tubes:

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent. It probably absorbs water because when Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, it reacts with water. So if the weight increased by 3.60g, that suggests that water was present. So the gas mixture contained water vapor. So Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb H2O, forming Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, which increases the tube's mass.

Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 is a solution. If the gas passed through didn't change its weight, maybe no CO2 was present. Because CO2 would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. If the solution's weight remained the same, it means perhaps there was no CO2 in the gas. Or maybe it was already neutralized elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the gas didn't contain any acid gases that would react with Ca(OH)2.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that any CO2 was already absorbed by the first tube, but that doesn't make sense as Mg(ClO4)2 doesn't react with CO2. Wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent but doesn't react with CO2. So if the gas in tube 2 didn't change weight, perhaps there's no CO2. Or maybe the solution wasn't basic enough. Wait, Ca(OH)2 solution is strongly basic, so any acidic gas like CO2 would react. So if the solution didn't change, maybe there's no CO2 in the gas. So maybe the gas after the first tube had no CO2, meaning that all CO2 was already removed before?

Wait, but the first tube is anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. It's supposed to absorb water. So maybe the gas mixture after heating contains H2O, CO2, and perhaps other gases. The Mg(ClO4)2 would take the H2O, but the
