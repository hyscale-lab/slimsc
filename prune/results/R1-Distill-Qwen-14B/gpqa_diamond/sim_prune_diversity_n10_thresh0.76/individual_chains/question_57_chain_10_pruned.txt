Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons, and I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, okay, I remember that scattering amplitude has something to do with the differential cross-section or something like that. 

Wait, the question gives me these phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh right, phase shifts are used in partial wave expansions for scattering amplitudes. So each phase shift corresponds to a certain angular momentum state, right?

I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all the partial waves. The general formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) P_l(cosθ) ), where k is the wave number, l is the angular momentum quantum number, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. 

But wait, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. That means θ=0°, because the incident beam is along the direction we're measuring. So for θ=0, the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) because cos(0)=1. 

I remember that P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 give 1 for any l. Wait, let me think about that. P₀(x)=1, P₁(x)=x, so at x=1, it's 1. P₂(x) is (3x² -1)/2, so at x=1, it's (3-1)/2=1. Similarly, all P_l(1) are 1. So the sum becomes (1/k) Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) * 1 for each term.

So the imaginary part of f(θ) when θ=0 would be the imaginary part of each term in the sum multiplied by (1/k). Let's write that out. For each l, the term is
