Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again. The question is about dissolving a certain amount of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in water using a strong acid. The goal is to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, I think I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and can react with a strong acid like HCl. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O. Right, so each mole of Fe(OH)3 would react with 3 moles of HCl.

First, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have. The problem states it's 0.1 grams. Let me calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron (Fe) is about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and hydrogen (H) is 1 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol. So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles.

Wait, let me double-check. 106.85 is Fe (55.85) + 3(OH-), each OH is 17. So 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51= 106.85. Yeah, right. So 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol is approx 0.0009359 mol, which is about 9.36e-4 moles.

Now, since each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl, the moles of HCl needed would be 0.000936 *3= 0.002808 moles.

The acid solution is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration. So volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but wait—the options given have 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So that's probably one part of the answer.

Wait, but the problem says "minimum volume"—maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait, no, because I'm just calculating the stoichiometric amount needed to fully dissolve the Fe(OH)3. But wait, I should think about whether all of it would dissolve. Because Fe(OH)3 is a weak base; maybe in solution, not all of it will dissolve unless the acid is in excess. Hmm, but the question says, "the minimum volume needed to prepare the solution"—so I think it's the exact amount to react completely, not considering any excess for solubility. So the volume I calculated, 28.08 cm³, should be the minimum.

Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. Hmm, but wait, what about the pH part?

After dissolving Fe(OH)3 with HCl, the solution will contain FeCl3. FeCl3 is a strong electrolyte and will dissociate completely in water. FeCl3 → Fe³+ + 3Cl⁻. So the solution will have Fe^3+ ions, which are hydrolyzing in water to form H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

So the pH depends on the concentration of Fe³+ ions. Let's find the concentration first.

The total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³ (given) plus the volume of the acid. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the problem says 100 cm³ is the total volume. So if I add V cm³ of acid solution, the total volume is V_acid + V_water = 100 cm³. So V_water is 100 - V_acid.

Wait, no. The question states that the total volume is 100 cm³. So the initial solution is 100 cm³ in volume. The acid is added to this. So the acid volume added (V) plus the solvent (water) would
