Okay, so I've got this question about transmission electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So, the setup is that Mike is designing a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. That's really low pressure, so there shouldn't be many gas molecules around. But some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer. 

Mike determined the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the size of the compartment. The formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T temperature, d diameter of molecules, and P pressure. Or wait, maybe it's (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P * N_A), no, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up some terms.

But the key point is that when the electron beam is turned on, the mean free path changes to λ2 instead of staying λ1. The question is why λ2 is different. The temperature remains the same, so T doesn't change. 

What's the mean free path dependent on? It's inversely proportional to pressure. Lower pressure (rarer gas) means longer mean free path. So if the pressure in the compartment is the same, why would λ change? Because the electron beam is affecting the gas somehow.

Wait, when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. Do they interact with the gas molecules? Yeah, the electrons can cause electron-molecule interactions. One possibility is that the gas molecules get ionized by the electron beam. If they ionize, the ions have a different charge, maybe they get accelerated or something. But wait, in a vacuum, if the gas molecules are ionized, they might get pulled into the electron beam or maybe stick to the chamber walls, which are at a different potential.

Another thought: when the electron beam is on, it might cause gas molecules to be excited or ionized, leading to a change in the effective pressure. Or perhaps the electron beam heats the gas molecules, increasing their temperature. But the question states the temperature remains the same, so that's not it.

Wait, in the presence of an electron beam, the gas molecules might get charged, either positively or negatively. If these charged particles (ions or electrons) are accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope, they might move towards the walls or other parts of the chamber. This could cause the neutral gas molecules to be depleted in certain regions or perhaps cause the gas to be pumped away more efficiently. Alternatively, the charged particles could create more collisions, changing the mean free path.

Wait, another angle: when the electron beam is on, it's a high-energy beam. High-energy electrons can cause gas molecules to undergo various processes, like dissociation or even being expelled from the compartment. So the presence of the beam might reduce the number of gas particles in the compartment, effectively lowering the pressure. If the pressure decreases, the mean free path should increase. Because mean free path λ is inversely proportional to pressure. So if P goes down, λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Wait, but wait. If the electron beam removes gas molecules, then the pressure in the sample compartment would decrease. If the pressure is lower when the beam is on, then the mean free path λ would be higher because λ is proportional to 1/P. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

So the options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

Wait, the question says that when the beam is on, the mean free path is no longer λ1 but λ2. So we're to figure out whether λ2 is bigger or smaller than λ1.

If the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be lost, then P decreases, so λ increases. So λ2
