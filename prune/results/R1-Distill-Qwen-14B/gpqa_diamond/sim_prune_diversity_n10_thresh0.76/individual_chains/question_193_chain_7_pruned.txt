Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given a specific relationship between the number of stars and parallax.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, distance r = 1 / plx. That makes sense because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

The question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, when they say the number varies with 1/plx^5, that means N ∝ 1/plx^5. I need to express this in terms of distance r because the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance.

Since r is 1/plx, I can solve for plx in terms of r. Let's see: plx = 1/r. So substituting that into the equation for N, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Wait, let's compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5?

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. If N ∝ 1/plx^5 and plx = 1/r, then N ∝ 1/( (1/r)^5 ). Let's compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5. Taking the reciprocal, 1/(1/r^5) is r^5. So yes, N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars is proportional to the fifth power of the distance. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as r^5.

Wait, but wait again. The question says "how does the number of stars change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)"? Hmm, so maybe I should think about the derivative or the rate of change. Let me think. If N(r) is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars per unit distance would be the derivative of N with respect to r. Because per unit r, it
