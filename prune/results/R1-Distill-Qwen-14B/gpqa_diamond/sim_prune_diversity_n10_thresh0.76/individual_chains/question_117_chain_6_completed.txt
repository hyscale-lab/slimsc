Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. Let me think about each of the given compounds.

1. The first one is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected in a way that they can rotate? Wait, but if the substituents are on the same positions (like both 6 and 6' have nitro groups, and 2 and 2' have methyl esters), does that allow for any kind of stereoisomerism? Oh wait, I think biphenyl compounds can have some kind of stereoisomerism if the substituents are in positions that prevent free rotation. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is about whether the molecule could have chiral centers. Wait, the structure here: the biphenyl has two substituents on each ring. But wait, the 6 and 6' positions are on each phenyl, so maybe the central bond is single, allowing rotation. So the substituents on each ring are in specific positions. But whether the molecule has a chiral center? Let me think. The central part is the biphenyl with ester groups. The substituents are at 2 and 2', so each has an ester. But are there any chiral centers? Hmm, in the ester groups, like the methyl ester. The ester group itself isn't a chiral center. So maybe this compound doesn't have any chiral centers. But wait, maybe the structure is such that the two rings are connected in a way that creates a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are symmetrical, then maybe no optical isomerism. So I'm thinking this one might not show optical isomerism.

Wait, wait, another possibility: if the biphenyl rings have substituents that make the entire molecule asymmetrical. Like, if each ring has nitro and ester groups in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Then, could it have a chiral center elsewhere? Or maybe it's due to the biphenyl's configuration. Oh wait, biphenyls can have diastereomers based on the relative positions of the substituents. But I'm not sure if that leads to optical isomerism. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, no. But in this case, the substituents are at 6 and 6', and 2 and 2'. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So each ring is identical in substituents. So the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, so no optical isomers. So I think this one doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

2. Next is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure here is: the ester is from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the formula is OMe-O-C-O-C, wait, no. Let me draw it mentally. The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is (CH3)COHCOOH. Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (CH3)CH(OH)COOH? Wait, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, its ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the COOH becomes COOCH3, and the OH is on the adjacent carbon. So the structure is OMe-O-C-O-C-(CH2)CH(OH)CH3? No, wait. Let me think again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. When esterified, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2-COOCH3? No, the structure is more like CH2CH2COOCH3, but with an OH on the middle carbon. So the molecule has a hydroxyl group and an ester group on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but does that create a chiral center? Let's see: the central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to what? The structure would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoate has three carbons: the first (COO-) is on the end. So 2-hydroxy would be the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2(OH) attached to CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that's two CH2 groups. Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let's think: the formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, no: 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon of propanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the 2nd carbon is the middle one. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but the structure would then be:

The central carbon (second carbon) has OH, two CH2 groups, and the COOCH3 group. So the four substituents are: OH, CH2CH2COOCH3, two CH2 groups? No, wait, let's think. The central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- One OH group,
- One CH2 group (leading to the COOCH3),
- Two CH3 groups? Wait no. Let me think of it as:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- OH,
- A CH2 group on one side (which is connected to the COOCH3),
- And two CH2 groups? No, perhaps not. Let me think again. The molecule is:

Carboxylic acid group: COOCH3.

The two carbons before that are CH2 and CH2(OH). So the structure is:

(CH2)2(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- OH,
- One CH2 (connected to the COOCH3),
- And two other CH2 groups? No, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think I should break it down. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is an ester derived from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is:

CH3-CHOH-COOH.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. But wait, that would make it a three-carbon chain: the first carbon is CH3, the second is CH(OH), the third is COOH. When esterified, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, the carboxylate is on the third carbon, so 2-hydroxy would be on the second. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps drawing the structure would help. So, the molecule is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- OH,
- Two CH2 groups (one connected to the first carbon, which is CH3, and the other connected to the third carbon, which is COOCH3).

Wait, no: the second carbon is connected to:

- OH,
- One CH2 (from the first carbon),
- One CH2 (from the third carbon? No, wait, the third carbon is the COOCH3. So the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
- And another CH2? No, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: -CH(OH)-
Carbon 3: -CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Oh, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the structure as:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- OH,
- One CH2 group (which is connected to the first carbon, which is CH3),
- Another CH2 group (which is connected to the third carbon, which is the COOCH3 group),
- And another CH2?

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the molecule as having a structure where the second carbon has four different groups attached. Because if it does, then it's a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

So, for the second carbon (the one with OH), the four substituents would be:

1. OH,
2. CH3 group (from the first carbon: CH2-),
3. COOCH3 group (from the third carbon: CH2-),
4. And the fourth substituent is another CH2 group? No, wait, perhaps it's a single bond, so the substituents are:

Wait, maybe the second carbon is bonded to:

- One hydroxyl (OH),
- Two CH2 groups (each leading to different parts),
- And the COOCH3 group.

Wait, no, that's four substituents:

Wait, the second carbon is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2CH3,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and a hydrogen?

No, wait, wait. Let's think again. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, that's three carbons. So the second carbon is CH2, but no, wait: if it's CH2(OH), then the structure is:

CH2(OH) connected to CH2, which is connected to COOCH3.

So the second carbon is CH2, which is attached to:

- OH,
- A CH2 group (which connects to the first carbon, which is a CH3),
- A COOCH3 group (from the third carbon),
- And another CH2 group? Or perhaps not.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, that would make the second carbon a CH(OH) connected to:

- OH,
- Two CH3 groups (from the first carbon),
- And the COOCH3 group.

Wait, but that would make the substituents: OH, two CH3, and COOCH3. So the central carbon has two identical substituents (two CH3), which means it's not a chiral center. So no, that would mean that the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the actual structure. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is an ester where the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. The ester would be CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3. So the structure is:

CH3 - CH(OH) - COOCH3.

So the second carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- OH,
- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
- And another CH group (the third carbon is attached to the COOCH3 group, so the second carbon has another CH group connected to it).

Wait, no. The second carbon would be CH(OH), connected to:

- OH,
- A CH3 group (from the first carbon),
- A COOCH3 group (from the third carbon),
- And a CH2 group? Or perhaps it's a CH2 group. Wait, no, the third carbon is the one with the COOCH3, so the second carbon is connected to the third carbon as CH2? Or is it directly connected?

Wait, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH(OH)-
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So the second carbon is attached to:

- OH,
- CH3 (Carbon 1),
- COOCH3 (Carbon 3),
- And another CH2 group? Or is it two CH2 groups?

Ah, wait. Carbon 2 is CH(OH), connected to Carbon 1 (CH3), Carbon 3 (COOCH3), and a hydrogen? No, that can't be right because that would make it a CH2 group. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the structure is such that the central carbon (Carbon 2) has four different substituents. Because if that's the case, then it's a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, Carbon 2 in the structure:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So what are the substituents on Carbon 2?

- One OH,
- One CH3,
- One COOCH3 (which is a carbonyl group attached to OCH3),
- And one CH2 group (the one leading to Carbon 3? No, wait, Carbon 3 is the COOCH3. Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

Wait, Carbon 2 is connected to:

- OH,
- CH3 (from Carbon 1),
- COOCH3 (from Carbon 3),
- And a single bond to the next carbon (which is Carbon 3's group, but that's a carbonyl group, so perhaps that's a C=O-OCH3).

Wait, no, that's not correct. The substituents on Carbon 2 are:

1. OH,
2. CH3,
3. COOCH3,
4. And a CH2 group connected to the next carbon (Carbon 3 is the carbonyl, so maybe the substituent is a CH2 group leading to the carbonyl).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to count the substituents. Carbon 2: CH(OH) is attached to:

- OH,
- CH3 (from Carbon 1),
- COOCH3 (from Carbon 3),
- And a hydrogen? Or another substituent.

Wait, no, Carbon 2 is in the middle of the chain. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3,
Carbon 2: CH(OH),
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3,
- Carbon 3: COOCH3,
- OH,
- and a hydrogen? Because if Carbon 2 is CH(OH), then it has four bonds: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and a single bond to another carbon? No, wait, that's only three substituents. So maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps Carbon 2 is connected to two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH2-CHOH-COOCH3. No, that doesn't make sense for 2-hydroxypropanoate. Oh wait, no, it's propanoate, so only three carbons. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

Wait, but that would make Carbon 2 as CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3 (Carbon 1),
- COOCH3 (Carbon 3),
- OH,
- and a single bond to another CH group? No, that would be four substituents. Wait, I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether this molecule has a chiral center. If the central carbon (Carbon 2) has four different groups attached, then yes. So, substituents attached to Carbon 2 are:

1. OH,
2. CH3,
3. COOCH3,
4. And a hydrogen? Or another group.

Wait, if Carbon 2 is CH(OH), then it has four substituents: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and a hydrogen? No, that would make four, but wait, if it's CH(OH), it's CH2(OH) perhaps? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the actual structure.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is:

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (CH3)CHOHCOOH? No, wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid as CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So when you esterify it, the COOH becomes COOCH3, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So, the central carbon is the second CH2 group. Wait, but that's a CH2 group, which is not a chiral center because all four substituents are the same (two H's on each side). Wait, no. The second carbon is CH2, so it's CH2(OH), CH2, etc. Wait, but then that's a CH2 group, not a CH group. So the substituents on the second carbon would be OH, CH2CH3, and two H's. No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is that the 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the second carbon is CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH group (the third carbon). Wait, but that would make four substituents, which are all different. So yes, that carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the second carbon is CH(OH) connected to four different groups, then it's a chiral center. So yes, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus shows optical isomerism.

So for option 2, yes.

3. Benzophenone. Structure is two benzene rings connected by a ketone. So the structure is Ar-CO-Ar, where Ar is aryl (benzene). So the molecule is diphenyl ketone. Does this have any chiral centers? No, because the central carbon is connected to two aryl groups (same on both sides), a carbonyl group, and a lone pair? Wait, the central carbon is a carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O. So the structure is:

Ar–C(=O)–Ar.

So the central carbon is a carbonyl carbon, which is trigonal, not tetrahedral. So it's not a chiral center. Therefore, benzophenone does not have a chiral center and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but what about the possibility of the molecule being planar due to the ketone? No, because the molecule is symmetric. Since both substituents are the same (benzene rings), the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. So no optical isomerism here.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. The structure of fumaric acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, with the structure CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. When esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2=C(COOCH3)CH(COOCH3)CH2? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but no, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but in the trans configuration. So when dimethyl ester is formed, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3)CH2? No, wait. Fumaric acid is (E)-HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? Or wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two carboxylic acid groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3? No, wait, more precisely, it's (CH2COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3CH3). Wait, no, perhaps it's (Z or E) arrangement.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)–CH2(COOCH3)CH2? No, wait. No, fumaric acid is HOOC–CH=CH–COOH, so the ester would be OMeOOC–CH=CH–COOCH2Me? No, more accurately, dimethyl fumarate is (Z)- or (E)-butenedioate.

Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. The structure is CH2CH2(COOCH3)CH2CH2(COOCH3), connected via a double bond. Wait, no. The correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)–COOCH3? Wait, no. Let me get it right.

Fumaric acid is HOOC–CH=CH–COOH. When esterified with two equivalents of methanol, both -COOH groups become -COOCH3. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)–COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not right. The structure should be CH2=CH–(COOCH3)2. So the molecule is CH2=C(COOCH3)–CH2(COOCH3). Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, each carboxylic acid becomes a methyl ester. So the structure is CH2=CH–(COOCH3)2. So the molecule is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Hmm, but wait, the double bond is between the two carbons, each attached to a COOCH3 group. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2–C=CH–COOCH3
|
COOCH3

No, that can't be right. Wait, the structure is:

CH2=CH–(COOCH3)2. No, perhaps it's O=C-OCH3 groups on each end. Alternatively, the correct structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the two carbons on the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So the structure is:

CH2–C(COOCH3)2–CH2.

Wait, no, the fumarate is the diethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has the structure CH2=CH(COOCH2CH3)2, but for dimethyl, it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Anyway, the key point is that the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (because fumaric acid is the trans isomer). So the molecule has a double bond with two identical groups (COOCH3) on each end, but in a trans configuration.

So does this molecule have any chiral centers? No, because the double bond doesn't have a chiral center; it's a geometric isomer. However, because the molecule has a plane of symmetry (since both substituents on each end are the same), it doesn't have a chiral center. Wait, but wait, in the case of dimethyl maleate or fumarate, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center but can have stereoisomerism due to the double bond configuration. However, optical isomerism arises only from chiral centers, not from double bonds. So, unless the molecule has a chiral center, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. For a molecule to show optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or a planar chirality, which is rare. In this case, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with substituents on each carbon. But since each substituent on the double bond is the same (each has two COOCH3 groups), the molecule is symmetrical. So, no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. Wait, but earlier I thought that because of the trans configuration, maybe it can't be superimposed on its mirror image. But wait, the actual question is about whether it shows optical isomerism due to chiral centers. So, since dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: could the molecule have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral? Let's think. The structure of dimethyl fumarate (trans) is:

O=C-OCH3
     \
CH2–C=CH–OOC-OCH3
     /
O=C-OCH3

No, wait, that's not right. The actual structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2 in the trans configuration. So each of the two carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So, the structure is symmetric. So, it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Another approach: which of these compounds have chiral centers?

1. No chiral center.

2. Yes, chiral center.

3. No.

4. No chiral center.

So looking back at the question, the options are which of the four compounds show optical isomerism.

So the correct ones are only option 2.

Wait, but looking back at option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Wait, if the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration, it's a symmetrical molecule, so no chiral centers. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, another angle: dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate, but those are geometric isomers, not optical isomers. So, no optical isomerism.

So back to the options.

Which of the four have optical isomerism?

Options:

1. No.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

So the correct answers are 2 and possibly any others?

Wait, the question is which of the four show optical isomerism.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1, 2,4 → No, because 1 and 4 don't.

Option B) 3 and 4 → No.

Option C) 2 and 3 → No, because 3 doesn't.

Option D) 1 and 2 → No, because 1 doesn't.

Wait, so none of the options have only 2. Wait, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about case 4. Let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has the structure where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester.

Does this have a chiral center? No, because the substituents on each end are the same.

Wait, but wait, what about the possibility of the molecule being chiral due to a stereogenic center elsewhere. No, the only substituents are the two COOCH3 groups on the double bond. Each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 and two H's. So, each double bond carbon is CH2 groups, but that's not right. Let me think.

Wait, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So each carbon is CH2, but that's not possible because double bonds have two substituents each. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Each end of the double bond has one COOCH3 group and one CH3 group? No, no.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me clarify.

Fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH.

So when it's converted to dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)–COOCH3.

Wait, no. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)–CH2(COOCH3). No, that's not correct. No, actually, the correct structure is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)–COOCH3.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the actual structure. The fumarate ion is the conjugate base of fumaric acid, which is in the trans configuration. So when you esterify both ends with methyl groups, each COOH becomes COOCH3.

So the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)–COOCH3, but arranged in a trans configuration.

Wait, but each of the double bond carbons has two COOCH3 groups. So each carbon is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and two H's? No, because the valency of carbon is four. So each carbon in the double bond must have two substituents besides the double bond. So, if it's (E)-dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
CH2–C=CH–COOCH3
     /
COOCH3

Wait, no, that can't be right. I think the correct structure is that each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group, but arranged trans.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and another substituent. But what's the other substituent? If the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So each carbon is CH2, but that's not possible because each would have four bonds.

Wait, this is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps I should just focus on whether the molecule has a chiral center. Since dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with identical groups on each end, it's symmetric and doesn't have a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

So the only compound among the four that shows optical isomerism is option 2.

But looking back at the options, option A is 1, 2,4. Option D is 1 and 2. So if only option 2 is correct, but the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4.

Wait, maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. How?

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each end of the double bond has a different substituent. Wait, no, because fumarate is symmetric. So no, no chiral center.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the question is about which of the four show optical isomerism. So the correct answer would be only option 2. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. Wait, the options are:

A)1,2,4
B)3,4
C)2,3
D)1,2

Hmm, if only 2 is correct, but the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-examine option 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, another thought: could the molecule have a chiral center elsewhere, not on the double bond? For example, if the ester groups are connected in a way that creates a chiral center.

No, in dimethyl fumarate, both ester groups are on the double bond. So, no, there's no chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option 1.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is biphenyl, with each phenyl ring having nitro groups at 6 and 6', and ester groups at 2 and 2'.

Biphenyls can have axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. So, for example, if the substituents are in positions that make the two rings not mirror images, the molecule can have a chiral axis, leading to enantiomers. So, for biphenyls, if the substituents are in such positions that the molecule is not planar-symmetric, then it can have optical isomerism.

So in this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, on each ring, the substituents are at 6 and 2. Now, on a benzene ring, the positions 2 and 6 are meta to each other, but in biphenyl, the positions are on each ring.

Wait, but would this arrangement create a chiral axis? Let me think. The biphenyl is connected at position 1 and 1', so the two rings are connected at that position. The substituents are at 6 and 6' on each ring, which are para positions relative to the point of connection. Also, each ring has a substituent at 2 and 2', which are ortho to the point of connection.

So, the arrangement is such that each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. Now, for the biphenyl to have axial chirality, the substituents must be arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical around the central bond.

If both rings have the same substituents (nitro and ester), and they are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. But if their arrangement leads to asymmetry, then the biphenyl could be chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6, which are on opposite ends relative to the point of connection (position 1). So, the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the overall molecule may lack a plane of symmetry.

In such a case, the biphenyl could exhibit axial chirality, leading to enantiomers. So, this molecule would show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because the substituents are on both rings in the same positions. So, if the two rings are identical and their substituents are in the same relative positions, the molecule might be symmetrical. But biphenyls with identical substituents on each ring can sometimes be symmetrical.

Wait, for example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the central bond, then it's not chiral. But if the substituents are arranged such that no such plane exists, then it's chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. For a single ring, that would mean the substituents are meta to each other. But in a biphenyl, the arrangement depends on how the two rings are connected.

If the two substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule as a whole has no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I can think of the biphenyl as being similar to 1,2-dimethylbiphenyl, which is known to have axial chirality. Wait, but in that case, the substituents are in the ortho positions on each ring.

In our case, substituents are in the 2 and 6 positions on each ring, which are meta to each other. So, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, leading to axial chirality and thus optical isomerism.

So, if that's the case, then option 1 would also exhibit optical isomerism.

If that's true, then the correct answer would include option 1 and option 2.

So, looking back at the options, option D is 1 and 2, which would be correct.

Wait, but I thought earlier that option 1 didn't have a chiral center. But now I'm considering axial chirality, which is a type of stereoisomerism without a chiral center.

Axial chirality occurs when a molecule has a central axis (like the single bond between two aromatic rings) with substituents on either side that are not mirror images, leading to enantiomers.

So, in the case of option 1, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6 positions. So, the substituents on each ring are in a way that they are not aligned in a plane of symmetry. Thus, the biphenyl would have axial chirality, leading to optical isomerism.

So, option 1 does show optical isomerism.

So, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.

Looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2.

So the answer would be option D.


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chiral centers or axial chirality.

### 1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with substituents at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. The key consideration is whether the molecule has axial chirality. Axial chirality occurs when the substituents on the two rings are arranged asymmetrically around the central bond, lacking a plane of symmetry. In this case, the nitro and ester groups at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring create an asymmetrical arrangement, leading to axial chirality. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

### 2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
The structure of this compound is CH₃-CHOH-COOCH₃. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: OH, CH₃, COOCH₃, and a hydrogen. The presence of a chiral center means this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

### 3. **Benzophenone**
Benzophenone has the structure Ar–C(=O)–Ar, where Ar is an aryl group. The central carbon is part of a carbonyl group (C=O) and is not a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the identical aryl groups on either side of the carbonyl group. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### 4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**
Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂=C(COOCH₃)–COOCH₃ in the (E)-configuration. The molecule has a double bond with identical substituents (COOCH₃ groups) on either side, making it symmetrical. Since there are no chiral centers and the molecule is achiral, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion
The compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are **1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate)** and **2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate)**. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: D**
