Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum states. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it.

The question says there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Oh wait, p orbitals have a principal quantum number l=1. Right, because s is 0, p is 1, d is 2, etc.

The state given is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. The total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1. Wait, so the total orbital angular momentum is 2, which makes sense because when you add two l=1's, you can get l=0,1,2. So here it's l=2.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements give -ħ. So each Lz should be -ħ.

Wait, orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are m, which is the z-component divided by ħ. So for each electron, Lz can be -l, -l+1,..., l. So for l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. Each m corresponds to Lz = mħ.

So the state is |1,1,2,-1>. But that's the coupled state. I think I need to express this state in terms of the product states of each electron's individual states. Because the measurement is being done on each electron's individual Lz.

Wait, the coupled state is |l1, l2, L, M> where L is the total and M is the z-component. To find the probability, I need to expand this coupled state into the product states of each electron's m1 and m2. Because the product states are eigenstates of L1z and L2z.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a combination of |m1, m2> states. Let me think about how to do that.

The general approach is to find the expansion of the coupled state in terms of the product states. For two electrons each with l=1, the possible total L can be 0,1,2. Since our state is L=2, M=-1.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore spin angular momentum. So we're only dealing with orbital angular momentum here. So the state we're considering is purely the orbital part. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum state.

So the total state for both electrons is a product of their individual states, but when combined, they form a state with total L. But the given state is a coupled state, not a product state. So I need to express the coupled state in terms of product states.

The coupled angular momentum states can be written as a linear combination of the product states. The expansion coefficients are given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Oh right, Clebsch-Gordan coefficients (CG coefficients) are used to combine two angular momenta into a total.

So for two electrons, each with l=1, the CG coefficients for combining to L=2, M=-1 would involve the product states with m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = M. So M here is -1.

Wait, the total M is m1 + m2. So for each product state, m1 + m2 must equal the total M, which is -1.

But in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the M is -1. So all the product states in its expansion must satisfy m1 + m2 = -1.

But wait, the coefficients are more complicated than that. The CG coefficients also involve how the states combine to form different L's. But perhaps for each possible m1 and m2 that sum to -1, the product state |m1, m2> is part of the expansion.

But wait, to find the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ, that would require m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, because Lz = mħ. So we're looking for the coefficient of the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> in the expansion of |1,1,2,-1>.

But does that state exist in the expansion? Let's think.

The coupled state |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> should be a combination of product states where m1 + m2 = -1. So possible (m1, m2) pairs are: (-1,0), (0,-1), (-2,1)? Wait, no, because m can't be outside -l to +l. So l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1.

So possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1 are (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (1, -2) but wait m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can't be less than -1. So the only valid pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Oh wait, another possibility: m1= -1, m2=0; m1=0, m2= -1.

Wait, can m1 and m2 be other values? No, because m1 can be -1, 0, +1, same for m2. So sum to -1.

But wait, (m1, m2) could be (-1,0), (0,-1). Are those the only possibilities? Let me see: (-1 + 0) = -1, (0 + (-1)) = -1. The other possibilities would be that m1 = 1 and m2 = -2, but m2 can't be -2 because l2=1. So no, that's not possible.

So the only product states in the expansion are these two: |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

But wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you add two l=1's to get L=2, I think there's more than just these two states contributing.

Wait, perhaps I should write down the expansion. The state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed as a sum over possible m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = M=-1.

So the expansion is:

|1,1,2,-1> = Σ [ Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ] * |m1, m2>,

where m1 + m2 = -1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l1=1 and l2=1 into L=2.

I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2, M=-1 would involve (m1, m2) pairs: (-1, 0), (0, -1).

But wait, I remember that for two l=1 states, the CG coefficients for L=2 M=0 would have all combinations where m1 + m2 =0, but for M=-1, it's only the combinations where m1 + m2 =-1.

Wait, let me think about the specific coefficients.

The CG coefficient for |l1 m1> |l2 m2> into |L M> is given by:

< l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M | ... >.

But maybe I should look up the CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1 and L=2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the possible states.

Another approach is to recall that when adding two angular momenta with l1=1 and l2=1, the possible L values are 0,1,2.

For each L and M, the state is a combination of product states where m1 + m2 = M.

So for L=2 and M=-1, the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0), (0,-1), and (-2,1) but wait, m can't be -2 for l=1, so only (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait, no, because m1 can be -1, 0, +1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, so for M=-1, m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible combinations:

m1 = -1, m2=0.

m1 = 0, m2=-1.

m1 = 1, m2 =-2 --> invalid because m2 can't be -2.

Similarly, m1=-2 is invalid, etc.

So only two product states contribute: (-1,0) and (0,-1).

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The coefficients can be found from the CG table.

Looking up the CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

The general formula for the CG coefficient when adding two angular momenta l1 and l2 into L, M:

The coefficient is:

sqrt( (2L +1) / ( (l1 + l2 + L)(l1 + l2 - L)) ) * [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look up the specific coefficient.

Alternatively, I recall that for l1=1, l2=1, L=2:

The state |2,1> is a combination of |1,1> |1,0> and |1,0> |1,1>, but wait M=1.

But for M=-1, let's think.

The CG coefficient for |l1=1, m1=-1; l2=1, m2=0> in L=2, M=-1 is sqrt(2/3), and for |m1=0, m2=-1>, it's also sqrt(2/3), but with a sign?

Wait, maybe I should look at the explicit expansion.

I think the expansion for |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> is:

sqrt(2/3) |m1=-1, m2=0> - sqrt(1/3) |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps both terms have positive coefficients.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the correct expansion is (1/sqrt(2)) multiplied by (|m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1>).

Wait, no, that would be for symmetric combinations, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the state is symmetric or antisymmetric in some way.

Wait, but since the two electrons are identical particles, perhaps we need to consider symmetry, but the question says to ignore spin angular momentum. Hmm, but the problem is about orbital angular momentum, which for electrons would be part of their wavefunction, which is antisymmetric.

Wait, no, actually, electrons are fermions, so their total wavefunction (which includes spin and spatial parts) must be antisymmetric. But the question says to ignore spin, so perhaps we're dealing with only the spatial part, which must be antisymmetric under exchange if the spin part is symmetric, or symmetric if spin is antisymmetric.

Wait, but maybe that's complicating things, and perhaps the question is just about orbital angular momentum without considering the antisymmetry.

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, I can treat them as distinguishable particles, since spin is ignored, but wait, no, electrons are indistinct. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe the key point isn't about the symmetry but about the expansion coefficients.

So, in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the expansion into product states is:

|1,1,2,-1> = C1 |m1=-1, m2=0> + C2 |m1=0, m2=-1>

What are C1 and C2?

The CG coefficients for adding l1=1 and l2=1 to get L=2.

Looking up the CG coefficients for L=2, M=-1:

I think the state is a sum of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, each multiplied by 1/sqrt(2), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are different.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficients for L=2, M=-1 are:

sqrt( ( (2 + 1) ) / ( (1 + 1 + 2)(1 + 1 - 2) )) ) * sqrt( (2 + 1) ) / ... Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the coefficients are 1/sqrt(2) for each term because there are two terms. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( ( (2+1) ) / ( (1+1+2)(1+1-2) ) ) ) * [ something ].

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the possible ways to get M=-1.

Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are both 1/sqrt(2), but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct expansion is:

|1,1,2,-1> = [ sqrt(2/3) ) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt(1/3) |m1=0, m2=-1> ]

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of the squares should be 1.

Wait, 2/3 + 1/3 = 1, yes.

Wait, but why would the coefficients be different? Hmm.

Alternatively, I've heard that for the addition of two l=1's to get L=2, the coefficients for M=1 are sqrt(1/3)|1,1> |1,0> + sqrt(2/3)|1,0> |1,1>, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the expansion for M=-1 is sqrt(1/3) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt(2/3) |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, that would make the sum of squares (1/3 + 2/3)=1.

So the coefficients would be sqrt(1/3) and sqrt(2/3).

Wait, but perhaps I should double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is symmetric under exchange.

Wait, but in that case, the coefficients would be the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the expansion is ( |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ) / sqrt(2).

Because those are the two possibilities, and the state is symmetric under exchange, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in any case, to find the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ, which corresponds to m1 =-1 and m2=-1.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. Each electron's Lz is m * ħ. So if m1 =-1, then L1z = -ħ. Similarly, m2=-1 => L2z = -ħ.

So we're looking for the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1>, which is |m1=-1, m2=-1>.

But in the expansion of the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, does this product state appear?

Because m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2, which doesn't match the total M of -1. So in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the only product states that contribute have m1 + m2 = -1.

So the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> has m1 + m2 = -2, which doesn't match M=-1. Therefore, this product state is not part of the expansion of the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>.

Wait, that means the coefficient for |m1=-1, m2=-1> in the expansion is zero. Therefore, the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ is zero.

So the joint probability is zero, which is option D.


The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, with orbital angular momentum quantum numbers \( l_1 = 1 \) and \( l_2 = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state is given as \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \), where \( l = 2 \) is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and \( m = -1 \) is the z-component of the total angular momentum. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \), which corresponds to \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \).

To solve this, we expand the coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) in terms of the product states \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \). The coupled state is a linear combination of product states where \( m_1 + m_2 = M = -1 \). The valid combinations of \( (m_1, m_2) \) that satisfy this condition are:

1. \( (m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0) \),
2. \( (m_1, m_2) = (0, -1) \).

The product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) does not satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \), as \( m_1 + m_2 = -2 \), which is inconsistent with the total \( M = -1 \). Therefore, the product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) does not appear in the expansion of \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \).

Since the coefficient of \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) in the expansion is zero, the probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \) is zero.
