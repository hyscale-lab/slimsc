Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about epoxidation reactions and then what happens when the products are analyzed via HPLC. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of this, but let me think through it.

First, the question says that a chemist does two reactions. Both involve treating either (E)-oct-4-ene or (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. I remember that mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are typically used for epoxidizing alkenes. So in each reaction, the alkene is being epoxidized.

Wait, so each alkene will form an epoxide. But since the starting alkenes are E and Z isomers, their epoxides might be different. Oh right, because the geometry of the starting alkene affects the epoxide structure.

Let me recall: when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide by an electrocyclic opening. The reaction is stereospecific. So for a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide would have a certain configuration, and for a cis (Z) alkene, another.

Wait, no, maybe it's the opposite. Let me think. When mCPBA adds across a double bond, it forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Or does it invert? No, wait, the epoxidation with peracids typically leads to the same configuration as the starting alkeneâ€”so if the double bond is E (trans), the resulting epoxide will have the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides, leading to a trans epoxide. Similarly for Z.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think about the mechanism. mCPBA adds across the double bond via a cyclic transition state. The peracid (mCPBA) opens the double bond in a way that the oxygen adds to each carbon in a syn addition. So for an E double bond, the addition of two oxygen atoms (from the peracid) would end up trans in the epoxide. Or is it the opposite?

Wait, no. Let's imagine the double bond is in the E configuration. The substituents on each end are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, the peracid's O-O group adds across
