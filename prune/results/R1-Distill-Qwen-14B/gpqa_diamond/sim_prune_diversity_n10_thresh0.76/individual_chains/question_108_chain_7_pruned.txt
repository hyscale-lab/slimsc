Okay, so I've got this question about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, the question mentions a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis. Oh wait, Oz is the z-axis in a Cartesian coordinate system, right? So the magnetic field is pointing along z.

The problem says m is small, meaning the orbital magnetic quantum number is small. I remember that m can take values from -l to +l in integer steps. So if m is small, maybe it's like m=0 or ±1 for higher l values, but I'm not sure how that affects things here.

The paramagnetic coupling term is mentioned. I think that refers to the Zeeman effect. Oh right, the Zeeman effect is the splitting of spectral lines when a magnetic field is applied. The energy shift due to the magnetic field is given by the Zeeman term. The formula I remember is ΔE_zeeman = -μ·B. And μ is the magnetic moment, which for an electron in an atom is μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, but in this case, we're looking at the paramagnetic coupling. Paramagnetism arises from the spin of electrons, right? So maybe it's the spin-orbit coupling or the Zeeman effect for the spin. Oh wait, no. The paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is the interaction between the magnetic moment and the external field. So for an atom with s=1/2, the spin magnetic quantum number m_s can be ±1/2.

So the paramagnetic coupling term's energy would be proportional to the magnetic field strength B. Let me write down the formula. The energy due to the magnetic field is (H_p) = -μ · B. The magnetic moment μ for spin is given by μ = g_s μ_B S, where S is the spin angular momentum. Wait, but for a single electron, S is (ħ/2)σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So the z-component would be μ_z = g_s μ_B (m_s) , where m_s is ±1/2.

So the paramagnetic term would be H_p = μ_B * g_s * m_s * B, where m_s is ±1/2. So the
