Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about identifying the product of a reaction involving a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The reagents given are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aqueous KOH and heat. The NMR data is provided, so I'll need to use that to figure out the structure of the starting material before I can determine the product.

First, I should look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). 

Wait, 9.72 ppm is a high chemical shift, which makes me think of an aldehyde proton. But wait, that's a triplet. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and are typically deshielded. They are usually singlets because there's no neighboring H's. So a triplet here is interesting. Maybe it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, could it be an acidic proton like from an aromatic ring with substituents?

Looking at the other peaks, 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests maybe a para-substituted aromatic ring. The downfield shift (around 6.98) could be due to substituents like electron-withdrawing groups. The 6.51 could be part of another aromatic ring, perhaps with fewer substituents or different groups.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad singlet suggests maybe an exchangeable proton, like an -OH group, or perhaps some coupling that's not splitting it into a clear pattern. Alternatively, it could be from an aromatic ring with adjacent protons that are not splitting it much.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's around where CH2 groups adjacent to oxygen might show up. Maybe an OCH2 group, like an ether or an ester. Alternatively, it could be part of an alkoxy group attached to something else.

Let me try to piece this together. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, N=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees. That could be two rings and one double bond, or one ring and three double bonds, but more likely, maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds/1 ring) and another double bond plus a ring? Wait, but wait, benzene is 3 degrees (3 double bonds) and one ring. Hmm.

Wait, degree of unsaturation calculation: Each double bond or ring adds 1. So for C8H9NO: 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 0 halogens. Let's compute (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So five degrees. So that could be, for example, benzene (3 degrees, because three double bonds) plus a ring (another degree) and an additional double bond. Or benzene plus a double bond and an amide group or something else.

But looking at the NMR, there's a triplet at 9.72 ppm. That's high, but triplet. Maybe an aldehyde is not the right interpretation. Alternatively, the triplet might not be an aldehyde but something else. Or perhaps it's an alpha proton to a carbony
