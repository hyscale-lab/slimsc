Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about finding the maximum orbital period of a second planet in the same system. Both planets are in circular orbits and share the same orbital plane. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and the second is 2.5 Earth radii. The star they orbit has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun.

The first planet transits with an impact parameter of 0.2 and has an orbital period of 3 days. We need the maximum period for the second planet so that both transit and occultation events can happen. Hmm, I remember that occultation is when the planet passes behind the star from our point of view, right?

So, what's the key here? I think it's about orbital periods and the alignment required for both events to occur. For both transit and occultation to happen, the orbital periods must be such that the planets are in the same position relative to the star and us at certain times.

Wait, but how does that work? Oh right, for a planet to transit, it must pass in front of the star from our perspective. For occultation, it must pass behind the star. Both events require the planet to be in the same orbital position relative to the star and us. So, the time between these events can't be longer than the orbital periods of the planets. Or wait, no, maybe it's more about the synodic periods?

Wait, maybe it's about the orbital period of the second planet being a divisor of the first's period, or something like that. Or perhaps it's about their orbital periods being such that their alignment happens in a way that allows both events.

But wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The problem says that both planets are in the same system, same orbital plane. The first planet has a 3-day period. The second has a longer period, presumably, since we're looking for the maximum possible.

Wait, but the second planet's period can't be longer than a certain value because otherwise, the orbital periods wouldn't allow both transit and occultation. Because for both events to occur, the second planet needs to catch up in its orbit in such a way that it aligns both to transit and then occultate.

Hmm, perhaps it's about the
