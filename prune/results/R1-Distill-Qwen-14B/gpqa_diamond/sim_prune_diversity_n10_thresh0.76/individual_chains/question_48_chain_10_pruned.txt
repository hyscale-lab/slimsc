Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what each part does and what the final product looks like.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first reaction is treating it with bromine (Br2) to form product 1. Oh wait, bromine in what conditions? For ketones, I think bromine can undergo various reactions. One possibility is the addition to the carbonyl group, but wait, no, ketones don't usually add Br2 in the same way alkenes do. Hmm, another thought: maybe it's a dihydroxy bromination? Or maybe it's a ring-opening via some mechanism. Oh wait, maybe it's a bromohydrin formation. No, wait, cyclohexanone with bromine in a different solvent? Alternatively, could it be a benzoin condensation? No, I think that's for aldehydes. Alternatively, maybe the bromine is acting as an electrophilic reagent, and the cyclohexanone undergoes a bromination at the alpha position via some enol mechanism.

Wait, wait, when a ketone like cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, the typical reaction I think is the addition of bromine to the carbonyl, but wait, in ketones, the carbonyl is less reactive than aldehydes. Or maybe it's the formation of a bromocyclohexane derivative. Alternatively, perhaps it's a haloform reaction, but that usually applies to methyl ketones. Since cyclohexanone isn't a methyl ketone, maybe that's not it. Hmm. Alternatively, I might be mixing up reactions. Another possibility is that the bromine adds to the ring. But wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring, which is usually not that reactive towards electrophilic substitution unless it's activated. But cyclohexanone has an electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. So perhaps the ring becomes more reactive towards electrophilic substitution.

Wait, so when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2) in a certain condition, maybe it undergoes electrophilic substitution. The carbonyl group is an activating group in certain positions. Wait, in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at one
