Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a pretty complex organic molecule. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, how exactly do I approach this?

The molecule given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks like a big molecule with several double bonds and branching. I think I need to count all the bonds in this structure because the question gives bond energies for each type of bond.

Wait, the question provides the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an element and turn it into gaseous atoms. So for carbon, that's 1000 kJ/mol. But I'm not sure how that ties into the calculation. Maybe it's for breaking C-C bonds or something else.

The bond energies given are:
- H-H = 100 kJ/mol
- C-C = 200 kJ/mol
- C=C = 300 kJ/mol
- C-H = 400 kJ/mol

So, the general approach, as I recall, is to calculate the total bond energies in the molecule and then subtract or add them in some way.

Wait, the formula I think I remember is: Enthalpy of formation = (Sum of bond energies of all bonds broken) - (Sum of bond energies of all new bonds formed). But wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Or maybe it's about the formation from elements, so you have to calculate how much energy is released (exothermic) or absorbed (endothermic) when the molecule forms.

Alternatively, for enthalpy of formation, you can use the formula: ΔHf° = Σ [ΔHf°(products)] - Σ [ΔHf°(reactants)]. But I'm not exactly sure if that applies here.

Wait, maybe not. Another approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the bonds broken in the reactants and the bonds formed in the products. But in this case, the reactants are the elements in their standard states, which are H2 and C.

So, maybe I should
