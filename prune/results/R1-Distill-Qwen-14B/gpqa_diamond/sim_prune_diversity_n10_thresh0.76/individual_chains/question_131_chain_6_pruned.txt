Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and see what I can gather.

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When this acid is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has some specific NMR characteristics: a single peak at 7 ppm in 1H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in the 13C NMR. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products—major and minor. Both have the molecular formula C13H16O3. 

The key part is about the NOESY NMR spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. I need to figure out which two resonances are connected in the major product.

Let me break this down. First, I think I should figure out what the anhydride looks like. The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid usually forms an anhydride. So, the structure would have two carboxylic acid groups connected via an anhydride linkage. 

Wait, the anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR at 7 ppm. That's probably from an aromatic proton, but wait, an anhydride from a diacid with an alkene might not be aromatic. Hmm. Or maybe the alkene is part of a ring? Or perhaps it's a conjugated diene or something else. Alternatively, maybe the anhydride has an exo-methylene group or something that leads to a single proton.

Wait, the 13C NMR has two peaks—137 and 165 ppm. 137 is likely a carbonyl adjacent to an alkene. Wait, no, 137 is probably a sp² carbon. 165 is a carbonyl, maybe the anhydride carbonyl. So the structure of the anhydride must have two carbonyl groups (the anhydride O's) and some sp² carbons.

Wait, the initial dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. So when it dehydrates, the two carboxylic acid groups would lose water and form an anhydride. The cis-alkene would be adjacent to the carbonyls. So the anhydride would have a structure like O=C-O-C=O, linked between two (cis) alkenyl groups.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride? If the dicarboxylic acid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond. Wait, no, the starting material is a cis-alkene. So maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, not double bond. Wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's a single bond. No, wait, a cis-alkene would mean double bond.

Wait, maybe the diacid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond in the middle. Like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but between the CH2s, there's a double bond. So, HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH would be if all are single bonds, but if there's a double bond, perhaps HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH with the double bond between the middle CH2s. Wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that wouldn't have a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond somewhere else. Wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CR2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the R groups.

Wait, perhaps the diacid is like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between CH2s. No, wait, the diacid is a cis-alkene, so the structure would be something like HOOC-CH2-CR2-CH2-COOH, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond between the CH2s. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR data.

The anhydride's 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. 7 ppm is usually aromatic protons, but an anhydride from a diacid with a cis-alkene might not have aromatic rings. Alternatively, maybe the protons are on an sp³ carbon adjacent to an electronegative group. Wait, another thought: 7 ppm could be a vinyl proton, but that's more around 5-6 ppm usually. Or perhaps an aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm, so that's probably not it. Wait, maybe the 7 ppm peak is from an aromatic ring, but the starting material doesn't have any rings—unless the dehydration forms a cyclic structure.

Wait, the anhydride's structure: If the diacid is HOOCCis-CH₂CH₂COOH, then dehydration would form an anhydride with an internal double bond. So perhaps the structure
