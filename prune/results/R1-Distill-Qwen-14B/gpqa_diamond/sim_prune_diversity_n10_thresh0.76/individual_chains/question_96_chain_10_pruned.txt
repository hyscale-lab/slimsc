Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm. The given data includes the angular size of the event horizon, the distance to the galaxy, and I need to find the order of magnitude of the black hole's entropy. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Oh right, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. But wait, sometimes I see it written as S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), yeah, that's the same thing. So I need to find the area A of the event horizon.

The event horizon radius R is given by the Schwarzschild radius formula: R = 2 G M / c². So A would be 4 π R², which is 4 π (2 G M / c²)^2. But maybe I don't need to get into the mass yet. Let's see.

The problem gives the angular size θ of the event horizon. Oh, right! The angular size can help me find the actual size, since I know the distance. The formula for angular size is θ ≈ (size)/(distance), where θ is in radians. But wait, the given θ is in degrees, so I'll have to convert that to radians first.

Wait, the problem says θ is 10^-17 degrees. So to convert to radians, I multiply by π/180. Let me calculate that: 10^-17 degrees * (π rad)/(180 deg) ≈ (10^-17) * (3.1416/180) ≈ roughly 1.745e-19 radians. So θ ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

The distance d is 10^10 parsecs. Wait, I need to convert parsecs to meters because the standard units for these constants are in meters, kilograms, seconds, etc. Let me remember: 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 3.086e16 * 1e10 = 3.086e26 meters.

Hmm, angular size θ is approximately equal to (size)/(distance), so the size (which would be 2R, since the event horizon is a sphere, so diameter is 2R) is approximately θ * d.

Wait, so size ≈ θ * d. So 2R ≈ θ * d. So R ≈ (θ d)/2.

So substituting the numbers: θ is about 1.745e-19 radians, d is 3.086e26 meters. R ≈ (1.745e-19) * (3.086e26) / 2.

Let me compute that. 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = let's see, 1.745 *3.086 is about 5.37, and the exponents are e-19+26 = e7. So 5.37e7 meters. Divided by 2, so R ≈ 2.685e7 meters.

Wait, 2.685e7 meters is the radius. So the area A is 4 π R². Let me compute R²: (2.685e7)^2 = (2.685)^2 * 1e14. 2.685 squared is approximately 7.21, so R² ≈ 7.21e14 m².

Then A = 4 * π * 7.21e14
