Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

The operator A_y is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). Oh wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices are related to angular momentum. For spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices represent the components of the spin angular momentum. So S here must be a Pauli matrix, right?

Wait, the matrix S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). Let me write that down:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right! That's the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y. So S is sigma_y. And the operator A_y is c multiplied by sigma_y.

So c is h/(4π), so A_y = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

The problem asks about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix.

First, let's find the eigenvalues of A_y. The eigenvalues of sigma_y are well-known. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So sigma_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

But since A_y is (h/(4π)) times sigma_y, the eigenvalues of A_y should be (h/(4π)) multiplied by ±1. So the eigenvalues a are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly state that. Let me check the options again.

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). Hmm, but the eigenvalues I calculated are real numbers, not complex. Because sigma_y has real eigenvalues? Wait no, wait. Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. So A_y is Hermitian because c is real and sigma_y is Hermitian. So the eigenvalues should be real. Therefore, any option that mentions an imaginary part in the eigenvalue is incorrect. So Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2. No, same issue. So options A and B are incorrect because they mention imaginary parts, which shouldn't be there. So I can eliminate A and B.

Options C and D are about the properties of the eigenfunctions. Let's think about that.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component Az. Hmm. Since A_y and A² might commute? Or not. Wait, A² is the square of the angular momentum operator. For spin 1/2 particles, A² should be (h² * s(s+1)) where s=1/2, so A² would be (h²)*(1/2)(3/2) = 3h²/4.

Wait, but A is a vector operator, so A² is the sum of A_x² + A_y² + A_z². So for each component, their squares would add up to (A²). But each component individually commutes with A², so the eigenfunctions of A² are the same as any component's eigenfunctions? Or perhaps not.

Wait, the eigenfunctions of A² are the same as the eigenfunctions of any component, because A² commutes with each A_i. So if a state is an eigenfunction of A_y, it's also an eigenfunction of A². So the first part of Option C is correct.

The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Hmm. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the components of angular momentum don't commute with each other. So if a state is an eigenstate of A_y, it cannot be an eigenstate of A_z unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which is only possible for states with definite total angular momentum and projection, but in this case, since A² is (h^2 s(s+1)) and Az is another component, I'm not sure.

Wait, actually, the eigenstates of A_y can't be eigenstates of both A_y and A_z because the operators don't commute. So the eigenfunctions of A_y are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C's second statement is correct. So the entire statement in C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm. Basis functions usually refer to the eigenvectors forming a basis. Since the operator is 2x2, it has two eigenvalues, each with an eigenvector. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay form a basis for the space. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but what's the exact wording? Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. The basis functions are the eigenvectors, so they form a basis. So yes, D is correct.

Wait, but wait. Are the eigenvectors of Ay the same as the basis functions of the matrix? Well, the matrix is 2x2, and any two eigenvectors will form a basis for the space. So yes, they can serve as basis functions. So D seems correct.

Hmm, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D are about the properties of the eigenfunctions.

Wait, another angle. Let me think about each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So that's correct. So the first part is correct.

The second part, can they be eigenfunctions of Az? No, because [Ay, Az] = iħ A something? Wait, angular momentum components satisfy [A_i, A_j] = iħ ε_{ijk} A_k. So [Ay, Az] = iħ A_x. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay and Az, then [Ay, Az] would imply that A_x is zero in that state, but I'm not sure. But in any case, a state can't be an eigenstate of both Ay and Az unless it's a state with definite total angular momentum, which is not the case here. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So the second part is correct.

Option D: Eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the matrix operator's eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so yes, they are basis functions.

So both C and D could be correct. But the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct while calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So perhaps the correct statement is D, because during calculation, the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, but let me think. When you diagonalize a matrix, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis. So for a 2x2 matrix, you'll get two eigenvectors that are orthogonal (assuming the matrix is Hermitian, which it is here). So D's statement is correct.

So which option is correct? The options are C and D.

Wait, looking back at the problem, the options are:

C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So both statements could be correct, but which one is correct as per the options.

Wait, statement D is about the eigenfunctions being the basis functions of the matrix. Since the matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

But wait, let's think again. The matrix operator's basis is defined by the eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions for the operator. So yes, they form the basis.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me re-express option C.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So that's correct.

So both C and D seem correct. But the options are mutually exclusive, so only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation about the eigenvalues. Let me double-check the eigenvalues.

The matrix S is sigma_y:

sigma_y = [[0, -i],
           [i, 0]]

So it's Hermitian because it's equal to its conjugate transpose. So its eigenvalues are real.

The eigenvalues for sigma_y can be found by solving det(S - λ I) =0.

det( [ -λ    -i ]
     [ i    -λ ]) = 0

So determinant is (λ^2 + i^2 ) = λ² - (-1) = λ² +1 =0 → λ² = -1 → λ= ±i? Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, sigma_y is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues should be real. Oh wait, wait a second. Wait, sigma_y is actually Hermitian? Let me check.

The conjugate transpose of sigma_y is:

[[0, i],
 [-i, 0]]

Which is not equal to sigma_y. Wait, no, sigma_y is not Hermitian. Wait, no, wait, sigma matrices are Hermitian.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Let me confirm.

sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]] → real and symmetric → Hermitian.

sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]] → real and diagonal → Hermitian.

sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is equal to its conjugate transpose? Let's see:

Conjugate transpose of sigma_y is:

[[0, i],
 [-i,0]]

Which is the same as sigma_y's transpose. Wait, sigma_y is anti-symmetric, but is it Hermitian? Let's compute sigma_y^dagger.

The adjoint (conjugate transpose) of sigma_y:

For sigma_y, the (1,2) element is -i, so the (2,1) element is i. So the adjoint would be:

[[0, i],
 [-i, 0]]

Which is the same as the original sigma_y? No, because sigma_y's original (2,1) element is i, so the adjoint is:

Row 1: [0, i]

Row 2: [-i, 0]

Which is not the same as sigma_y. So sigma_y is not Hermitian? Wait, but then that's confusing because in quantum mechanics, spin matrices should be Hermitian.

Wait, I think I must be making a mistake. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I mixed up the definition. Ah, no, sigma_y is actually Hermitian. Wait, let me compute sigma_y^dagger.

sigma_y^dagger = [ [0, i], 
                   [-i, 0] ]

Wait, sigma_y is:

[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

So sigma_y^dagger is:

[ [0, i],
  [-i, 0] ]

Which is equal to sigma_y? No, because the (1,2) element is i, not -i.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, if you look carefully, the (1,2) element of sigma_y is -i. So in sigma_y^dagger, the (2,1) element would be the conjugate of (1,2), which is i. So sigma_y^dagger is:

[ [0, i],
  [-i, 0] ]

Which is the same as sigma_y multiplied by -1. Because sigma_y is equal to - sigma_y^dagger.

Wait, that would mean sigma_y is anti-Hermitian, not Hermitian. But that's not correct because Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in writing sigma_y. Let me double-check.

The Pauli Y matrix is:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

Wait, but that's a 2x2 matrix. Let me compute its conjugate transpose.

The conjugate of sigma_y is sigma_y^*.

sigma_y has elements [0, -i; i, 0].

Conjugate of each element: [0, i; -i, 0].

Transpose of that is [0, -i; i, 0], which is the original sigma_y. So sigma_y^dagger = sigma_y? Because sigma_y^dagger is sigma_y^T^*, which is sigma_y in this case.

Wait, let me clarify. The conjugate transpose (dagger) is the transpose of the conjugate. So for sigma_y:

Original:

row 1: [0, -i]
row 2: [i, 0]

Conjugate each element:

row 1: [0, i]
row 2: [-i, 0]

Transpose this to get the dagger:

columns become rows.

So column 1: [0, -i] → row 1: [0, -i]

column 2: [i, 0] → row 2: [i, 0]

So sigma_y^dagger is:

[ [0, -i], 
  [i, 0] ]

Which is exactly sigma_y. So sigma_y is Hermitian because sigma_y^dagger = sigma_y.

Ah, okay, I see. So sigma_y is Hermitian. Therefore, A_y = c sigma_y is also Hermitian since c is real. So the eigenvalues should be real.

So when I calculated the determinant earlier, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, when I write the characteristic equation for sigma_y:

det( sigma_y - λ I ) = 0

Which is:

| -λ    -i |
| i     -λ |

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) → λ² - ( (-i)(i) )

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant is λ² - 1 =0 → λ²=1 → λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues of sigma_y are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A_y = (h/(4π)) sigma_y are c * 1 = h/(4π) and c * (-1) = -h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real. So any option that talks about the eigenvalues being complex or having imaginary parts is wrong. So options A and B are incorrect.

So now, looking back at the options, only C and D are possible.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with A_y, so any eigenstate of A_y is also an eigenstate of A². So the first part of C is correct. The second part says they can't be eigenfunctions of Az. Since A_y and Az don't commute, their eigenstates are not the same. So the second part of C is correct. So option C is a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the operator is 2x2, the two eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, which one is the correct answer.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct. So among the options, both C and D seem correct. But perhaps I made a mistake in this analysis.

Wait another approach. Let's think about the possible answers. Let me think about the options.

Option D says the eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix. So the matrix is 2x2, and any linear operator on a 2D space has eigenvectors that form a basis. So yes, D is correct. Therefore, during the calculation, you would consider this statement correct.

Alternatively, option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So the first part is correct. The second part is correct because you can't have eigenfunctions of both Ay and Az. So option C is correct.

Now, looking back at the options, both C and D seem correct. But since the question is a multiple-choice, only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider which of the options is correct. Let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So, if the statement is true, which one is correct?

Well, since the matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors do form a basis, so D is correct. But C's statement is also correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Wait, but the question is about the correct statement during the calculation. So perhaps both are correct, but the options may not have that. Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D. So which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D, because it's more of a fact about the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, no, let's think differently. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement would you consider correct.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Which would be true as the eigenvectors form a basis.

Alternatively, the question is whether the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A². Since the calculation might involve realizing that A² commutes with Ay, so eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A².

So perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, but the problem is, in the given options, what is correct.

Another approach: Let's think about the possible answers.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

But since A² is a scalar operator (because it's the square of the vector operator A), any eigenstate of Ay will automatically be an eigenstate of A², because A² commutes with Ay.

So the first part of C is correct.

The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since [Ay, Az] = iħ A_x, which is non-zero, the operators do not commute. So a state cannot be an eigenstate of both Ay and Az. So the second part is correct.

So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions form a basis of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, with two eigenfunctions, they are a basis. So D is correct.

So both C and D are correct.

But the problem is that multiple-choice questions have only one correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility. Let me think about the matrix. The matrix Ay is 2x2, so it has two eigenvalues, each with a corresponding eigenvector. So the eigenvectors are orthogonal and can be used as a basis. So D is correct.

But in the question, which statement is correct during the calculation.

So perhaps during the calculation, you would note that the eigenfunctions form a basis, so D is correct.

But then again, option C is also correct. So perhaps I should look for the option that is definitely correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the initial approach.

Wait, another angle: in quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of a single component of angular momentum (like Ay) are not eigenstates of the other components (Az, Ax). So option C's second part is correct.

Furthermore, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² because A² is a Casimir operator that commutes with all components. So the first part is correct.

So option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. The calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors would involve solving the matrix equation and finding the eigenvectors. So during that calculation, you'd find that the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator. So D is correct.

But I'm getting stuck because both C and D seem correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the statement in D is not necessarily correct. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the term "basis functions" refers to the functions that form a basis for the vector space on which the operator acts. So for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors, being two in number and non-degenerate, form a basis. So D is correct.

Therefore, both options C and D seem correct. But the options are presented as four, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the eigenvalues. Let me double-check.

The matrix Ay has eigenvalues a = ± h/(4π). So eigenvalues are real.

So any options that mention the eigenvalues having an imaginary part are incorrect. That leaves options C and D.

But looking at the statements again. Option C says the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are ±2πh or ±h/4π. Wait, no, option C says: the imaginary part are +1/2 or –1/2, but that doesn't align with our calculation.

Wait, no, option C says the imaginary parts are ±1/2, which is wrong because we found the eigenvalues are real.

Wait, no, looking again, option C says: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +1/2 or –1/2, and the real part of that are +1 or –1. No, that's wrong because the eigenvalues are real, as we found.

Wait, no. Wait, wait, perhaps I misread the options.

Looking back:

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π.

Wait, but the eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary parts are zero. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: The imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Also incorrect.

Option C: The imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Wait, no, I think I misread earlier. Let me read the options again.

Wait, the question's options are:

Option A) The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π.

Wait, no, that's a confusion between real and imaginary parts. Because the actual eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So option A is incorrect.

Option B) The imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, but our eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary parts are zero. So option B is wrong.

Option C) The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D) The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

So, the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are incorrect.

So the correct options are either C or D.

Option C is correct. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So C is correct.

Option D is also correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

But the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

Hmm, perhaps both statements C and D are correct. But since the options are given, and only one can be selected, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component Az.

Since A² and Ay commute, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So the first part is correct.

The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since [Ay, Az] is non-zero, their eigenstates are different. So the second part is correct.

So option C is correct.

But why is option D also correct? Because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

So I think during the calculation, both C and D are correct statements. But since the options can't have two correct answers, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the options.

The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

So during the calculation, when you find the eigenvalues, you find that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which is D's statement.

But at the same time, when you realize that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is C's first statement.

But perhaps the correct answer is C, because option D is always true for any Hermitian matrix. But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But now I'm getting stuck. Let me think about another approach.

Let me think about the possible statements.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with Ay, so eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². And since they don't commute with Az, they can't be eigenfunctions of Az.

So option C is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.


The problem involves analyzing the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:
1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The Pauli \( Y \)-matrix (\( S \)) is Hermitian, and its eigenvalues are \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real. Therefore, any statement claiming the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is incorrect.

2. **Option A:**
   - Claims the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real part are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).

3. **Option B:**
   - Claims the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real part are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).

4. **Option C:**
   - States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator), but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum).
   - \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). This makes the first part of the statement correct.
   - \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute (\( [A_y, A_z] = i\hbar A_x \)), so a state cannot be an eigenstate of both \( A_y \) and \( A_z \). This makes the second part of the statement correct.
   - Therefore, Option C is correct.

5. **Option D:**
   - States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \).
   - For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) form a basis for the space. This is true, but the statement is general and does not specifically address the calculation of eigenvalues or eigenvectors. Thus, while technically correct, it is less relevant to the calculation.

### Conclusion:
Both Options C and D are correct, but the question asks for the statement that is correct **during the calculation**. Option C directly relates to the properties of the eigenfunctions and their relationship with \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \), making it the most relevant choice.

**Answer: C**
