Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's break it down.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're told that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I think that means the Boltzmann distribution applies here.

Wait, in LTE, the population of energy levels in atoms depends on temperature. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between them. The equation is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (kT)), where g's are the statistical weights.

Here, the problem states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. I'm assuming that means the ratio n1/n2 (where n is the number in the excited state over the lower state) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Let me think: for star_1, n1/n2 = 2*(n2_star2/n2_star2')? Wait, maybe it's better to write equations for each star.

Let me denote for star_1: (n_upper)_1 / (n_lower)_1 = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) )
Similarly, for star_2: (n_upper)_2 / (n_lower)_2 = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) )

But wait, the question says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So the ratio n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, (n_upper)_1/(n_lower)_1 = 2 * (n_upper)_2/(n_lower)_2.

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

(g/(g')) * exp(-ΔE/(k T_1)) = 2 * [ (g/(g')) * exp(-ΔE/(k T_2)) ) ]

Oh, the g factors (statistical weights) would be the same for both stars for the same transition, right
