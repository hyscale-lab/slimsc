Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about a series of reactions, and from that, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember they have to do with the shapes of molecules and their symmetry elements. Like, how many planes of symmetry, axes of rotation, etc.

First, let's parse the reactions given. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Another reaction is where C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. Then, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I think I should figure out what each of these substances A, B, C, D, etc., could be. Starting with the reactions.

Let me think about the first reaction: solid A plus 8 equivalents of gas B → product C. 8 equivalents suggests that the mole ratio is 1:8, so maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen? For example, if A is sodium (Na), and B is chlorine (Cl2), then sodium reacts with chlorine to form NaCl. But wait, sodium chloride is a solid, but in that case, 2 Na would react with Cl2, so the ratio would be 2:1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, but maybe A is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a transition metal, like copper. If B is sulfur, but sulfur is a solid too. Or maybe A is aluminum and B is something else. Wait, another approach: product C is bright red. What compounds are bright red? Maybe something like iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3), but that's reddish. Alternatively, maybe a transition metal complex. Oh, perhaps C is a compound with a high symmetry structure.

Wait, the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E. E is extremely hazardous. What's a bright red solid that can react with something to form a hazardous product? Maybe C is Fe2O3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride or another compound.

Wait, the third reaction is C reacting with water to give A plus acids F and G. So C plus H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc. Weak acids are like HCN, H3PO4, etc.

Wait, when a metal oxide reacts with water, it usually forms a metal hydroxide, but that doesn't directly give acids. Unless it's a highly active metal oxide. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, like AlN. AlN + H2O → Al(OH)3 + NH3. But NH3 isn't an acid. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another thought: if A is a metal
