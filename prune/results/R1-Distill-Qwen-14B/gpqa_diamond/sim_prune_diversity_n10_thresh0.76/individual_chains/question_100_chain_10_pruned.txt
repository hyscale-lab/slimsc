Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to work through it step by step. Let me try to visualize the reaction steps and figure out each compound.

Starting with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. That's either propene or propyne, but more likely propene since that's more common in bromination. Wait, no, wait. Propene is C3H6, and so is cyclopropane, but cyclopropane is more stable and maybe less reactive. But for bromination, propene is more likely because it's an alkene. So A is probably propene.

Step 1: Bromination in CCl4. Bromination of an alkene usually adds bromine across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) reacting with Br2 would form 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3), which is compound B.

Step 2: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a base and a good nucleophile. So this is probably an elimination reaction. The dibromide would undergo dehydrohalogenation, but since there are two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, it can eliminate twice. First, one Br leaves as Br- (but wait, with KOH, maybe it's more like an E2 mechanism). Wait, when a vicinal dibromide reacts with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it usually undergoes elimination to form an alkene again, but possibly with different stereochemistry. Alternatively, it could
