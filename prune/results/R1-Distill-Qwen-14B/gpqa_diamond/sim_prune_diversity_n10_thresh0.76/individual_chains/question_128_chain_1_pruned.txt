Okay, so I've got this question about cloning the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. Let me think through this.

The main goal is to choose the correct plasmid from the options A to D. The question provides the amino acid sequence of P53, and four different DNA sequences. I need to figure out which one is the correct one to use for expressing the protein in E. coli.

Wait, E. coli uses DNA to make mRNA, which is then translated into protein. So the plasmid should have the correct coding sequence for P53. But wait, the question says the plasmids have different sequences. I think I need to look for the correct start and stop codons, and ensure the reading frame is correct.

P53 is a eukaryotic protein, but E. coli is a prokaryote. So the plasmid probably includes a prokaryotic promoter and maybe a tag or something. But the question is about the correct sequence, not the promoter. So I'll focus on the coding region.

The given amino acid sequence starts with Met (because the first codon is M in the sequence). The plasmid should have an ATG as the start codon. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

All four options start with ATGGAGGAGCCGCA..., which is ATG (start) followed by GAG (Glu), GAG (Glu), etc. So that's correct. Now, the end of the coding sequence is important. The P53 sequence ends with... let me see the end of the given amino acid sequence.

The last part
