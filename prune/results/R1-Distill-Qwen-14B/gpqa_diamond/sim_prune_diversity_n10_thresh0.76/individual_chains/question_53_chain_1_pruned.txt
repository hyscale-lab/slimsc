Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The question gives me some spectroscopic data, and I need to determine the molecular formula from the options provided. Let me break down the information step by step.

First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. That means there are two substituents attached to the benzene. The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. Esters usually have a carbonyl peak around 1700 cm^-1, so that confirms the presence of an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let's parse each of them.

1. **Aromatic-H signals**: Two signals. Since it's di-substituted, the substitution pattern could be either para, ortho, or meta. For para substitution, the aromatic protons are equivalent and would show as a single peak (a doublet). Wait, but here it's two signals. Hmm, maybe the substituents are in the ortho positions. Because if two substituents are adjacent, then the aromatic protons would have different environments. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a strong electron-withdrawing group that causes different coupling, but I think two signals suggest they are in positions that are not equivalent. Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so if the substituents are in positions that lead to two distinct aromatic proton environments, like perhaps one substituent is in ortho and another in a position that makes the other protons nonequivalent. Or maybe the substituents are in positions that create two different types of aromatic protons. Wait, another possibility: one substituent is a meta director and another is an ortho/para director, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that the benzene has two sets of aromatic protons. For example, two substituents in the para positions would result in equivalent protons, but if it's a di-substitution that's not symmetric, like two substituents in adjacent positions (ortho), then the aromatic protons would split into two signals. I think that's right. So, two aromatic signals mean the substituents are probably in such a way that the aromatic protons are in two different environments, so maybe an ortho substitution.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. If two substituents are on the ring, their positions can lead to different NMR signals. For example, if the substituents are para, the aromatic protons would be in two sets: the para positions to the substituents would have equivalent protons, but wait, in para substitution, the substituents are across from each other, so the aromatic protons would be in two sets: those adjacent to each substituent and those across. No, wait, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, that's actually a 1,4-disubstitution. But wait, that's not possible because in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 4 are across each other. So for a di-substituted benzene with substituents in 1 and 4 positions, each substituent would have two adjacent H's. But in that case, the aromatic protons would be in four positions: adjacent to substituent 1 (positions 2 and 6), adjacent to substituent 4 (positions 3 and 5), and position 2 and 3 are adjacent to substituent 1 and 4 respectively. Wait, no, maybe it's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that make the ring have two distinct sets of aromatic protons. So, for example, if the substituents are in the 1 and 3 positions (meta), then the ring would have two sets of aromatic H's. So, the NMR would show two signals for aromatic H's. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me not get stuck here for now and move on to the other signals.

2. **Vinyl-H signals**: Two signals, one doublet and one doublet of quart
