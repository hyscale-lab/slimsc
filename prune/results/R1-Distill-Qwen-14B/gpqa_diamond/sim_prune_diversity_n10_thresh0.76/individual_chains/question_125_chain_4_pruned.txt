Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². That looks familiar; I think that's a harmonic oscillator potential, right? Because the form is like a spring potential, Hooke's law. So this is a 3D quantum harmonic oscillator.

The problem asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy eigenvalue. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that in 3D, the energy levels of a harmonic oscillator depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the energy should be the same regardless of the direction—so the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each dimension.

Wait, in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy is given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2 ), right? Or wait, maybe it's E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum n_x + n_y + n_z. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding all three gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Yeah, that's right.

So the energy levels are quantized with E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z. So for each energy level, n can be 0,1,2,... etc.

Now, the third excited state. Wait, I have to be careful here. The ground state is the lowest energy, so that's n=0. The first excited state is n=1, then n=2 is the second excited, and n=3 is the third. Wait, no—no, wait. The ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So the third excited state would have n=3.

Wait, hang on: The ground state (lowest energy) is the 0th state. First excited is next, which is n=1. So the third excited state is
