Okay, so I have this genetics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The problem arises because this compound makes the barley unusable for food. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to produce mutants and are looking for the mutation that would eliminate the compound.

The intact gene sequence is given, followed by four mutants (1 to 4). I need to figure out which mutation would likely result in the elimination of the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, I remember that EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) is a mutagen that primarily causes point mutations, mostly base substitutions. It doesn't cause large deletions or insertions, so each mutation here is likely a substitution.

Looking at the sequences, I should compare each mutant to the intact gene to see where the changes are and what effect they might have.

Let me write down the intact gene and each mutant's sequence, focusing on the regions where they differ.

Intact:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact, the first part: the fourth and fifth nucleotides. Intact has TTTCT, mutant 1 has TTCTA. Wait, let me count. Wait, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCT... so from the beginning:

Intact: positions 1-20 (approx):

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTA TTA GT C G T … TGA.

Mutant1: ATG TTCTACGCT...

Wait, let me line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTA TTA GT C G T … TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTCTACGCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTA TTA GT CGC … TGA

Wait, perhaps better to compare each position:

Looking at the sequences:

Intact: positions (lets say) 1-25: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

So, comparing each:

The beginning: Intact's first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT.

Mutant1: ATG T T C T A CGC GGT ACT...

Oh wait, wait. Let me look for where they differ. Let's compare each nucleotide.

Looking at the first part:

Intact:
Positions 1-24 (or so): 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT
