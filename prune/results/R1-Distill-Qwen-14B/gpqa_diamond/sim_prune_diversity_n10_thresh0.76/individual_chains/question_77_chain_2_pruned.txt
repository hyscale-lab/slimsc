Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me take a deep breath and try to work through this step by step.

The question is about two different reactions, and I need to pick the correct major products from the options given. The problem is presented as two parts: reaction A and reaction B. Let's break them down one by one.

Starting with reaction A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize it. So, the structure would be a benzene ring attached to a CH2-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2 group. Wait, no, wait. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So, the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond starting at C2? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- as the substituent. But wait, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure is:

The ene group is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. So with a 3-methyl, it's CH2=CHCH(CH3)-, right? So, the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2 attached to benzene? Wait, no, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. Oh wait, no. Let me parse this correctly.

The substituent on benzene is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So, the structure is OCH2-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl). Wait, that would be OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent. But with a 3-methyl, that would make it CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. So the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is the benzene ring connected to OCH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, maybe the but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- as the substituent. So, (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methylbenzene would be benzene-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Let me try drawing it.

The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So, the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2
