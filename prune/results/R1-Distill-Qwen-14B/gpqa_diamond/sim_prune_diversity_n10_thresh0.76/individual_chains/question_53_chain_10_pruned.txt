Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The given data includes the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. 

First, the FTIR shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters typically have strong absorption around 1740 cm^-1 due to the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, we know the molecule has an ester functional group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It has six signals, which probably correspond to different sets of protons. Let's break down the information from the NMR:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H: So, the aromatic ring has two distinct sets of protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern could be para, meta, or ortho. But wait, the number of signals might help. If it's para-substituted, each substituent is opposite each other. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, the ring would have two equivalent H environments—so two signals. If it's meta, maybe more signals? Hmm, but the question says two signals, so maybe it's para. Or maybe another possibility, like two substituents that create symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that the aromatic protons split into two groups.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H: One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or an aromatic ring. Wait, in an aromatic ring, the protons are typically either in a certain substitution pattern. But perhaps these vinyl protons are part of a substituent on the ring, like an ester group with an adjacent double bond? Or maybe an allyl group? 

Wait, the presence of a doublet and a doublet of quartets suggests coupling between these protons. Let me think: a doublet of quartets (a quartet is from coupling with three equivalent protons, but wait, a quartet can also come from coupling with two protons each having two neighbors, like adjacent to a CH2 group. Hmm, maybe the vinyl protons are in a trans or cis configuration, and coupled with adjacent protons. Alternatively, maybe one of them is adjacent to a CH3 group.

Wait, but the next point says two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. So, the molecule has two sets of methyl groups. Maybe each CH3 is attached to something different. For example, perhaps an ester group and another substituent, like a methyl group attached to an oxygen, and another methyl attached somewhere else. Or maybe each substituent on the aromatic ring contributes a CH3 group.

Wait, let me think about possible structures. Let's say the aromatic ring is benzene with two substituents. One substituent is an ester group, like OCOOR, where R is an alkyl group. The other substituent might be something else, perhaps a vinyl group or another group that has CH3 and CH2.

Wait, but the absence of CH2 signals in the NMR suggests that there are no -CH2 groups in the molecule. So any substituents can't have CH2 groups. Hmm. That complicates things. So substituents must be such that any groups attached don't have CH2's. 

Wait, let's think about the ester group. The general structure of an ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if one substituent is an ester group, like OCOOR', where R' is a methyl group (so the ester is methyl something), but that would give a CH3 group. Wait, but methyl ester would have a CH3 attached to the oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the ring are an ester group (like OCOOR') and another group, say, a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), but wait, that might have CH2. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a methoxy group, but that wouldn't give CH3 unless there's another group.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group. Let me think. If the ring has an ester group and a vinyl group (like a CH2CH2 group), but wait, that would introduce CH2 groups, which would show up in NMR as a triplet or something. But the problem states there are no CH2 signals. So substituents can't have CH2 groups.

Hmm, maybe the substituents are an ester and a methyl group? But wait, that would give only one CH3, but the NMR has two CH3 signals. So maybe two substituents, each with a CH3 group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that each has a CH3.

Wait, another thought: maybe the molecule is something like para-methyl vinyl ester benzene. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and another group with a CH3, like a methyl group attached to an oxygen. But that would be a methoxy group, which would have different NMR signals.

Wait, maybe the structure is a di-substituted benzene where one substituent is an ester (like OCOCH2CH3?), but that would have CH2 groups. Alternatively, maybe the ester is something like OCOCH2Ph, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a propenyl group. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but that includes a CH2, which would show up as a signal. But the problem says there are no CH2 signals. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the
