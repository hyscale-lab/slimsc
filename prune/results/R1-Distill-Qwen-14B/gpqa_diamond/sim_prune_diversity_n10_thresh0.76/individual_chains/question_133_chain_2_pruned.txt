Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 0.2 liters, right? Because 1000 cm³ is a liter, so 200 is 0.2. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard, so maybe some activity coefficients are negligible, but I'm not sure if that matters here.

The question is asking about the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution. Orthophosphate is HPO4^3- or PO4^3-, right? Wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it dissociates, the different forms are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. Wait, I think I might get confused. So orthophosphate usually refers to H3PO4, but in solution, it's in different forms. But in this case, the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which would be K+ and H2PO4^- in solution. Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which is Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, so when you mix these two, the solution should be a buffer solution because you have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, which is the conjugate base. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should come into play here.

But wait, the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but that's the fully protonated form. But in solution, especially with these salts, H3PO4 would dissociate. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Or maybe the total concentration of all phosphate species?

Wait, the problem says "orthophosphate ions." Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, which can lose protons stepwise to form H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. So the orthophosphate ion is the HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-? Or is it specifically PO4^3-?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. I remember that orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- ion. Or wait, maybe it's the sum of all the phosphate species, but I'm not sure. The question says "orthophosphate ions," which might specifically refer to HPO4^2- and PO4^3-? Or maybe it's just PO4^3-? I need to clarify that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Because in the solution, we have a mix of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts, so maybe PO4^3- is a minor species. Or is it?

Wait, but let's outline the steps. First, I need to calculate the concentrations of each salt in the solution. Then, since they're a buffer, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. Once I have the pH, I can find the concentration of HPO4^2- or PO4^3- or whatever the case may be.

So first, find the moles of each component.

Moles = mass (g) / molecular weight (g/mol).

For KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ let's calculate that. 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007336 mol. So approximately 0.007336 moles.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 1 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005614 mol. Approximately 0.005614 moles.

Now, the solution volume is 0.200 L. So the concentrations are:

[ KH2PO4 ] = 0.007336 mol / 0.2 L = 0.
