Okay, so I've got this physics problem about vector fields and volume integrals. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

The question says that we have a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Wait, so the field is f(r) = (1/r²) ȓ, right? Because it's radial and only in the radial direction. So f(r) is a vector field that points radially outward and decreases with the square of the distance from the origin.

The integral we're looking to compute is the volume integral of the divergence of f over the sphere of radius R. That is, ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV within the sphere.

I remember from vector calculus that the divergence of a vector field F in spherical coordinates, when F has only a radial component, is given by (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r). So for F_r = 1/r², let's compute that.

Hmm, let's compute ∇ · f. So:

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²))).

Wait, simplifying inside the derivative: r² * (1/r²) is just 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇ · f = (1/r²)(0) = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at r=0, then the integral would be zero. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check. The formula for divergence when the field has only a radial component F_r is:

∇ · F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r).

So F_r is 1/r². Plugging in, we get:

(1/r²) * d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ].

Simplify inside: r² * 1/r² is 1. So now it's (1/r²) * d/dr (1). The derivative of 1 with respect to r is 0. So ∇ · F is zero everywhere except at r=0.

Wait, but then the volume integral of zero would be zero as well. So the integral should be zero. But wait, is it possible that the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, but we're integrating over a volume that includes the origin? Because if the field has a point source at the origin, maybe the divergence is not zero in a distributional sense.

Wait, another approach: sometimes these kinds of vector fields are associated with point charges or masses. For instance, in electromagnetism, the electric field of a point charge has divergence proportional to the charge density. So maybe this field is similar.

Wait, the electric field of a point charge Q is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (Q r̂)/r². The divergence of E is zero except at r=0, where it's a delta function. The integral of the divergence over any volume that includes the origin would be Q/(ε₀), right? But in this problem, the field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, so it's similar but without the 1/(4πε₀) factor. So perhaps the divergence is zero except at the origin, and the integral over the sphere of radius R would be proportional to something like the charge enclosed.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's compute the volume integral of the divergence of f(r) within the sphere of radius R.

If ∇ · f is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the integral would be zero, but that's only if the divergence is zero in the classical sense. However, in the context of distributions, the divergence might be a delta function at the origin. So perhaps the integral would not be zero but a multiple of the volume's inclusion of the origin.

Wait, so maybe I should think in terms of Gauss's Law. The integral of E · dA over a closed surface is equal to the enclosed charge divided by ε₀.

But wait, in this case, we're looking at the divergence of f, and the integral of that over the volume. From the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of f is equal to the surface integral of f · dA over the sphere of radius R.

Wait, so let's compute that surface integral. The field f(r) is (1/r²) r̂. On the sphere of radius R, r is R, so f(R) is (1/R²) r̂. The differential area element dA on the sphere is R² sinθ dθ dφ. The dot product of f and dA is f · dA = (1/R²) r̂ · (R² sinθ dθ dφ). Wait, wait, no, the differential vector area dA is R² sinθ dθ dφ r̂. So the dot product is (1/R²) r̂ · (R² sinθ dθ dφ r̂) = (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ = sinθ dθ dφ.

So the surface integral becomes ∫ (sinθ dθ dφ) over θ from 0 to π and φ from 0 to 2π. The integral of sinθ dθ from 0 to π is 2, and the integral of dφ from 0 to 2π is 2π. So 2 * 2π = 4π.

But wait, that's the surface integral of f · dA. From the divergence theorem, that should equal the volume integral of ∇ · f. So if that surface integral is 4π, then the volume integral of the divergence is 4π.

Wait, but earlier when I computed the divergence, I thought it was zero. So why is there a discrepancy?

Ah, because in reality, the divergence of f is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it's a delta function. So the volume integral of ∇ · f over the sphere includes the origin, so the integral is 4π, not zero.

Wait, so that would mean that the answer is 4π. Looking back at the options: option A is 4π, option B is 1, etc.

Wait, but let me recheck. The divergence of f(r) = (1/r²) r̂ is zero everywhere except at r=0. But when you integrate the divergence over a volume that includes r=0, the integral becomes 4π? Or is it 4π times what?

Wait, let's think again. Using the divergence theorem, ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · dA) da.

We computed the right-hand side as 4π. So ∫ (∇ · f) dV = 4π.

Wait, but that would mean that the divergence is a delta function at the origin such that its integral over any volume containing the origin is 4π. But wait, for the electric field, the integral would be Q/(ε₀), which is 4π ε₀ Q, if I remember correctly. But in this problem, f(r) is (1/r²) r̂, so maybe the integral is 4π.

Wait, so the correct answer would be 4π, which is option A.

But wait, another way to think about it is that the divergence is zero except at the origin, but the integral over the sphere includes the origin, so the integral is 4π. So the answer is 4π, option A.


The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field \( \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r}) \) inside a sphere of radius \( R \) centered at the origin. The field is given as \( \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}} \), which has only a radial component and falls off as \( 1/r^2 \). 

To compute the integral, we use the divergence theorem, which states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the surface integral of the field over the boundary of the volume. Mathematically:

\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_{S} \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \)
In spherical coordinates, for a vector field with only a radial component \( F_r \), the divergence is given by:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (r^2 F_r).
\]

Here, \( F_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \). Substituting this into the formula:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0.
\]

Thus, \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 0 \) everywhere except at \( r = 0 \), where the divergence is a delta function centered at the origin.

### Step 2: Compute the surface integral
Using the divergence theorem, the volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) is equal to the surface integral of \( \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} \) over the sphere of radius \( R \). On the sphere, \( \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{R^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}} \), and the differential area element is \( d\mathbf{A} = R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \hat{\mathbf{r}} \). The dot product \( \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} \) becomes:

\[
\mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi = \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi.
\]

The surface integral is then:

\[
\int_{S} \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi.
\]

The integral over \( \theta \) is:

\[
\int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta = 2,
\]

and the integral over \( \phi \) is:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi = 2\pi.
\]

Thus, the surface integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_{S} \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = 2 \cdot 2\pi = 4\pi.
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the result
From the divergence theorem, the volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) over the sphere is equal to the surface integral, which is \( 4\pi \). This result arises because the divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \) is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it contributes a delta function. The integral over the sphere captures this contribution.

### Final Answer
The volume integral of the divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \) inside the sphere of radius \( R \) is \( 4\pi \).
