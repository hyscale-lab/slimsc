Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about observables and their measurements. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, quantum states are usually column vectors with complex numbers and normalized. Oh wait, but this vector has real numbers. Maybe it's already normalized? Let me check. The vector is (-1, 2, 1). The norm would be the square root of ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1 )= sqrt(6). So the state vector is probably (1/sqrt(6)) multiplied by (-1, 2, 1). So the actual state vector is Ïˆ = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Then, there are two observables, P and Q. Each is represented by a matrix. I need to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P and -1 when measuring Q, in that order.

First, I remember that when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of both P and Q.

But wait, since we're measuring P first, then Q, the state after measuring P will be the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 for P. Then, measuring Q on that new state.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the process: when you measure P, the system collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, the state for the next measurement of Q is that eigenstate.

So let's start with operator P. Its matrix is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, let me write this out. So P is a 3x3 matrix:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2
