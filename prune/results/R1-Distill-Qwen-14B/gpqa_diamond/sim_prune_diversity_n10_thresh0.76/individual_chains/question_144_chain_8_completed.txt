Okay, I need to find the mean decay distance for this meson resonance X. Hmm, I remember something about particles decaying and the relation between their lifetime and the distance they travel. Let me think step by step.

So, the mean decay distance, I think, is the average distance the particle travels before it decays. I remember that the formula involves the particle's lifetime and its velocity. But wait, how do I get the lifetime from the given parameters?

Oh right, the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime. The uncertainty principle says Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Γ. The exact relation is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, I should make sure about the units here. Because Γ is given in MeV, and I need to convert that into energy units that match ħ's units.

Wait, ħ has units of energy multiplied by time. Let me recall the value of ħ. I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, Planck's constant h is about 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. But since we're working in particle physics units, I think ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm. Wait, no, maybe it's better to get the value in the correct units for this problem. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. So I need to calculate τ and then multiply by the velocity v to get the distance L = v * τ.

But wait, how do I find the velocity? Since the particle is a meson, I can assume it's moving relativistically. So I should find its velocity using its energy and mass.

The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E / (m c²). Since c² is 1 in these units (GeV), γ = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So γ is about 6.6667.

Now, the velocity v can be found using β = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Wait, let me make that right. Alternatively, since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), so β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Calculating 1/γ²: 1/(6.6667)^2 is approximately 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is about 0.9887. So β is approximately 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887c.

But wait, c is the speed of light, which is about 3 × 10^8 m/s. So v is approximately 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, back to calculating τ. Γ is given as 320 MeV. Wait, but ħ is often expressed in units of GeV·s. Let me get the value of ħ in GeV·s. I think ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ must be in GeV for this to work. Since Γ is 320 MeV, that's 0.320 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.320 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.320) × 1e-25 s.

Calculating 6.582 / 0.320: 6.582 ÷ 0.32. Let me compute that. 32 * 20 is 640, so 0.32 *20.56 is about 6.58. So 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, is that correct? Wait, no, wait. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.320 is:

6.582e-25 / 0.320 = (6.582 / 0.320) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I made a mistake in the calculation. 6.582e-25 GeV·s divided by 0.320 GeV gives τ in seconds. So 6.582e-25 / 0.320 = (6.582 / 0.320) * 1e-25 = 20.56875 * 1e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. So τ is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v multiplied by τ. So L = v * τ = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s).

Calculating that: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = let's compute the coefficients first.

2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ Let's see: 3 * 2.05 is 6.15, but since 2.966 is a bit less than 3, and 2.056875 is a bit more than 2.05, maybe around 6.11 or so. Wait, let me compute it accurately.

2.966 * 2.056875:

Break it down:

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375

0.966 * 2.056875

Hmm, 0.966 is approximately 0.966.

Wait, 2.056875 * 0.966 = let's compute 2.056875 * 0.966.

Hmm, 2.056875 * 0.9 = 1.8511875

2.056875 * 0.066 = approx 0.136303875.

So total is 1.8511875 + 0.136303875 ≈ 1.9875.

So overall, 4.11375 +1.9875 ≈ 6.10125.

So the coefficient is approximately 6.10125.

The exponent is 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So L ≈ 6.10125e-16 meters.

Wait, that's 6.1e-16 meters. Looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16 m and option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, but my calculation gives about 6e-16 m, which is not among the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of β. Let me recheck that.

So we calculated γ as E / (m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666667.

Then, β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

1/γ² is (1/(6.666667)^2) = 1/(44.444444) = approx 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thought: maybe I should use the relativistic relation between the total energy and velocity more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute β as (p c) / E, where p is the momentum.

Wait, p = gamma m v, but maybe it's easier to compute beta as (pc)/(E) because E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

Wait, let's compute p.

p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

But since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², perhaps better to compute p in GeV/c.

So E = 8 GeV, m c² = 1.2 GeV.

So p = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) GeV/c = sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV/c = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV/c.

So beta = (p c)/(E) = (7.91 GeV/c * c) / (8 GeV) ) = 7.91 / 8 = 0.98875.

So that's consistent with the earlier calculation. So beta is indeed about 0.98875.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mean lifetime. Let me recheck that.

Γ is the total decay width, which relates to the lifetime via τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, what are the units here? ħ is in GeV·s, Γ is in GeV, so τ will be in seconds.

Yes, so 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So that seems correct.

Now, L = v * τ.

v = beta * c = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = ?

Let me compute 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24:

2.966e8 is 2.966 * 1e8.

2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 * 1e-24.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ let's calculate:

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375,

0.966 * 2.056875 ≈ 1.9875 (as before),

so total is 6.10125.

Exponents: 1e8 *1e-24 = 1e-16.

So 6.10125e-16 m.

Wait, but the options don't include this. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for something else. Let me think again about the formula. Oh wait! The mean decay length is c * τ * β, but sometimes in some derivations, it's written as L = c * τ * β.

Wait, because velocity v = β c, so L = v τ = β c τ.

So perhaps I should have written L = β c τ.

But that's what I did. So why am I getting 6e-16, but the options are around 4e-15 or 5e-15?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the relativistic gamma factor in a different way. Wait, another approach: the total decay width Γ is given, and the natural linewidth is Γ. The lifetime tau is related to Γ via ħ tau = ħ / Γ. So that part seems correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the production energy is given, but the actual energy of the particle is the center-of-mass energy, so perhaps I should use that as the energy of the meson, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the problem states that the production energy is 8 GeV, so that's the energy of the meson.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the velocity beta more accurately. Let me compute beta precisely.

We have gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.66666666667.

So gamma = 20/3.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444444.

So 1/gamma^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) = let's compute more accurately.

0.9775 is between (0.988)^2 = 0.976144 and (0.989)^2=0.978121.

Wait, 0.988^2 = (0.98 *10 + 0.008 *10)^2 → more accurately, 0.988 * 0.988.

Let me compute 0.988 * 0.988:

= (0.98 +0.008)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008^2.

0.98² = 0.9604.

2 * 0.98 * 0.008 = 0.01568.

0.008²= 0.000064.

Total: 0.9604 +0.01568= 0.97608 + 0.000064= 0.976144.

So 0.988^2 = 0.976144.

But 0.9775 is 0.001356 more than that.

So the difference is 0.9775 - 0.976144 = 0.001356.

So how much more than 0.988 is beta? Let me let x be the small increment beyond 0.988.

We can approximate using the derivative. Let f(x) = (0.988 + x)^2 ≈ 0.976144 + 2*0.988 * x.

Set f(x) = 0.9775.

So 0.976144 + 2*0.988 x = 0.9775 → 2*0.988 x = 0.001356 → x ≈ 0.001356/(2*0.988) ≈ 0.001356/(1.976) ≈ 0.000686.

So x ≈ 0.000686.

So beta ≈ 0.988 + 0.000686 ≈ 0.988686.

So beta is approximately 0.988686.

So more accurately, beta is about 0.988686.

So, let's redo the calculation with more precise beta.

v = beta * c = 0.988686 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966058e8 m/s.

Now, L = v * tau.

Tau was 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So 2.966058e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute this more accurately.

2.966058e8 = 2.966058 * 1e8.

2.056875e-24 = 2.056875 * 1e-24.

Multiply 2.966058 * 2.056875:

Let me compute this step by step.

2.966058 * 2 = 5.932116

2.966058 * 0.056875 = ?

Wait, 0.056875 is 56875e-6.

Breaking it down:

2.966058 * 0.05 = 0.1483029

2.966058 * 0.006875 = let's compute:

0.006875 = 6875e-6.

But 2.966058 * 0.006875 = ?

Hmm, 2.966058 * 0.006 = 0.01779635

2.966058 * 0.000875 = Let's compute:

0.000875 is 7/8 of 0.001.

So 2.966058 * 0.000875 = (2.966058 * 0.001) * 0.875 = 0.002966058 * 0.875.

0.002966058 * 0.875 = 0.002966058 * (7/8) = 0.002582719.

So 0.006875 gives 0.01779635 + 0.002582719 = 0.020379069.

So 0.05 gives 0.1483029 and 0.006875 gives 0.020379069.

Adding together: 0.1483029 + 0.020379069 = 0.168681969.

So 2.966058 * 0.056875 = 0.168681969.

So the total for 2.966058 * 2.056875 is 5.932116 (from 2) + 0.168681969 = 6.099967969.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: Wait, no, I think I messed up. Because 2.056875 is 2 + 0.056875, so when I multiply 2.966058 by 2, I get 5.932116, and when I multiply by 0.056875, I get 0.168681969. So adding them gives 5.932116 + 0.168681969 = 6.100797969.

So the product is approximately 6.1008e-16 meters.

But the options are options A and C are around 5e-15 and 5e-16, and options B and D are around 4e-15 and 4e-16.

Wait, 6.1e-16 is 6.1e-16 m, which is 6.1 * 1e-16 m. The options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B) 4.0655e-15 m

C) 5.0223e-15 m

D) 4.0655e-16 m

So my result of 6.1e-16 is not among them. So I must have made a mistake in calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong value for ħ.

Wait, let me check the value of ħ. I think I used ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Wait, wait a second: No, I think that's incorrect. Let me verify the exact value. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact value in GeV·s.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute ħ in units of GeV·s.

I found that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Yes, so that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of velocity. Let me compute beta more accurately.

Wait, another approach: since gamma is 20/3, let's compute beta as sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2).

Wait, (3/20)^2 is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the velocity in terms of the natural units. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity using the relation:

v = c * sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E^2)).

Wait, m is in GeV/c², E is in GeV, so units would work out.

So v = c * sqrt(1 - ( (1.2 GeV/c² ) c² )^2 / (8 GeV)^2 )

Wait, (m c²) = 1.2 GeV.

So the term becomes sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2) ) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887 c.

So that's the same as before.

Hmm. So I'm back to my initial calculation. So why is my result not matching any option? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the product.

Let me recompute 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

2.966e8 is 2.966 * 1e8.

2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 * 1e-24.

So 2.966 * 2.056875 = ?

Let me compute 2.966 * 2 = 5.932.

2.966 * 0.056875 = ?

Compute 2.966 * 0.05 = 0.1483.

2.966 * 0.006875 = 0.020379.

So total 0.1483 + 0.020379 = 0.168679.

So 5.932 + 0.168679 = 6.100679.

So 6.100679e-16 m. So about 6.1e-16 m.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the lifetime.

Wait, wait! Another thought: perhaps in particle physics, the decay width Γ is given in MeV, but I should ensure that I'm using the correct units.

Ah! Wait a minute. The width Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.320 GeV. So that part was correct.

Wait, but wait: Maybe the formula for tau is tau = ħ/(Gamma), but I might have missed a factor of c somewhere. Because ħ has units of GeV·s, and Gamma is in GeV, so tau is in seconds. So that part is correct.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the formula is c tau = ħ/(Gamma) ? No, no, because the units don't match. ħ has units of GeV·s, Gamma is GeV, so ħ/(Gamma) is GeV·s / GeV = seconds. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ħ. Let me check the exact value.

I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps using natural units where c=1, and then converting at the end.

In natural units, ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, tau in natural units would be ħ / Gamma.

Gamma is 320 MeV. So tau (natural units) = 197.33 MeV·fm / 320 MeV = (197.33/320) fm ≈ 0.616656 fm.

Now, to convert tau into seconds, I need to convert fm to meters and use the speed of light.

Wait, 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

But in natural units, the time unit is (fm) / (c), since c=1 in natural units. So 1 fm = c * (time in seconds).

So 1 fm = 3e8 m/s * t → t = 1e-15 m / (3e8 m/s) ) = 1e-23 / 3 seconds ≈ 3.333e-24 seconds per fm.

So tau in natural units is 0.616656 fm, which is 0.616656 * 3.333e-24 s ≈ 2.0555e-24 s.

Which matches our earlier calculation.

So that's correct.

Now, the distance L = v * tau.

v is beta c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.0555e-24 s ≈ 6.1005e-16 m.

Again, same result.

So my calculation is consistent, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is using a different approach, or I made a mistake in the assumption.

Wait, perhaps the decay length formula is L = c * tau * beta.

Wait, that's the same as v * tau = beta c * tau.

So, same result.

Wait, perhaps the width is given in MeV, and I should have converted it to GeV correctly. Oh, 320 MeV is 0.320 GeV, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic relation for the mean lifetime. Hmm, but I think that's already accounted for in the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the total decay width as the natural linewidth, but I think I used it correctly.

Wait, perhaps the mean decay distance is given by L = (c * tau) * beta.

Which is same as v * tau.

So, same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the numerical value more accurately.

Let me compute 6.582e-25 / 0.320.

6.582 / 0.320 = ?

6.582 ÷ 0.32.

0.32 * 20 = 6.4, so 20 times 0.32 is 6.4. The remainder is 6.582 -6.4=0.182.

0.182 / 0.32 = 0.56875.

So 20.56875.

So tau is 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta because of more precise gamma.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666667.

So compute beta more accurately.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma² = (8/1.2)^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444444444.

1/gamma² = 9/400=0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Now, let me compute sqrt(0.9775) accurately.

We can use the Taylor expansion for sqrt(x) around x=1.

sqrt(1 - d) ≈ 1 - d/2 - d²/8, for small d.

Here, d=0.0225.

So sqrt(0.9775) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ 1 - 0.0225/2 - (0.0225)^2/8.

Compute:

0.0225/2=0.01125.

(0.0225)^2=0.00050625; 0.00050625/8=0.00006328125.

So sqrt ≈ 1 - 0.01125 - 0.00006328125 = 0.98868671875.

So beta ≈0.98868671875.

So v= beta * c = 0.98868671875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966060156e8 m/s.

So L = v * tau.

v=2.966060156e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L= 2.966060156e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Let me compute 2.966060156 * 2.056875.

Let me compute:

2 * 2.056875 =4.11375.

0.966060156 *2.056875.

Compute 0.966060156 *2=1.932120312.

0.966060156 *0.056875.

Compute that:

0.056875 = 56875e-6.

0.966060156 *0.05=0.0483030078.

0.966060156 *0.006875 = 0.006654336.

So adding:0.0483030078 + 0.006654336 = 0.0549573438.

So 0.966060156 *2.056875 = 1.932120312 + 0.0549573438 ≈1.9870776558.

So total 2.966060156 *2.056875 =4.11375 +1.9870776558 =6.0999276558.

So L≈6.0999e-16 meters.

Again, the same result.

So perhaps the problem expects a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the decay width is the total width, which is the same as the natural linewidth. But I think I used that correctly.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the formula for the mean decay length based on the meson's lifetime and speed, but I think that's what I did.

Hmm. Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ħ. Let me double-check the value of ħ.

Wait, looking up the exact value of ħ in GeV·s:

Yes, ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So that's correct.

Hmm. So why isn't the result matching any options? Perhaps I should check if I multiplied the correct exponents.

Wait, 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Exponents: 1e8 *1e-24 =1e-16.

Coefficient:2.966 *2.056875=6.1008.

So 6.1008e-16 m.

Wait, but the options have 5.0223e-16 m and 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I should compute it using more precise values.

Let me recalculate 6.582e-25 / 0.320.

6.582 / 0.320 = 20.56875.

So tau=20.56875e-25 s=2.056875e-24 s.

So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider the particle's lifetime in the lab frame. Since the particle is moving, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. Oh wait, but I think I already accounted for gamma in the calculation because tau is the proper lifetime, and the observed lifetime is gamma * tau.

Wait, no: wait, the formula for tau is tau = ħ / Gamma, which is the proper lifetime. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau. Because decay width is related to the proper lifetime, not the dilated lifetime. Wait, no, I think that's where I made a mistake.

Wait, no, the decay width is related to the lifetime of the particle in its rest frame. So when the particle is moving, its lifetime is longer (gamma * tau), but the decay width itself is the same. Because the decay width is a property of the particle, not dependent on the frame.

Wait, so the decay width Γ is related to the proper lifetime tau_0 via Γ = ħ / tau_0.

So in the lab frame, the lifetime is tau = gamma * tau_0.

But when calculating the mean decay distance, it's v multiplied by tau, which is the lab frame lifetime.

Wait, so perhaps I should have used tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

So tau_0 = ħ / Γ.

tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = gamma * (ħ/Γ).

So L = v * tau_lab = beta c * gamma * (ħ/Γ).

Wait, that's different from what I did earlier. Oh no! I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I used tau = ħ / Γ, which is tau_0, the proper lifetime, but in reality, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So I should have multiplied tau_0 by gamma to get the lab frame lifetime.

So the correct approach is:

tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.

tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

Thus, L = v * tau_lab = beta c * gamma * tau_0 = beta c gamma (ħ / Gamma).

Wait, so in that case, I should recalculate using tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

So let me redo the calculation.

Tau_0 = ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.320 GeV) )= 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma = 20/3 ≈6.6667.

Tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 =6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, wait, no: wait, gamma is 6.6667, so 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s = approx 1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, that's a longer lifetime, so the decay length would be longer, which would explain why my initial calculation was shorter.

Wait, no, wait: no, because I think I messed up. Let me compute it again.

tau_0 = 2.056875e-24 s.

gamma is 6.6667.

tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 =6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s = approx 1.37125e-23 s.

v = beta c ≈ 0.9886867 *3e8 m/s ≈2.96606e8 m/s.

So L = v * tau_lab =2.96606e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Compute 2.96606e8 *1.37125e-23.

Coefficients: 2.96606 *1.37125 ≈ let's compute.

Approximately:

3 *1.37125=4.11375.

But 2.96606 is 3 - 0.03394. So 1.37125 * (3 -0.03394) = 4.11375 - (1.37125 * 0.03394).

Compute 1.37125 *0.03394 ≈ 0.04655.

So 4.11375 -0.04655≈4.0672.

So the coefficient is approximately4.0672.

Exponents: 1e8 * 1e-23=1e-15.

So L≈4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to this value.

Ah, so I see where I went wrong earlier. I forgot to account for the time dilation factor gamma when calculating the lifetime in the lab frame. So the mean decay length is longer because the particle's lifetime is longer in the lab frame.

So the correct approach is to use the lab frame lifetime (tau_lab = gamma * tau_0), which then gives L= v * tau_lab ≈4.067e-15 m, which matches option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]

where \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \) is the lifetime of the particle in the lab frame, and \( v \) is the particle's velocity. The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is related to the total decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

The lab frame lifetime is then:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_0
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The energy \( E \) is \( 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and the mass \( m \) is \( 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \tau_0 \)
The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), and the total decay width \( \Gamma \) is \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.320 \, \text{GeV} \). Therefore:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.320} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \)
The lab frame lifetime is:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_0 = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is related to \( \beta \) by \( v = \beta c \), where \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \). First, calculate \( \beta \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus:

\[
v = \beta c = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23})
\]

First, calculate the coefficient:

\[
2.966 \cdot 1.37125 \approx 4.067
\]

Then, combine the powers of 10:

\[
L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
