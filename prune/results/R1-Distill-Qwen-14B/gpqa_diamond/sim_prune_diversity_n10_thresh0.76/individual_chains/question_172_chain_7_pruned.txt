Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let me think through this.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, no, wait. It says they're twice as excited. Wait, actually, no, more precisely, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. So maybe that's a red herring for this particular part of the problem.

Wait, no, the key point is the excitation. So in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So I think that means the number of atoms in that higher energy state is higher in star_1 compared to star_2.

Since the stellar photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), I can use the Boltzmann equation. Right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, let me denote n1 as the population in the excited state for star_1, and n2 for star_2. The problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited, so n1 = 2 * n2.
