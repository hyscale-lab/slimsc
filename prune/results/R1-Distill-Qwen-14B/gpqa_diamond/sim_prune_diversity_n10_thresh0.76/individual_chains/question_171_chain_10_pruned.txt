Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I need to figure out the order of the substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer. Let's see, the substances are numbered 1 to 6, and each is a benzene derivative.

The question says that each undergoes an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, but for some of these, like if there's a strong directing group, maybe the substitution isn't straightforward? Or maybe bromine is acting as the electrophile, but the substituents on the benzene ring will direct where the substitution happens.

I remember that substituents on benzene can be activating or deactivating and can be ortho/para directors or meta directors. So the position of the substitution (para, ortho, meta) will affect the yield of the para isomer.

The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, I think the para fraction depends on how easily the substituent directs the incoming bromine to the para position.

Wait, but some substituents are meta directors, so they don't contribute to para substitution. While others are para directors, leading to more para substitution. Also, the activating groups might make the ring more reactive, so the reaction happens more in certain positions.

But wait, in this case, bromine is the electrophile. So first, the ring must be activated enough for the substitution to occur. But some substituents might deactivate the ring, making substitution harder. So for those, the substituent might not direct as effectively.

Each substance has a different substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: So that's toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para director.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: That's a benzoyloxyethyl group? Wait, no, wait: C6H5-COOC2H5 is benzene with a COOEt group. The carbonyl is usually deactivating because of the electron-withdrawing effect. But wait, the COOEt group is an ester, which is an electron-withdrawing group. So it's deactivating and meta-directing.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorobenzene. Chlorine is a deactivating (due to electronegativity) but ortho/para director because the lone pairs can donate through resonance.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethylbenzene. The ethyl group is activating, ortho/para director.

6) C6H5-COOH: Benzoic acid. The COOH group is deactivating because of the electron-withdrawing effect (due to the -COOH being a strong EWG). So it's meta-directing.

Wait, but wait. For substituents, the directing depends on both the group's nature and whether it's activating or deactivating. So, activating groups are usually ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups can be either, depending on their structure.

Let me list each substituent and their directing effect:

1) -CH3: activating, ortho/para (so substitution can occur in ortho, para; more in para in some cases).

2) -COOEt (ester): deactivating, meta director.

3) -Cl: deactivating (due to being EWG), but ortho/para director because Cl has lone pairs that can resonate into the ring, but overall deactivating.

4) -NO2: strong deactivating, meta director.

5) -C2H5: activating, ortho/para.

6) -COOH: deactivating, meta director.

Wait, except for -Cl and -SO3H, which are ortho/para directors despite being deactivating. So in case of -Cl, it's ortho/para, but for others like -COOH, it's meta.

Wait no, benzoic acid's COOH group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing. So, that's correct.

So, now, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, we need to see how much the reaction favors para substitution.

But wait, bromine may add in different positions based on the substituent's directing.

Wait, but the question states that each undergoes an electrophilic substitution with bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. So, perhaps their structures are such that the substitution occurs only in a particular position, making the para-isomer the major product or not.

Wait, but the substituent's directing effect determines where the substitution occurs. If the substituent is a strong ortho/para director, the substitution can happen in those positions. But if the substituent is a meta director, substitution occurs in the meta position.

So for each substituent, the para product will be formed only if the substituent allows para substitution.

For example, the substituents that are ortho/para directors (like -CH3, -Cl, -C2H5) can lead to substitution in the para position. Whereas substituents that are meta directors (like NO2, COOEt, COOH) would not form para products but meta instead.

Wait, but wait, the para product is possible only if the substituent is an ortho/para director. So, for substituents that are meta directors, the para product would not form. Or maybe they form some, but it's the minor product.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So the para product is possible only when the substituent is an ortho/para director because only then can the incoming electrophile add to the para position.

So, for substituents that are meta directors, the para product won't form, so the weight fraction is zero. But that can't be right because the options have all their fractions ordered.

Wait, but in reality, when a substituent is ortho/para directing, the incoming electrophile adds to ortho, para positions. So the major products would be ortho and para, and the ratio depends on the substituent's activating effect.

But wait, the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. That's confusing. Because usually, substitution occurs in both ortho and para positions. But the question says only one is formed. So perhaps all the substitution occurs in the para position, which would imply that the substituent strongly directs to para.

Wait, that's a bit unclear. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

"Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):"

Hmm, perhaps each reaction produces only a single product, which is the major product. So, for each substituent, the bromine adds in the position that's most favored, which could be either para or ortho.

Wait, but that's not possible because for substituents that are ortho/para directors, substitution occurs in both positions, but the question says only one product is formed. So perhaps it's assumed that only the para product is formed or only the ortho.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is such that substitution occurs only in one position, leading to only one product. So
