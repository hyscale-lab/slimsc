Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. It's being reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus with HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, that's when the nitrile is attached to something else. Or wait, no, maybe that's for the hydrolysis of esters or something else. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI might be used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction. Wait, no, Wolff-Kishner is for converting carbonyl groups (like ketones or aldehydes) into methylene groups by treating with hydrazine, then heating with strong base and a catalyst like sodium or potassium. So maybe that's not it here.

Wait, another thought: I've heard that red phosphorus and HI can be used to convert alkyne groups into alkenes. Oh right! The process is called the hydroxylation of alkynes or the hydration of alkynes, but wait, no, that's with mercury. Wait, maybe it's the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's used to remove functional groups. Wait, another possibility is that red phosphorus and HI are used to cleave double bonds via a reaction called the Witting reaction? Or wait, maybe it's for the dehydrohalogenation? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, I think that when alkenes are treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's a reaction that adds HI across the double bond. But wait, no, I think that's the addition of HX (like H2O, HI, HBr) to alkenes, which would be acid-catalyzed addition. But red phosphorus and HI are often used in the dehydrohalogenation or in elimination reactions. Wait, no, I might be mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the structure would have a cyclohexene ring. Let me try to draw this mentally. The cyclohexene is at position 3, so the ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (assuming numbering starts at the formyl group as position 1). Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-). So the structure would have a cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 2 and 5.

The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI. So, what does that do? Oh wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the Cleve elimination or in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I remember that when you have allylic or benzylic halides, they can undergo elimination. But wait, in this case, maybe the HI is acting as a nucleophile, and perhaps it's adding to double bonds.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of red phosphorus, HI can act as a source of iodide ions. Red phosphorus is often used as a reducing agent. Wait, perhaps it's the Clemmensen reduction? No, Clemmensen is for reducing ketones to alkanes, using Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat. But that's with HCl, not HI. Wait, but Clemmensen uses HCl, while another reduction called the Wurtz reaction uses Na and NH3, but that's for coupling.

Wait, maybe red phosphorus and HI are used to perform a deoxygenation. For example, in the presence of a carbonyl group, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps it's the reduction of a carbonyl to a CH2 group. Wait, wait, I think that when you have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it converts the carbonyl group into a methylene group (-CH2-). So, the carbonyl O is replaced by CH2.

Wait, let me think about that. So for example, if you have RCHO, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would give RCH2I? Or maybe RCH2-? Or maybe it's a different process. Alternatively, I think that the reaction could be the conversion of alkenes to diols using something else, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (so a double bond), a formyl group (CHO), and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-). So, when reacted with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

I think that in this case, the reaction is the elimination of water from a diol or something else, but perhaps it's more about adding HI across the double bonds.

Wait, an alternative thought: perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening, but that seems less likely here.

Wait, let's break down the starting molecule. The cyclohexene has substituents at 2 and 5 positions. The substituents are formyl and vinyl groups. So, the molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-ene-carboxylic acid. So, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. Then, at C2, a formyl (CHO), and at C5, a vinyl (CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH-). So, the substituents are at positions 2 (CHO) and 5 (CH2CH2?), but wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, the substituent at position 5 is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-).

Now, when this reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm. Red phosphorus is often used as a reducing agent. So, perhaps this is a deoxygenation reaction, where the carbonyl groups are reduced.

Wait, let's think about each functional group. The molecule has a formyl group (CHO), a cyclohexene ring (double bond), and a vinyl group (another double bond). So, the molecule has three double bonds: one in the ring, one in the vinyl group, and the aldehyde's double bond.

But wait, the aldehyde is a carbonyl group (O double bond C), but the other double bonds are in the ring and the vinyl group.

Wait, the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated by the formula: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since this compound has multiple double bonds, the DoU would be the sum of all the double bonds and rings.

But the question is about the product after reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI. So, what's the product?

Wait, I think that in this reaction, the aldehyde group (CHO) is being converted. Let's think about that. The reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI. In some reactions, aldehydes can be reduced. For example, using H2/Ni would reduce an aldehyde to CH2OH. But with red phosphorus and HI, I think it's a different reaction. Maybe it's the formation of an iodide.

Wait, another thought: the reaction might be the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's for ketones, and I don't think that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihydroxylation. Wait, no, dihydroxylation typically uses OsO4 or another oxidizing agent, not HI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydration, but that's for alkynes, not alkenes.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider each functional group and see how it reacts.

So, the starting molecule has:

1. A cyclohexene ring (double bond)
2. A formyl group (CHO)
3. A vinyl group (CH2=CH-)

Red phosphorus and HI. Hmm. I'm trying to remember if this is a known reaction. Oh! Wait, I think that when alkenes are treated with HI in the presence of a red phosphorus catalyst, it's the addition of HI across the double bond. So it would add H and I across each end of the double bond.

But wait, red phosphorus is sometimes used as a reducing agent. Alternatively, in the presence of excess HI, perhaps it's a cleavage reaction. Oh! Maybe it's the cleavage of double bonds. I've heard that HI in the presence of a metal can cleave double bonds. For example, in the presence of H2O and acid, alkenes can undergo hydration, but that's not with HI.

Wait, another approach: think about the product after reaction. If the cyclohexene ring's double bond is cleaved, the ring would open. So, if the cyclohexene (C3 and C4) double bond is cleaved, the ring would break there, leading to a diol or some other product. Wait, but with HI, perhaps it's a halohydrin formation, but that's more like adding H and X across the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening via addition of HI, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle. The formyl group (CHO) is a carbonyl. When treated with reducing agents, such as LiAlH4, it would be reduced to CH2OH. But with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the CHO is converted into CH2I. Because red phosphorus and HI could act as a source of H and I. So, the aldehyde becomes CH2I.

Wait, I think that when an aldehyde is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reaction where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a hydrogen and iodide. So, the aldehyde (RCHO) would become RCH2I.

So, in the starting molecule, the formyl group (CHO) becomes CH2I after reaction. That would be one change.

What about the other groups? The cyclohexene ring has a double bond. Would that be affected? And the vinyl group (CH2=CH-).

Wait, if the reaction is adding HI, then perhaps the double bonds (both in the ring and in the vinyl group) would add HI.

Alternatively, perhaps only the aldehyde is reacting, and the other double bonds remain.

Wait, but the question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product. So I need to count all the double bonds and rings in the product.

Let me think: the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (so that's one ring, which is one DoU), a formyl group (which is a double bond—so DoU 1), and a vinyl group (another double bond, DoU 1). So total DoU is 1 (ring) + 2 (double bonds) = 3, plus the formyl's double bond? Wait, wait, wait, the formyl is a carbonyl, which is a double bond, so that's another one. So total DoU would be 3 (ring and two double bonds) plus the carbonyl (so 4), but I might be getting the count wrong.

Wait, the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me count:

- Cyclohexene: 1 ring and 1 double bond → 2 DoU (since a ring is equivalent to a double bond)
- The formyl group (CHO): 1 DoU (the carbonyl)
- The vinyl group: another DoU (the double bond)

So that's 2 (cyclohexene) + 1 (CHO) + 1 (vinyl) = 4 DoU.

But wait, the cyclohexene's ring is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so it's one ring and one double bond. So each contributes a DoU. So 2 DoU from the ring and double bond, plus CHO (1) and vinyl (1) → total 4.

Now, when treating with red phosphorus and HI, what happens:

1. The formyl group (CHO) is probably reduced to CH2I. So the carbonyl (DoU 1) becomes a single bond, so DoU decreases by 1.

2. The cyclohexene ring's double bond: if HI adds to it, it would become a single bond, but that's not necessarily the case. Wait, but if the double bond is in the ring, adding HI would open the ring if it's an exocyclic double bond. Alternatively, the double bond could be hydrogenated, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI are used for hydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring's double bond is being hydrolyzed. Wait, but without a catalyst, maybe not.

Wait, another possibility: the red phosphorus and HI could be causing the elimination of the cyclohexene's double bond. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is only affecting the aldehyde group. So, if the aldehyde is converted to CH2I, the DoU from that group goes from 1 to 0. So the product would have DoU of 3 (from the ring and double bonds) + 0 (from the aldehyde) + 1 (from the vinyl group) → 4 DoU? No, wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each functional group's fate.

- The cyclohexene ring's double bond: if it's unchanged, it contributes 2 DoU (1 ring, 1 double bond)
- The formyl group becomes CH2I, so it's a single bond now; DoU decreases by 1.
- The vinyl group's double bond: if it's unaffected, contributes 1 DoU.

So, the product would have:

- Cyclohexene ring: 2 DoU (ring and double bond)
- Formyl → CH2I: now 0 DoU (single bond)
- Vinyl: 1 DoU.

So total DoU would be 2 + 0 + 1 = 3.

Wait, but wait: the cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So it's a ring plus a double bond, which together count as two DoU.

But if the ring's double bond is not affected, then it remains as two DoU.

So overall, the product would have:

- 2 (cyclohexene ring and double bond)
- 0 (formyl)
- 1 (vinyl)

Total DoU: 3.

But wait, the question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency, which is the same as the degree of unsaturation.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene's double bond is also adding HI, so the double bond becomes a single bond, which would eliminate DoU.

Wait, I thought that when HI adds to a double bond, it adds across it, converting the double bond into single bonds, thereby reducing the DoU.

So if the cyclohexene's double bond adds HI, that DoU is lost.

Similarly, the vinyl group's double bond: if it adds HI, that DoU is lost.

Wait, but the starting molecule has 4 DoU. If two of them (cyclohexene and vinyl) are each opened by adding HI, then DoU would decrease by 2.

Plus, the aldehyde is converted, losing 1 DoU. So total DoU would be 4 - 3 = 1.

But that's only if all three double bonds are opened, which may not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction only affects the aldehyde and the cyclohexene's double bond.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction in more detail. The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. So, perhaps it's a sequence of additions.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde group is first converted to CH2I. Then, any remaining double bonds would react.

Wait, but the main question is about the product's index of hydrogen deficiency. So perhaps I should consider each possible transformation.

Let me try to outline the structure after reaction.

Starting with 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

After reaction with red phosphorus and HI:

- The formyl group (CHO) is replaced by CH2I → no DoU here.
- The cyclohexene's double bond (C3-C4) is opened by HI addition. So, that would add H and I across the double bond, turning it into a single bond. So the ring's double bond is gone, meaning the ring is now a cyclohexane (no double bond) but with substituents. So the ring would lose one DoU (as the double bond is gone), but the ring itself is still a six-membered ring, which counts as one DoU. Wait, no, because a ring's DoU is one. Wait, a cyclohexane (saturated) has one ring but no double bonds: DoU is 1. A cyclohexene has one ring and one double bond → DoU 2. So if the double bond is opened, the cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane, which has one DoU (the ring).

So, the cyclohexene's DoU goes from 2 to 1. So, the change is a loss of 1 DoU.

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is another double bond. So, if that reacts with HI, adding across the double bond, it would become CH2-CH2I, perhaps. So that would remove the double bond, losing one DoU.

So, in the product:

- Cyclohexane ring: 1 DoU (only the ring)
- CH2 group from the formyl: no DoU
- Vinyl group becomes single bond: no DoU

So total DoU: 1.

Wait, so the starting material has four DoU, and the product has one. So the index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.

But wait, let me recount:

Starting DoU: 4 (ring and double bond in cyclohexene, formyl, vinyl)

After reaction:

- Ring: 1 DoU (cyclohexane)
- Formyl → CH2I: 0
- Vinyl → CH2CH2I? No, wait, the vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the cyclohexane. If HI adds, it would become CH2-CH2I. So that's a single bond, so DoU 0.

So product DoU = 1.

If that's the case, the answer would be option A) 1.

But wait, another possibility: what about the carboxylic acid group? How does that react with HI and red phosphorus?

The starting material has a carboxylic acid group (COOH). Does that react in this condition?

Red phosphorus and HI are usually not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. They might, but I don't think so. Alternatively, the carboxylic acid could react with HI, but that would be a nucleophilic attack. Wait, carboxylic acids are weakly acidic but not enough to react with HI under these conditions. So the COOH group would remain as is.

So, the product would have a COOH group, which is a carbonyl (DoU 1). But wait, no, a carboxylic acid has a carbonyl, so that's a DoU.

Wait, this changes things. Earlier, I thought the formyl group (CHO) was converted to CH2I, so the COOH group remains. So the product would have:

- Cyclohexane ring: 1 DoU
- CH2I from CHO: 0
- CH2CH2I from vinyl: 0
- COOH: 1 DoU (carbonyl).

So total DoU: 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, but that's a problem because I thought the formyl group was converted, but the carboxylic acid's carbonyl is another DoU. So starting DoU was 4, product DoU is 2, so the index would be 2. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in that analysis.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the carboxylic acid group. So the product would have:

- COOH (DoU 1)
- CH2I (0)
- The ring: I thought it's cyclohexane (1 DoU)
- Vinyl group: if it's opened, 0.

So total DoU: 1 + 1 = 2. But the options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Wait, so none of the options match 2. That suggests I made a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene's double bond is not opened. Let me think again.

Perhaps the reaction only affects the aldehyde group, and the other double bonds remain.

So the product would have:

- Formyl → CH2I: 0 DoU
- Cyclohexene ring (still DoU 2: ring and double bond)
- Vinyl group: DoU 1

Plus COOH: DoU 1.

So total DoU: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. So that's the same as the starting material. But I don't see why only the aldehyde would react.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction adds HI across the formyl group, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the formyl group to CH2OH, but with HI, that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction mechanism. Red phosphorus and HI are used in a reaction called the hydroiodination of alkynes, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the hydroboration-oxidation, but that's done with BH3 and then oxidizing. Not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dihalogenation. When a diene reacts with HI, perhaps in the presence of red phosphorus, it adds two molecules of HI, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but red phosphorus is a strong reducing agent.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of the possible product structures.

If the formyl group is converted to CH2I, the vinyl group is unaffected, and the cyclohexene's double bond is unaffected, then the product would have:

- 2 DoU (cyclohexene)
- 0 (formyl)
- 1 (vinyl)
- 1 (COOH)

Total DoU: 4. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, if the formyl is CH2I, the cyclohexene's double bond is opened (so DoU from 2 to 1, cyclohexane), and the vinyl's double bond is opened (DoU 0), then:

- 1 (cyclohexane)
- 0 (formyl)
- 0 (vinyl)
- 1 (COOH)

Total DoU: 2. Still not matching.

Another possibility: the reaction involves the cleavage of the vinyl group. For example, adding HI to the vinyl group. But without knowing the exact reaction, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps all the double bonds are opened, so the product has no double bonds, and the cyclohexane ring remains.

So, products:

- Cyclohexane: 1 DoU (ring)
- CH2I from CHO: 0
- CH2CH2I from vinyl: no DoU
- COOH: 1 DoU (carbonyl)

So, total DoU: 1 (ring) + 1 (COOH) = 2. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: the index of hydrogen deficiency is the sum of rings and double bonds.

The starting material has:

- 1 ring (cyclohexene)
- 3 double bonds (cyclohexene double bond, formyl carbonyl, vinyl double bond) → 3.

So total DoU: 1 (ring) + 3 (double bonds) = 4.

In the product:

- If the formyl is converted to CH2I (no DoU)
- The cyclohexene's double bond is opened (so ring remains, DoU 1)
- The vinyl's double bond is opened (DoU 0)
- COOH remains (DoU 1)

So DoU is 1 (cyclohexane) + 1 (COOH) = 2. But again, 2 isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the COOH group. So the product would have:

- Ring: DoU 1
- COOH: DoU 1
- Formyl: DoU 0
- Vinyl: DoU 0

Total DoU: 1 + 1 = 2. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction affects the COOH group. For example, saponification, but that's with a base, not HI.

Alternatively, maybe the COOH group is reduced to CH2OH. But with red phosphorus and HI, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the COOH group is deprotonated by HI, but that's unlikely since HI is a strong acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about iodination. Maybe the aldehyde's O is replaced by I, but that's not the typical case.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is converted into a single bond, and the cyclohexene's double bond is also opened.

So, in that case:

- Cyclohexane (1 DoU)
- Formyl CH2I (0)
- Vinyl CH2CH2I (0)
- COOH (1 DoU)

Total DoU: 1 + 1 = 2. Again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not just adding HI but actually opening the rings. Wait, but the cyclohexene is a six-membered ring; adding HI wouldn't open it unless it's a strained ring, which it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation, but that's more with OsO4.

Another angle: the index of hydrogen deficiency is the number of hydrogen atoms less than the maximum possible for an alkane.

Wait, perhaps the product has fewer rings and double bonds.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction converts the aldehyde into CH2I, and the cyclohexene's double bond is also opened by adding HI, so the ring becomes a cyclohexane. The vinyl group's double bond is also opened by adding HI, becoming CH2CH2I.

So the product would be:

- CH2I (formyl)
- CH2CH2I (vinyl)
- Cyclohexane (ring)
- COOH (still present)

So, the product would have:

DoU from cyclohexane: 1 (ring)
DoU from COOH: 1 (carbonyl)
Others: 0
Total: 2.

But again, the options don't have 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me read the question again.

The product is formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Wait, another important point: the reaction is with excess HI. So, perhaps all possible sites are being iodinated.

Wait, in the presence of excess HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the reaction is the complete addition of HI to all double bonds and the aldehyde.

So:

1. The aldehyde (CHO) is converted to CH2I.
2. The cyclohexene's double bond adds HI, becoming CH2-I across the ring.
3. The vinyl group's double bond adds HI, becoming CH2-CH2I.

So, in the product:

- Cyclohexane (ring): 1 DoU
- CH2I (formyl): 0
- CH2CH2I (vinyl): 0
- COOH: 1 DoU.

Total DoU: 1 (ring) + 1 (COOH) = 2.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the carboxylic acid is also affected. For example, maybe it's converted into something else. But I'm not sure how.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a complete deoxygenation. So, the aldehyde is converted to CH2I, the vinyl becomes CH2CH2I, the cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane. What about the COOH group?

Red phosphorus and HI might reduce the COOH group to CH2OH, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the COOH group is converted to an acid iodide or something else.

Wait, in the reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI, perhaps it's converted into an acid iodide, like RCOI, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is unaffected.

But if the COOH group is converted into something else, like CH2OH, that would change the DoU.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about iodination than reduction.

Wait, perhaps the product after reaction is a molecule without any double bonds or rings, except the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, maybe the cyclohexane ring remains, but all other double bonds are gone.

So DoU:

- 1 (ring)
- 0 (formyl)
- 0 (vinyl)
- 1 (COOH)

Total DoU: 2.

But again, that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the answer options: A is 1, B is 3, C is 5, D is 0.

Hmm. So perhaps the product has no double bonds or rings, so DoU 0. But that would require all rings and double bonds being opened.

Wait, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond. If that's opened, the ring becomes a cyclohexane (still a ring, with DoU 1).

So, the cyclohexane contributes 1 DoU, COOH 1, others 0 → total 2, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexane ring is also opened. But how? Only if the ring is opened by cleavage, which would require breaking two bonds. Is that possible under these conditions?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a complete hydrogenation, but without a catalyst, that's unlikely.

I'm getting stuck and perhaps need to think differently. Let me think about what the product might look like.

If I imagine that all double bonds are opened by adding HI, then:

- The cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane (ring remains, but double bond gone → DoU 1)
- The vinyl group becomes CH2CH2I (no DoU)
- The formyl becomes CH2I (no DoU)
- COOH remains as is (DoU 1)

Total DoU: 2. Again, not an option.

Another possibility: maybe the reaction doesn't affect the cyclohexene's double bond, only the aldehyde and the vinyl.

So:

- Cyclohexene: DoU 2 (ring and double bond)
- Formyl → CH2I: 0
- Vinyl → CH2CH2I: 0
- COOH: 1 DoU

Total DoU: 3.

Which option B is 3.

But earlier I thought that the reaction would open the cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the cyclohexene's double bond. So:

The formyl and vinyl groups are converted, but the cyclohexene remains.

So:

- Cyclohexene: DoU 2 (ring and double bond)
- Formyl → CH2I: 0
- Vinyl → CH2CH2I: 0
- COOH: 1 DoU

Total: 2 + 1 = 3 → option B.

So the answer would be B)3.

But earlier I thought the reaction would open the cyclohexene, leading to a lower DoU. But perhaps it doesn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the red phosphorus and HI are only adding to the aldehyde and the vinyl group, leaving the cyclohexene's double bond intact.

In that case, the product would have:

- Cyclohexene: DoU 2
- Formyl: 0
- Vinyl: 0
- COOH:1

Total DoU: 3.

Which is option B.

But wait, why would the reaction leave the cyclohexene's double bond untouched? Maybe because the reaction conditions are such that only more reactive double bonds are affected.

The formyl group is more reactive than the cyclohexene's double bond, perhaps. So, the formyl and vinyl groups (more substituted) are opened, but the cyclohexene's double bond remains.

So, the product would have:

- Cyclohexene (DoU 2)
- Formyl → CH2I (0)
- Vinyl → CH2CH2I (0)
- COOH (1 DoU)

Total DoU: 2 + 1 = 3.

So the index is 3, which is option B.

But wait, another thought: if the cyclohexene's double bond is also opened, as I initially thought, the DoU would be 2. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't add HI to the cyclohexene, but only to the formyl and vinyl groups.

So, the cyclohexene's double bond remains, so DoU from that is 2.

Adding that to the COOH's 1 DoU, the total is 3.

So, option B.


The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (degree of unsaturation) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The starting material contains the following functional groups:

1. **Cyclohexene ring**: A six-membered ring with one double bond, contributing 2 degrees of unsaturation (1 for the ring and 1 for the double bond).
2. **Formyl group (CHO)**: A carbonyl group, contributing 1 degree of unsaturation.
3. **Vinyl group (CH₂=CH-)**: A double bond, contributing 1 degree of unsaturation.
4. **Carboxylic acid group (COOH)**: A carbonyl group, contributing 1 degree of unsaturation.

Thus, the starting material has a total of **4 degrees of unsaturation**.

When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI:
- The **formyl group (CHO)** is converted to CH₂I, eliminating its degree of unsaturation.
- The **vinyl group (CH₂=CH-)** reacts with HI, converting the double bond to a single bond, eliminating its degree of unsaturation.
- The **cyclohexene ring's double bond** remains unaffected, retaining its 2 degrees of unsaturation.
- The **carboxylic acid group (COOH)** is not affected by the reaction conditions and retains its degree of unsaturation.

In the product:
- The cyclohexene ring contributes **2 degrees of unsaturation** (1 for the ring and 1 for the double bond).
- The formyl group and vinyl group no longer contribute to the degree of unsaturation.
- The carboxylic acid group contributes **1 degree of unsaturation**.

Thus, the total degrees of unsaturation in the product are **3**.

Critical analysis of the options:
- **A) 1**: Incorrect, as the product retains the cyclohexene ring and carboxylic acid group, which contribute to unsaturation.
- **B) 3**: Correct, as calculated above.
- **C) 5**: Incorrect, as the reaction reduces the degrees of unsaturation.
- **D) 0**: Incorrect, as the product still contains unsaturated groups.

Answer: B
