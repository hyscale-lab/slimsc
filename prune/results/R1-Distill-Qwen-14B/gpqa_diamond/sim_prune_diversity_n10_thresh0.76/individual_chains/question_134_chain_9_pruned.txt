Okay, so I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. But wait, this is the first time I'm seeing three solutions being mixed, not just two. So I need to think about how all these reactants interact.

Let me list out the solutions:

- 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it should dissociate completely.
- 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4. H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, which is a strong acid as well. I think the first dissociation is complete, but maybe the second isn't. But since it's a strong acid, maybe it's considered fully dissociated for this purpose. Or wait, H2SO4 is diprotic, but in solution, the first H+ ionizes completely. The second might not, but probably for neutralization, we consider both H+ ions.
But wait, wait. For enthalpy of neutralization, each H+ from the acid reacts with OH- from the base. So I need to consider the total moles of H+ and OH- from all solutions.

Then, the third solution is 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it should dissociate completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH^- ions. So for each mole of Ba(OH)2, two moles of OH- are produced.

So first, I'll calculate the moles of H+ and OH- from each solution.

Starting with HCl:

Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L. Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is H+ and Cl- ions, so 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4: 0.3 M, 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each molecule of H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions, so total H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2. 0.5 M, 200 mL = 0.2 L. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait! The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O. So the limiting reagent will be whichever is in lesser amount: H+ or OH-.

So H+ is 0.28, OH
