Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and understand what it's asking. 

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. The question gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and I need to find out by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. Also, all have the same albedo (0.3, like Earth).

Hmm, equilibrium temperature. I remember that for planets, the equilibrium temperature depends on their distance from the star and their albedo. The formula is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - a) / ( (1 + e)^(1/2) ) ) ) * ( ( R_star ) / (2D) )^(1/2), but wait, maybe that's getting too detailed. Alternatively, a simpler version when orbits are circular (so e=0) and albedo is same. Then it's T = T_eff * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) * (1 - a)^(1/4). But perhaps for this problem, since albedos are the same and assuming circular orbits, the temperature ratio is based on the distance ratio.

Wait, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star. So T ~ 1/sqrt(D). Because the flux from the star decreases with 1/D², and equilibrium temperature is determined by energy balance, so T^4 ∝ flux, so T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). Alternatively, T is proportional to (L/(16πσ D²))^(1/4) → (1/D²)^(1/4) → 1/D^(1/2). So T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So if Planet1 and Planet2 have T ratio 1.4, that would relate to their distances.

Wait, the question says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. But since T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D), the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Because T1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D1)), and similarly for
