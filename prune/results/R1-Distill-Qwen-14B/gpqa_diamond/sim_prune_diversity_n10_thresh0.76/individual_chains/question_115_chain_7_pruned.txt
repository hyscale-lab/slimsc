Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate, producing two photons. The energies of both photons are the same, and their directions are one upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is, what is the angle between the directions of the photons?

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to recall some physics concepts here. This is about particle annihilation, specifically electron-positron annihilation. When an electron and a positron collide, they can annihilate each other and produce photons. Since they're matter and antimatter, they have equal and opposite charges, but in this case, their motion is along the same line but opposite directions.

Wait, Lorentz factor is given for each. The Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time, length, and mass dilate for an object moving at relativistic speeds. So for the electron, gamma_e is 4, and for the positron, gamma_p is 2.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think. The electron is moving to the right (since it's coming from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (since it's coming from the right). So their velocities are in opposite directions. But when they annihilate, they produce two photons moving in opposite directions, but in this case, both are going to the right? Because one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So their directions are both in the right half-plane but symmetric above and below the horizontal axis.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right. But that seems a bit odd because when a particle and antiparticle annihilate, the total momentum must be conserved. So the initial momentum is the sum of the electron and positron's momenta. Then, the photons must carry away momentum such that their vector sum equals the initial total momentum.

So I need to compute the initial total momentum, then figure out the directions and energies of the photons based on that.

But wait, wait. Let me think about the initial setup
