Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully and then break it down.

The problem says that compound X, with the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I have to identify which option (A-D) is the correct starting material, Compound X.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides through the Prilezhaev epoxidation. So, this reaction is likely an epoxidation of an alkene to form an epoxide.

Wait, right. Prilezhaev oxidation uses a peracid, but wait, no, maybe that's another reaction. Oh, wait, 1,4-diazabicyclooctane is actually used in the Sharpless epoxidation, but wait no, Sharpless uses a different reagent. Alternatively, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is part of the Jones oxidation conditions? No, Jones is for oxidizing alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids. Wait, perhaps it's involved in epoxidation. Oh yeah, wait, that's the epoxidation of alkenes. So, when an alkene reacts with an oxidizing agent like a peracid, it forms an epoxide. But the reagent here is 1,4-diazabicyclooctane. Oh wait, that's actually a base, perhaps used in some other type of reaction?

Wait, maybe it's a base used in an elimination reaction. Alternatively, another thought: the reaction could be a ring-opening of an epoxide. Or perhaps it's the formation of an epoxide from a diene or something else.

Wait, the product's NMR data is given. Let me look at that. The 1H NMR has several signals: 2.28 (3H, s), another at 2.31 (3H, s) as singlets. Then some aromatic signals: 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H). The 13C NMR shows signals around 21 and 28, which might be methyl groups, then a bunch of carbons in the aromatic region, and a carbonyl at 197.7. Wait, 197 is a ketone? Or maybe an epoxide, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, perhaps the 197 is something else. Wait, wait, no, an epoxide is an ether, so maybe that's not a carbonyl. Wait, wait, 197 is more in line with a ketone, like around 205 for a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe that's a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the product after reacting with diazabicyclo... If the starting material is an alkene, and the reagent is a peracid-like compound, then the product would be an epoxide. But if the starting material was an epoxide, perhaps the reaction is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide. But 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? So if it's a base, maybe it's deprotonating something, or perhaps it's part of a ring-opening in basic conditions.

Wait, but the product's 13C NMR
