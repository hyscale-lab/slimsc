Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me information from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to figure out the chemical formula among the four options provided.

Starting with the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 wavenumbers usually indicates an -OH group because O-H stretching in alcohols or carboxylic acids is quite broad. But wait, the absorption here is at 3000, which is a bit higher. Oh wait, maybe it's not an -OH. Because I remember that O-H in alcohols is usually around 3300-3500 cm^-1. So a peak at 3000 might be something else. Or maybe it's a C-H stretch from an aromatic ring? Like sp² C-H stretching? Or maybe an -NH stretch, but that's usually even higher, like 3300-3500.

Wait, the FTIR also shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps an conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an aromatic ester or something. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an amide or an aromatic ring's C=C stretching? Hmm, but that's usually around 1600. So another carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the 1650 is an C=C stretch? No, because that's usually lower. Let me think: 1700 is probably a carbonyl. The 1650 could be an conjugated carbonyl, or maybe a carbonyl with some electron-withdrawing groups nearby. Alternatively, maybe it's a C-O stretch, but those are usually lower in wavenumber. Or maybe it's a C=C in an aromatic ring? No, aromatic C=C is around 1450-1600. So maybe it's a carbonyl group, but perhaps in a different environment. Wait, another possibility is that 1700 is a ketone, and the 1650 is perhaps an aromatic ring's C=C. Or maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester where the carbonyl is next to an oxygen.

Then the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like CH2=CH. So the compound has a double bond, probably in a vinyl group, maybe as part of a conjugated system.

Now the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, what gives a mass of 45? Let's think. 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O, but wait, 45 is also the molecular weight for (CH3)2O (dimethyl ether) but that's 45? Wait, no, (CH3)2O is (12*2 + 1*6 +16)= 46. So 45. Let me think: 45 could be CH3COH (methyl alcohol is 32). Wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O^+ or maybe a fragment like CH2=CHOH? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group. Or perhaps it's an ester group fragment. Wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O (dimethyl ether) is 46, so that can't be. So what else adds up to 45?

Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let's compute possible fragments. 45 = 12*(n) +1*(h) +16*(o). Let's see possible combinations.

For example:

- C3H5O: 3*12=36 +5=37 → 36+5 +16=57 (no, that's 57). Wait, maybe I should think of the formula in terms of possible functional groups. Alternatively, perhaps 45 is a common fragment. I remember that in mass spec, the tropylium ion is m/z 91, but that's not helpful here. Another common fragment is the methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, the CH2CH2O group would be 45? Let me compute:

CH2CH2O: molecular formula is C2H5O. So 12*2=24, 5*1=5, 16=16. 24+5+16=45. Oh wait, that's correct! So the fragment could be C2H5O, but wait, that would actually be a CH2CH2O group. But wait, in mass spectrometry, the fragment at m/z 45 is likely a CH2CH2O group, which is the molecular ion of ethyl ether? Or a fragment from a larger molecule.

Wait, but wait, the possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

So how does the molecular formula fit with the fragments?

Hmm, maybe the molecule has an ester group. Because esters have the carbonyl group and an oxygen. Let's think about the functional groups.

The FTIR suggests two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one. Wait, the FTIR shows a peak at 1700 and 1650. So that could be two different carbonyls. For example, maybe an ester (1700) and a conjugated carbonyl like a ketone (1650), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe one carbonyl and another functional group, like an aromatic ring which could absorb around 1650. Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester, which would have a carbonyl around 1700 and another around 1650.

So, maybe the compound has an ester group (since esters have a strong carbonyl around 1700) and another group. Let's think about the possible structures.

Another clue is the NMR showing vinyl hydrogens. So there's a double bond in the structure, probably part of a vinyl group, perhaps in an ester side chain or in a conjugated system.

The possible formulas:

Option A: C6H12O2 → degrees of unsaturation? Let's calculate. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 -H -X +N)/2. Assume no X or N here. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 → (14-12)/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. But the IR has a peak at 1700 (carbonyl), so maybe another double bond. Hmm, so maybe two double bonds or a ring and a double bond. Alternatively, in an ester, the carbonyl is a double bond. So if the molecule has an ester group (which has a carbonyl) and a double bond elsewhere, that would account for two double bonds, making degree of unsaturation 2. Oh wait, for formula C6H12O2, degree of unsaturation is (14-12)/2=1. So that can't account for two double bonds or a ring plus another. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Let me recalculate: Formula is C6H12O2.

Degrees of unsaturation: each degree is one double bond or one ring. The formula is C6H12O2. The general formula for hydrocarbons is CnH2n+2. For each H less than 2n+2, there's a degree of unsaturation. So for C6H12: 2*6 +2 =14. So 14-12=2 → 2/2=1 degree. So 1 degree, which could be a ring or a double bond.

But wait, the compound has a carbonyl (double bond) and a vinyl group (another double bond). That would require two degrees, but the formula only allows for one. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the carbonyl is part of an ester, which has two oxygen atoms, but the count still holds. So the formula C6H12O2 has one degree, which can be a ring and a double bond. For example, a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond somewhere else. Or perhaps an ester with a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a diester or something else.

Wait, let's look at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2 → degrees of unsaturation 1.

Option B: C6H10O → degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be two double bonds, a ring and a double bond, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2 → (14-10)/2=2.

Option D: C6H12O → (14-12)/2=1.

So, considering the FTIR shows two carbonyl peaks, that suggests two carbonyl groups, so two double bonds (assuming each carbonyl is a double bond), which would require two degrees of unsaturation. So the formula must have at least two degrees. That would eliminate options A and D, which have only one. So the possible formulas are either B or C.

Wait, but the FTIR has two strong peaks, 1700 and 1650, which I thought were carbonyls, but maybe one is a carbonyl and another is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 cm^-1 is not a carbonyl. Could it be an aromatic ring? If the molecule is aromatic, then the 1650 might be the C=C stretch. But if it's a conjugated system, like an aromatic ring with substituents, that could cause a shift.

Wait, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests a double bond. So perhaps the molecule has an aromatic ring (which would account for another double bond) and a carbonyl.

Wait, let's think about possible structures. Let's say it's an aromatic ester. For example, methyl benzoate. Structure: benzene ring with an ester group OMe. So the ester carbonyl is at ~1700, and the benzene C=C would be around 1600, but maybe the conjugation could shift it a bit higher. But I'm not sure if that explains the 1650.

Alternatively, maybe it's an α,β-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R. That would have a conjugated carbonyl, so the carbonyl might be around 1700, and the conjugated double bond might absorb around 1650. That could explain both peaks.

In that case, the molecule would have a double bond (from the vinyl group) and another from the conjugated carbonyl. So that would account for two degrees of unsaturation. So the formula needs to have two degrees. Looking back, options B and C have two degrees, so we can narrow it down to those.

Next, the NMR: presence of vinyl hydrogens. So the structure has a double bond, probably in a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-).

The mass spec has a fragment at m/z 45. Earlier, I thought that was a CH2CH2O group. So maybe the molecule has an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ester (R-O-CO-R'). For example, if the ester is something like CH2CH2-O-CO-..., then a fragment could break off the ethyl group as CH2CH2O+, which has a mass of 45.

Wait, but in an ester, the oxygen is in the carbonyl. Let me think. The ester group is O-CO-O. Wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if a fragment breaks off the R-O- group, that could be a CH2CH2O+ ion with m/z 45.

So if the ester has an ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached to the oxygen, then a fragment breaking off the ester oxygen would give a CH2CH2O+ ion, which is 45.

So if the ester is for example ethyl something, then that would create a fragment at 45.

Now, looking at the possible formulas.

Option B: C6H10O. Let's see, if it's an ester with ethyl group, the formula would be something like R-O-CO-R'. Wait, but the molecular formula for the ester would be R-O-CO-R', which combines as (R + R') plus O and CO. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with an ethyl group. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, let me consider option C: C6H10O2. So a six-carbon molecule with two oxygen atoms. If it's an ester, let's say it's something like CH2CH2-O-CO-CH2CH2CH2- no, that's getting too long. Alternatively, perhaps a cyclic ester (lactone). For example, a five-membered lactone would have the formula C5H8O2, but we have C6H10O2, so maybe a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is ethyl something, and the rest of the molecule has four carbons. Let's see: ethyl propionate is CH3CH2COOCH2CH3. Wait, that's four carbons in the acid part and two in the ethyl, so total six carbons. So formula would be C6H12O2. But wait, wait, let me calculate the formula.

Ethyl propanoate: the ester from propanoic acid and ethanol. So the formula would be C3H5O2 (propanoate) + C2H5O (ethyl group) → no, wait, the ester is C3H6O2 (propanoic acid is C3H8O2, but when it esterifies, it loses water, so C3H6O2) and the ethyl group is C2H5O. Wait, no, the ester is formed from the acid (RCOOH) and the alcohol (R'OH), so RCOOR', which would have the formula Cn+1 H2n+2 O2. So for ethyl propionate (propanoic acid + ethanol), the ester would be C3H5O2 (from the acid) plus C2H5O (from the alcohol) minus H2O (since esterification is acid + alcohol → ester + water). So the ester would have (3 + 2) carbons, 3+2+ (from water... wait, perhaps it's easier to count all atoms.

Propanoic acid: C3H6O2. Ethanol: C2H5OH. Ester would be C3H5O2 (from acid) + C2H5O (from alcohol) minus H2O (because H from acid and OH from alcohol combine to make H2O). So the ester would be C3H5O2 + C2H5O - H2O = C5H10O2? Wait, no, propanoic acid is C3H6O2 (CH2CH2COOH), ethanol is C2H5OH. Ester is CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. So formula is C3H5O2 (propanoate) plus C2H5O (ethyl) minus H2O. So the ester would be C3 + C2 = C5, H5 + H5 = H10, O2 + O1 (from ethyl, which is O in ester group is already considered) minus H2O. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's compute it directly. CH2CH2COOCH2CH3 has:

Carbon: 3 (propanoate) + 2 (ethyl) =5? No, wait, I think I'm miscalculating. Wait, the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. So that's 3 carbons in the acid part and 2 in the ethyl, so 3+2+1 (the O connects them?) No, the ester is O-linked. So the ester group is O-CO-O. So the molecule is (CH2CH2COO)(OCH2CH3). So total carbons: 3 (from COO) + 2 (from ethyl) =5. But the question's options are all six carbons. So perhaps the ester is ethyl pentanoate or something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's not an ester but a ketone with a double bond. But considering the IR, the 1700 is a carbonyl, so that's probably ester or ketone or aldehyde. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond elsewhere.

So, perhaps the formula is C6H10O2. Let's see, for option C: C6H10O2.

Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. Which could be two double bonds or a ring and a double bond.

If the structure is an α,β-unsaturated ester, like CH2=CHCOO-R, then the ester has a carbonyl group (1700 cm^-1) and the conjugated double bond (which would absorb around 1650). That fits the IR data. The vinyl hydrogens in the NMR make sense for the CH2=CH part. The ester group would give a fragment with CH2CH2O in the mass spec, giving m/z 45.

So if the ester is ethyl α,β-unsaturated propanoate, what would that look like? Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is methyl acrylate. Acrylic acid is CH2=CHCOOH. Its ester with methanol would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. The formula for that would be C4H6O2. But our options are higher, like C6H10O2.

Wait, perhaps it's an ester with a longer chain. Let's think of ethyl vinyl benzoate or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a cyclic ester with a double bond.

But perhaps I should think about the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45 is likely C2H5O. So the ester group might have an ethyl group attached, which would contribute to that fragment.

So, if the ester is ethyl something, then the formula would have two oxygen atoms because it's an ester (O and COO). Let's take the ethyl ester.

Looking at the molecular formulas of the options:

Option C: C6H10O2. If it's an ethyl ester, the ester part would be O-CO-O. So the rest of the molecule (the acid part) would have 6 - 2 =4 carbons. Wait, no, the ester is from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. So the acid would contribute (n) carbons, and the alcohol (m) carbons. The ester would have (n + m) carbons. So for the ester to be C6, the acid and alcohol carbons add up to 6. For example, if the acid is C4 and the alcohol is C2 (ethyl), the ester would be C6.

Wait, C4H8O2 (butanoic acid) and C2H5OH. The ester would be butyl propanoate? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think: the acid would lose a water molecule when forming the ester. So the formula of the ester would be (CnH2nO2) + (CmH2m+1O) - H2O → which would be Cn+m H2(n + m)+1 O2.

Wait, but let me compute it directly. For example, if the acid is C3H6O2 (propanoic acid) and the alcohol is C2H5OH (ethanol), the ester would be C3H5O2 (from acid, since it loses H2O) + C2H5O (from alcohol, which is C2H5-O-). So the ester is C5H10O2. But our options are only up to C6. So perhaps the acid is C4 and the alcohol is C2. Then the ester would be C6H12O2. Oh wait, option A is C6H12O2. But earlier I thought that the FTIR suggests two carbonyls, which would require two degrees, and option A has only one. Hmm, but perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C). Let me think about the structure. Maybe it's an ester with a double bond. For example, ethyl something with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an aromatic ester with a vinyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. A six-membered lactone would have the formula C5H8O2, but our option is C6H10O2, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the compound has both an ester group and a ketone group. Then the IR would show peaks for both. So two carbonyl groups: one at 1700 (ester) and one at 1650 (ketone). That would fit with two degrees of unsaturation. But wait, that would require two carbonyl groups, which would be possible if the molecule has both an ester and a ketone. But then the molecular formula would have two oxygen atoms (if it's an ester and a ketone). So, for example, something like cyclohexanone with an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester with a substituent that has a carbonyl. But I'm not certain.

Another angle: the mass spec. The fragment at 45 is probably the ethyl group (C2H5O+) as I thought earlier.

So the ester would have an ethyl group. That would mean the formula has at least two oxygen atoms (since it's an ester). So among the options, A and C have two oxygen atoms.

Option A: C6H12O2 → formula. So, let's see, if it's an ester, and the formula is C6H12O2, which would come from, say, pentanoic acid and ethanol. The ester would be C5H11COOCH2CH3? Wait, pentanoic acid is C5H10O2, ethanol is C2H5OH. The ester would be C5H10O2 (from pentanoic acid) + C2H5O (from ethanol) minus H2O. So C5 + C2 = C7? No, that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is formed from butanoic acid and ethanol. Butanoic acid is C4H8O2, ethanol is C2H5OH. The ester would have C4 + C2 = C6, O from butanoic acid (O2) and O from ethanol (O1) minus O from H2O (since in esterification, H from acid and OH from alcohol combine to form H2O). So O in ester is 2 (from the acid) + 1 (from ethanol) - 1 (from H2O) = 2. So the formula would be C6H12O2. That matches option A.

Wait, the ester would be ethyl butyrate: CH2CH2O-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, let me write it correctly. The structure is CH3CH2COOCH2CH3. Wait no, that's ethyl propanoate. Ethyl butyrate would be CH2CH2COO-CH2CH2CH2CH3. So the formula would be C6H12O2. So that's option A.

But earlier, I thought that the IR requires two carbonyl groups (peaks at 1700 and 1650), which would need two degrees of unsaturation, but option A has only one. So that's a problem.

Wait, but maybe the IR isn't showing two carbonyls. Let me re-examine the FTIR data. The FTIR has a very broad peak at 3000 (maybe an -OH?), but that's not certain. Then two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So perhaps the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is something else. What else could 1650 be?

If the compound has an aromatic ring, the C=C stretch is around 1450-1600 cm^-1. So 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl group, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

So in an α,β-unsaturated ester, the carbonyl is around 1700, and the conjugated double bond is around 1650. So that would explain the two peaks. So the ester has a conjugated double bond, which requires another degree of unsaturation.

Wait, but the formula for option A is C6H12O2, which has only one degree of unsaturation. So to have both a carbonyl (ester) and a conjugated double bond, that would require two degrees. So that can't be.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct formula is option C: C6H10O2. Because it has two degrees of unsaturation, which could account for the two double bonds (the carbonyl and the conjugated double bond).

So the structure would be an α,β-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3? But that's getting a bit long. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl ester of acrylic acid. Acrylic acid is CH2=CHCOOH, so the ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. The formula would be C5H8O2. But our option is C6H10O2. So perhaps it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a substituted cinnamic acid ester. But I'm not sure.

Putting it all together:

- FTIR: 3000 (maybe -OH or sp² C-H), 1700 (carbonyl, likely ester), 1650 (conjugated carbonyl or double bond).
- 1H NMR: vinyl hydrogens, so double bond present.
- Mass spec: fragment at 45 → likely CH2CH2O+ (ethyl group), suggesting an ethyl ester.
- The formula needs to have two carbonyls (two double bonds) → two degrees of unsaturation.

So among the options, only option C (C6H10O2) has two degrees of unsaturation. So that would be the correct formula.

Wait, but earlier I thought option C is C6H10O2.

So, the correct answer would be option C: C6H10O2.


To identify the unknown compound, we analyze the provided spectroscopic data and compare it with the given molecular formulas: **C₆H₁₂O**, **C₆H₁₀O**, **C₆H₁₀O₂**, and **C₆H₁₂O₂**.

### Key Observations and Analysis:

1. **FTIR Data**:
   - A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an **-OH group** or possibly sp² C-H stretching.
   - Strong peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of a **carbonyl group** (likely an ester or ketone) and possibly a **conjugated carbonyl** or an aromatic C=C stretch.

2. **¹H NMR Data**:
   - Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** (hydrogens attached to a double bond) suggest the presence of a **double bond** in the structure.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is consistent with a **CH₂CH₂O⁺** ion, indicating the presence of an **ethyl group** attached to an oxygen atom, likely part of an ester.

4. **Degrees of Unsaturation**:
   - The compound must account for the double bond (from the vinyl group) and the carbonyl group (from the ester). This requires **two degrees of unsaturation**.

### Evaluation of Options:

- **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**  
  Degrees of unsaturation = 1.  
  This formula allows for only one double bond or ring, which is insufficient to explain the two carbonyl peaks observed in the FTIR spectrum.  
  **Eliminated.**

- **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**  
  Degrees of unsaturation = 2.  
  While this formula accounts for two degrees of unsaturation, it only has one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with the presence of an ester group (which requires two oxygen atoms).  
  **Eliminated.**

- **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**  
  Degrees of unsaturation = 2.  
  This formula satisfies the two degrees of unsaturation required for the carbonyl group and the vinyl double bond. The presence of two oxygen atoms also aligns with the ester functional group. The fragment at **m/z = 45** in the mass spectrum is consistent with an ethyl group attached to oxygen, further supporting this formula.  
  **Selected.**

- **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**  
  Degrees of unsaturation = 1.  
  Similar to Option A, this formula allows for only one degree of unsaturation, which is insufficient to explain the two carbonyl peaks in the FTIR spectrum.  
  **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**, as it accounts for the spectroscopic data, including the two degrees of unsaturation, the presence of an ester group, and the ethyl fragment observed in the mass spectrum.
