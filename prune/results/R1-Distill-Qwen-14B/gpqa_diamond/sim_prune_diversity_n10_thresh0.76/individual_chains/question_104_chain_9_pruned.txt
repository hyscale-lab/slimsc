Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The more massive the planet and the closer it is to the star, the bigger the shift, right?

Wait, the question says that two stars have exactly the same masses, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with masses similar to Neptune. So their masses are the same. The RV method detected both, and the spectral line shifts are given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms for planet 1 and 2 respectively.

The question is about how many times longer the orbital period of planet 2 is compared to planet 1. So I need to find the ratio of their periods, P2/P1.

I remember that the RV shift depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (but since both are detected, maybe they're edge-on or close enough that the shift is the same?), and the orbital period. Or wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by some formula. Let me think. The formula for the semi-amplitude is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(2/3) ) ) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) )

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, I think the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )) ) multiplied by some constant factors. But since the planet masses are similar and the stars are same, and assuming same inclination (since the shifts are given, perhaps we can neglect inclination differences or assume sin i is same for both), then K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M
