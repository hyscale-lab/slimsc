Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that the interplanar distance formula involves the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals are a type of hexagonal system, aren't they? Or wait, no, rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems. Oh right, it's a special case where all edges are equal and all angles are equal. So the lattice parameters a, b, c are all the same, and the angles α, β, γ are all the same too. In this case, each is 30 degrees, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Hmm, wait, interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a, right? Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the edge length. So here, a = 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, but wait, in a rhombohedral structure, maybe the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll proceed with a = 10 A.

The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by 1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - [ (h k)/(a²) (cos α + cos β) ) + (h l)/(a²) (cos α + cos γ) ) + (k l)/(a²) (cos β + cos γ) ) ] / (1 + ... ) wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - hk( cos α ) - hl( cos β ) - kl( cos γ ) ) ) or something like that. Wait, no, that's for a cubic system when angles are 90 degrees. But for a rhombohedral system, it's more complicated.

Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula can be written as 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (h k (cos α) + h l (cos β) + k
