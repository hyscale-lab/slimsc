Alright, so I have this question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where a magnet can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electromagnetism, but let's think this through.

Okay, Maxwell's equations are four in total. I remember they describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and how they're generated by charges and currents. Normally, in our universe, magnets are dipoles—they have both a north and south pole. But in this parallel universe, magnets can have isolated poles, so like a magnet with only a north pole or only a south pole. That must change some of Maxwell's equations because our current equations assume that magnetic monopoles don't exist.

Wait, right! The standard Maxwell's equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: divergence of E equals rho over epsilon_0.
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: divergence of B is zero. Because in our world, there are no isolated magnetic charges—magnetic monopoles don't exist. So the magnetic field lines are always continuous, forming closed loops.
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: the curl of E is minus the time derivative of B.
4. Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition): the curl of B is mu_0 times J plus epsilon_0 mu_0 times the time derivative of E.

So, if in this universe, magnetic monopoles do exist, then Gauss's Law for magnetism would change. Because in our world, divergence B = 0, but if there are isolated magnetic charges, the divergence of B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. So that equation would change.

Wait, but the question is about which equations are different. So normally, the first equation (Gauss's E) and third (Faraday) are about E fields, while the second (Gauss's B) and fourth (Ampère) are about B fields. But if magnetic monopoles exist, the second equation would be different.

But wait, the question isn't just about whether one equation is different. The options are about which specific equations change.

Wait, also, if there are magnetic charges, does that affect other equations? Like Ampère's Law or Faraday's?

Hmm. Let me think. In the standard case, the divergence of B is zero because there's no magnetic charge. If magnetic charges exist, then divergence of B would equal rho_m (some term involving the magnetic charge density). So that's equation two.

But Faraday's Law involves the curl of E. Faraday's Law is about how a changing B induces an E field. If there's a magnetic current, would that affect Faraday's Law? Wait, I think when magnetic monopoles are present, another term would appear in the equation. Or does it?

Alternatively, perhaps the Maxwell equations would have to be modified to include magnetic charge and current terms. Let me try to recall. The original Maxwell equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×B = μ₀( J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )

In the presence of magnetic monopoles, people often add terms to the equations.
