Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. So the question is about three exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I remember that Kepler's laws are involved in orbital periods, but I'm not exactly sure about the details.

The problem states that the equilibrium temperatures ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. Wait, equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were a perfect blackbody, right? The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.5, where R is the star's radius, a is the planet's orbital distance, and albedo is the reflectivity.

All three planets have the same albedo, which is 0.3. So the albedo part will cancel out when taking the ratio, I think. So the temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4:1. So, T1/T2 = 1.4. Let me write that down.

T1 = 1.4 * T2.

Using the equilibrium temperature formula, that would relate to their distances. Let's see, T is proportional to (R/(2a))^0.5. So T1/T2 = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a1). Wait, because when you take the ratio, the R and 2 will cancel. So, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). So,

1.4 = sqrt(a2 / a1)
Squaring both sides, 1.96 = a2/a1 → a2 = 1.96 * a1.

So Planet2 is about 1.96 times farther from the star than Planet1.

Next, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3's equilibrium temperatures is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3. Again, using the same approach.

2.3 = sqrt(a3/a2)
Squaring, 5.29 = a3/a2 → a3 = 5.29 * a2.

Substituting a2 from before: a3 = 5.29 * 1.96 * a1. Let me calculate that. 5.29 *
