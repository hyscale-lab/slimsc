Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. These particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Right now, on average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls. But the question is asking, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls instead?

Hmm, okay, so I'm trying to find the required gamma (gamma) value. Let me think about what I remember about particle decay and detectors.

I recall that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. The proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. So the lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma multiplied by tau.

The particles are produced at the center of the detector and move outward. The distance they need to travel to reach the inner wall is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters.

So for a particle to reach the detector wall, the time it takes (from the lab frame) multiplied by its speed should be equal to the radius. Wait no, more accurately, the proper lifetime (tau) is the time the particle lives in its own frame. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer because of gamma. So the distance the particle travels is speed multiplied by the time it lives in the lab frame. Since they're moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, I can approximate their speed as c, right? Because for ultra-relativistic particles, their speed is very close to c.

So, the distance (d) is equal to the velocity (v) multiplied by the time (t). But the time t is the lifetime in the lab frame, which is gamma * tau. So d = v * gamma * tau.

But wait, for ultra-relativistic particles, v is approximately c. So d ≈ c * gamma * tau.

Alternatively, in the rest frame of the particle, the detector moves towards it at speed v. The time the particle has to live is tau, so the distance the detector travels (which is the same as the radius) is v * tau (from the particle's frame). Wait, but that might not be the right approach. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Time dilation affects the proper time. In the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer, so it can travel further. So the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is L = gamma * v * tau. Since v is close to c, L ≈ gamma * c * tau.

But if the particle's lifetime is too short, it might not reach the detector wall. The fraction of particles that reach the wall depends on the probability that the particle hasn't decayed before traveling the distance to the wall.

The probability P that a particle reaches the wall is given by the exponential decay law. The probability that it hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t/tau_lab), where tau_lab is gamma * tau. But
