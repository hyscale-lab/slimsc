Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five of them. The compounds are labeled A1, A2, A3, A4, A5. The problem gives some properties of these compounds, and I need to find the molecular weight range of A4, choosing from the given options.

Let me break down the information given:

1. **Compound A1**: It's a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The decomposition reaction probably releases F2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Oxidizing implies that A1 is a strong oxidizing agent.

2. **Compound A2**: The oF (I think that's the oxidation state of F) is 31.96%. Wait, oxidation states are usually integers, but 31.96% seems like a decimal. Maybe that's the percentage of fluorine in the compound? Or perhaps it's the oxidation state, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, oF might be the formula or something else. Hmm. Wait, the oF=31,96% probably refers to the mass percentage of fluorine in A2. So, A2 has 31.96% fluorine by mass. Let me compute that.

If A2 is a binary compound with Y and F, and the fluorine content is 31.96%, then the molar mass of A2 can be found if I know the formula. Let's think about possible Y and F compounds.

3. **Compound A3**: It's obtained by fluorinating Y. So, perhaps A3 is YF, or YF3, etc., but more likely a binary compound. It can also interact with xenon, which might mean it's a strong oxidizing agent as well, but maybe not as strong as A1.

4. **Compound A4**: When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, A5 is formed. Then, when A5 is in water, it decomposes into two substances. So, A5 is probably something that breaks down into Y and something else when water is added.

Wait, the reaction with Y (added in 1:1 molar ratio) probably indicates a displacement reaction. For example, in the case of HCl and NaOH, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, if A4 is a salt like YF4, adding Y might reduce F- ions, but that's just a guess.

But let's go back to A1. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So, the decomposition reaction would be something like A1 → A2 + F2. If A1 is a binary compound, then perhaps it's YF4 decomposing into YF3 and F2? Or maybe YF3 decomposing into YF2 and F2?

Wait, but fluorine is F2, a diatomic
