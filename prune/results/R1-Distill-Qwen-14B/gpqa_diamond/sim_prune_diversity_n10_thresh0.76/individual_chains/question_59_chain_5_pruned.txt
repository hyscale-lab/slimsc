Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, with various pH values. Hmm, I remember that when mixing acids and bases, the H+ and OH- ions will react, so I probably need to calculate the net concentration of H+ or OH- after mixing.

First, I think I should find out how much of each acid and base is present in terms of moles. Moles are calculated by Molarity multiplied by Volume in liters, right?

Let me jot down each step.

1. Calculate moles for each solution.
   - CH3COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid. Its moles would be M * V. So 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.
   - HCl is a strong acid. Moles = 0.2 M * 0.4 L. Let me compute that: 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.
   - Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Wait, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH⁻ ions. So each mole gives two moles of OH⁻. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But since each gives 2 OH⁻, it's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles OH⁻.

Wait, but when I mix them all together, the H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base. So I need to find the total H+ and total OH- and see which is in excess.

Total H+ comes from HCl (since it's a strong acid and dissociates completely) and CH3COOH (but wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. Hmm, this complicates things. So I can't just add the H+ from CH3COOH like I would for a strong acid. So maybe I should consider the HCl's H+ first, then see what's left after reacting with the OH- from Ba(OH)2. Then, if there's any H+ left, the acetic acid would contribute a little more, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the base is in excess, so the solution will be basic.

Wait, let me outline the steps clearly.

Step 1: Calculate moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, and moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid. So in solution, it doesn't completely dissociate, so the H+ it contributes is less than 0.0
