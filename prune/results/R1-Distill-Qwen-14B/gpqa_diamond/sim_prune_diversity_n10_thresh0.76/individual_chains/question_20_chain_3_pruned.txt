Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations. Hmm, I remember that the impulse approximation is used when considering interactions in a nucleus, like electroweak interactions. The key idea is that each nucleon behaves almost like a free particle. So the question is asking which combination of the four given assumptions leads to this approximation.

Let me read the options again. The question lists four assumptions (1 to 4) and asks which three together imply the impulse approximation.

Option 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. So this means the force or interaction doesn't involve multiple nucleons at the same time. It's like each nucleon is treated separately. That makes sense because in the impulse approximation, each is considered free, so the interaction is one-on-one.

Option 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. "Transparent" probably means that other nucleons don't interfere. So when a nucleon interacts, the others don't contribute; the interaction is like the nucleon is free. So the nucleus as a whole doesn't affect the interaction beyond the single nucleon involved. That fits with the idea of treating each as free.

Option 3: The quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Wait, quarks are usually relativistic in nuclei? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. But if quarks are non-relativistic, maybe it simplifies the treatment. But does that tie into the impulse approximation? The impulse approximation is more about the interaction with the whole nucleon rather than the internal structure. So I'm not sure if this is directly related or necessary for the approximation. Maybe it's a distractor.

Option 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh right, because binding forces are what hold the nucleons together. If the nucleon feels no binding, it's like it's free. So that makes sense as part of the impulse approximation.

So, putting it together. The impulse approximation assumes that each nucleon acts freely, so the interaction is only with individual nucleons (1), the nucleus is transparent except for the one being hit (2), and the nucleon isn't bound (4). So the necessary assumptions are 1,2,4. Wait, but what about option 3? I'm not sure why that's given as an option.

Looking at the options, the correct combination would
