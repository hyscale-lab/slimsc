Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question in front of me. It's about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think this through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is 1/2 times (|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state rather than a pure state. So, first, I need to analyze what this particular density matrix represents.

Wait, let's break it down. The expression is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Each term like |0><0| is a projection operator. So, adding |0><0| and |1><1| would give a matrix that has 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. Because each |i><i| is a diagonal matrix with 1 in the i-th position. So adding those two gives:

|0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]
|1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]
Adding them: [[1,0],[0,1]]
Then multiply by 1/2: so the density matrix ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]

Wait, that makes sense. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. I remember that for a qubit, the density matrix can be represented in a Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector r describes the state, where the components of r correspond to the expectation values along the Pauli matrices.

The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit can be written as:
ρ = (I + r·σ)/2
where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector (a 3D vector). The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz.

So, if I expand that, the diagonal elements of ρ will be (1 + r_z)/2 and (1 - r_z)/2. Let me write that out.

Wait, for a 2x2 density matrix, the general form when expressed in terms of the Bloch vector is:
ρ = [[ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],
      [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

So, looking at the given ρ, which is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]], I can compare it to the general form.

Comparing diagonal elements:
(1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.
(1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5 → same result, r
