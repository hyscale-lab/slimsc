Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model extension and calculating the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson through radiative corrections. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given has several terms. Let me parse it first. There's a kinetic term for the singlet fermions NR, a kinetic term for the scalar field phi, a gauge kinetic term for the scalar S, and then some interaction terms. The terms involve y_i and g_iα, and a potential V which depends on phi, S, and H. Oh wait, wait—H isn't mentioned in the field content, but the potential includes it. Maybe H is another scalar field, perhaps a doublet like the Higgs in the Standard Model?

The fields are given as singlets (NR) and a scalar doublet (S). Phi is another singlet. The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) are given for phi: ⟨phi⟩² = x² + v², where ⟨phi⟩ is x and ⟨h⟩ is v. So phi must have a VEV that's a combination of x and v. Wait, but maybe h is another field? Or maybe phi and S get VEVs?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The phi field has a VEV of x, and another field h has VEV v? Or is the phi field itself splitting into components, with one component getting a VEV of x, and another part linked to h with VEV v? Or perhaps phi is a complex scalar, so its VEV is x, and another field h has VEV v. Hmm, the notation can be tricky.

The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons arise when a symmetry is spontaneously broken but not completely. In the Standard Model, the Higgs mechanism, the Higgs field breaks the electroweak symmetry, and the Goldstone bosons are eaten by the W and Z bosons. But in this case, there's an extended model with more scalars, so perhaps there are multiple Higgs fields.

In the Standard Model, the Higgs
