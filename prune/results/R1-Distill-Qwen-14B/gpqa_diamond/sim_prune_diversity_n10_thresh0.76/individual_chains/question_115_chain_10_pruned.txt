Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Okay, so the setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy. One is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm. Right, so when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they typically produce photons. Since they're moving towards each other, their combined momentum must be considered. Also, the problem states that both photons have the same energy. Interesting.

Wait, conservation laws must apply here. Both energy and momentum should be conserved. So I'll probably need to calculate the total energy and momentum of the system before the collision, then see how the photons' momenta and energies relate to that.

First, let's think about the electron and positron. The electron is moving from left to right (since it's moving along the horizontal axis from the left), and the positron is moving from right to left. So their directions are opposite.

The Lorentz factor is given for each. Lorentz factor gamma is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But for calculations, maybe I can use the relativistic energy and momentum expressions.

The rest mass of an electron (and positron, since they're the same mass) is m_e = 9.109e-31 kg. So each has rest mass energy of m_e c², but their kinetic energies plus rest energy contribute to their total energy.

Wait, the total energy of each particle is gamma * m_e c². The momentum is gamma * m_e * v. Alternatively, since gamma = energy/(m_e c²), and v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²), but perhaps a better way is to use the relation between momentum and energy for each particle.

For a relativistic particle, the energy E is related to momentum p by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So for each particle, I can compute their energies and momenta.

Let me compute each particle's energy and momentum.
