Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, right, eigenvalues are crucial because they tell us the possible energy levels the system can have.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So σ has components which are the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz. And n is a unit vector, so it's a direction in space. So the dot product would be summing over the components, like σx * nx + σy * ny + σz * nz. But since n is a unit vector, nx² + ny² + nz² = 1.

I remember that Pauli matrices have some properties. Each Pauli matrix is Hermitian, which makes sense because the Hamiltonian should be Hermitian to have real eigenvalues. Also, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues of ±1. But wait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, so the eigenvalues for each should be ±1. But how does that apply when you take a linear combination like σ · n?

So, I think the operator H is proportional to the spin operator along the n direction. For a spin-½ particle, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. Oh right, because S = (ħ/2) σ. So if H is ε σ · n, that would be 2ε times the spin operator along n. So H = 2ε S · n̂.

Wait, but wait, S · n̂ has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 because S has magnitude ħ/2. So when you multiply by 2ε, the eigenvalues would be ± ε ħ. Wait, no, let me think again.

Alternatively, looking at H as a 2x2 matrix: since σ · n is a dot product, it's a sum like nx σx + ny σy + nz σz. Each σ matrix has trace zero and determinant -1. But what are the eigenvalues of such a matrix?

I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are ±1. But when you have a linear combination of Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues depend on the coefficients. Oh wait, but for any unit vector n, the matrix σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. Because,
