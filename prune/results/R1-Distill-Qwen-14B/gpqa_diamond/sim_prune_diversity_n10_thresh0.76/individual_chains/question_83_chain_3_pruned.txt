Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says we diluted 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrated this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We're supposed to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, okay, let's break it down. When we dilute the acetic acid with water, the concentration changes. So initially, the acetic acid concentration is 0.05 M. We have 20 cm³ of that. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. So the new concentration after dilution would be half, right? Because the volume doubles. So 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M acetic acid. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. Moles = concentration × volume. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH will be 0.001. Since the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / concentration. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Now, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. The solution will be a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate dissociates completely in water to give CH3COO⁻ and Na⁺. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic.

The pH at equivalence can be found using the Kb of acetate. Since Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, but wait. Let me check that again. Oh, wait, no. Because Kw is 1e-14, so Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5. Let me calculate that. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 is approximately (1 /1.85) * 1e-9. 1/1.85 is about 0.5405, so Kb is 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate at equivalence point is the moles of acetate divided by the total solution volume. At equivalence, the volume is 40 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L. So moles of acetate are 0.001, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, to find pH at equivalence, we can treat the acetate solution as a weak base. So the hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]. Let's let x be [OH⁻]. So Kb = x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 ≈ 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. So [OH⁻] is about 1.04e-5. Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but looking at the options, none have pH 9.02 at equivalence. Hmm. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Oh wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in Kb.

Wait, wait, 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is 5.405e-10. That's correct. So Kb is 5.405e-10. So the acetate concentration is 0.02 M.

Wait, maybe I should do the calculation without approximation. Let me set Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10. So x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02 - x). Hmm, but 5.4e-10 is so small that x will be much smaller than 0.02. So the approximation holds.

So pOH is log(1.04e-5) → 4.98. pH is 9.02. But the options don't have 9.02. Let me see the options again.

Looking at the options for equivalence point pH:

Option A) 8.52
B) 6.73
C) 7.00
D) 6.92

Wait, none of these are close to 9.02. So
