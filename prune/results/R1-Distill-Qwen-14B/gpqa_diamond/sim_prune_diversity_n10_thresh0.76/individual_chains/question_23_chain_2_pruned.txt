Okay, let's try to work through this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question involves an organic reaction with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure.

So, the molecule is benzene with an ether substituent. The ether group is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. Breaking that down: the but-3-en-1-yl group is a four-carbon chain with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait no, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH-CH2 but wait, no. Let me think again. The formula for but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, no. Wait, butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH-CH2? No, wait, perhaps I should draw it. But-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, the numbering. The double bond is between C3 and C4, so the substituent is on the first carbon.

Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH-? Wait, but that would require four carbons. Let me number from the end. For but-3-en-1-yl, the chain is four carbons, with the double bond starting at carbon 3. So, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, but that would be four carbons as 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, no, because but-3-en would have the double bond between C3 and C4, which for a four-carbon chain would be the same as buta-1,3-diene, which isn't possible because that's a conjugated diene, but wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2 but that doesn't make sense as a substituent. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the substituent is an oxygen connected to a but-3-en-1-yl group, which is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, but that's a five-carbon chain, but wait, but-3-en-1-yl is four carbons. So the substituent is:

(CH2) group: but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, but-3-en
