Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me break it down step by step.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That means it's something like benzene or another aromatic ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which is an important clue. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) which typically absorbs around 1740 cm^-1. So the compound has an ester functional group somewhere.

Looking at the 1H NMR data, there are six signals. Let me list them out:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons would depend on the substitution pattern. If the substituents are in the para position, the aromatic protons would split into two sets: two equivalent H's on one ortho position and two on the other. But wait, the di-substituted could be para, meta, or ortho. Hmm, but if it's para, the aromatic Hs would have two each as equivalent, so maybe two signals for the two sets of equivalent Hs? Or maybe each substituent is different, leading to more signals. Wait, the compound is di-substituted with two substituents, but each substituent could be the same or different. The problem doesn't specify, so I have to think based on the NMR.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That suggests coupling with adjacent protons. Maybe a trans or cis configuration. Also, the presence of vinyl Hs might be part of an ester group, perhaps as part of a vinyl ester.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. So each CH3 is giving a singlet, but since there are two, they must be in different environments. Or maybe each is a triplet or something else, but the question says two signals, so possibly two different CH3 groups.

No signals for –CH2 groups. So the molecule doesn't have any methylene (CH2) groups.

Let me think about the structure. Since it's a di-substituted aromatic ring with an ester group
