Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem step by step. So the question is about a reaction involving Substance X and some other substances. Let me try to break down the information given.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm, so X is probably a compound that has elements with isotopes. The fact that it's a heavier isotope might mean that one of its elements is something like chlorine, which has a common isotope Cl-35 and Cl-37. Or maybe something else like oxygen or carbon? Wait, but heavier isotopes... maybe sulfur?

Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y. What liquids react violently? Oh, maybe something like water? Or perhaps an acid? Or maybe a base? Wait, but the product is a gas W. Let's think, when a metal reacts with an acid, it releases hydrogen gas. Or maybe when a carbonate reacts with an acid, it releases CO2. But the problem says W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So each molecule of W has equal p and n.

So let's think about possible gases that fit that. For example, He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (if it's He-4). Or maybe something else. Let me see: the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. So if W is a molecule, like H2O? Wait, H2O has 10 neutrons in total (if it's the regular isotope). Wait, no, that's for the whole molecule. Wait, perhaps each molecule's total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons. Let me think.

Wait, let's think of the molecule. Let's say it's H2O. Protons: 2 (from H2) + 8 (from O) = 10. Neutrons: H has 1 each, so 0, plus O-16 has 8. So total neutrons 8. 10 protons vs 8 neutrons. Doesn't match. So that's not it.

Alternatively, CO2: C has 6 protons, O has 8 each. So total protons: 6 + 16 =22. Neutrons: C has 6 (since C-12), each O has 8. So total neutrons: 6 +
