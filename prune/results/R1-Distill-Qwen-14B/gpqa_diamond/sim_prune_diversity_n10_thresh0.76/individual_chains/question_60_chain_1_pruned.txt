Okay, so I have this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll think it through.

The question says there's a civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they have a spacecraft that can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super fast! The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes, from their perspective, to reach Earth. The options are about how old they'll be when they arrive, or if they die before.

Wait, so the key here is that we're considering the astronaut's proper time, right? Because the question asks for the time experienced by the astronaut. So time dilation comes into play here due to special relativity.

First, I remember the formula for time dilation: the proper time (tau) is equal to the coordinate time (t) multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma, but actually wait, no. Proper time is the shortest time measured in the moving frame. Let me think. The formula is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, no, that's not right. Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so tau is t / gamma. Or wait, tau is the time experienced by the traveler, and t is the time in the stationary frame (like Earth's frame). So, when the spaceship is moving at velocity v relative to Earth, the time measured on Earth (t) is longer than the astronaut's proper time (tau).

But wait, the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is a big factor here. I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. So, if the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c, how long does it take from Earth's frame?

Wait, let me get that distance correct. I recall that the distance is roughly 163,000 light-years. So using that, the time from Earth's perspective would be distance divided by speed. So t = (163,000 light-years) / (0.99999987c). Since one light-year is the distance light travels in a year, dividing by c (which is 1 light-year per year) would give time in years.

Calculating that: 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ approximately 163,000 + (163,000 * 0.00000013). Let's compute that: 163,000 * 0.00000013 is about 0.021. So total t ≈ 163,000.021 years from Earth's frame. That's a long time, but wait, the astronaut's lifetime is 150 years! Oh wait, wait, the average lifetime is 150 solar years. So if the trip takes 163,000 years from Earth's perspective, but the astronaut's own clock would measure less because of time dilation.

Wait, but the options don't have anything that big. Wait, the options are about the astronaut's age, which is 22 years old, and the time taken is from their perspective. So the astronaut wouldn't live long enough if the trip takes a million years, but wait, wait, wait. Let me compute the time from their perspective.

Wait, no. The distance from their perspective is different. Because in their frame, they're stationary, and Earth and the cloud are moving towards them at speed v. So the distance is contracted. So the proper distance (in Earth's frame) is L = 163,000 light-years. But from the spaceship's frame, the distance is L' = L * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the time experienced by the astronaut is L' / v.

Wait, that might be a better approach. So let's compute L' first.

L' = L * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute v²/c². v is 0.99999987c, so (v/c) = 0.99999987. Squaring that: (0.99999987)^2 ≈ let's compute that.

Well, 1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 - (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute (0.99999987)^2:

Approximate method: (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is very small. Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*1.3e-7 = 1 - 2.6e-7. So 1 - (v/c)^2 ≈ 2.6e-7.

Wait, wait, actually, v is 0.99999987c, so v/c ≈ 0.99999987. Then (v/c)^2 is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that precisely.

Let me compute 0.99999987^2.

Calculate 0.99999987 * 0.99999987:

= (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2.

≈ 1 - 2.6e-7 + (1.69e-14). Since 1.69e-14 is negligible, we can approximate it as 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - (v/c)^2 ≈ 2.6e-7.

Then sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.6
