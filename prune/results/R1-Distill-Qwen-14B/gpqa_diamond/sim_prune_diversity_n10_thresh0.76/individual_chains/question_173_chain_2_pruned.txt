Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that it's related to quantum mechanics. The question is asking about the minimum uncertainty in the energy of an electron given the uncertainty in its position. Let me think about how to approach this.

The problem states that the electron is moving along the x-direction with a speed v of 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is probably involved here.

Wait, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is on the order of Planck's constant over 2π. But when we're talking about minimum uncertainty, I think we take the lower bound, so Δx * Δp ≈ h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. Or maybe it's h-bar, which is h/(2π). Wait, h-bar is ħ. So the formula is Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2, or sometimes people just use ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2. But for minimum uncertainty, we can take the equality, so Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx).

But wait, the question is about energy uncertainty, ΔE. Oh, right, energy and momentum are related through the kinetic energy. Since the electron is moving at a high speed, maybe we can approximate its kinetic energy using the non-relativistic formula. So, the kinetic energy E = p²/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass of the electron.

But wait, the uncertainty in energy would relate to the uncertainty in momentum. Because ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, which is related to the uncertainty in momentum. So, using the uncertainty principle, I can find Δp and then relate that to ΔE.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate Δp using the uncertainty principle: Δp ≈ ħ / (2Δx)
2. Then, the uncertainty in kinetic energy, ΔE, can be approximated by (Δp)^2/(2m), since E = p²/(2m) and the uncertainty would be the derivative or something. Wait, but that might not be exactly correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of ΔE in terms of the momentum uncertainty. Since E is p²/(2m), then ΔE would be approximately (p Δp)/(m), because the derivative of E with respect to p is p/m. So, ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if E = p²/(2m), then dE/dp = p/m. So, the uncertainty in E would be approximately (p/m) * Δp. So, ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

So, I need to find p first. The momentum p is m*v, where m is the mass of the electron. Let me get the values:

Mass of electron, m = 9.109e-31 kg.

Speed, v = 2e8 m/s.

But wait, wait a second. Wait, 2e8 m/s is 200,
