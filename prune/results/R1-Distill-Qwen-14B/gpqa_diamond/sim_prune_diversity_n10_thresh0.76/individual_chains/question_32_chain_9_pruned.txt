Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the collider when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light, which is pretty fast. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

Wait, the nucleus is called X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh, right, lithium normally has 3 protons. So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons, right? So the nucleus in question is Li-6. So its atomic mass is important here. I remember that the mass number A is 6, so the mass is 6 atomic mass units (u). But wait, wait, no, because the actual mass might be a bit different due to binding energy, but for this calculation, I think we can approximate using the mass number. Or maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I might need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0141 atomic mass units. Let me double-check that. Oh yeah, I think Li-6 has a mass of around 6.0141 u. Okay, so the rest mass m is 6.0141 u. But wait, how do I convert that into kilograms? Because I'll need to use SI units for energy calculations.

1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So 6.0141 u would be 6.0141 multiplied by that number. Let me calculate that. 6 * 1.6605e-27 is about 9.963e-27 kg, and 0.0141 *1.6605e-27 is about 2.338e-29. So adding them together, roughly 9.963e-27 + 2.338e-29 = approximately 9.986e-27 kg. Hmm, maybe I should just write it as m = 6.0141 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Alternatively, I can calculate it more accurately.

But wait, maybe I can just use the mass in atomic mass units in the formula and then convert to energy using the appropriate constants. Oh, right, the energy formula involves relativistic terms. The kinetic energy is related to the gamma factor.

So, the speed is 0.96c. I remember that gamma (γ) is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate gamma for v=0.96c.

v = 0.96c → v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 = 0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.92
