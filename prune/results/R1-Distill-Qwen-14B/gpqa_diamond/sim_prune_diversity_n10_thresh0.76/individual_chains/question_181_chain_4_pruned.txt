Okay, so I just came across this neutrino question, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question is about the Sun's neutrino flux when the pp-III branch suddenly stops. Hmm, I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that fuse protons into helium. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches are different parts of this process. Each branch contributes differently to neutrino production.

Wait, right! The pp-III branch is the main contributor to the high-energy neutrinos, specifically the ¹⁵N part of the cycle, which produces a lot of the 10 MeV neutrinos. So if the pp-III suddenly stops, that would significantly affect the neutrino flux we receive on Earth.

So the question is asking about the ratio of the flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). Before the pp-III stopped, both bands would have contributions from different parts of the pp chain. 

I think the lower energy neutrinos (like in band 1) are mainly from the pp-I branch. The pp-I branch involves the fusion of two protons to deuterium, which emits a positron and a neutrino. These neutrinos are lower in energy, around a few MeV, so 700-800 keV is within that range. 

The higher energy neutrinos (band 2, 800-900 keV) are probably from the pp-III branch. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, maybe around 10-15 MeV? Wait, no, wait. Actually, the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are around 12-14 MeV, I think. Oh, but wait, the bands here are in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. So wait, 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, 800 is 0.8, 900 is 0.9. So the neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range are high for the lower parts of the pp chain, but more so, maybe from the other branches.

Wait a second. Let me think again. The pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, maybe around 0.4 MeV. The pp-II and pp-III produce higher energies. So if pp-III is stopped, then the high-energy neutrinos (like 8-9 MeV?) would drop. But wait, the bands in the question are in the 0.7 to 0.9 MeV range. So maybe the neutrinos in these bands come from different parts.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me recall the main neutrino sources in the Sun. There's the proton-proton chain, which contributes to the solar neutrino flux, and the CNO cycle, but the CNO's neutrinos are higher energy and contribute less to the overall flux because the CNO cycle is less dominant in the Sun compared to other stars.

In the proton-proton chain, the dominant neutrino emission comes from the ¹
