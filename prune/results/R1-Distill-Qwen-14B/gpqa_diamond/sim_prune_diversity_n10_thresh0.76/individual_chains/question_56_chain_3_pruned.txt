Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, first, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. For dipole transitions (which I think is the electric dipole transition), the selection rules are important. I think the main ones are that delta l (the change in angular momentum) should be ±1, and delta m (the change in magnetic quantum number) can be 0, ±1. Oh, right, and also delta n can be any integer, but in practice, for a single photon emission, it would typically be a drop by one energy level, but since this is two transitions, maybe each step changes by one.

Wait, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So the electron goes from n=3 to n=1, which is a drop of two levels. Since each transition is a dipole, each transition probably only changes n by 1. So the two-step process would be 3→2→1.

Now, for each transition, the selection rules apply. Let's think about the first transition from n=3, l=0 (s orbital) to some state. What are the possible l values for n=2? Well, n=2 can have l=0,1. So the first transition must change l by ±1. Since starting from l=0, the next l must be 1.

So the first transition is from |3,0,0> to either |2,1, m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1. Because delta m can be 0, ±1.

Then, the second transition goes from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0. Again, delta l must be ±1, so from l=1 to l=0. So for the second transition, the starting state is |2,1, m1>, and it goes to |1,0, m2>. Here, m2 can be m1, m1±1, but since the final m is 0 (because the final state is |1,0,0>), let's think about that.

So the first transition is |3,0,0> → |2,1, m1>, where m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Then, the second transition is |2,1, m1> → |1,0, m2>. But m2 must be 0. So m2 is 0, so from m1, what values allow m2 to be 0 via delta m of 0, ±1.

Wait, in the second transition, delta m can be 0, ±1. So for the second transition, m2 = m1 + delta m. But m2 has to be 0. So m1 can be 0, 1, or -1. But wait, let's think about each possible m1.

Case 1: m1 = 0. Then delta m can be 0, +1, or -1. So m2 can be 0, +1, or -1. But the final state has m=0, so only delta m=0 would work here. So for m1=0, the second transition must have delta m=0, so m2=0. So that's allowed.

Case 2: m1 = +1. Then delta m could be -1 (so m2=0). So that works.

Case 3: m1 = -1. Then delta m could be +1 (so m2=0). So that also works.

So all possible m1 values (-1,0, +1) can lead to the final m=0 in the second transition. So each possible m1 in the first transition is allowed. So how many possible first transitions are there? The first transition can go to |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1>.

Wait, but when calculating the probability, I think each of these m states might have different transition probabilities. But the problem is about the transition route and the corresponding probability. So the options are for the paths.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0,0. And the probability is 1/3.

Option B: 3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option C: 3,0,0 →2,
