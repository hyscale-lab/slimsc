Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's break it down.

First, the molecular formula: C is 9, H is 11, N is 1, O is 2. The degree of unsaturation can be calculated. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so it's (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees. That could be from a benzene ring (3), a carbonyl group (1), and maybe an amide or an ester (another ring or double bond? Wait, wait, no. Benzene ring is 4n+2, so each ring or double bond is one degree. So 5 could be: benzene ring (3), a carbonyl (1), and another double bond or ring or maybe an amide which has another. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring and two carbonyls. Hmm.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches, maybe from an amide or amine. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is indicative of a carbonyl group, likely an ester (maybe around 1735-1750 for esters), but wait, 1720 is a bit lower, which could be a ketone or maybe an amide. But in the options, looking at the possible structures, I see some esters and amides.

Looking at the NMR data: several peaks.

1H NMR:
- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's an ethyl group as a CH2CH3, typically triplet around 1.2-1.3 ppm.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet. Maybe an NH group? Or something else, perhaps adjacent to an electronegative atom.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, which usually suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. So maybe adjacent to a CH2CH3 group, like OCH2CH3 (ethoxy group) or something similar.
- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): These look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest substitution on a benzene ring. The 7.0 and 8.0 ppm are likely para-substituted because each is a doublet, meaning each H has one neighbor. So like a substituent on a benzene ring with two substituents, maybe in para positions. But wait, the integration is 2H each. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each having two H. Or perhaps a meta substitution, but doublets with 2H each would more likely be para.

Wait, in para substitution, each H has only one adjacent H (the other on the ring). So each would be a doublet. So perhaps the aromatic ring has two substituents in para positions. Or maybe it's a meta substitution but that would give different splitting. Alternatively, substituents adjacent to each other.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic protons are part of a substituted benzene, such as with a substituent in the para positionâ€”like two substituents? Or maybe the substituent is in the para position, making the ring have two sets of protons, each as doublets. Like, if the substituent is in the para position, then the H's adjacent would be next to each other. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.
Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group on the 3 position. So the benzamide is CONH2 attached at position 3. Wait, no, benzamide is the amide, so the structure would be benzene with CONH2 at position 3 and an ethoxy group somewhere else? Or maybe I'm mixing up the numbering. Wait, 3-ethoxybenzamide would have the ethoxy group at position 3, and the amide (CONH2) at position 1? No, wait, benzamide is where the amide is attached to the benzene. So 3-ethoxybenzamide would have the ethoxy group at position 3 relative to the amide group. So amide is at position 1, ethoxy at 3. Then the aromatic protons would be in positions 2 and 4? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 3 and another.

Wait, perhaps I should draw each structure.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.
Formamide would be HCONH- attached to the benzene. So the structure is benzene with an ethoxy group at position 4 (para), and the formamide group (HCONH-) attached at position 4 as well? Or perhaps the formamide is attached at position 4, and the ethoxy at the same position? Wait, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is at position 4, and formamide is attached at position 1. So structure would be benzene with OCH2CH3 at 4 and HCONH2 at position 1. Then the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6, but maybe split into two doublets.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.
Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be benzene with NH2 at position 4 (para), and a propionyl group (CH2CH2COO-) attached. Wait, but propionate as the ester? Or the amide? No, propionate is the acid, but in the compound, it's probably the ester. So perhaps it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate? Wait, no, option D is that. Option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate, so perhaps the structure is benzene with NH2 at 4 and a propionoyl group attached as a carboxylic acid
