Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit overwhelming at first glance. Let me break it down step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions, and I need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. The options are A to D, with numbers 4 to 10. Hmm.

First, let's parse the starting materials and the reactions.

1. The first compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta refers to a norbornene structure. The tert-butoxy group is attached at position 7. So the structure is norbornene with an oxygen substituent connected to a tert-butyl group.

2. Then, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile in such reactions, and the presence of dibromides suggests some kind of substitution. Oh wait, in the presence of a base or a nucleophile, dibromomethyl groups might undergo elimination or substitution. But with two equivalents, maybe it's a di-substitution.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Each of the 5 and 6 positions has a CH2Br2 group. Wait, no, more accurately, each has a CH2Br attached, but with two Br per CH2? Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)â€”so each has two Brs on each methyl. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, no, each position has a methyl group with two bromines. So each is CH2Br2? Or is it CH2Br-CH2Br? No, wait, no. The structure is that each of the 5 and 6 positions on the cyclohexadiene is substituted with a dibromomethyl group. So each is a CH2Br group attached to the ring, but each CH2 has two Br atoms. So the structure is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with at positions 5 and 6, CH2Br2?

Wait, that
