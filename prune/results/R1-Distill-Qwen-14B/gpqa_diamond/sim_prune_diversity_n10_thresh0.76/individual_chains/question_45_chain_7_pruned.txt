Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels depend on the quantum number n. Each particle is a spin-1/2, so their spins can be up or down, but I think that the spin doesn't affect the energy directly because the potential is symmetric. So maybe the spin just allows more particles to occupy the same energy level.

Wait, right, the Pauli exclusion principle says that no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers. But in this case, since we're dealing with a 1D well, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n and the spin. So each energy level can hold two particles with opposite spins. Oh, so each energy level can have a maximum of two particles.

The problem is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state when four particles are placed in the well. So I need to find the first three energy levels (ground, first, second excited) and figure out how the particles fill those levels.

The energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n²) * E, where E is the base unit given, which is pi² ħ²/(2mL²). So E_n = (n²) * (pi² ħ²/(2mL²)) which is exactly the E provided.

So the energy levels are E_1, E_2, E_3, etc. Now, for four particles, how do they fill these levels? Each level can hold two particles (because of spin up and spin down). So let's start filling.

Ground state: The lowest energy is E_1. Since each level holds two particles, the first two particles go into n=1 with opposite spins. So all four particles would fill up to n=2? No, wait, wait. No, wait. Let me think again. The first level, n=1, can have two particles. Then the next level, n=2, can also have two particles. So four particles would fill n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So the ground state would have all four particles in the two lowest energy levels.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited, etc. So the ground state would be the lowest possible total energy, right? So all four particles would fill the lowest available energy levels.

So let's think of the order of filling. Each energy level can take two particles. So:

n=1: E_1 = 1² E = E. Two particles here.

n=2: E_2 = 4E. Two particles.

So four particles would fill n=1 and n=2. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, but wait. For four particles, you can have up to two in each level. So let's list the order. The first two go into n=1 (lowest energy). The next two go into n=2 (next lowest). So the total energy would be 2*E_1 + 2*E_2 = 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8
