Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I think that's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because when I see |0><0| and |1><1|, those are the projectors onto the basis states, and adding them gives the identity matrix, right?

So the identity matrix for a qubit is 2x2, with 1s on the diagonal. Let me write that out. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So ρ becomes (1/2) * I, which would be [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

Now, the question is about the geometrical position. I think this relates to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, any single-qubit state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. For a pure state, it's on the surface, and for a mixed state, it's inside.

The Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is given by r = [x, y, z], where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. So, the general form of a density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Let me expand that. The density matrix ρ is (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2. Comparing this to the given ρ, which is (I)/2, that means the coefficients of σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z are all zero. So x=0, y=0, z=0.

Wait, but wait a minute. If r is (0,0,0), that would correspond to the completely mixed state, right? Because the identity matrix represents the completely mixed state, which is the maximally uncertain state. So yes, the geometric position would be at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Let me look at the options. Option C is (0,0,0), which matches what I found. Option B is (0,0,1), which would be the state |0> if it's a pure state, but this is a mixed state, so it's not on the surface. Option A is (1,1,0), which doesn't seem right. Option D is (1,1,1), which would be a point outside the Bloch sphere, but that's not possible since all points are within or on the sphere.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. Any single-qubit state can be expressed as a Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = [x, y, z] \), where \( x, y, z \) correspond to the coefficients of the Pauli matrices \( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \), respectively. The general form of a density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = [\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z] \). Comparing this to the given \( \rho \), which is \( \frac{I}{2} \), it is clear that the coefficients of \( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \) are all zero. Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to the completely mixed state at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \( \mathbf{r} = (1, 1, 0) \) is incorrect, as it does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **Option B**: \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 1) \) is incorrect, as this would represent a pure state, not a mixed state.
- **Option C**: \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \) is correct, as it matches the maximally mixed state.
- **Option D**: \( \mathbf{r} = (1, 1, 1) \) is incorrect, as it lies outside the Bloch sphere and does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
