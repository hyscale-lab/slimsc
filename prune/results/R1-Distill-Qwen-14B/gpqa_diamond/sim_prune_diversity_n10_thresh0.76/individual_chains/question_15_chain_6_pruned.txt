Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, transits are when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, right? The probability of that happening depends on a few factors, I think. Both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods and host star properties.

So, the question says Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2. That probably means Planet_1 is closer to its star because orbital period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law. Oh right, Kepler's law: the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. But wait, since the host stars have different masses, I need to consider that too.

Host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So, the host stars have different masses but same radii. Hmm, I wonder how that affects the transit probability.

Transit probability... I remember that the probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit compared to the star's size. The formula I think is roughly (R_*/a) * (sqrt(1 - e²)), but since both are circular orbits, e is zero, so it's just (R_*/a). But wait, the actual probability is proportional to (R_*/a)^2, because the area? Or maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, but squared because it's a geometric probability.

Wait, no, wait. The transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit (since we don't know the inclination) is proportional to (R_*/a) * (R_p/a), where R_p is planet radius. Wait, no, R_p isn't given here. Oh, wait, the question says the planets are Earth-like, so perhaps their radii are similar? Or maybe the question is more about the star's radius and the orbital distance.

Wait, the formula for the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the circle where the planet's path can cause a transit. So it's (R_*/a)^2, but multiplied by the impact parameter distribution. Alternatively, I think the probability is given by (R_*/a) * (sqrt( (1 - (R_p/a)^2) )) ), but since R_p is small compared to a,
