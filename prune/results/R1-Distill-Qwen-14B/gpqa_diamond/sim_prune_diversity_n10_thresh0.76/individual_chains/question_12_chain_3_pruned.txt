Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Hmm, let me see. The question is about a pion decaying into a muon and a neutrino. The pion is at rest, so I think that simplifies things a bit because momentum should be conserved.

The reaction given is Pi(+) â†’ mu(+) + nu. Wait, nu is the neutrino, right? So the pion is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. That means the total momentum of the products must also be zero. So their momenta should be equal and opposite each other. Oh, right, because muon and neutrino go in opposite directions.

But wait, neutrinos are tricky. I remember they have very small mass, but in this case, since the pion's mass is much larger, maybe we can approximate the neutrino as having negligible mass. Or perhaps not? Wait, but the question gives rest masses for the pion and muon, but not for the neutrino. Hmm, neutrinos are leptons, but their rest masses are super tiny, like maybe a few meV. So for this problem, maybe we can treat the neutrino as massless, which would simplify things.

So the pion is at rest, so its initial energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The decay products are the muon and the neutrino. The muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, so that's a lot. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so we can ignore it.

So in the center-of-momentum frame (which is the pion's rest frame), the total energy is conserved. The initial energy is the pion's rest energy, 139.6 MeV. The final energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, energy isn't conserved if the neutrino has rest mass, but maybe in this approximation, we can just consider that the neutrino's rest energy is negligible. So the total energy after decay is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy. But since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum times c. Wait, but in units where c=1, energy for massless particles is |p|.

But the pion's energy is all converted into the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino, plus their rest masses. Wait, no. The rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV, which is the sum of the rest masses plus the kinetic energies. Wait, but the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino is nearly massless, so the pion's rest mass must be equal to the sum of the muon and neutrino's rest masses plus their kinetic energies. But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so the rest mass of the pion is about 139.6, which is more than 105.7. So the pion must be dec
