Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this chemistry problem, but I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully. Let's start by understanding what the question is asking.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But more importantly, it's divided into two parts (A and B) which I need to solve. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?

The options for part A are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to figure out which one doesn't exhibit tautomerism.

Hmm, I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond, typically in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydrogens that can move, like in keto-enol tautomerism. So, I should think about each compound.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Wait, no, benzoquinone is actually a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms in alternating positions, making it a diketone. So, it's O=C6H4=O, but in a cyclic structure with two ketone groups opposite each other.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The numbering is 1,3,5, so the ketones are at every other carbon. So, it's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each separated by a CH2 group. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2- or something like that, but in a ring.

Wait, but tautomerism occurs when there are adjacent H's and double bonds. For keto-enol tautomerism, the hydrogen must be alpha to a carbonyl. In benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are on the same ring, but in 1,4 positions perhaps? Wait, no, benzoquinone can be 1,4-diketone (para) or 1,2,4,5 (ortho) but I think the common ones are para. So in para benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are opposite each other on the ring. Each carbonyl
