Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. Oh wait, di-substituted means there are two substituents on the ring. So the ring itself is benzene, which has six carbons, and each substituent would add another. So two substituents would add two more carbons, making 8 in total. That makes sense.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the molecule has both a carbonyl group and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring. Let me think about possible structures.

So, the substituents on the benzene ring could be a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Common substituents with carbonyl groups include ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc. But wait, the ring is di-substituted, so each substituent is in a specific position.

Wait, the ring has 6 carbons, plus two substituents. Let's think about what each substituent would contribute. Let's count carbons:

Benzene has 6 C. Each substituent adds their own carbons. For instance, if one substituent is a carbonyl group like a ketone (like in acetophenone), that substituent is a C=O, so it's just one carbon (the carbonyl C) attached to the ring. Then another substituent could be a halogen, say Cl or Br. But wait, halogens like Cl are substituents with just one atom, so they don't add any carbons.

Wait, but the total carbon count is 8. Benzene has 6, so the substituents add 2 carbons. So each substituent must contribute a certain number of carbons. Let me think.

Wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group with more carbons. For example, if one substituent is an acetyl group (like OAc?), but wait, acetyl is CH3CO-. So that substituent would be two carbons (the CO and the CH3). Alternatively, if the substituent is a formyl group (CHO), that's one carbon.

Wait, but the
