Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, paramagnetic coupling... that's related to the Zeeman effect, right? Because the Zeeman effect deals with the splitting of spectral lines when a magnetic field is applied.

So, the problem states that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. Oh wait, and it's small m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, m is the magnetic quantum number, which can take values from -l to +l in integer steps. But since m is small, maybe l is small too? Like for hydrogen, the different energy levels have different l values. For example, n=1 has l=0, n=2 has l=1, etc. So if m is small, perhaps we're looking at a state with low l, like l=0 or l=1.

The options are about whether the paramagnetic coupling term is much larger, much smaller, or similar to the transition energy ΔE. The transition energy is given with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. I remember that the 0.486 μm wavelength is the Balmer-alpha line, which corresponds to the transition from n=2 to n=1 in hydrogen. So ΔE is the energy difference between these two states.

First, I need to find the numerical value of ΔE. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by the Rydberg formula. The formula is E_n = - (μe^4)/(8ε0²h²) * (1/n²), but perhaps more practically, I can use the relation between energy and wavelength.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Let me compute that.

Given λ = 0.4861 μm = 486.1e-9 meters. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. The speed of light c is 3e8 m/s.

So E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m) 

Let me compute that. Let's calculate numerator first: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = approx 4.087e-18 J.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the exponent. Let me compute that again.

Wait 3e8 times 6.626e-34 is 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then, divided by 486.1e-9 meters is 486.1e-9 = 4.861e-7 meters.

So, 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = let's compute that.

1e-25 / 1e-7 is 1e-18, right? So 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18. 

1.9878 / 4.861 ≈ 0.4088. So 0.4088e-18 J, which is 4.088e-19 J. Wait, no, because 0.4088e-18 is 4.088e-19. Hmm, okay.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to remember that the Balmer-alpha transition energy is about 13.6 eV * (1/1² - 1/2²) = 13.6*(1 - 0.25) = 13.6 * 0.75 = 10.2 eV. Wait, no. Wait, the energy levels are E = -13.6 eV / n². So for n=1, E=-13.6 eV, for n=2, E=-3.4 eV. So ΔE is 10.2 eV.

Wait
