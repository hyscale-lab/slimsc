Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. Hmm. 

Alright, let's start by understanding what's given. The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So, f(r) = 1/r² in magnitude. And the field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. That probably means it's pointing radially outward or inward, depending on the sign, but since it's only the magnitude given, I'll assume it's radial.

Wait, but wait—the problem says the magnitude is 1/r², but the field being a vector, it's along the radial direction. So I should probably express this vector field in terms of the unit radial vector. In spherical coordinates, the unit vector is usually denoted as r̂. So f(r) would be (1/r²) * r̂.

Now, the task is to compute the volume integral of the divergence of f over a sphere of radius R. So mathematically, it's the integral of ∇·f dV over the volume of the sphere.

Hmm. I remember from my vector calculus that the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates can be a bit tricky, but for a field that's purely radial, there's a simpler expression. Let me recall. Oh right, for a vector field A(r) r̂, where A is a function of r only, the divergence is (dA/dr) r̂ + (2 A)/(r) ) multiplied by the unit vectors, but wait, no, actually, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the general formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field F = F_r r̂ + F_θ θ̂ + F_φ φ̂ is (1/(r²)) [d(r² F_r)]/dr + (1/(r sinθ)) [d(F_θ sinθ)/dθ] + (1/(r sinθ)) [∂F_φ/∂φ} ].

But in this problem, the vector field only has a radial component, which is F_r = 1/r², and F_θ = F_φ = 0.

So the divergence simplifies to (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² F_r) + other terms which are zero because F_θ and F_φ are zero.

So plugging in F_r = 1/r².

Let me compute that:

d/dr (r² F_r) = d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) = d/dr (1) = 0.

Wait, so the divergence ∇·f is zero? Because the first term is zero and the other terms are zero because F_θ and F_φ are zero. So the divergence is zero?

But wait, that can't be right. Because if the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin, but the integral over a volume that includes the origin would be a different story.

Wait, wait, maybe I got the expression wrong. Let me double-check the formula for the divergence when the field is purely radial and depends only on r.

Ah, I
