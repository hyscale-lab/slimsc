Okay, so I've got this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is an organic one, and the options are between propenyl and butenyl acetates in cis and trans forms. The NMR data is given, so I need to analyze that.

The 1H NMR peaks are: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), 1.6 ppm (3H, d).

Hmm, I remember that in NMR, each peak corresponds to a set of equivalent protons, and the splitting and integration can tell us about the structure.

Let me break it down. So, the first peak is at 7.0 ppm, which is a singlet? Wait, no, it's a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a pretty large coupling constant, so maybe it's a trans coupling, like in a double bond.

So, in acetates, the ester group is OAc, right? So the structure would be something like R-O-CO-OAc or wait, no, acetates are usually R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, acetate esters are like R-O-CO-OCH3? Or wait, no, acetate is CH3COO- as the ester. So, the structure is something like R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, the ester would have R-O-CO-O-R, but perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Maybe it's R-O-CO-R', but for acetates, the R' is usually methyl, so methyl ester.

Wait, no. The acetate ester would have a structure like R-O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, wait, more accurately, it's R-O-CO-O-R', where R' is from acetic acid. So, the ester group is OAc, which is O-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, wait. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. The ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. The ester group is O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R' is the acyl group. So, for acetic acid, R' is CH3CO-. So, the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? Or wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-R', so if it's methyl acetate, it's CH3O-CO-OCH3? No, no, methyl acetate is CH3COOCH3. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The structure of an ester is R-O-CO-R', where R is the alkoxy group and R' is the acyl group. So, for methyl acetate, R is methyl (CH3O-) and R' is acetyl (COCH3). So, yes, structure is CH3COOCH3.

So, in the given problem, the compound is an acetate, so the structure would be something like CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl acetates, which suggests that the ester is an alkene.

Wait, wait. The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, etc. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH2CH2? No, propenyl is CH2=CH2? No, wait, propenyl groups are CH2=CHCH2-, but as substituents. So, the ester would have an alkene group attached to the oxygen. So, the structure is like OCH2CH2CH2CH2? No, no, the acetate would be R-O-CO-OCH3, but wait, that's not right. Oh wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R' is the acyl group, which for acetic acid is CH3CO-. So the ester is CH3CO-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, so the structure is CH3COO-R, where R is a propenyl or butenyl group. So, R is an allyl group, perhaps. So, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-, and butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- or similar.

But the NMR data has a peak at 7.0 ppm, which is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, so probably between two vinyl protons that are trans to each other.

Looking at the NMR data: the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet for 1H. That suggests it's a vinyl proton. So perhaps the structure has a double bond with two protons on adjacent carbons.

Wait, another peak is at 5.5 ppm, which is a doublet of quadruplets or something else. Hmm, perhaps that's another vinyl proton. So, for a propenyl group, maybe there are two doublets.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures.

Option C is Cis-propenyl acetate. So, the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2, but wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-O-? Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but the structure is CH3COOCH2CH=CH2. But wait, the ester is CH3COO-R, where R is the propenyl group.

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, no. Wait, no. Acetate ester is CH3COO-R, where R is the propenyl group. So R is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, but propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the oxygen. So, structure is CH3COO-CH2-CH=CH2. Or is it CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, no, the ester is CH3COO-R, where R is the propenyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, that's incorrect. Let me get
