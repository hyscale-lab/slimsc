Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the right answer is. Let's see what the question is about.

The question gives me a density matrix rho and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are different vectors r in 3D space, like (1,1,0), (0,0,1), etc. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But how does that relate to geometrical positions?

Wait, I think I remember something about the Bloch sphere. Oh right! For a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize all possible states of a qubit. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside or maybe at the center if it's a completely mixed state.

The given density matrix is rho = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me compute that. The |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0 on the diagonal, and |1><1| is diagonal with 0 and 1. Adding them gives a diagonal matrix with [1,1], and then multiplying by 1/2 makes it [0.5, 0.5] on the diagonal. So the off-diagonal terms are zero.

Wait, so rho is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 0.5. I think that's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because for a maximally mixed state, the density matrix has equal probabilities of 0.5 for both states |0> and |1>, and no coherence (off-diagonal terms are zero). So this rho is in the center of the Bloch sphere, right? Because the Bloch sphere's center corresponds to the completely mixed state.

But wait, how does this translate into coordinates on the Bloch sphere? The Bloch vector representation might help. I recall that any single-qubit state can be written as rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space. Oh, yes, this is the standard parametrization.

So, let's write that out. The identity matrix I is 2x2, and the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The vector r has components (x, y, z). So when we have rho as (I + r·σ)/2, expanding that gives the density matrix.

Given rho in the problem is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write that out in terms of the identity and Pauli matrices. 

|0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So when I multiply by 1/2, I get (I)/2.

Wait, that's interesting. So rho equals (I)/2. Let me plug that into the parametrization. (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2 implies that r·σ must be zero. Because (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2 + (r·σ)/2. So setting that equal to rho = I/2, we have (r·σ)/2 = 0. Therefore, r·σ must be zero. 

But what's r·σ? It's xσ_x + yσ_y + zσ_z. For this sum to be zero, each of x, y, z must be zero because the Paul
