Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with a mixture X, which is equimolar and made of two liquids. This mixture X decolorizes bromine water, which I remember means it has some kind of unsaturation—like alkenes or maybe some other groups that can react with bromine.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum under heat, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y. Mixture Y is also equimolar and two liquids, but this time the mixture doesn't decolorize bromine water. So whatever happened in the reaction, the products probably don't have those unsaturated groups anymore. Wait, but mixture Y is formed by disproportionation, which is when one substance splits into two, changing oxidation states. Hmm, so perhaps X is a compound that can undergo such a reaction.

Next, when both mixture X and mixture Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they give only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon, and its mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Also, Z is a part of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. Oh, and Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's probably a saturated compound, maybe an alkane. Wait, but if it's a solvent, perhaps it's something like toluene or something else, but wait, no, because Z doesn't react further with H2, which would be the case for alkanes since they're already saturated.

So let's think about Z first. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let me calculate the molecular formula of Z. Let's say the molecular weight is M. The mass of hydrogen is (number of H atoms × 1) / M = 0.1428. So, 0.1428 is roughly 1/7. So maybe (n * 1)/M = 1/7. So n/M = 1/7. Let's think of a hydrocarbon. Suppose Z is CnH2n or CnH2n+2, depending on whether it's an alkene or alkane.

Wait, but Z is a constituent of mixture Y. And Y comes from the disproportionation of X. Let me think about what X could be. Since X decolorizes bromine water, it probably has double bonds (like alkenes) or maybe some other unsaturated groups. But when X is heated with platinum, it undergoes a reaction that changes the structure.

Wait, but the reaction of X with H2 (if that's what's happening) via platinum? No, wait, the treatment is with Pt when heated. Oh, but in the next step, both X and Y undergo hydrogenation. Wait, the first reaction is X treated with Pt and heated to form Y. So that's a different reaction—maybe a catalytic decomposition or something else.

Wait, let me think about possible compounds that can undergo disproportionation upon heating with Pt. One possibility is when an alkene undergoes some kind of reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is a di-substituted benzene derivative that can undergo some ring-opening or other reaction.

Wait, perhaps X is a diene or something else. Let me think about the hydrogenation step. When X and Y are hydrogenated, they both give Z. So Z must be a hydrogenated version of both X and Y. Hmm.

Let me consider Z's hydrogen percentage. 14.28% is approximately 1/7. Let's see. Suppose the molecular weight of Z has 14.28% hydrogen. Let's say Z is C5H12 because that's a common solvent (pentane). Let me check the hydrogen percentage. C5H12's molecular weight is (5*12)+(12*1) = 60 +12=72. Hydrogen is 12/72 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667, which is about 16.67%, not 14.28%. So that's not it.

Another possibility—maybe Z is toluene? No, toluene is C7H8. Let's calculate: (8)/(92) = approximately 8.7%. No, that's lower than 14.28%.

Wait, maybe Z is something else. Let me think of another approach. Let's suppose Z is C3H8 (propane). The molecular weight is 3*12 +8= 44. Hydrogen is 8/44= 0.1818, which is 18.18%—closer, but not 14.28%.

Hmm, another approach. 14.28% is approximately 1/7. So, maybe
