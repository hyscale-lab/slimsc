Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem states that two compounds, A and B, are treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This results in two different diketones. I need to figure out which starting materials A and B are from the options given.

First, I remember that the reaction involving hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite (NaNO2), and water is typically used in the production of nitrous acid, which is involved in various organic reactions. Wait, but I think when it's used with alcohols, especially secondary alcohols, it can lead to the formation of ketones through what's called the Stephen reduction? Or maybe not exactly that. Oh wait, no—wait, I think when you have a secondary alcohol and treat it with nitrous acid under certain conditions, you can get the formation of a carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's related to the oxidation of alcohols.

Wait, another thought: I remember that when a secondary alcohol is treated with a mixture of hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, it can form a nitroso compound, which upon workup (like with water) might undergo some rearrangement. Alternatively, I'm thinking about the HNO2 conditions for the formation of a ketone from a secondary alcohol. Oh wait, I think this is called the Stephen reduction. Or wait, maybe not. Wait, the Stephen reduction uses a copper catalyst and is for the reduction of ketones to alcohols. Hmm, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the treatment with HCl, NaNO2, and H2O is used in the oxidation of alcohols. For primary alcohols, this usually leads to the formation of nitrous acid and then possibly an N-nitrosation, but maybe not. Alternatively, in the presence of a strongly acidic condition, maybe the alcohol is oxidized to a ketone. Wait, wait a minute—secondary alcohols can be oxidized to ketones, but primary alcohols are oxidized to aldehydes or carboxylic acids, depending on the conditions. But how does NaNO2 and HCl fit into this?

Wait, I think I'm confusing this with the HNO2 conditions used in the diazotization
