Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about electrophilic substitution reactions of bromine with six different aromatic compounds. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield. Hmm.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positionsâ€”either ortho, meta, or para. The directing effect depends on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating and whether it's an ortho/para director or a meta director.

Wait, right. Activating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2, -OH, etc.) donate electrons, making the ring more reactive. They are usually ortho/para directors because they direct the electrophile to positions where the electron density is higher, which are ortho and para to themselves. Deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR, etc.) withdraw electrons, making the ring less reactive. These are meta directors because the ortho and para positions would be too deactivating, so the electrophile tends to attack the meta position relative to the substituent.

So, the para-isomer's yield depends on whether the substituent is a strong ortho/para director or a meta director. Also, steric hindrance could affect the regiochemistry, but I think that's a smaller factor compared to electronic effects in this case.

Let's look at each compound one by one.

1) C6H5-CH3: This is toluene. The methyl group is an activating group (since it's an alkyl group, which donates electrons via the inductive effect). It's an ortho/para director. So, when bromine is added, the para position should be a major product, along with the ortho. But for substitution, since it's a methyl group which is a weak activating group, the ring is activated, but the substituent is small. So the para isomer should have a higher yield compared to meta.

Wait, but when the substituent is activating and ortho/para directing, the para product is usually the major one because steric factors are less of an issue compared to meta. Wait, no, in toluene, para is the major product, but sometimes ortho is also a significant product. But in the case of a bulky group, ortho becomes less favored. But methyl is not that bulky. So for toluene, the bromine substitution tends to occur mainly at the para position. Or wait, no, I think the major product is para, but ortho is also significant. However, for this question, since the substituent is an ortho/para director, the para isomer is possible, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer.

Wait, the question says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Hmm, no, wait, the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed" because it's in excess of bromine, so maybe it's a substitution reaction where each molecule of the aromatic compound forms only one bromine-substituted product. Or perhaps it's a
