Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack what's being asked.

Alright, the problem is about a star's properties when it has spots versus when it doesn't. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so, the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

Hmm. So, the key here is probably the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of different energy levels in a gas in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), which the problem states is the case.

The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Wait, wait, wait. Let me get this right. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So, if E2 is higher than E1, the exponential term decreases as T increases, because T is in the denominator.

In this problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So when the star has spots, the temperature is 5500 K instead of 6000 K. But wait, are the spots affecting the local temperature? Or is the overall photospheric Teff changing, which would affect the average conditions?

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the photosphere as a whole is at a lower Teff. So the star's overall temperature is lower when spots are present.

But how does this affect the energy level populations? Since we're talking about the photosphere, which is in LTE, the temperature we should consider is the local temperature. Wait, but if the star's overall Teff is lower, but the spots themselves are cooler regions. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the star's surface is partially covered by spots. The spots are cooler, so when 40% of the surface is spots, the overall emission (and thus effective temperature) is lower. But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. Are the spots causing a change in the local temperature where those Ti atoms are?

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases, so the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. So the photosphere as a whole is at a lower temperature. So the effective temperature is an average, but for the purposes of LTE, each region is at its own temperature. But perhaps the problem is treating the
