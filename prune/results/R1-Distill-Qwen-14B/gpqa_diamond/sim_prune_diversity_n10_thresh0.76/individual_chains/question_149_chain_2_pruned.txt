Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here about a peptidic compound. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what's going on.

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly right except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Wait, same alpha-proton? So each of these peaks should be integrating to half a proton each, adding up to 1H total. But the integrals are roughly equal, so maybe each is about 0.5H. But wait, the question says together they integrate to 1H. So each is one of two protons that are equivalent in some way, but in the same environment? Hmm.

The peaks have similar chemical shifts, which suggests they're in similar environments. And the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the reason. So it's not like they're coupling to each other or something. So why are there two peaks for the same proton?

Then the LC-MS part: at elevated temperature, two peaks with equal intensity. Same mass spec. So same mass, same everything else. So the same molecular weight, same molecular formula. So it's not a fragment or a different ion.

What are the options?

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a lower mass. But the LC-MS shows same mass, so probably not. Unless the question is about something else, but both peaks have same mass. So A is less likely.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers.
