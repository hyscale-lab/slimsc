Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. Let me try to break it down step by step. The problem involves a series of reactions starting from Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 is propene, right? Because propene has the formula C3H6 (double bond between carbons 1 and 2). Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Oh wait, no, propene is actually C3H6? Wait, no. Wait, ethene is C2H4, propene is C3H6? No, wait, wait. No, propene is C3H6? Wait, no. Wait, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, which is C3H6. Oh right, so yes, A is propene.

So the first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh, that's a classic addition reaction. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) reacting with bromine in CCl4 would undergo addition across the double bond. So compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Or wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would do a dibromide addition. So the product would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Wait, but wait, when bromine adds to a double bond in CCl4, it's an anti addition. So the two bromines add across the double bond. So the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane, but wait, propene is CH₂=CH₂CH3? Wait, structure of propene is CH₂=CHCH3, so adding Br2 would give CH₂Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound B.

Then compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so it's probably an elimination reaction. So when a vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromide) is treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it undergoes dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two molecules of HBr and forming an alkene. Wait, but wait, the structure of B is CH₂Br-CHBr-CH3. So when eliminating two HBr molecules, where would the double bond form? The possible alken
