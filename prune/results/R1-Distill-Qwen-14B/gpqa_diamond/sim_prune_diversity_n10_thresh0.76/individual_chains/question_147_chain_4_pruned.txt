Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem states: Consider the annihilation process where a proton and an antiproton collide to produce two particles of type A⁺ and two of type A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of particle A multiplied by the speed of light squared is 300 MeV. The question is, what is the velocity of particle A?

The options given are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Hmm, since this is an annihilation process, I remember that in such reactions, matter and antimatter particles (like protons and antiprotons) annihilate each other, converting their mass into energy, often in the form of other particles. But here, instead of just energy, they produce two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. So, I need to consider conservation laws here, specifically conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh, that's probably an important clue. If it's moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. So perhaps the initial kinetic energy is small, and the rest mass energy dominates. But I should think about that more carefully.

Let me jot down what I know. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps its speed is low, which might mean that the proton is initially at rest, or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton's momentum is small.

Wait, no, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So the proton might be at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a small velocity, so its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy.

Wait, but in annihilation, both the proton and antiproton are involved. So, perhaps the system's initial momentum is dominated by the antiproton's momentum since the proton is either at rest or moving very slowly as well.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps the proton is stationary, and the antiproton has some small momentum. But I'm not entirely sure
