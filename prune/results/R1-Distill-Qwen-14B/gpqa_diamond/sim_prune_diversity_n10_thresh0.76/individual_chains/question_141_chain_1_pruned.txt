Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit unsure how to approach it, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

First, I need to figure out what the starting material is. 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, wait, that nomenclature is a bit confusing. Wait, benzene rings are usually numbered in a way that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So 1-bromo-2-d something? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylamino benzene? Hmm, I think the 'd' stands for something else. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Or 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? No, wait. Let me think. Oh, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the 'd' is a typo, and it's supposed to be another substituent, like another bromine. Hmm, but the formula is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, maybe it's 2,4-dimethyl-1-bromobenzene. Because sometimes, substituents are indicated with numbers. So,
