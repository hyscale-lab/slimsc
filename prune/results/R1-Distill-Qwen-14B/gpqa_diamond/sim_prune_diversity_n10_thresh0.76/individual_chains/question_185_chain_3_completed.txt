Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of the sigma vector and the n vector. Oh right, sigma is the Pauli spin matrices, and n is an arbitrary unit vector.

Wait, what's the dot product of sigma and n mean? Oh right, the sigma vector is made up of the Pauli matrices sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. So the dot product would be sigma · n = n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z. So the Hamiltonian H is epsilon times that.

I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are plus and minus 1. But wait, the Pauli matrices themselves are 2x2 matrices, and each has eigenvalues ±1. But when you take a linear combination like sigma · n, does that change the eigenvalues?

Wait, the eigenvalues of a matrix aren't just the components; it depends on the combination. But wait, I think there's a property here. The trace of sigma · n would be zero because each Pauli matrix has a trace of zero, and the unit vector's components squared sum to 1, but the trace of each sigma is zero. So the trace of H would be zero.

But I'm looking for eigenvalues. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the general form of the Hamiltonian. H is proportional to a vector in the Bloch sphere direction because sigma · n is a matrix that can be thought of as the spin component in the n direction.

Wait, the eigenvalues of sigma · n. Let's think, for any unit vector n, the matrix sigma · n has eigenvalues ±1, right? Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and any linear combination with coefficients squared summing to 1 (since n is a unit vector) would result in the same eigenvalues. Because, for example, if n is along x, then sigma_x has eigenvalues ±1. If n is along some other direction, the eigenvalues are still ±1. Because the matrix sigma · n is a Hermitian matrix with trace zero, and determinant -1 (since each Pauli matrix has determinant -1. Wait, sigma_x has determinant (i think) (-1), so sigma · n has determinant n_x^2(-1) + n_y^2(-1) + n_z^2(-1) * something? Wait, no, the determinant of a sum isn't the sum of determinants. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, another approach: the eigenvalues of any 2x2 matrix can be found using the characteristic equation. The trace is the sum of eigenvalues, and the determinant is the product.

The trace of H is the trace of epsilon * (n · sigma). Since each sigma matrix is traceless, the sum is zero. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero, meaning they are a and -a.

The determinant of H would be [epsilon^2 (n · sigma)^2 ]? Wait, no, the determinant of a matrix like sigma · n is the determinant of (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z). Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices satisfy (sigma · n)^2 = I, since each sigma_i squared is I, and the cross terms (sigma_i sigma_j for i !=j) would vanish when summed over n_i n_j. So (sigma · n)^2 = (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y +n_z sigma_z)^2.

Expanding that, each sigma_i^2 term gives I, so n_x^2 I + n_y^2 I + n_z^2 I plus the cross terms. But sigma_i sigma_j = i epsilon_ijk sigma_k (for i !=j), so those cross terms would involve sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i = 2 I delta_ij? Wait, no. Wait, sigma_i and sigma_j anti-commute when i !=j. So [sigma_i, sigma_j] = 2i epsilon_ijk sigma_k. So {sigma_i, sigma_j} = sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i = 2 delta_ij I.

So when you square sigma · n, you get sum_i n_i^2 sigma_i^2 + sum_{i !=j} n_i n_j (sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i ). The sum of sigma_i^2 is sum n_i^2 I = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I = I since n is a unit vector.

The cross terms are sum_{i !=j} n_i n_j (sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i ) = sum_{i !=j} n_i n_j (2 delta_ij I )? Wait, no, i and j are different, so delta_ij is zero. Wait, wait. Oh, because for i !=j, sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i = 0? Because sigma_i and sigma_j anti-commute, so sigma_i sigma_j = - sigma_j sigma_i. So sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i = 0.

Wait that's not right. Let me think again. If i !=j, then sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i = 0. Because sigma_i and sigma_j anticommute, so sigma_i sigma_j = - sigma_j sigma_i. So their sum is zero.

So the square of sigma · n is just the sum of n_i^2 sigma_i^2, which is I. So (sigma ·n)^2 = I.

So the eigenvalues of sigma ·n must satisfy λ² =1. So λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues of sigma ·n are ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H = epsilon (sigma ·n) would be ± epsilon.

Wait, but wait, H is epsilon multiplied by sigma ·n. So if sigma ·n has eigenvalues ±1, then H has eigenvalues ± epsilon.

So looking at the options:

Option B) +epsilon, -epsilon.

Option C) has epsilon multiplied by hbar/2, but why would that be?

Wait, I must have made a mistake. Because in the case of spin-1/2 systems, the spin matrices are (sigma/2). So for example, the spin operator S = (sigma/2). So the eigenvalues of S·n would be ± (1/2). But in this question, the Hamiltonian is H = epsilon sigma ·n, so the eigenvalues would be ± epsilon.

Wait, wait, but in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices are actually sigma/2 for spin 1/2 particles. So maybe in this problem, the Hamiltonian has to include a factor of 1/2.

Wait, maybe I got that mixed up. Let me think again. Suppose the Hamiltonian is H = epsilon (sigma ·n), then when we compute the eigenvalues, it's plus and minus epsilon. So the answer should be option B.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes Pauli matrices are scaled with factors. Wait, no, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1, so when multiplied by any scalar, the eigenvalues are multiplied by that scalar.

So, yes, the eigenvalues of H are ±epsilon, which is option B.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. To find the eigenvalues of \(H\), we analyze the structure of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\).

The dot product \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices:  
\[
\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z,
\]  
where \(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1\) since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector. Each Pauli matrix (\(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), \(\sigma_z\)) is Hermitian and has eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). For any unit vector \(\vec{n}\), the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are also \(\pm 1\), as the linear combination preserves the eigenvalue structure due to the orthogonality and normalization of \(\vec{n}\).

The Hamiltonian \(H = \varepsilon (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})\) scales the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) by \(\varepsilon\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \(+1, -1\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\).  
- **Option B**: \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) is correct, as derived above.  
- **Option C**: \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are not scaled by \(\hbar/2\) in this context.  
- **Option D**: \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) is incorrect because it does not involve \(\varepsilon\).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(\pm \varepsilon\). 

Answer: B
