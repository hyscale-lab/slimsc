Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The main thing the question is about is the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels—specifically, how this ratio changes when there are spots versus when there aren't.

So, the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. Wait, the problem says "the ratio decreases when the star has spots." So when the star has spots, this ratio is lower than when it doesn't. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots) would give us the factor.

I remember that in stellar atmospheres under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, so if the star's temperature changes, this ratio will change. But wait, the star's temperature isn't uniform. When there are spots, part of the surface is cooler than the rest. So, does the overall photospheric temperature drop, and how does that affect the calculation?

Wait, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the star's effective temperature is lower. But wait, the effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity, right? The effective temperature is the temperature of a black body that would emit the same amount of radiation as the star. So when spots cover part of the surface,
