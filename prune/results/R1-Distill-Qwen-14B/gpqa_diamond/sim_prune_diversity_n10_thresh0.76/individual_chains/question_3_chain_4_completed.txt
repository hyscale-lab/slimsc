Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking. 

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, which is the Pauli z matrix. The question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. 

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is found by taking the conjugate transpose of the state, multiplying the operator, and then the state again. So, for an operator O, it's ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. 

Wait, but this operator is a combination of σz and σx. Maybe I can break it down into parts. Since expectation is linear, the expectation of 10σz +5σx would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes it easier.

First, I should find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, that might be straightforward. Let me write down the state ψ.

ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. 

Wait, actually, wait a second—spin-up and spin-down are eigenstates of σz with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. So when I compute ⟨σz⟩, it should be the sum of the probabilities times their respective eigenvalues.

The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me compute the modulus squared of each to get the probabilities. 

The first term: (0.5)^2 = 0.25. Second term: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So the total is 1, which is good because probabilities should sum to 1.

So for σz, the expectation value is (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. 

Wait, that's ⟨σz⟩. So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, I need to find ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are different, I think. Oh wait, but maybe I can express σx in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

The Pauli matrices: σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when applied to |↑⟩, it gives |↓⟩, and to |↓⟩, gives |↑⟩. But how does that help me compute ⟨σx⟩?

Alternatively, maybe I can express σx in terms of the basis states and compute the expectation value.

The expectation value of σx is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let me compute that.

So ψ is a column vector. Let me write it as a vector. Assuming |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1], then ψ is:

ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Wait, no. Wait, because in the standard basis, |↑⟩ is the first basis vector, so 0.5|↑⟩ is 0.5 in the first component. Similarly, sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 in the second component. So ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Then, σx is the matrix:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

So σx |ψ⟩ would be [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ]^T, because σx swaps the components.

So ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is ψ† σx ψ. So let me compute this.

Alternatively, another approach: σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|. So when I compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩, it's ⟨↑| (0.5) + ⟨↓| (sqrt(3)/2) multiplied by σx acting on |ψ⟩.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute it directly. Let's compute ψ† σx ψ.

ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

Multiply by σx, which is [[0,1],[1,0]], so the product becomes:

[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ]

Then multiply by ψ, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]:

So [sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 ] + [0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ] = (sqrt(3)/2 *0.5) + (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 )

Wait, wait, that's because when you multiply a row vector by a column vector, you take the dot product. So the first component is sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5, and the second is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2. So both terms are the same.

So each term is (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = sqrt(3)/4. Two terms: sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, σx is a Hermitian operator, so its expectation should be real. Let me compute the matrix product step by step.

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ψ is [a, b]^T = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So σx ψ = [b, a]^T = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then ψ† σx ψ is a row vector [a*, b*] multiplied by σx ψ, which is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ].

So the product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).

Wait, 0.5 is a real number, so a* is 0.5, same as a. Similarly for b*. So:

0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.4330.

sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = same as above, another sqrt(3)/4.

So sum is sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866.

So now, putting it all together. The operator is 10σz +5σx. The expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

We have ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5, and ⟨σx⟩ ≈ 0.866.

So 10*(-0.5) = -5. 5*(0.866) ≈ 4.33.

Adding those together: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, so the expectation value is approximately -0.67.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C is -0.7.

But wait, I approximated 0.866 as about 0.866, which is about 0.866. 5 * 0.866 is 4.33, correct. So -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Hmm, but the options are to one decimal place. So -0.67 is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So option C is -0.7.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation for ⟨σx⟩. Maybe I made a mistake there.

Alternative approach: Another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is using the formula for expectation value in terms of the components. Since σx can be written in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as I said, and ψ is a linear combination, perhaps expanding it algebraically would help.

Let me write ψ as a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

Then, σx |ψ⟩ = σx (a|↑⟩ +b|↓⟩ ) = a σx |↑⟩ + b σx |↓⟩.

But σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So σx |ψ⟩ = a |↓⟩ + b |↑⟩.

⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = (a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓|) (a |↓⟩ + b |↑⟩ )

= a a* ⟨↑|↓⟩ + a b* ⟨↑|↑⟩ + b a* ⟨↓|↓⟩ + b b* ⟨↓|↑⟩.

Since ⟨↑|↓⟩ is zero, ⟨↑|↑⟩ is 1, same for ⟨↓|↓⟩.

So this becomes a b* *1 + b a* *1.

So (a b*) + (b a*) = 2 Re(a b*).

So let me compute a and b.

a = 0.5, real number.

b = sqrt(3)/2, also real.

So a b* = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4.

Re(a b*) is same as a b, because a and b are real.

So 2 Re(a b*) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So same result as before. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2.

So the calculation is correct.

So putting it together, expectation of 10σz +5σx is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2.

Compute this numerically.

sqrt(3) is approx 1.732.

So (5 sqrt(3))/2 = (5 *1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 = 4.33.

So 4.33 -5 = -0.67.

Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is -0.7.

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given quantum state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is linear, so we compute it as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The probabilities of the particle being in these states are given by the squared magnitudes of the coefficients in \( \psi \):

\[
P(|\uparrow\rangle) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad P(|\downarrow\rangle) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]

Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator swaps the states \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \). To compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \), we use the formula:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \text{Re}(a b^*),
\]

where \( a \) and \( b \) are the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in \( \psi \), respectively. Here, \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Substituting:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \text{Re}\left(0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \text{Re}\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substituting \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle = -0.5 \) and \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx 0.866 \):

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Round to One Decimal Place
Rounding \( -0.67 \) to one decimal place gives \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to **Option C**.
