Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the probability of an atom decaying after a certain period given that it hasn't decayed in a previous time.

Alright, the setup is that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, in 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it will decay. But now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. The question is asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait, 150 minutes after what? Hmm, probably from the current time, which is 50 minutes after the start. So the total time we're considering is another 150 minutes, making the total time 200 minutes since the start? Or is it 150 minutes from now, which would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes total. Either way, I think the key is to model this using the exponential decay formula.

I remember that the decay probability can be modeled with an exponential function. The formula for the probability of decay is often given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as the number of undecayed nuclei, N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), which is the complement of the decay probability.

Given that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so that P(100) = 0.32. So I can set up the equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let's solve for λ.

Wait, actually, maybe it's better to find the decay constant λ first. So rearranging the equation:

e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -λ *100 = ln(0.68).

So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100. Let me compute that. The natural log of 0.68 is approximately, let me think. ln(0.
