Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, the denominator looks like 4 - (x² + y²), so maybe we can write it as 4 - r² where r² is x² + y². Hmm, because in polar coordinates, r² would be x² + y², right. So maybe they're using polar coordinates here.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, but wait, the metric is given in terms of x and y. So I'm trying to figure out what kind of geometry this metric represents.

Pseudosphere... that's a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like a saddle shape. But wait, in two dimensions, a pseudosphere is an abstract surface, but in this case, maybe the metric is for a hyperbolic space.

Wait, the metric is written as ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me see: if I factor this, it's 32/(4 − r²) times (dx² + dy²), with r² = x² + y².

Wait, if I set r² equal to x² + y², then the denominator is 4 - r². So the metric would be ds² = [32/(
