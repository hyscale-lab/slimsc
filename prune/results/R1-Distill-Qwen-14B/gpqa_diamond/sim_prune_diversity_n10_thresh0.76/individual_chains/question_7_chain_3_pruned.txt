Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it fills the universe. The problem is about high-energy gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The question is asking at what energy the gamma-rays' lifetimes would be limited by this process.

The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. I think I remember that the CMB has a blackbody spectrum, so most photons are at the peak energy, which is something like a fraction of an eV. But here it's given as 1e-3 eV, so that's about 1 milli-eV.

The process in question is gamma + gamma â†’ e+ + e-. This is a pair production process. I've heard that this process is significant because it can limit the flux of high-energy gamma-rays from distant sources. The idea is that if a gamma-ray travels through the universe, it might interact with CMB photons and convert into electron-positron pairs. If the gamma-ray has a high enough energy, this interaction would happen quickly enough that the gamma-ray doesn't travel very far before it's annihilated, thus limiting its lifetime or the distance it can travel.

So, the problem is asking the threshold energy where this annihilation becomes significant. I think this is related to the so-called pair production threshold. But wait, the threshold condition for pair production via photon-photon collisions depends on the energies of the two photons involved.

I remember that the threshold energy for pair production in photon-photon collisions is such that the combined energy of the two photons must be at least twice the rest mass of the electron (since electron and positron are produced). The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so twice that is about 1.022 MeV. But wait, that's for each photon providing that energy. No, wait, no, because each photon can have much less energy, as long as their combined energy is sufficient.

Wait, no, wait. The center-of-mass energy must be at least 2m_e c^2. The formula for the center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 -
