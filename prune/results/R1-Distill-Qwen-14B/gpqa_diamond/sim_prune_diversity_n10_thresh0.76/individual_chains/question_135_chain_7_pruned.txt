Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to work through it.

The question is about the bosonic field X and its interaction with fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, I'm not sure I got that right. Let me parse it again. Oh, maybe it's written as L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the interaction term involves the fermion fields ψ_f, and the boson X.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are combinations of various fermion-antifermion pairs.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because E=mc², so each fermion would need energy at least equal to its rest mass. So, for each possible fermion pair, check if twice the fermion mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me list the fermion masses. I think the fermions in the Standard Model are:

Leptons:
- electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV

Quarks:
- up (u): ~0.0035 GeV
- down (d): ~0.0047 GeV
- strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
- charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
- bottom (b): ~4.13 GeV
- top (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV

So, for a decay X → f f-bar, 2m_f must be ≤ 6 GeV.

Let's evaluate each option.

Option A: X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but tau is 1.78 GeV. 2m_tau ≈ 3.56 GeV ≤6, so allowed. e is negligible, so allowed. What about the others:

b: 4.13 GeV each. 2*4.13=8.26 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b b-bar because the mass is insufficient. So option A must be wrong because it includes b.

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Check each:

c: 1.27 GeV each. 2*1.27=2.54 ≤6. So allowed.

s: 0.095 GeV. 2*0.095=0.19 <6. Allowed.

u, d: same, allowed.

tau: 2*1.78=3.56 ≤6. Allowed.

mu: 0.105 GeV. 2*0.105=0.21 <6. Allowed.

e: allowed.

So all the fermions in option B are allowed. But wait, what about the X's mass? Could it decay into other particles?

Wait, another thing to consider: the interaction term. The Lagrangian is -λ f f-bar ψ_f (v + X) ψ_f, but I'm not entirely sure how that affects the coupling. Oh, wait, perhaps the coupling is proportional to the Yukawa coupling. The interaction term would be something like λ f f-bar X, right? So for each fermion f, the coupling is present if the Yukawa coupling exists.

But in the Standard Model, each fermion has a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs. So for X to decay into f f-bar, the Yukawa coupling must be non-zero for f, and the mass must be sufficient.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the interaction is given as -λ f f-bar (v + X) ψ_f? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is L = -λ X f f-bar, where f is the fermion. So the decay X→ f f-bar is possible if the coupling exists and the mass condition holds.

Assuming that the coupling is allowed (i.e., Yukawa coupling is non-zero for the fermion in question), then the decay is allowed.

So, considering the mass limits, let's check each option.

So for option B, the possible decays are c c-bar, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Do all these fermions have a non-zero Yukawa coupling with X? Hmm, but wait, in the problem statement, the Lagrangian might only include certain fermions. Let me see: the interaction term is written as -λ f f-bar ψ_f (v + X) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps f is the same as ψ_f, maybe a typo? Alternatively, perhaps the term is something like X ψ_f ψ_f, which would imply a Yukawa coupling for ψ_f.

Wait, perhaps the interaction is X ψ_f ψ_f-bar, so the boson X couples to fermion ψ_f. So for which ferm
