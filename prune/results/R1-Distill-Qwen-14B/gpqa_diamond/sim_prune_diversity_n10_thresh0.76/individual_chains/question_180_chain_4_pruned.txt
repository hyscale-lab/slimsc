Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. It's about calculating the minimum energy of a system with charges. Let me try to break it down and think it through step by step.

So the question says: There are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with electric potential energy in a system of charges, it's all about calculating the potential energy between each pair of charges. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approx 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

Since all the 12 charges are at a fixed distance from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P, I think the setup is that the 13th charge is at the center, and the 12 are arranged in some symmetrical way around it. But wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So the 13th charge is at P, and the others are all 2 meters away from it. So each of the 12 is 2 meters from the central charge.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum energy of the system. So I'm thinking that the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th (central) charge contributes to the total. Also, the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves might matter. But wait, the 12 are arranged symmetrically—like a regular dodecahedron or something. But I'm not sure if their mutual interactions contribute to the energy.

Wait, but wait. The system's total potential energy is the sum of all pairwise potentials. So the total U is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

So let's see. There are 13 charges: one at P, and 12 at 2m from P.

Each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, so each of the 12 has
