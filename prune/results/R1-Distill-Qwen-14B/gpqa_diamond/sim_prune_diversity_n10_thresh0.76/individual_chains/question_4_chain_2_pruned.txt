Okay, so I have this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a hypothetical universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I need to figure out which of Maxwell's equations would be different in such a scenario.

Wait, Maxwell's equations are four in total, right? They describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate and interact. Let me recall what each equation states.

The first equation is Gauss's Law for electricity: it says that the divergence of the electric field is proportional to the charge density. So ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. That equation relates to electric charges and wouldn't be affected by the nature of magnets, I think. So probably not this one.

The second equation is Gauss's Law for magnetism: ∇·B = 0. Oh, right, this is the one that says there are no isolated magnetic monopoles. Because magnetic field lines are continuous, forming closed loops. So in our universe, you can't have a magnet with just a single North or South pole; they come in pairs. But in this parallel universe, magnets can have isolated poles. That must mean that the divergence of B isn't zero anymore. So this equation would change. So the equation ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, maybe? Where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So that's one equation that would definitely be different.

Then there's Faraday's Law of Induction, which is the third equation. It says that the curl of the electric field is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic field: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. I don't think this one would change because it's about how changing magnetic fields induce electric fields, and whether the magnetic field has isolated poles might not affect the way it changes. So this equation might stay the same.

The fourth equation is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. This relates the curl of the magnetic field to the current and the time-varying electric field. Since this equation deals with currents and how they generate magnetic fields, and assuming that the existence of isolated magnetic poles doesn't directly affect this relationship (unless the current includes magnetic current terms), but I'm not sure. Wait, in the standard equations, J is the current, which is made of moving charges. If magnetic monopoles exist, maybe there's a magnetic current as well. But in the given question, it's about the form of Maxwell's equations. So Ampère's Law would have to account for magnetic current density, perhaps. So maybe this equation would change.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In the standard equations, the divergence of B is zero because there are no magnetic monopoles. If there were monopoles, then ∇·B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density.

So which equations change? Let me list the four equations:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ → unchanged because it's about electric charges.
2. ∇·B = 0 → would change to ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, so this equation changes.
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t → probably unchanged, as it's about changing B inducing E.
4. ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t) → perhaps changes if there's a magnetic current.

Wait, but in the scenario where we have magnetic monopoles, do Maxwell's equations introduce terms for magnetic current? I think so. So Ampère's Law would have an additional term for the magnetic current. But Ampère's Law in the standard form is about how the curl of B relates to currents and displacement. So maybe the fourth equation would change.

Wait, no. Ampère's Law is about the curl of B. If the existence of magnetic monopoles doesn't directly affect the curl of B but its divergence. So perhaps the two equations that change are the ones related to the divergence of B and any new terms in the curl equations.

Alternatively, I should think about the full set of modified Maxwell's equations when magnetic monopoles exist.
