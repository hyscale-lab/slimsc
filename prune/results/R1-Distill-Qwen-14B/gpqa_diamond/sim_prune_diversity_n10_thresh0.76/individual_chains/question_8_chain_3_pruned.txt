Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the experiment is about finding genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose in white lupine. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knockout mutants (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The results of their tests with the pathogen are given as percentages of resistance compared to the wild type. 

The data is:
- g1: 75% resistance
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

And the question is about figuring out the interaction among these genes. The options are A to D, each making different claims about which is the transcription factor and how the genes interact.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with epistasis and gene interactions, the resistance levels can give clues about the pathway. Let's think about what each scenario might mean.

First, the wild type is 100% resistant. The knockouts have varying resistances. 

So, for a single mutant:
- g1 is 75%. So, knocking out G1 reduces resistance, but not as much as others. But not completely susceptible.
- g2 is 0% — so when G2 is knocked out, the plant can't resist at all. So G2 must be really important.
- g3 is 50% — knocking out G3 reduces resistance by half.

Now the double mutants:
- g1g3: 10% — that's a big drop. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance plummets. Hmm, maybe they contribute to the same pathway and their functions are additive?
- g2g3: 0% — same as g2 alone. Because when G2 is not present, even if G3 is also not present, the resistance is zero. So perhaps G2 is upstream of G3, or maybe G2 is part of a different pathway that when missing, everything falls apart.
- g1g2: 0% — same as g2. So if both G1 and G2 are knocked out, resistance is zero. So maybe G2 is epistatic over G1, meaning that G2 acts downstream of G1, or vice versa.

Wait, what's epistasis again? Oh right, epistatic genes are those where their mutation masks the phenotype of another gene. So if gene A is epistatic over gene B, the phenotype of a double mutant (A and B knocked out) will look like the single A mutant, not B.

So looking at g2g3: 0%. But g2 alone is 0%, so maybe G3 isn't doing much when G2 is already knocked out. So G2 might be upstream. If G2 is a transcription factor, perhaps it activates G3. So when G2 isn't working, neither is G3, because it's downstream.

Wait, but g3 alone is 50% — so when only G3 is not working, resistance is 50%. So if G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it's regulating G3. So when G2 is knocked out, G3 can't be expressed, making the resistance worse. So in g2, it's 0%, which is worse than g3's 50%.

So if G2 is a transcription factor, that would make sense. Because without G2, G3 can't be expressed, leading to lower resistance.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% — same as g2. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, it's the same as when only G2 is knocked out. So this suggests that G2's function is epistatic over G1. Because the phenotype of G2 knockout is what's observed when both are knocked out. So the presence of a functional G2 masks the effect of G1. So G2 is epistatic towards G1.

What about g1g3? 10% — so worse than g1 alone (75% vs 10%). So knocking out both G1 and G3 makes it much worse than either alone. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is additive. But the presence of either G1 or G3 can provide some resistance. Alternatively, maybe
