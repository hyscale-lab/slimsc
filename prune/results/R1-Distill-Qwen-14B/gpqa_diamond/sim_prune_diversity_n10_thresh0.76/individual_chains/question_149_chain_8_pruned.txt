Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question about a peptidic compound. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly correct except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, so they're not splitting each other because of coupling. The options mention spin-spin coupling, but it's ruled out based on the coupling pattern, so that's not the issue here.

Then looking at the LC-MS results. They show two peaks of equal intensity, same mass spectrum as expected. So the mass is the same, but there are two peaks. That suggests either the same compound with different retention times or something else.

Wait, if it's the same mass, could it be isomers? Enantiomers have the same mass, right. But if it's a mixture of enantiomers, would they show up as two peaks in LC-MS? Because chiral columns can sometimes separate enantiomers, but I'm not sure. Also, the question says the crude compound's NMR is off, so maybe it's a diastereomer situation.

Wait, another thought: the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. I remember that diastereomers can have different NMR signals because their environments are different. Enantiomers, on the other hand, have identical NMR signals because they're mirror images. So if the NMR shows two different peaks, that suggests the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, not enantiomers. Because diastereomers have different physical properties.

So looking at the options: option B is enantiomers. But since the NMR shows two separate peaks, that can't be B. So B is probably not the answer.

Option D is diastereomers. That makes sense because diastereomers would have different NMR shifts and possibly different retention times in LC-MS. But wait, why would the LC-MS have two equal peaks? Because diastereomers have different physical properties, so maybe the separation is due to the column being able to differentiate them. But why same mass? Oh, because diastereomers have the same molecular formula, same molecular weight. So the same mass spec would make sense.

So the NMR shows two separate peaks for the same proton, meaning the molecule has two different environments, which is characteristic of diastereomers. So the crude compound might be a mixture of diastereomers.

Wait another thing: why would the same alpha-proton split into two peaks? Maybe because of different diastereotopic environments. Oh, if the molecule has multiple stereocenters, maybe the alpha proton is in a different environment depending on the configuration of other centers. So when there are diastereomers, the same proton could give different shifts.

So putting it together, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, and the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass but different retention times. That points towards diastereomers, so option D.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C says 'double coupling' during amide bond formation.
