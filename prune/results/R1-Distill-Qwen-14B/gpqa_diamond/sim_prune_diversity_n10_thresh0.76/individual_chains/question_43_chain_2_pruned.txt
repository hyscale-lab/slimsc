Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this IUPAC naming problem. The molecule is a benzene ring with several substituents: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Additionally, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Also, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are ortho to the nitrile group.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the benzene ring and place all the substituents correctly. I'll number the positions starting from the carboxylic acid. Let's say the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Since the substituents are meta to each other, the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are each separated by three positions.

Wait, no. Wait, meta to each other means they are each in positions that are 1,3,5 apart. So the benzene ring would have substituents in positions 1,3,5 for those three groups. But the question says the carboxylic acid, the carbaldehyde, and the cyano group are all meta to one another. So each is positioned so that any two are meta. So for example, if carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the other two substituents (carbaldehyde and cyano) would be at positions 3 and 5. But wait, no, because all three are meta to each other â€“ but that's not possible on a benzene ring because each substituent can only have two meta positions. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding that. Maybe it's that each substituent is meta to the others, but that's not possible for three groups on the ring. Alternatively, perhaps they're all in meta positions relative to each other in a way that each is meta to the next. Maybe it's arranged so that each substituent is at 1,3,5 positions.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think: the main functional group is the carboxylic acid because it has the highest priority. The numbering should start from the carboxylic acid as position 1.

So, position 1 is the COOH group.

The carbaldehyde (formyl group) is meta to
