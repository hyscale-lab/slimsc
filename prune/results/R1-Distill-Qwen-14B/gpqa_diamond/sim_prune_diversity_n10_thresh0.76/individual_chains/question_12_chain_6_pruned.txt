Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when a particle decays, especially at rest, we can use conservation of energy and momentum principles. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV/c², and mu is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino is nearly massless, so I can probably ignore its rest mass for this calculation.

Wait, energy and momentum must be conserved here. Since the Pi is initially at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the mu and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to satisfy momentum conservation. So p_mu = -p_nu. That makes sense.

Now, for energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the Pi, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the energies of the mu and the neutrino must add up to this.

The mu has rest mass, so its energy will be the sum of its kinetic energy and rest mass energy. The neutrino, being massless, has energy equal to its kinetic energy (since E = pc for it).

Let me denote:
E_mu = K_mu + m_mu c²
E_nu = K_nu

Conservation of energy gives:
E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c²
=> (K_mu + m_mu c²) + K_nu = m_pi c²

But wait, since the neutrino is massless, its energy is entirely kinetic. So I can write K_nu = E_nu.

Also, from momentum conservation, the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. So |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Now, for the mu, using E² = (pc)² + (m_mu c²)². So E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c²? Wait, actually, the units might be in MeV, so maybe it's better to work in units where
