Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. The main ring is a cyclohexane with a ketone group at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group, so that's -CH2OH attached. At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2)... no, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, so it's CH2 attached to the CH2 group, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2-C(CH2... no, wait. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2? Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2- but wait, the numbering is a bit confusing. Let me think: propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group starting from the double bond. So, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2-) with a double bond? Wait, maybe it's CH2=C(CH2-) attached? Or perhaps it's the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached to C2. So, for example, it's CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond between first and second carbons. Hmm, maybe it's CH2CH2CH3 but with double bond at the first position, so it's CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent. So the substituents on the cyclohexanone are at positions 3 and 5.

So first step: the starting material is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide to form product 1.

I think sodium hy
