Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about six different benzene derivatives undergoing bromination with excess bromine. We need to arrange them based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm, right, so the weight fraction depends on the substituent directing the incoming bromine to the para position.

Wait, I remember that substituents on the benzene ring can be either activating or deactivating, and they also direct the incoming electrophile to specific positionsâ€”ortho, meta, or para. So the substituent's nature will determine where the bromine adds.

So for each substituent, I need to determine whether it's activating or deactivating, and whether it's ortho/para-directing or meta-directing. Then, the para-isomer's yield would depend on how much of the bromination occurs at the para position relative to the other positions.

Let me list out each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3 (methyl group)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (an ethyl ester group, like OOCR)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorine)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitro group)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl group)
6) C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid group)

Wait, each of these is a substituent attached to the benzene ring. So let's analyze each one.

1) Methyl group (CH3): It's an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. Alkyl groups are ortho/para-directing. So the substituent will direct the bromine to para and ortho positions. Since it's activating, the ring is more reactive, so the reaction is more favorable. But wait, the position where substitution occurs depends on the directing. So in this case, the major product would be para and ortho. But since there are two positions, but which one is more favored? I think for methyl, which is a strong activating group, the para is a major site. But wait, sometimes the ortho can be more substituted but in monobromination, with excess bromine, but wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, but if the substituent is activating, the para and ortho positions are favored. But when you have a substituent that is strongly activating, the para is a major site. But for the purpose of this problem, we're just asked about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, what is the fraction of para product.

Wait, but the issue is that some substituents are meta-directing, which would mean the para is not a major position. So for substituents that are meta directors, the para would be less formed.

Wait, but in the case of substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para is a possible site. So the more activating the group, the more the para product is formed. Wait, but the position of maximum substitution might vary.

Wait, but in electrophilic substitution, the substituent's directing effects determine where the substitution happens. So, for example, a nitro group (NO2) is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So in that case, the incoming bromine would go to the meta positions, not para. So the para product would be minimal.

On the other hand, substituents that are ortho/para directors would lead to more para product, but some substituents may have more ortho products than para. Wait, but how does the substituent's activating power affect the ratio of para to ortho?

I think that the activating groups (like alkyl, alkoxy) are ortho/para directors. But in such cases, the para product tends to be more than the ortho because the para position is less hindered. But wait, sometimes, the ortho might be more substituted, but in terms of activation, maybe para is more favored.

Wait, perhaps in some cases, like with a
