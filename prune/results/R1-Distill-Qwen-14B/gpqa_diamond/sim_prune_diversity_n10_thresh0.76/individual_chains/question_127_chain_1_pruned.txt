Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which molecule forms when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I'll try to draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. So the main chain is nine carbons long (nonane), and there are double bonds at positions 2 and 6. Also, there's a butyl group attached at position 5. Wait, but butyl is four carbons, right?

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The formula is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. So the main chain has nine carbons, with double bonds starting at C2 and C6. The substituent is a butyl group on C5.

So, structure-wise, let me number the main chain from 1 to 9. The double bonds are between C2-C3 and C6-C7. Then, at C5, there's a butyl group attached. But wait, a butyl group would be -CH2CH2CH2CH2-. So that's four carbons. But wait, in the structure, the substituent would be a four-carbon chain branching off from C5.

Wait, but butyl can be different isomers, like n-butyl, iso-butyl, or sec-butyl. But without more info, I think the question assumes the most straightforward structure, which is the n-butyl group.

So, the structure would look something like this:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 ?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the main chain is nona-2,6-diene, so that's double bonds at 2 and 6. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, no, wait. The main chain is nona-2,6-diene, so that's:

Positions 1 to 9:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3:
