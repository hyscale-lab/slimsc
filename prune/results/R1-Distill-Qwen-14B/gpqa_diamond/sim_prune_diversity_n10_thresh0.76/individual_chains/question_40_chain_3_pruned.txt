Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about two chemists talking, and the second one says, "my compounds are on top of each other." Hmm. I need to understand what that means in a chemistry context.

Hmm, when a chemist says their compounds are "on top of each other," I think they might be referring to something happening in a separation technique. Oh wait, like chromatography? Because in chromatography, you separate compounds based on their interactions with a stationary phase and a mobile phase. If two compounds are on top of each other, maybe they are eluting together or not separating properly.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's about crystallization? Like, when compounds are supposed to crystallize separately but they form a solid together. So, if they have similar properties, maybe they form a co-crystal or something, making it hard to isolate them. But I'm not too sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe it's about how the compounds stick together because of their physical properties. Like, if they have similar polarities, they might interact more with each other than the solvent, leading them to not dissolve properly or stick together. Or perhaps they have similar boiling points, so when they're distilled, they come off together instead of separating into different fractions.

Wait, the options are A to D. Let's look at them.

Option A: Compounds have similar polarities. If two compounds are similar in polarity, they might interact more, perhaps leading to issues in separation techniques. For example, in chromatography, if two compounds have similar polarities, they might elute together because they have similar interactions with the stationary phase. So you can't separate them because they move at the same rate.

Option B: Compounds are bonding through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions. That would mean they're sticking together because of intermolecular forces. If they have strong van der Waals interactions, maybe they form a solid or are difficult to separate. But why would that make them "on top of each other"? Maybe it's about being stuck together in a mixture.

Option C: Compounds have similar boiling points. If two compounds have similar boiling points, when you try to distill them, they would vaporize together, making it hard to collect them separately. So during a distillation, you might get them both condensing at the same time, leading to a mix that doesn't separate into two distinct fractions. That would make the compounds hard to isolate, so they stay together, sort of on top of each other.

Option D: Similar optical rotations. Hmm, optical rotation is a property related to chirality. If compounds have similar optical rotations, that might indicate they're enantiomers or diastereomers. But how does that relate to being on top of each other? Maybe not directly. I think this option is less likely.

So, going back to the question. The chemist says their compounds are "on top of each other." That probably means they're not separating when they should. So, in a separation process like chromatography or distillation, if they're eluting together, it's about their physical properties.

If the compounds have similar polarities (A), then in chromatography, they'd move together. Or, if they have similar boiling points (C), they wouldn't separate during distillation.

Wait, the question is about synthetic organic chemistry. Maybe they
