Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what it's asking.

The question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variations. I remember that TTV is a method used to detect planets by observing the changes in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star, which can be influenced by the gravitational pull of other planets in the system. But for this problem, maybe that's not too important.

The setup says there are five exoplanets with circular orbits. They are in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, then Planet_2 is twice that, Planet_3 is 2.5 times, Planet_4 is 3.5 times, and Planet_5 is 5 times the period of Planet_1.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. It says all planets have the same albedo, so albedo doesn't come into play here. Equilibrium temperature typically depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Since albedo is the same, the ratio of temperatures will depend on their distances.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula: I remember it's T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since all planets have the same albedo, a is the same for all. So the temperature ratio T4/T2 will be based on the square root of (D2²/D4²) because when you take the fourth root, the distance terms are squared.

Wait, let's think. The formula can be simplified for comparing two planets. Since L and a are the same, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (1/D)^(1/2). So T is inversely proportional to the square root of D.

But wait, the planets are in orbital resonance, which usually relates to the ratios of their orbital periods. But for the purpose of temperature, I think what matters is their distance from the star. Since all orbits are circular, Kepler's third law applies
