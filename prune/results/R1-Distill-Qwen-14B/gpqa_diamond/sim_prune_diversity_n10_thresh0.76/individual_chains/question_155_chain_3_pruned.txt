Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

Wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The given state is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the state is expressed in the P_z basis.

Wait, but since the state is given in the P_z basis, calculating ⟨P_z⟩ should be straightforward. Because in the eigenbasis of an operator, the expectation value is just the eigenvalue. Wait no, wait. Wait, the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So the state is expressed in the P_z's eigenbasis. So I can't directly say that ⟨P_z⟩ is the eigenvalue, because the state isn't an eigenstate of P_z.

So maybe I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩.

Wait, P_z is a diagonal matrix in its own eigenbasis. Looking at the matrix given for P_z, it's:

[ [ħ, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -ħ] ]

So the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ, corresponding to the respective basis vectors.

But the state here is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. So ψ is a column vector in the P_z basis. So to find ⟨P_z⟩, I can compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Similarly, for ⟨P_z²⟩, since P_z is diagonal, P_z² would just have the squares of the diagonal elements, so [ [ħ², 0, 0], ... etc. ]

Wait, but let me compute these expectation values.

First, let me compute ⟨P
