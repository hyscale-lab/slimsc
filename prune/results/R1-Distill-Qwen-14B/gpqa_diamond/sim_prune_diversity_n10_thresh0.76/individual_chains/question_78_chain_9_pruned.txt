Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that potentials are related to the electromagnetic fields via Maxwell's equations, but I need to think about how the motion of the charge affects these potentials.

The question gives me a point charge q moving with a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and there's this vector d which goes from the point where the field was generated at time tr to the observation point r. Oh right, so tr is the time when the charge was at the position that created the field we're observing at time t, which is later than tr. 

So the velocity of the charge at that earlier time tr is v. I need to find expressions for V(r,t) and A(r,t).

I recall that the scalar potential V due to a charge is usually (q/(4πε₀ r)). But wait, when the charge is moving, does that change the expression? Oh wait, no, the static scalar potential is still q/(4πε₀ r) at the observation point, but maybe the potentials when considering retarded time or something.

Wait, but the vector potential A is given by something involving the charge's velocity. I think the vector potential due to a moving charge might involve the velocity term. Oh right, the general expression for the vector potential is A = (μ₀ q (v × r̂ )) / (4π r² c²) ) or something like that, but I'm not too sure about the exact form.

Wait, no, wait. Another approach: The potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential satisfies ∇²V = -ρ/ε₀, and the vector potential satisfies ∇²A = -μ₀ J. But for a point charge, the current J is q v δ(r'), so yeah.

Wait, but for a moving charge, the potentials would depend on the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time. Oh, because the fields are retarded, meaning they depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time.

So the scalar potential V would be given by the static potential at the retarded position. So maybe V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge's position at tr to
