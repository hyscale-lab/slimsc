Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. Hmm, I remember that cycloadditions are pericyclic reactions, and the [4+2] type is a Diels-Alder reaction, right? So the question is about identifying the exo product when 2,5-dimethylthiophene reacts with furan-2,5-dione under heat.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Diels-Alder is [4π + 2π] cycloaddition, so the diene and the dienophile. The exo rule states that the more substituted product is formed, which is usually the exo transition state. Oh, but wait, the exo product is the one where the substituents are on the same face, leading to a more stable transition state because of better orbital overlap and possible secondary orbital interactions.

So, the reaction here is between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione. Which of these is the diene and which is the dienophile? Let me recall: thiophene is a conjugated diene, and furan-2,5-dione (which is like a dione with two ketone groups on the furan ring) is probably the dienophile. Because furan derivatives are good dienophiles, especially when electron-deficient. The dione groups make it more electron-deficient, so that's likely the dienophile.

Wait, but wait. 2,5-dimethylthiophene has two methyl groups at positions 2 and5. Thiophene is a five-membered ring with sulfur. It's a diene, so it can act as the diene in Diels-Alder. Furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups, so it's a good dienophile.

So the diene is 2,5-dimethylthiophene, and the dienophile is furan-2,5-dione.

In a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (conjugated double bonds) attacks the dienophile. The endo rule says that the more substituted product is formed, but wait, the question is about the exo product. Oh, the exo product is usually the major product unless it's under
