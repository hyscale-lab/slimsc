Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct reagents for each step. Let's break it down.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's methylacetone or something. When ketones react with cyanide, I remember that they typically undergo nucleophilic addition. So in this case, NaCN would provide CN- as a nucleophile. But wait, under what conditions does this happen? I think that for the addition of cyanide to ketones, you usually need some kind of acid catalyst. Because the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl, but the carbonyl is not very electrophilic on its own. So acid would protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic. So A is probably an acid, like H3O+.

Wait, but what about the product? The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see: the starting ketone is (CH3)2CO. The product has a nitrile group (CN) attached. So the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, converting the ketone into a cyanohydrin. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Oh wait, but the product name is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. Wait, but in the product, the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl and a methyl group. So it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when CN- adds, it would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Wait, but the product name says butanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I need to count the carbons.

Butan-2-one is four carbons: CH3-C(O)-CH2. Oh wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So the chain is three carbons: the carbonyl is on C2 of a four-carbon chain? Wait no, butan-2-one structure is CH2CH2COCH3? No, wait wait. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so the structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2- something? No, butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO? Wait, I think butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when the cyanide adds, it would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. Wait but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, that's four carbons. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product is longer. Wait, but the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. Adding a cyanide would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is a three-carbon nitrile. So why does the product name have four carbons? Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is not butan-2-one but another ketone. But the question says butan-2-one, so I'll proceed.

Anyway, the point is that the first step is a cyanohydrin formation. So the reagent A is likely H3O+ because that's needed for the acid catalysis. So in the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm, so if A is H3O+, which options? A) and B) have A = H3O+.

Now, the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, so the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How is that done? Nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. Common reagents for that are strong oxidizing agents. For instance, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or other oxidizing agents like H2O with certain catalysts.

Wait, but in the presence of H2O as a reagent, maybe it's a hydrolysis? Wait, nitriles can hydrolyze in acidic or basic conditions. For hydrolysis to carboxylic acids, the usual conditions are acid (like H2SO4) and heat, or sometimes using a strong oxidizing agent like H2O with HCl or other acids. Alternatively, maybe reagent B is HCl with H2O?

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile must be oxidized. So what reagents oxidize nitriles to carboxylic acids? One common method is using H2O with HCl and a catalyst. Alternatively, using H2O with a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 in acidic conditions.

Wait, but looking at the options, the reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH, depending on the option. Wait, in the given options, option A says B is HCl, option B says B is CH3COOH, etc.

Wait, but the second step is the nitrile converting to a carboxylic acid. So the reaction conditions would involve some kind of hydrolysis or oxidation. Wait, another possibility is that the nitrile is treated with H2O under acidic conditions to form a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the nitrile is at C2, and there's a hydroxyl group at the same carbon. So when the nitrile is oxidized, the CN becomes COOH, but what happens to the hydroxyl group? Since both are on the same carbon, perhaps it's a vicinal diol or something else. Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the oxidation of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid, regardless of the other substituents.

So, the reagent B could be a strong acid. For example, in the presence of HCl, perhaps the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, another method is using KMnO4 under acidic conditions.

Wait, but in the given options, the possible B reagents are HCl, H2O, CH3COOH, or something else. Wait, the question states that B is H2O, so perhaps it's just water in some condition. Wait, no: the reaction is reagent B (H2O) suggests that H2O is part of the reaction. Wait, maybe the reaction is hydrolysis in acidic conditions, perhaps with HCl as the acid. So reagent B is HCl, but in that case, option A has B as HCl. But wait, option A has B as HCl, but under what conditions is that?

Wait, perhaps the second step is the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. For that, the typical conditions are H3O+ and heat, or maybe using H2O and an acid catalyst. Alternatively, using a strong acid like HCl with H2O. So if reagent B is H2O, then perhaps the reaction uses HCl as the acid, but the options don't list that. The options for B are either HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Wait, looking back at the options, the options for B are either HCl (option A), CH3COOH (option B), HCl (option C), or CH3COOH (option D). Wait, but the question says reagent B is H2O. Or no, wait, the reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) --> product. Oh wait, no, perhaps B is the reagent, and one of the reagents is H2O. So the options specify reagent B as H2O.

Wait, that's how it's written: the second reaction uses reagent B, which is H2O. So the reagents for the second step are H2O and perhaps another reagent. But looking at the options, each option gives A and B. So the first part is reagent A, the second is reagent B. So in the options, for the second reaction, reagent B could be HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Wait, the problem statement says: the second reaction's reagent is B (H2O). So B's reagent is H2O, but perhaps other conditions are involved. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-express the reactions.

Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Reaction 2: product from reaction 1 + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, wait, no. The product from reaction 1 is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile? Or is the product from reaction 1 the starting material for reaction 2? No, wait, the first reaction is butan-2-one plus NaCN and A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then the second reaction is that product plus B (which is H2O) gives 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the product of reaction 1 doesn't have a benzyl group. Oh wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, no, looking back: The second reaction's product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the starting material for reaction 2 is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So reaction 2 is the nitrile group converting into a carboxylic acid group. So the nitrile becomes a COOH group.

So the second step is the oxidation of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. The reagents involved would need to be strong enough to oxidize the nitrile. So in the presence of H2O, perhaps an acid catalyst is needed. So if reagent B is HCl, then under acidic conditions, the nitrile could be oxidized to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps using HCl in H2O.

Wait, but how is that done? Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under strong acidic (like HCl) conditions, with heat. Or, perhaps using a strong oxidizing agent in acidic conditions. So if B is HCl, then the reaction would proceed.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.

Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH.

So for reaction 1, the reagent A is H3O+ because that's needed for the nucleophilic addition of NaCN to the ketone. So options A and B are candidates because they have A as H3O+.

In reaction 2, reagent B needs to be a strong acid for the oxidation of nitrile to carboxylic acid. HCl (option A and C) is a strong acid. CH3COOH is a weaker acid, so perhaps not strong enough for that step.

So, for reaction 2, reagent B is HCl. Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, and C has B as HCl, but option C has A as NaHSO3.

Wait, but in reaction 1, if A is H3O+, then options A and B are possible. And in reaction 2, B needs to be HCl, so option A is the only one that fits both.

Wait, but what about option C? Where A is NaHSO3. NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3^- ion. Could that be used in reaction 1? Well, in the first reaction, it's an acid-catalyzed addition of CN^- to the ketone. So H3O+ is the acid. NaHSO3 would provide H+ and HSO3^-.

Wait, but would HSO3^- work as a catalyst for the addition? Or would it interfere? I'm not sure. I think H3O+ is the typical acid catalyst for such reactions, so A is H3O+.

Thus, the correct option is A: A is H3O+, B is HCl. So option A.


The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile using NaCN and reagent A. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. Acid catalysis is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is the most suitable acid catalyst for this step, as it provides the necessary protons for the reaction. Therefore, reagent A must be H₃O⁺, which eliminates options C and D, leaving A and B as potential candidates.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid using reagent B (H₂O). This is the oxidation of the nitrile group (CN) to a carboxylic acid (COOH). Strong acidic conditions are typically required for this transformation. Among the options, HCl is a strong acid and can provide the necessary conditions for this reaction. In contrast, CH₃COOH is a weaker acid and is less effective for this purpose. Thus, reagent B must be HCl.

Combining these observations, the correct option is A: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl.

Answer: A
