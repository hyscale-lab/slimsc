Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me think. Alright, I'll start by trying to visualize the setup. There's a conducting sphere with radius R, and it's grounded. So, that means any excess charge on it would go into the ground, right? Wait, but wait, if it's grounded, does that mean the sphere is at zero potential? Or does it just mean that any charge added can leave via the ground?

So the problem says a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of this sphere. I guess d is the separation between the charge and the center of the sphere, so the distance from the charge to the surface of the sphere would be d - R? Wait, no, not necessarily, because if d is the distance from the center, then the distance from the charge to the surface would be d - R only if d > R. Oh, but I don't know if d is greater than R or not. The problem doesn't specify, but I think in typical setups, the charge is outside the sphere, so d is greater than R. But maybe it's not necessary right now.

The question is about the net potential energy of the system. Potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to bring charges together. But since the sphere is grounded, I think that might influence the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere's charges will redistribute themselves to cancel the electric field inside the conductor. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded,
