Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think about what I remember about equilibrium temperature. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming radiation from its star and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula I recall is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ) where T is the planet's temperature, T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is the star's radius, and 'a' is the planet's orbital distance. 

Wait, but in this problem, the albedo is the same for both planets, right? So the (1 - albedo) term will cancel out when taking the ratio. That's good because I don't have to worry about that part.

So the main factors will be the star's properties and the planets' distances. But wait, the problem doesn't directly give me the distances of the planets from the star. Oh, but the problem does give data from the transit and radial velocity methods. Hmm, how can I use that to find the orbital distances?

Radial velocity method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit. For a star, the RV method measures the Doppler shift which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_star) )^(1/3) * sin i ) / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) )) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) but maybe I can relate the RV shift to the mass and the orbital period. Alternatively, the shift in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å is given as 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. Wait, but how does that relate to the orbital period or the planet's mass?

Oh, wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us,
