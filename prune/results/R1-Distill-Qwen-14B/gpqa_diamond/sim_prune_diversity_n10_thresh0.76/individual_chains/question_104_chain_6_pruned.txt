Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

So, there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet, and both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets by looking at the shift in the spectral lines of the host stars.

Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1? The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula that comes to mind is the one involving the Doppler shift and the velocity of the star. The shift in wavelength (delta lambda) is related to the velocity (v) of the star by the formula delta lambda / lambda = v / c, where c is the speed of light.

But wait, in this problem, they're giving the shift in milliangstroms, which is delta lambda. To find the velocity, I can rearrange the formula: v = (delta lambda / lambda) * c. But wait, the actual value of lambda (the wavelength) might not be necessary here because perhaps the ratio of velocities depends only on the ratio of the shifts, assuming the same spectral line is used (so same lambda for both measurements).

Wait, the problem says that the same spectral line at a given wavelength is used for both. So lambda is the same for both Planet #1 and #2. Therefore, the velocity is proportional to the delta lambda. So Planet #1's star is moving at a velocity v1, and Planet #2's at v2. Since delta lambda is 5 and 7 respectively, then v1 = (5/lambda)*c and v2 = (7/lambda)*c. Therefore, v2 = (7/5) * v1. So v2 is 1.4 times v1.

But wait, how does the velocity relate to the orbital period? I think I need to use Kepler's third law here, but I'm not exactly sure how to apply it in this context. Let's think. The RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the period, and the semi-major axis (but since the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is the radius).

Kepler's third law in the context of the RV method is often written as:

v = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star (Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun's), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the inclination i is 90 degrees (edge-on) for maximum Doppler shift, so sin i = 1. So the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the relation between velocity and period. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, I'm not confident about the exact formula, but I know that the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period P. Because when P is longer, the star moves more slowly in its orbit, leading to a smaller K.

So if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p
