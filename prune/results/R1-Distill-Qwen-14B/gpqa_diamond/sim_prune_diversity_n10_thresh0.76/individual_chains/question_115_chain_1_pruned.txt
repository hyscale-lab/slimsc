Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electrons and positrons colliding and producing photons. Hmm, let me try to unpack what's going on here.

Alright, the setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one's going upper-right, the other lower-right.

The question is asking for the angle between these two photons' directions. The options are A)74, B)172, C)138, D)96 degrees. Hmm.

Wait, okay, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. Since an electron and positron are involved, they must be moving towards each other. But wait, the electron is moving from the left, and the positron from the right. So their initial momenta are in opposite directions. 

But Lorentz factors are given—so relativistic effects are at play here. The Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time, length, and mass dilate. The Lorentz factor is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But perhaps more importantly, the momentum of each particle depends on gamma as well.

Wait, the electron and positron have the same rest mass—so their rest masses are equal. Let's denote the rest mass as m. Since the positron is the antiparticle, its mass is the same as the electron's. So when calculating their momenta, it's (gamma * m * v) for each.

Wait, but both are moving along the same axis, so their velocities are in opposite directions. Let's say the electron is moving along the positive x-direction (from left to right), and the positron is moving along the negative x-direction (from right to left). Wait no, the positron is moving from the right, so if we take the initial setup as the positron moving towards the left (since it starts from the right), but wait, the initial movement is along the horizontal axis. Wait, perhaps I should clarify directions.

Wait, the problem says both are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is from the left, so moving to the right. The positron is from the right
