Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through. So the question is about determining the comoving distance of a quasar given certain observations. 

Wait, the observations mentioned are in the near infrared and optical spectrum. The peak is at 790 nm, and the flux drops below that. Oh, right, flux drop-offs can relate to dust extinction, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Maybe it's about the Lyman break? Because the Lyman-alpha forest or the Lyman break could cause a drop in flux at certain wavelengths. The Lyman break is when the intergalactic medium absorbs certain wavelengths, causing a drop in the observed flux below a certain point. 

Wait, the Lyman series is for hydrogen. The Lyman-alpha transition is about 121 nm, which is in the UV. So if a quasar's emission is at a certain rest frame wavelength, but we see it redshifted, the observed wavelength would be longer. If the observed peak is at 790 nm, which is near infrared, that's about 7900 angstroms. 

But wait, what if the quasar's emission line is at a rest wavelength. Oh, maybe the peak is from the Lyman-alpha emission line. Lyman-alpha is 121.6 nm. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then the redshift z is (observed - rest) / rest. So (790 - 121.6)/121.6 = (668.4)/121.6 ≈ 5.5. So z≈5.5. 

If the quasar's light is observed at 790 nm, and the Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm rest frame, then z is about 5.5. Alternatively, if the observed peak is the Lyman break, which occurs at 91.2 nm rest (the Lyman limit), but that's shorter than Lyman-alpha. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Alternatively, the peak could be from the Lyman series, or maybe it's the Balmer break? Wait, the Balmer break is in the optical and is a drop in flux at around 360 nm or so. But the
