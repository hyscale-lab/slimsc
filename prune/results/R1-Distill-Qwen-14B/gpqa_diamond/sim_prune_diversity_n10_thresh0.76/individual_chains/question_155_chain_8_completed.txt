Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z given a specific state. Hmm, I remember that uncertainty is calculated using the standard deviation formula. The formula for the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the expectation of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation of P_z. So, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Wait, the state is given as a column vector. Let me parse that. The state is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2)^T. So that's the state vector. And the operator P_z is given as a matrix with first row [ħ, 0, 0], second [0,0,0], third [0,0,-ħ]. So that's a diagonal matrix, which makes sense because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So measuring P_z in this basis will give either ħ, 0, or -ħ, right?

So to find the uncertainty, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. But wait, since P_z is already diagonal, maybe it's easier. Let me think. The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum over the probabilities times their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, the state is a column vector, so I can write it as a vector |ψ⟩ = [a, b, c]^T, where a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(2), and c = -1/2.

But wait, I should first check if this vector is normalized. The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1. Let's see: |a|² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4, |b|² is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, |c|² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Adding them: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. Okay, so it's normalized. Good.

Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is just the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue. Wait no, actually, each component in the vector is the amplitude for the respective eigenstate. So for each basis state |i⟩, the coefficient is the amplitude, and the eigenvalue is p_i.

So, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ = sum ( ψ_i^* * p_i * ψ_i ), because each ψ_i is the amplitude for the eigenstate |i⟩ with eigenvalue p_i. Oh wait, no, ψ is a column vector, and in Dirac notation, ⟨ψ|P_z|ψ⟩ is the expectation. Since P_z is diagonal, it's just the sum of |ψ_i|² * p_i.

So p_i are the diagonal elements of P_z: p_1 = ħ, p_2 = 0, p_3 = -ħ.

So the coefficients are a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(2), c = -1/2.

So |a|² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4, |b|² is 1/2, |c|² is 1/4.

Thus, ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (ħ/4) - (ħ/4) ) = 0. Hmm, interesting.

Now, ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is also diagonal, with each element squared. So for each i, p_i squared: (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2 → ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = |a|²*(ħ²) + |b|²*(0) + |c|²*(ħ²) = (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/4)(ħ²) )= (1/2) ħ².

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ², and ⟨P_z⟩ is 0. So the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0^2 ) ) = sqrt( (ħ²/2) ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, that would make the answer option B) ħ/sqrt(2).

But wait, let me double-check my steps. Did I compute the expectation correctly?

Yes, because each term is |amplitude|^2 multiplied by the eigenvalue. So for P_z, the expectation is sum |a_i|² p_i. So for the first term, |a|^2 is (1/2), and p_i is ħ, so 1/2 * ħ? Wait, no, wait a is -1/2, so |a|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Oh right, I had it correct earlier. So 1/4 * ħ plus 1/4 * ħ from the third term? No, wait the third term is |c|² * p_3. p_3 is -ħ. So that's (1/4)*(-ħ). So the first term is 1/4 * ħ, third term is 1/4 * (-ħ). So that adds to zero. So yes, ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. 

⟨P_z²⟩ is sum |a_i|^2 (p_i)^2. So for each term, (1/4)*(ħ²) [first term], (1/2)*(0) [second], (1/4)*(ħ^2) [third]. So sum is (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = 1/2 ħ^2.

So uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) / sqrt(2). So the answer is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ in the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are the diagonal elements of its matrix representation: $p_1 = \hbar$, $p_2 = 0$, and $p_3 = -\hbar$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 |a_i|^2 p_i,
\]

where $|a_i|^2$ are the probabilities (squared magnitudes of the components of $|\psi\rangle$). The components of $|\psi\rangle$ are $a_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $a_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $a_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$. Thus:

\[
|a_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |a_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |a_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting into $\langle P_z \rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is also diagonal with eigenvalues $p_i^2$. Thus, $P_z^2$ has eigenvalues $p_1^2 = \hbar^2$, $p_2^2 = 0$, and $p_3^2 = \hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 |a_i|^2 p_i^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
