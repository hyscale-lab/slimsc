Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem involves two reactions with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. The starting materials are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. After both reactions, the products are combined, and then analyzed on two HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) and a chiral one. The question is about how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

First, I should remember what mCPBA does. mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent in epoxidation reactions. So, when it reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. But wait, it's a diastereoselective reaction, right? The stereochemistry of the starting alkene (E or Z) affects the configuration of the epoxide.

So, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA. Since (E) is trans, the epoxidation would form a trans epoxide. But wait, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the oxygen adds to opposite sides. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, which has the two substituents on opposite sides, adding an epoxide would create a trans configuration in the epoxide ring. Hmm, actually, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think. When mCPBA reacts with a double bond, it forms an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are added with specific stereochemistry. For a trans (E) alkene, the epoxidation leads to a trans epoxide. Wait, noâ€”actually, the addition is such that the oxygen adds with the same stereoelectronics as the alkene. So, for a trans diene, the epoxide ends up as a trans-diepoxide? Or maybe I should think of the structure. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle. For (E), the substituents (CH2CH2CH2CH3) are opposite.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2, but more accurately, it's CH2CH2 with substituents on each end. So when mCPBA adds
