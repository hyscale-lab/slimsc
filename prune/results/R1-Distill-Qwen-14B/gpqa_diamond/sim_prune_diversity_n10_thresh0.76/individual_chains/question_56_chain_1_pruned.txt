Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. Hmm, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between different energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. The question is about a specific transition from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. 

Wait, the notation is |n, l, m>, right? So the initial state is n=3, l=0 (which is an s orbital), and m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. The question says it's a two-step transition, so it must involve an intermediate state.

Dipole transitions are allowed if the transition obeys the selection rules. For the hydrogen atom, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 (for electric dipole transitions) and Δm = 0, ±1. So, in each step of the transition, the l and m values can only change by these amounts.

Let me think about the possible steps. Starting from 3,0,0. The first transition can go to a state where l changes by ±1. Since the initial l is 0, the next step can only be l=1. Because Δl must be ±1. So the first transition from 3s (n=3, l=0) must go to a 3p state (n=3, l=1). 

Wait, but what about the n quantum number? The selection rule for n isn't as strict. For dipole transitions, the change in n can be any integer, but in practice, you go from n to n±1, I think, because higher changes are less probable. But wait, in this case, we're considering a two-step process. So from 3 to somewhere else and then from there to 1.

Wait, the first transition can't decrease n too much because we're dealing with two dipole transitions. Let me see: 3 →1 would require a big change in n, but with two transitions, perhaps 3→2 and then 2→1.

So the first dipole transition takes the electron from n=3, l=0 to a state with l=1. So the first step could be 3,0,0 → 3,1, m where m can be 0, ±1. But wait, wait, actually, the initial state is |3,0,0>, so the m is 0. So for the first transition, m can change by ±1, so m can go to 1 or -1, or stay at 0. But wait, wait: no, the initial m is 0. So the first transition can take m to 1 or -1, because Δm can be 0, ±1. Wait, but wait, no, Δm can be 0, ±1. So from m=0, possible m in the next state could be -1, 0, or +1. But since the initial l is 0, the possible l for the next state is 1. So the first transition could be to 3,1, any m, but that m can be 0, ±1.

Wait, but wait, for a dipole transition, the transition moment is non-zero only if certain conditions are met. The electric dipole selection rules are that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So in the first transition, from n=3, l=0, m=0, the state must go to a state with l=1 and m can be -1, 0, +1. So the possible states after the first transition are |3,1, -1>, |3,1,0>, and |3,1, +1>.

Now, from this intermediate state, we have to go to |1,0,0>. Let's see: the second transition must go from l=1 to l=0 (since the final state has l=0). So that's a Δl of -1, which is allowed. Also, the m must change from whatever it was to 0. So for each possible intermediate state, can we reach |1,0,0>?

Let's take each case:

1. Intermediate state |3,1,0>. From here, the second transition must go to l=0. So the next state will have l=0. The m must go from 0 to 0 (Δm=0). So the transition is |3,1,0> → |2,0,0>? Wait, wait no. Wait, the n value has to change as well. Because the initial state is |3, l=1, m=0>, and the next state is |n, 0, 0>. So n can be 2, because going from 3 to 2 is Δn= -1, which is allowed. Or could it go to n=4? Hmm, but wait, in the problem, the final state is |1,0,0>, so the second transition must take the n from 3 to 1 in two steps. Wait, no, because the two transitions are sequential. So from 3 → some state, then to 1. So the first transition must go to a state with n=3 (since it's within the same n?), or maybe different. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, the first transition is a dipole transition from |3,0,0> to |3,1, m>. The second transition must take the state to |1,0,0>. So in the second transition, the state is |3,1, m> → |1,0,0>?

Wait, but that would require a change in n of 3 →1, which is Δn= -2. Is that allowed for dipole transitions? Wait, dipole transitions can have Δn=±1, but wait, no, I think that's not exactly correct. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are Δl=±1 and Δn= any integer, but in reality, the most probable transitions are those where Δn=±1, but I might be confusing with the selection rules for other types of transitions.

Wait, no, the electric dipole selection rule for hydrogen is Δn arbitrary? Or is it that Δn can be any integer except zero? Hmm. Wait, no—dipole transitions can have any change in n as long as l changes by ±1. Because the transition moment depends on the integral of the wavefunctions multiplied by r (for electric dipole), and that's non-zero only if the product of the angular parts gives a non-zero result when integrated, which requires l to change by 0, ±1. Wait, no, correction: the electric dipole selection rule is Δl = ±1, and for the radial part, n can change by any integer (except Δl=0, but that's already ruled out). So, for example, n can go from 3 to 1 in a single dipole transition, but is that allowed in two steps?

Wait, but the problem states that the decay is via two dipole transitions, so the first transition is from |3,0,0> to some |n', l', m'>, and the second transition takes it to |1,0,0>.

So in the first step, from |3,0,0> to |3,1, m>, as we discussed. Then, in the second step, from |3,1, m> to |1,0,0>.

Wait, but that would require a transition from n=3 to n=1 in the second step. So, for the second transition, the change in n would be Δn= -2. But is that allowed in dipole transitions? Because the main selection rule for l is Δl=±1, but n can change by any integer as long as l changes by ±1. So in the second transition, l is changing from 1 to 0 (Δl=-1, which is allowed), but the n changes by -2. I thought that dipole transitions only allow Δn=±1, but I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, no—I think the main electric dipole selection rules are Δl=±1 and Δn= any integer except 0. Because, for example, the transition from n=2 to n=1 in hydrogen is allowed via a dipole transition (like in the Balmer series). So Δn= -1 is allowed. But a Δn of -2 would be allowed only if the other conditions are met. So, in the second transition, can we go from n=3 to n=1? Let's think about the possible m transitions as well.

Wait, the second transition is from |3,1, m> to |1,0,0>. So l changes from 1 to 0 (which is allowed, Δl=-1). m must change from m to 0. So m can change by 0, ±1. So for example, if the intermediate state is |3,1,1>, then in the second transition, m can go to 0 (so Δm= -1). Similarly, if the intermediate state is |3,1,0>, then m can stay at 0. Or if it's |3,1,-1>, then m can go to 0 (Δm=+1). So all three possibilities are allowed for the m transition.

Now, considering the possibility of the second transition from n=3 to n=1. The change in n would be Δn=-2. But wait, is that allowed? I thought dipole transitions require Δn=±1. Oh wait, no, the selection rule for dipole transitions is that Δn can be any non-zero integer. Because the transition moment is proportional to the integral involving the wavefunctions and the dipole operator (which is r in spherical coordinates), and this integral is non-zero only if the product of the angular parts leads to non-zero overlap, which depends on l and m. But the radial part, involving the 3s and 3p wavefunctions, can have transitions to any n, as long as the angular condition is met. So for example, a 3p state can decay to a 1s state because Δl=2 (no, wait, no; l=1 → l=0, which is Δl=-1, which is allowed). So the n can change by Δn= -2 as long as l changes by Δl= -1. So I think this is allowed.

So the first transition is 3s →3p (l change from 0→1), then the second transition is 3p →1s (l change from 1→0, n change from 3→1).

Now, considering the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/3.

Wait, but the first transition would have to go from n=3 to n=2, which is Δn= -1. Then the second transition from n=2 to n=1, Δn=-1. So that would be two transitions, but each with Δn=-1. So in each step, l changes by +1 or -1. Let's see.

Wait, initial state is |3,0,0>. First transition: n=3, l=0 → n=2, l=1 (Δn=-1, Δl=+1). Then, the second transition: n=2, l=
