Okay, so I need to figure out how long it will take for this astronaut to reach Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud, but from the astronaut's perspective. Hmm, let's see.

Wait, the problem says it's from the astronaut's point of view, so I should probably consider time dilation effects from special relativity. Because when you're moving at a significant fraction of light speed, time slows down for you relative to a stationary observer. But wait, in this case, who is the stationary observer? Oh right, Earth is moving relative to the spacecraft, but for the astronaut, the time experienced is their proper time.

Wait, no, I think I got that backwards. The astronaut is in the spacecraft, so for them, Earth is moving towards them at a high speed. So the time they experience would be less than the time observed from Earth because of time dilation. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again.

The distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years, I think. So as the astronaut is traveling, from the Earth's frame of reference, it would take a long time. But because the spacecraft is moving so fast, the astronaut's own experienced time is less due to their frame being the rest frame.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the time from the Earth's perspective first. Then use time dilation to get the astronaut's time. Let me structure this.

So, Earth's frame: The distance is D (say, around 200,0
