Okay, I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to take it step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus X is lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, Li usually has an atomic number of 3 (so 3 protons). So if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3+3=6, so it's Li-6. Or wait, maybe it's Li-7? Wait, no, because 3 protons and 4 neutrons would be Li-7. So the problem says 3 neutrons, so Li-6.

So the nucleus is Li-6. Now, I need to find the energy when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic. But wait, I'm a bit confused here. Do I use the total energy or just the kinetic? The question says "energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So I think the RHIC imparts energy to
