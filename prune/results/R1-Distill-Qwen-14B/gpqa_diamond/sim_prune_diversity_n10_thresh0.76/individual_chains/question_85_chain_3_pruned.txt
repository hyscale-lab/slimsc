Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that has to do with the balance between the incoming starlight and the planet's outgoing radiation. So, the formula for equilibrium temperature is probably T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25, or something like that. Wait, no, let me think. Oh right, the formula is T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.25, where A is the albedo.

But wait, albedo is the same for both planets, so A is the same, and they'll cancel out in the ratio. So the ratio of T1 to T2 depends on sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) divided by sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ), right? Because T1 and T2 depend on sqrt(R/(2a)).

So that ratio becomes sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Because when you divide the two terms, the R_star and 2 in denominator cancel out. So
