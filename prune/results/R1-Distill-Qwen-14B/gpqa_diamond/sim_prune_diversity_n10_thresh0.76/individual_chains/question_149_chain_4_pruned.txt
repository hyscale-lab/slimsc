Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about a synthesized peptidic compound. The 1H NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, same chemical shift, roughly equal integrals adding up to 1H. So, each peak is about half a proton? And they rule out spin-spin coupling as the reason, so it's not like a splitting with another proton.

Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So, same molecular weight. But wait, same mass but different peaks? That must mean they're separating based on something else, like retention time, but same massâ€”so perhaps isomers or something else.

Let me look at the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. The MS would show a different mass for the precursor, right? Because the question says the mass is consistent with the expected molecule. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so same mass spec. But in NMR, enantiomers usually don't split each other's peaks because the molecule is chiral, and the environment for each proton is the same. Wait, but in a chiral environment, wouldn't the alpha proton have the same shift regardless of the enantiomer? So perhaps if you have a racemic mixture, the NMR would see all the protons as equivalent, so maybe the peaks wouldn't split. Hmm, not sure. I thought that in a racemic mixture, the NMR would see a single peak because the environments are identical. But maybe if the molecule has some symmetry, but wait, the question says it's a peptidic compound. If it's a peptide, it's likely to have some chiral centers. But wait, if there's a mixture of enantiomers, would the NMR show duplicate peaks? I'm a bit confused here. Maybe not, because each enantiomer has the same environment for that proton.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. So, maybe during the formation of the amide bond, like in an HATU or DCC coupling, sometimes you can have some byproduct or maybe some side reaction. Double coupling could mean that the same proton is coupling with two different partners. Wait, but the problem says they ruled out spin-spin coupling as the reason. So that can't be C.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would elute at different times in LC (since same mass but different structures might have different retention times). Also, in NMR, each diastereomer would have their own set of peaks. But wait, the NMR shows the same alpha proton appearing as two peaks. So if you have two diastereomers, each with the same alpha proton chemical shift? That seems unlikely because the environment would be different. But maybe the two diastereomers have the same shift for that proton, like if the adjacent groups are the same. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the two diastereomers have that particular proton in the same environment, so their shifts are the same.

Wait, but the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. So if the molecule has two different diastereomers, each with the same proton shift, how would that happen? Or maybe the molecule is forming some sort of epimer, causing a diastereomeric mixture. Or perhaps the molecule is forming a pair of enantiomers with a different environment elsewhere, but the same shift for this proton.

Alternatively, considering the LC-MS: same mass, so same molecular formula. Two separate peaks, same mass. So either enantiomers or diastereoisomers. But enantiomers don't change the mass. Wait, same mass but different structures would be diastereomers.

Wait, but the NMR shows the same alpha proton as two peaks. So maybe that's because each diastereomer has that proton in a slightly different environment, but the shifts are similar enough that they overlap
