Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and they're heated together. The question is asking for the exo product of this reaction, and there are four options labeled A to D. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that cycloaddition reactions are all about the combination of two molecules to form a new ring. The [4+2] part makes me think of Diels-Alder reactions, which are [4π + 2π] cycloadditions. In Diels-Alder, a diene reacts with a dienophile to form a six-membered ring. So I should determine which of these molecules is the diene and which is the dienophile.

Looking at 2,5-dimethylthiophene, I know that thiophene is a five-membered aromatic ring with one sulfur. The 2 and 5 positions have methyl groups. Thiophene itself is an aromatic compound, so maybe it's acting as a diene here? Wait, but thiophene is more electron-rich because of the sulfur, so perhaps it can act as the dienophile. Alternatively, maybe the other molecule is the dienophile.

Furan-2,5-dione (which is also called 2,5-furandione) has two ketone groups. Furan is an electron-rich molecule because of the oxygen atoms, and the ketones might make it even more electron-deficient, making it a good dienophile. Or wait, maybe the furan-2,5-dione has a conjugated dienophilic part. Alternatively, is furan-2,5-dione more likely to be the dienophile because of its electron-deficient nature?

Wait, in Diels-Alder reactions, the dienophile is usually electron-deficient. Furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups, which are electron-withdrawing. So that makes me think that furan-2,5-dione is the dienophile. Then, 2,5-dimethylthiophene must be the diene. But wait, thiophene is a five-membered ring. How does that fit into a [4π
