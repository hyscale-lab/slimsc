Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass respectively. But I'm not sure if the mass comes into play here. The question is about the elemental abundances determined using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. Oh right, that's a method in spectroscopy to determine the abundance of elements in a star's atmosphere.

The given data:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So, the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is higher than the Sun by 0.3 dex.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So, Mg to Si ratio in Star_2 is higher than the Sun by 0.3.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun in Star_1.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Mg abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun in Star_2.

Wait, what's the photospheric composition of the Sun? It's given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16 × 10^-5.
Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, [Si/Star1]/[Si/Star2] or [nSi/Star1] / [nSi/Star2]?

Wait, actually, the ratio would be (n_Si1 / n_Si2). Or is it [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2?

Wait, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So, it's [Si]_1 / [Si]_2, where [Si] is relative to H, perhaps?

But wait, let me think about how these abundance ratios work. The [X/Y] notation is log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So, from the Sun's data:

- For Star_1:
  [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe abundance relative to H is same as Sun. So, n_Fe1 / n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

  [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log10(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) = 0.3.

  So, n_Si1/n_Fe1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

  Since n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun, because [Fe/H]_1 is 0.

  So, n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si1/n_Fe1) * (n_Fe1/n_H1) ) = (10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun)) * (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) )

  Which simplifies to 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun).

  So, [Si/H]_1 = log10(n_Si1/n_H1) = log10(10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun)) ) = 0.3 + log10(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

  Wait, but the Sun's [Si/H] is given? Let me see, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So, log(n_Fe/n_H) = -4.5.

  Wait, for Mg, the Sun's [Mg/H] is (7 -12) = -5. So, [Mg/H]_sun = -5.

  So, for the Sun: [
