Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I'm a bit new to immunology, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about rotavirus tagged with GFP. They delivered it to mice via oral gavage. Then, through in vivo imaging, some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They observed fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability. The question is asking which process is taking place.

Hmm. Let me break this down. Rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis. Peyer patches are clusters of lymphoid tissue in the small intestine, right? They're part of the immune system, especially for handling pathogens that enter through the digestive tract.

When they introduced the GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins, some issues happenedâ€”like being destroyed by stomach acid or getting stuck in mucus. But the ones that made it to the Peyer patches probably triggered an immune response.

They isolated the proliferating cells, which suggests these are B cells undergoing division. The sequencing showed high variability in the variable heavy chains. That makes me think about how B cells generate diversity in their antibodies.

Wait, the variable regions of the heavy chains are generated during processes like VDJ recombination, right? VDJ is the initial process in developing B cells where they rearrange the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments to create a wide variety of B cell receptors (BCRs). But this happens during B cell development in the bone marrow.

But wait, after the B cells are activated by an antigen, they undergo further processes. Somatic hypermutation comes into play in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. This process introduces point mutations in the variable regions, increasing the diversity of antibodies. Class switching is another process where the type of antibody (like from IgM to IgG) changes, but that doesn't directly affect the variable regions' variability.

The question mentions that the variable heavy chain genes have high variability. So it's after the initial VDJ recombination, which already gives a lot of diversity, but if they see high variability after activation, it's probably due to somatic hypermutation. Because in the germinal centers, B cells undergo rounds of division and mutation, leading to more varied antibodies. This process is crucial for generating high-affinity antibodies.

So putting it together: the rotavirus antigens are presenting at the Peyer patches, which are sites where B cells are activated. The cells are proliferating, and their variable regions are diverse. This points to somatic hypermutation as the process occurring.

The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

VDJ is an initial process in the bone marrow, so probably not happening here. Somatic hypermutation is during the immune response. Complement activation is part of the innate immune response, maybe, but the question is about the high variability in the gene sequences after activation. Class switching changes the antibody isotype but not the variable regions' variability.

So the correct answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The question involves rotavirus tagged with GFP being delivered to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence of the inner capsid proteins was partially destroyed by stomach acid or entangled in intestinal mucus, but some reached the Peyer patches. Fluorescent Peyer patches were identified, and proliferating cells were isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes revealed high variability, prompting the identification of the underlying process.

Peyer patches are specialized lymphoid tissues in the small intestine that play a key role in immune responses to pathogens entering through the digestive tract. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that generates diversity in B cell receptors. VDJ recombination is the initial process in B cell development in the bone marrow, where variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are rearranged to create diverse B cell receptors. However, this process occurs during B cell maturation, not during the immune response to an antigen.

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, occurs in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues after B cell activation by an antigen. This process introduces point mutations in the variable regions of the B cell receptors, increasing diversity and affinity. The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes in this experiment aligns with somatic hypermutation, which is a key mechanism for generating diverse and specific antibody responses.

Complement activation is part of the innate immune response and does not directly contribute to the variability in antibody sequences. Class switching recombination changes the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not affect the variability of the variable regions. Therefore, the most likely process responsible for the observed variability is somatic hypermutation.

Answer: A
