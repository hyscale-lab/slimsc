Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The problem is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that the harmonic oscillator is a standard problem in quantum mechanics, so I think this relates to the energy levels and their degeneracy.

The question is asking for two things: the value of the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that same energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to recall the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. In three dimensions, the energy levels are given by the formula E_n = (n + 3/2) ℏω, where n is the total quantum number. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, no, actually, the 3D harmonic oscillator isn't just a simple addition like that. Let me think again. Oh, right! For the 3D isotropic oscillator, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. So the energy is E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ℏω. But wait, another approach says that the energy depends on the principal quantum number N, which is nx + ny + nz. So E = (N + 3/2) ℏω. I'm pretty sure that's correct.

Wait, but sometimes people define N as the sum of the quantum numbers. So for each state, the energy depends on N, which is nx + ny + nz, and each N gives a certain energy level. So the energy levels are quantized and depend only on N.

Now, the problem is about the third excited state. Wait, what does that mean? The ground state is the lowest energy, which is N=0, right? Because when nx=ny=nz=0, N=0. The first excited state would be N=1, the second N=2, third N=3. No, wait, no. Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy, which is the state with N=0. The first excited state is the next possible N, which is N=1, because that's the next energy level. So the third excited state would be N=3, because first (N=1), second (N=2), third (N=3). Or wait, no. Let me think again. Ground state is N=0, first excited N=1, second N=2, third N=3. So the third excited state is N=3.

Okay, so for N=3, the energy is E = (3 + 3/2) ℏ ω = (9/2) ℏ ω. So that's the energy part.

Next, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy is the degeneracy, which is the number of states with the same N. The degeneracy for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by (N + 1)(N + 2)/2 divided by something? Wait, no, wait. The number of ways to write N as a sum of three non-negative integers is (N + 2 choose 2). Alternatively, it's (N + 2)(N +1)/2. Wait, no, the formula is (N + 2)(N + 1)/2? Or is it (N + 3 -1 choose 3-1) ), which is (N +2 choose 2). So for each N, the degeneracy is (N+2)(N+1)/2?

Wait, let me think. For N=0: only one state (0,0,0), so (0+2)(0+1)/2 = (2)(1)/2 = 1. Correct. For N=1: number of states is 3. Because you can have (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So (1+2)(1+1)/2 = 3*2/2=3. Correct. For N=2: the states are (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). That's 6 states. So (2+2)(2+1)/2 =4*3/2=6. Correct. So yeah, for N=3, the degeneracy would be (3+2)(3+1)/2 =5*4/2=10. So 10 eigenfunctions.

So the energy is (9/2)ℏω, and the degeneracy is 10.

Looking at the options, option A says (9/2)ℏω and 10. That matches. Option C has 3, which would be the degeneracy for N=1. So option A is the correct choice.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation for the energy. So the formula is E = (N + 3/2)ℏω. For N=3, it's (3 + 3/2) =9/2. Yes. That's right.

So the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the potential is given by \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are determined by the total quantum number \( N = n_x + n_y + n_z \), and the energy is given by:

\[
E = \left(N + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega
\]

The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for a given \( N \) is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(N + 2)(N + 1)}{2}
\]

The question asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state. Since the ground state corresponds to \( N = 0 \), the first excited state corresponds to \( N = 1 \), the second to \( N = 2 \), and the third to \( N = 3 \). For \( N = 3 \):

1. **Energy**: Substituting \( N = 3 \) into the energy formula:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega
\]

2. **Degeneracy**: Substituting \( N = 3 \) into the degeneracy formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and the degeneracy is 10. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), 10**

Answer: A
