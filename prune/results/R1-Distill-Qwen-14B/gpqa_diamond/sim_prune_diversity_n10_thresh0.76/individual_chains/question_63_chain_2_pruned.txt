Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step. The problem is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, I remember that in such models, molecules have quantized energy levels for both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next higher state. The question is about the momentum of that photon.

Wait, the molecule is diatomic, so it's made up of two atoms, X and Y. The masses are given as Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. Oh, and the bond length R is 2 angstroms. The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

I think the key here is to determine the energy difference between the current state and the next state. The photon's energy must match this difference. Once I have the energy, I can relate it to the momentum of the photon.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, especially for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. However, the problem says it's using the rotation-vibration model, which perhaps combines both. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think: the non-rigid rotor model (sometimes called the rotational-vibrational model) includes both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of the model.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. For a diatomic, the fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state. For rotational states, the ground state is J=0, but for a diatomic, can J be zero? Because for a rigid rotor, J can be 0, 1, 2... but sometimes the ground state is considered as J=0, but I'm not sure if the non-rigid rotor model changes this.

But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the transition is purely vibrational. Or perhaps it's a
