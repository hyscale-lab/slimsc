Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about a particle moving in two dimensions with a potential given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum from the given options. Okay, so the potential has two parts: one that's symmetric in r and another that depends on cos²θ, which suggests some angular dependence.

Hmm, I remember that in two dimensions, especially in polar coordinates, the potential often leads us to consider the effective potential or maybe separate the problem into radial and angular parts. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the potential V(r,θ) can be written as V(r) + V'(r,θ), where V(r) is (1/2)k r² and V'(r,θ) is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So maybe I can rewrite this in a different form to see if it simplifies.

I know that cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me substitute that in. So V becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Let me compute that: 3/2 times 1/2 is 3/4. So,

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4) k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, adding the terms: (1/2 + 3/4) k r² = (5/4) k r². So,

V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether this potential can be written in a way that separates into a function solely of r and another that depends on θ. Alternatively, maybe it's a form that can be expressed as a product of r and θ terms, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the potential as a sum of two parts, each with different angular dependencies. Let me think about whether each term can be treated separately.

Wait, the first term is (1/2)k r², which is spherically symmetric. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Cos²θ is not the same as the spherical harmonics, but perhaps I can express it in terms of angular momentum operators or something.

Wait, in two dimensions, the angular part is different from three dimensions. Oh wait, wait, in 2D polar coordinates, the angle is θ which is between 0 and 2π. The angular momentum operator in 2D is L = r × p, which gives L = m r² (d/dθ), right? So the angular momentum L is quantized as lℏ, where l is an integer (since in 2D, angular momentum can only take integer multiples of
