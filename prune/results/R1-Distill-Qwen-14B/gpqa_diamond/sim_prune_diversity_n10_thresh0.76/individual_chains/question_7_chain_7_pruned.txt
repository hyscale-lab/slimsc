Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about cosmic gamma-rays annihilating with the CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. Hmm, okay. I remember that high-energy particles can interact with the CMB, and this interaction might limit how long they can exist, right?

The question is asking about the energy at which a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by this annihilation process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. I think the process in question is the inverse Compton scattering or something similar, but wait, the annihilation would involve two photons: a high-energy gamma and a lower-energy CMB photon combining to make an electron and a positron. So the reaction is gamma + gamma → e+ e-.

I recall that for pair production, the energy of the two photons combined needs to be at least the rest mass energy of an electron, which is about 0.511 MeV. But wait, each photon doesn't have to have that much since they can combine their energies. So the condition is that the sum of their energies is at least 2 * 0.511 MeV, which is about 1.022 MeV. But in this case, one photon is the CMB photon, which is much lower energy.

So the gamma-ray's energy (E_gamma) plus the CMB photon's energy (E_cmb) should be at least 2 * m_e c^2. But since E_cmb is much smaller than E_gamma (like, 1e-3 eV vs. gamma-rays in GeV), maybe I can approximate E_gamma ≈ E_cmb + 2 m_e c^2. But wait, no, that's not right because E_cmb is much smaller than E_gamma. Wait, the other way around: E_gamma is the high-energy one, the CMB photon is low-energy. So for the two photons to produce an electron-positron pair, their combined energy must be at least 2 m_e c^2. But since one is much higher energy than the other, perhaps the threshold condition can be approximated.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the gamma-ray's energy times the CMB photon's energy is above a certain threshold. Wait, no, that's for pair production via the Breit-Wheeler
