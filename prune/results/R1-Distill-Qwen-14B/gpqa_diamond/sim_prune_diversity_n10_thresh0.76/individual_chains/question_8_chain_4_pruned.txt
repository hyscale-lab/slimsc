Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading through the question again and making sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the setup is that someone did an experiment on white lupine to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). 

The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors are proteins that help turn on the expression of other genes. So, if one of these is a TF, it probably regulates the others.

They tested these mutants for their resistance to anthracnose. The resistance levels are given as percentages of the control (wild-type). Higher percentage means more resistance. 

Here are the results:
- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

I need to figure out the interactions between these genes based on their resistance levels. The options suggest possibilities about which is a TF, and relationships like epistasis or pleiotropy.

Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, gene B is epistatic over gene A if the phenotype of A depends on B. For example, if a mutation in B masks the effect of A, then B is epistatic to A.

Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. But in this context, maybe it's about how genes affect each other's expression.

Redundancy would be when two genes have overlapping functions, so knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

So, let's look at the data.

First, individual knockouts:

g1 has 75% resistance. So, it's less than wild type, but not super severe. So, the gene product of G1 is contributing to resistance. If you knock it out, you lose 25% resistance.

g2 has 0% resistance. So, the mutant is completely susceptible. So, knocking out G2 is very bad for resistance.

g3 has 50% resistance. So, its effect is somewhere between G1 and G2. But when you knock it out, the plant is more susceptible than wild type.

Now, double knockouts:

g1g3: 10% resistance. So, much worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So, combining the two knockouts makes the situation worse than either alone.

g2g3: 0% resistance. Same as g2 alone. So, when you knock out both G2 and G3, you get the same resistance as when you just knock out G2. So, adding G3 knockout doesn't change the severity. Hmm, that's interesting.

g1g2: 0% resistance. So, when you knock out both G1 and G2, the plants are completely susceptible. But G2 alone is already 0%, so adding G1 knockout doesn't change the result. So, in this case, G1's effect is dependent on G2.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. Since g2 alone is 0%, any double mutant that includes g2 (like g1g2 or g2g3) will also be 0%. So that might just be because when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is zero, regardless of other genes. So, the presence of other knocked genes doesn't make it worse than zero.

But let's step back. What's the wild type's resistance? The control is 100%, so the wild type is fully resistant. When any single gene is knocked out, their resistance is lower—so all three genes contribute to resistance.

But looking at the double mutants:

g1g3: 10% resistance. That's worse than g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So the combined effect is more than additive. So, maybe the functions are additive. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway.

g2g3: 0%—same as g2. So, the presence of G3 knockout in the presence of G2 knockout doesn't change the result. So, maybe G3 is downstream of G2 or vice versa.

Similarly, g1g2 is 0%—same as g2. So, in the presence of G2 knockout, G1 knockout doesn't add anything.

Now, considering that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others. So, perhaps G2 is the TF, because knocking it out completely eliminates resistance. So, maybe G2 is the TF that activates other genes.

If G2 is a TF, then knocking it out would prevent the expression of any genes it regulates. That would make the plant unable to resist the infection.

Looking at the individual knockouts:

g2 has 0% resistance. So, without G2, the plant can't resist. So, G2 might be a TF that is essential for the resistance pathway.

But wait, what about g3? If G3 is downstream of G2, then knocking out G2 would prevent G3 from being expressed. So, in that case, the g3 mutant would have some residual function. But in the data, g3 is 50% resistance. So, perhaps G3 is not directly under G2's control, but perhaps another gene.

Wait, but if G3 is downstream, then knocking out G2 would also knock out G3's function, but in the data, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So perhaps G3 is not downstream of G2.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3.

Wait, but in that case, if G2 is knocked out, then both G1 and G3 wouldn't be expressed. But in the data, when G2 is knocked out (g2), the resistance is 0%, but when G1 is knocked out (g1), resistance is 75%, and when G3 is
