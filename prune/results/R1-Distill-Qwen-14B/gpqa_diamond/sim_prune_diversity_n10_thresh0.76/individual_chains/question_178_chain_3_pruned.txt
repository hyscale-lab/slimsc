Okay, so I've got this question about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of the coupling constants determines renormalizability. So the first step is to find the mass dimension of κ.

Wait, how do I find the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian? Right, the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (since it's integrated over spacetime, which has dimension [Mass]^-4 in 4D). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So let's break down the term κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each fermion field ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because in 4D, the Dirac spinor has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ and ψ each contribute 3/2. Then σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, right? Wait, σ is defined as a commutator of gamma matrices. Each γ matrix is dimensionless, so σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So that part doesn't add anything.

Now F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. Or wait, wait, no—the question doesn't specify, but F is probably the electromagnetic field strength. So F^{μν} has the same dimension as the field tensor. The field tensor F is derivatives of the gauge field A, which is dimension 1. Because the gauge field A has dimension 1. So F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each derivative is dimension 1, so F has dimension 2.

So putting this all together: the term is κ * (ψ̄) * σ * ψ * F.

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ and ψ contribute 3/2 each. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2) + (3/2)
