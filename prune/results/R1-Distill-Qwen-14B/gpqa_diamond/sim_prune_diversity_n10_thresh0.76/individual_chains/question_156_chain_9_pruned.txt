Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's read through it carefully. Hmm, it's about reactions involving mCPBA and then aqueous acid. The question is about what the HPLC chromatograms would look like when combining the products of two different reactions.

Alright, let's break it down. The first reaction is (E)-oct-4-ene treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The second reaction is (Z)-oct-4-ene under the same conditions. Both reactions go to 100% completion.

Wait, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, right? I remember that mCPBA is commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But wait, the configuration of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. Oh, right! mCPBA tends to add across the double bond in a stereospecific way, so E and Z alkenes would form different epoxides.

Wait, wait. Wait. Let me think. For alkenes, when mCPBA adds to a trans (E) double bond, the epoxide ends up with the two new oxygen atoms on the same face, or opposite? Or maybe it's more about the diastereomer formed.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. When mCPBA adds to an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is a peracid epoxidation, which is an electrocyclic process, I think. Oh, right, the peracid attacks the double bond in an endo transition state, so the stereochemistry of the starting alkene influences the epoxide's configuration.

So for (E)-oct-4-ene, which is trans, the epoxidation would lead to a trans-epoxide. Wait, no, actually, wait. (E) and (Z) alkenes have the substituents on opposite or same sides. So when mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide where the two new oxygen atoms are cis or trans?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me visualize. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are opposite each other. So when mCPBA, which is a peracid, adds across the
