Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, or the closer it is, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the stars are identical, so the same mass and same everything.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, wait. So the shift is related to the velocity of the star towards and away from us. Because the planet's gravity makes the star move in a small orbit, and as seen from Earth, this causes a Doppler shift in the spectral lines. The amplitude of this shift (the wobble) tells us about the mass and the orbital period of the planet.

I think the formula involved here is something to do with the radial velocity semi-amplitude. The formula I remember is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (4π²)^(1/3) )) )

But wait, since the planets have masses similar to Neptune, which is much less than the star's mass, M_* >> M_p, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. Also, e is zero because the orbits are circular. So the formula simplifies.

The simplified version of the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (4π²)^(1/3) )) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe I should look up the correct formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude. From what I recall, the formula is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (4π²)^(1/3) )) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. I think K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/ ( (M_* )^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_* )^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so 1 + M_p/M_* ≈ 1. So the formula simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(4π²)^(1/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, maybe I should think of the formula as K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Maybe it's better to use the formula that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_*)^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Since M_* is the same for both stars, and M_p is similar for both planets (since both are Neptune mass), and the inclination angle i is similar (we can assume sin i is similar for both, probably the same, as the problem states they detected the planets, implying i is roughly 90 degrees, so sin i ≈ 1). So, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_*)^(1/3) (P)^(1/3) )

But wait, M_* is same for both, and M_p is same for both, so K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

Wait, but in the problem, the shifts are given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms. Assuming the same instrument and same spectral line, the shift in wavelength is proportional to the velocity. Because the Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ ≈ v/c. Since both are same star (same λ), the Δλ is proportional to v, which is the semi-amplitude K.

So if K1 is 5 miliangstrom and K2 is7 miliangstrom, then K2/K1 =7/5= 1.4.

But from the previous reasoning, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).
