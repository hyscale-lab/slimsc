Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy it uses to accelerate a nucleus. The question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, right, I remember that in relativity, the energy of a moving particle depends on its gamma factor.

Wait, first, what's the nucleus we're dealing with? The problem says it's Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think—Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons and varying neutrons. So Li with 3 neutrons would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons.

So the nucleus is Li-6. Now, I need to find the rest mass of this nucleus. Oh, right, the atomic mass unit (u) comes into play here. The mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 1.007276 u for a proton and 1.008665 u for a neutron. But wait, because of binding energy, the actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of its parts. But wait, for the purpose of calculating the rest mass energy, I think we can use the mass of the nucleus as measured.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to look up the exact mass of Li-6. Let me recall: the atomic weight of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 atomic mass units. Wait, yes, I think the exact value is about 6.0150568 u for Li-6. But wait, sometimes the mass is quoted as the mass of the nucleus, which would be the atomic mass minus the mass of an electron. Wait, no. Wait, the atomic mass includes the electrons. Li has 3 electrons, so for Li-6, the atomic mass is around 6.0150568 u, but when considering the nucleus, we need to subtract the electrons' mass. Each electron is about 0.00054858 u. So for 3 electrons, that's 3 * 0.00054858 = about 0.00164574 u.

So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus would be 6.0150568 - 3*(electron mass). Wait, but wait—no. Because the atomic mass (like what's in the periodic table) already accounts for the electrons. But when dealing with the nucleus as a standalone, you have to subtract the electrons. So for example, the mass of the hydrogen nucleus (proton) is 1.007276 u for the atom, but the proton itself is about 0.938 GeV/c². Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Maybe I should use the mass of the nucleus in terms of u, including electrons, but I think I'm confusing myself.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the rest mass of the nucleus as given by m_X. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to proceed.

So the problem gives me the speed v = 0.96c. I need to find the total energy, which is gamma * m_X c².

So gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that.

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = 0.9216. Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714286.

But wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 0.0784 is the value. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... So that's 25/7, perhaps? Because 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is 25/7 or approximately 3.5714.

Now, the total energy E is gamma times m_X c².

But what is m_X? The mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let's find m_X in kg or in GeV/c².

Wait, 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. And 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. Since the rest mass energy is m c², where c is speed of light.

So first, I need to find m_X in kg, then compute E = gamma * m_X c².

Alternatively, I can compute m_X in atomic mass units, convert that to GeV/c², then multiply by gamma and c² to get energy in GeV.

Wait, perhaps the easier approach is to use the conversion from u to GeV/c². Because 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 1 u = 0.9315 GeV/c².

So if m_X (mass of Li-6 nucleus) is 6.0150568 u, then m_X c² is 6.0150568 * 0.9315 GeV.

Wait, but earlier I thought the nucleus's mass is 6.0150568 u minus the mass of electrons. Wait, no—wait, the atomic mass includes the electrons. So for a nucleus, the mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons. So for Li-6, which has 3 electrons, the nucleus mass would be 6.0150568 u minus 3 * (electron mass).

Wait, but the electron mass is about 0.00054858 u per electron. So 3 electrons would add 0.00164574 u. So the nucleus mass is 6.0150568 - 0.00164574 = 6.01341106 u.

Wait, but wait—no. Wait, the atomic mass is the mass of the atom, which includes the nucleus plus the electrons. So the mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons. So yes, subtract 3 * m_e, where m_e is the electron mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore the electrons, but I'm not sure. Wait, but for heavy ions, the electrons contribute a negligible amount to the rest mass. So perhaps the problem is approximating the nucleus mass as 6 u, which is 6.015 u as given.

Wait, but perhaps the actual mass is irrelevant because the problem gives the nucleus as X, which is Li-6. So maybe I should just proceed with the given data.

Wait, but wait—the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li has 3 protons. So 3 protons +3 neutrons = 6 nucleons, so the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass of about 6.0150568 u.

So m_X = 6.0150568 u.

But wait, the electrons are part of the atom but not the nucleus. So when considering the nucleus as a particle, its mass is m_X nucleus = m_atomic - 3 * m_e.

So m_atomic is the atomic mass of Li-6, which is 6.0150568 u. m_e is 0.00054858 u per electron.

So m_nucleus = 6.0150568 u - 3 * 0.00054858 u = 6.0150568 - 0.00164574 = 6.01341106 u.

So m_X = 6.01341106 u.

Now, converting u to GeV/c²: 1 u is approximately 0.9315 GeV/c². So m_X c² is 6.01341106 * 0.9315 GeV.

Let me compute that:

6.01341106 * 0.9315.

Hmm. Let's compute 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589.

0.01341106 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.01341106 * 0.9 ≈ 0.01207, and 0.01341106 * 0.0315 ≈ 0.000423. So total is approx 0.012493. So total m_X c² is 5.589 + 0.012493 = 5.601493 GeV.

Wait, but maybe I should be more precise. Let me do the multiplication:

6.01341106 * 0.9315.

Compute 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589.

0.01341106 * 0.9315:

0.01 * 0.9315 = 0.009315.

0.00341106 * 0.9315 = Let's compute 0.003 * 0.9315 = 0.0027945. 0.00041106 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.000383. So total is 0.0027945 + 0.000383 = 0.0031775. So adding to the 0.009315, we get 0.0124925.

So total is 5.589 + 0.0124925 = 5.6014925 GeV.

So m_X c² is about 5.6014925 GeV.

Then, the total energy E is gamma times m_X c². Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 * 5.6014925 GeV.

Let me compute that.

First, 3 * 5.6014925 = 16.8044775.

0.57142857 * 5.6014925: let's compute that.

0.5 *5.6014925 = 2.80074625.

0.07142857 *5.6014925 ≈ 0.4013. Because 5.6014925 *0.07 is about 0.3921, and 0.00142857 *5.601 is about 0.007999, so total approx 0.4001.

So 2.8007 + 0.4001 = 3.2008.

So total E = 16.8044775 +3.2008 ≈ 20.0052775 GeV.

Wait, but doing exact math:

3.57142857 *5.6014925 = ?

Alternatively, compute 3.57142857 times 5.6014925.

Let me think in terms of fractions. 3.57142857 is 25/7, as 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 25/7 *5.6014925 = (25 *5.6014925)/7.

Compute 25 *5.6014925 = 25 *5 is 125, 25 *0.6014925 is 15.0373125. So total is 140.0373125.

Divide that by 7: 140.0373125 /7 = 20.00533036 GeV.

So E ≈ 20.0053 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's a bit higher than my calculation. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let me check where I might have gone wrong.

1. Did I correctly calculate gamma? Yes, gamma for 0.96c is 1/(sqrt(1-0.96^2)) = 1/(sqrt(1-0.9216))=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

2. Did I correctly calculate the mass of the nucleus?

Wait, let's double-check the mass of Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0150568 u.

But the nucleus's mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass. Li has 3 electrons. So m_nucleus = 6.0150568 u - 3 * 0.00054858 u.

3 * 0.00054858 = 0.00164574 u.

So m_nucleus = 6.0150568 - 0.00164574 = 6.01341106 u.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, m_X c² = 6.01341106 u * 0.9315 GeV/u.

Wait, but wait—let me compute this more accurately. 6.01341106 * 0.9315.

Let me compute 6.01341106 * 0.9315.

Hmm:

6.01341106 × 0.9315.

Break this down:

=6 *0.9315 + 0.01341106 *0.9315.

=5.589 + (0.01341106 × 0.9315).

Let me compute 0.01341106 × 0.9315:

0.01 ×0.9315 = 0.009315.

0.00341106 ×0.9315=0.00341106 ×0.9=0.003069954, and 0.00341106 ×0.0315=0.000107285.

Adding those: 0.003069954 +0.000107285=0.003177239.

So 0.01341106 ×0.9315 = 0.009315 + 0.003177239 = 0.012492239.

So m_X c² =5.589 +0.012492239=5.601492239 GeV.

So m_X c² ≈5.601492 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m_X c^2 = 3.57142857 *5.601492 GeV.

Let me compute that:

3.57142857 ×5.601492.

Hmm, 3.57142857 is 25/7, so 25/7 *5.601492 = (25 ×5.601492)/7.

Compute 25 ×5.601492: 25 ×5=125, 25 ×0.601492=15.0373. So 125 +15.0373=140.0373.

Divide by 7:140.0373 /7=20.00532857 GeV.

So about 20.0053 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Hmm, my calculation gives about 20.005 GeV, but option C is 20.132, which is higher.

Where could I have gone wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the nucleus mass calculation. Let me double-check the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0150568 u, but when I subtract the electrons, maybe I should have considered the binding energy as well. Wait, no, the atomic mass already includes the binding energy. The nucleus's mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as moving, so the relativistic energy includes not just gamma times rest mass, but perhaps also kinetic energy. Wait, no—gamma * m c² is the total energy (rest energy plus kinetic). So (gamma -1) m c² would be the kinetic energy, but the question is asking for the energy of the collider, which would be the kinetic energy imparted to the nucleus. Or is it the total energy?

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think RHIC accelerates the ions, so the energy given is the kinetic energy.

Wait, no, the RHIC's energy is typically given as the total energy, not the kinetic. Because they specify it in terms of the beam energy. Wait, but sometimes people refer to the kinetic energy. Hmm, this is a critical point.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So perhaps they mean the kinetic energy, but more likely, that the total energy (gamma m c²) is the energy imparted by the collider.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is just asking for the total energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass.

In that case, my calculation is 20.005 GeV, but the options don't have that. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Maybe I shouldn't subtract the electrons. Because when you have a bare nucleus, it's not including the electrons. But in reality, the nucleus's rest mass is the same as the atom's (excluding electrons). Because when ions are accelerated, they're considered as bare nuclei, so their mass would be the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using the mass of the nucleus as 6 u. Let's see what happens if I take m_X =6 u.

m_X =6 u → m_X c² =6 * 0.9315 = 5.589 GeV.

E = gamma * 5.589 GeV = 3.57142857 *5.589 ≈ let's compute that.

3 *5.589 =16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589 ≈ let's compute 0.5 *5.589=2.7945, and 0.07142857 *5.589≈0.4006.

Total approx 2.7945 + 0.4006 =3.1951.

So total E=16.767 +3.1951=20. (16.767+3.1951=20. (16.767+3=19.767, +0.1951=19.9621) → wait, 3.1951 is 3.1951, so 16.767 +3.1951=19.9621 GeV.

Hmm, that's 19.9621, which is about 19.96 GeV, which is close to option C's 20.132, but not quite. So perhaps the error is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for the atomic mass and the electron mass.

Let me compute m_X more accurately.

Atomic mass of Li-6: exact value is 6.0150568 u.

Electron mass: 0.00054858 u per electron.

So m_nucleus =6.0150568 -3*(0.00054858) =6.0150568 -0.00164574=6.01341106 u.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, m_X c² =6.01341106 u * 0.931494 GeV/u.

Wait, I used 0.9315 as an approximation. Let me use a more precise value. 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c², so 0.931494 GeV/c².

So 6.01341106 *0.931494 = ?

Let me compute that.

6.01341106 ×0.931494.

Compute step by step:

6 ×0.931494 =5.588964.

0.01341106 ×0.931494.

Compute 0.01 ×0.931494=0.00931494.

0.00341106 ×0.931494.

Compute 0.003 ×0.931494=0.00279448.

0.00041106 ×0.931494≈0.00038224.

So total for 0.00341106 ×0.931494 is 0.00279448 +0.00038224=0.00317672.

So 0.01341106 ×0.931494=0.00931494 +0.00317672=0.01249166.

So total m_X c²=5.588964 +0.01249166=5.60145566 GeV.

Then, E =3.57142857 ×5.60145566.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.57142857 ×5.60145566.

Breaking it down:

3 ×5.60145566 =16.804367.

0.57142857 ×5.60145566 ≈ let's compute this as 0.57142857 is approximately 4/7.

Wait, 4/7 =0.57142857.

So 4/7 *5.60145566 = (4 *5.60145566)/7.

4 *5.60145566 =22.40582264.

Divide by7: ≈3.2008318.

So adding to 16.804367 gives 20.0051988 GeV.

Hmm, that's approximately 20.0052 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C (20.132 GeV) and option D (21.419 GeV). But 20.005 is nowhere near 20.132. Did I miss a decimal point somewhere?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rest mass in a different way. Maybe it's using the mass of the whole atom, not the nucleus. Let me try that.

If m_X is the atomic mass (6.0150568 u), then m_X c² =6.0150568 *0.931494 ≈ let's compute that.

6.0150568 *0.931494.

6 ×0.931494 =5.588964.

0.0150568 ×0.931494 ≈0.014006.

So m_X c² ≈5.588964 +0.014006=5.60297 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 ×5.60297.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5.60297.

Again, 3 ×5.60297=16.80891.

0.57142857 ×5.60297 ≈approx 3.201.

So total E≈16.80891 +3.201=20.01 GeV.

Still about 20 GeV, not matching any option. Hmm.

Wait, the options include 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.13 GeV higher. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, v=0.96c. Let me recompute gamma.

v=0.96c → v²/c²=0.9216.

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857. That's correct.

Hmm. So I'm getting about 20.005 GeV, but the closest option is C (20.132). Why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the speed. Let me check: speed is 0.96c, right?

Alternatively, maybe the nucleus is treated as a collection of nucleons, so the mass is considered as 6 * (proton mass + neutron mass)/2 or something. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation using the relativistic energy without subtracting the electron mass. So m_X is 6.0150568 u.

So m_X c²=6.0150568 *0.931494 ≈5.603 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 *5.603 ≈20.01 GeV.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the charge or something else. No, RHIC accelerates ions based on their charge, but the mass is just the mass of the nucleus.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation expects a different approach, such as using the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Let me check.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m c².

So K = (3.57142857 -1) *5.601492 → 2.57142857 *5.601492 ≈14.399 GeV.

But that's not matching any option either.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the rest mass energy as m c² =6 *938 MeV =5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

So E=gamma *5.628 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.628 = ?

3*5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628 → approx 3.206.

Total E=16.884 +3.206=20.09 GeV.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the nucleus's mass is incorrect. Another approach: perhaps the nucleus is considered as a collection of 6 nucleons, each with mass 1 u.

So X is Li-6, which is 6 nucleons. So m_X =6 *1.007276 u (protons) and 6 *1.008665 u (neutrons) → no, wait, that's incorrect because it's a mix of protons and neutrons. But perhaps the problem is approximating each nucleon as 1 u.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the mass number as the mass in u, ignoring binding energy. So m_X =6 u.

Then m_X c²=6 *0.9315=5.589 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.589 ≈20 GeV.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, let me think about the calculation again. Did I make a mistake in the multiplication?

E=gamma * m_X c².

Gamma is 25/7, m_X c² is 5.601492 GeV.

25/7 *5.601492 = (25 *5.601492)/7.

25 *5.601492 = 140.0373.

140.0373 /7=20.00532857 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the exact value is 20.0053 GeV, but the options don't have that. So why is option C 20.132 GeV? Let me see if there's a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the precise value of gamma.

v =0.96c.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute 0.96 squared: 0.9216.

1 -0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28=3.5714285714285714.

No mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, so the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

But the question asks for the energy of the collider, which would be the total energy, not the kinetic. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to use the mass of the entire atom, including electrons. Let's try that.

m_X =6.0150568 u.

m_X c²=6.0150568 *0.931494=5.603 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 *5.603=20.01 GeV.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the product gamma * m_X c².

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.601492239 more accurately.

3.57142857 ×5.601492239.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.601492239 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 ×0.001492239 ≈approx 0.0053246.

So total is 2.14285714 +0.0053246 ≈2.1481817.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.1481817=20.00532455 GeV.

Approximately 20.0053 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem defines X as Li with 3 neutrons, but I'm assuming it's 3 protons as well. Li has atomic number 3, so 3 protons and 3 neutrons for Li-6. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the speed, like 0.98c or something else, but the question states 0.96c.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the speed as 0.96c, but 0.96 times the speed of light. No, that's what I did.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different approximation for gamma. Let me compute gamma using more precise v.

v=0.96c.

Compute gamma more accurately.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm. So I'm stuck. My calculation gives about 20.005 GeV, but the options don't have that. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more precise values for the mass of the nucleus.

Let me get the exact mass of Li-6.

The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.0150568 u.

The exact mass of a proton is 1.007276 u.

The exact mass of a neutron is 1.008665 u.

Wait, but the nucleus's mass is 6.0150568 u minus 3 electrons. Each electron is 0.00054858 u.

So 3 electrons:0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass is 6.0150568 -0.00164574=6.01341106 u.

Now, m_X c²=6.01341106 ×931.494 MeV/c².

Wait, 1 u =931.494 MeV/c², so 6.01341106 u is 6.01341106 ×931.494 MeV.

Compute 6.01341106 ×931.494.

Let me compute this more accurately.

6 ×931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.01341106 ×931.494 ≈ let's compute 0.01 ×931.494=9.31494, 0.00341106 ×931.494 ≈3.177.

So 9.31494 +3.177=12.49194 MeV.

So total m_X c²=5588.964 +12.49194=5601.45594 MeV=5.60145594 GeV.

Then, gamma is 3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 ×5.60145594 GeV.

Compute this accurately.

3.57142857 ×5.60145594.

Let me compute this step by step:

3 ×5.60145594 =16.80436782.

0.57142857 ×5.60145594.

0.5 ×5.60145594=2.80072797.

0.07142857 ×5.60145594.

0.07 ×5.60145594=0.392101916.

0.00142857 ×5.60145594≈0.007999999.

So total for 0.07142857 ×5.60145594 is 0.392101916 +0.007999999≈0.400101915.

Adding to the 2.80072797 gives 2.80072797 +0.400101915=3.200829885.

So total E=16.80436782 +3.200829885=20.0051977 GeV.

So approximately 20.0052 GeV.

Hmm, but again, none of the options match exactly. The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

I'm getting about 20.0052 GeV, which is not listed. But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.127 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the product. Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.60145594 using a calculator approach.

3.57142857 ×5.60145594.

Compute using more precise steps:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.60145594.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.00145594≈0.0051975.

So total for 3.57142857 ×0.60145594 is 2.142857142 +0.0051975=2.148054642.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.148054642=20.00519749 GeV.

Same result as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy formula but with the rest mass of the entire atom, including electrons. Let's try that.

m_X =6.0150568 u → m_X c²=6.0150568 ×0.931494=5.603 GeV.

E=3.57142857 ×5.603=20.01 GeV.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the speed, like 0.98c. Let me see.

If v=0.98c, gamma=7.0.

Then, E=7 *5.601492=39.21 GeV.

But that's not any of the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.99c, which would give gamma about 7.09.

E=7.09 ×5.601≈39.7 GeV, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the rest mass of the nucleus in a different way. Perhaps the nucleus is considered to have a mass of 6.015 GeV/c², not converting from u.

Wait, but 6.015 GeV/c² is way too high because 1 u is about 0.9315 GeV/c².

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the wrong approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the kinetic energy, but then the calculation would be (gamma-1) m c².

In that case, E= (3.57142857 -1)*5.601492=2.57142857 ×5.601492≈14.39 GeV, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus in GeV/c².

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 0.938 GeV/c², and a neutron is about 0.9395 GeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total would be 3*(0.938 +0.9395)=3*(1.8775)=5.6325 GeV/c².

Wait, but that's the sum of the individual nucleon masses. But the actual nucleus has a binding energy, so the mass is less than the sum. But wait, 3 protons and 3 neutrons would have a mass of 3*(0.938 +0.9395)=5.6325 GeV/c². Then, the binding energy (which is negative) would reduce this mass.

Wait, but for the purpose of this calculation, perhaps the problem is approximating the nucleus's mass as 6 nucleons, each at 1 GeV/c². So m_X=6 GeV/c².

Then, E=gamma * m_X c² =3.57142857 *6=21.42857 GeV.

Which is approximately 21.43 GeV. Looking at the options, option D is 21.419 GeV, which is very close.

Ah, so perhaps the problem is using m_X=6 GeV/c², which is a rough approximation.

So in that case, the calculation would be 3.57142857 *6=21.42857 GeV, which rounds to approximately 21.429 GeV. Looking at option D, it's 21.419 GeV, which is very close. Perhaps due to rounding in the calculation, it's 21.419.

So why would the problem use m_X=6 GeV/c²? Because for each nucleon, protons and neutrons are roughly about 1 GeV/c². So for 6 nucleons, m_X≈6 GeV/c².

In that case, E=gamma*6 ≈3.57142857 *6=21.42857 GeV.

Thus, the correct option would be D) 21.419 GeV.

But earlier calculations with the precise mass gave around 20 GeV, but perhaps the problem expects this approximation.

So I think the intended answer is option D) 21.419 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required to accelerate a Li-6 nucleus to a speed of 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_X c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), \( m_X \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed of the nucleus is \( v = 0.96c \). Using the relativistic formula for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine \( m_X \)
The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.0150568 \, \text{u} \). The mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of 3 electrons. Each electron has a mass of \( 0.00054858 \, \text{u} \), so:

\[
m_{\text{nucleus}} = 6.0150568 \, \text{u} - 3 \times 0.00054858 \, \text{u} = 6.0150568 - 0.00164574 = 6.01341106 \, \text{u}
\]

The conversion factor from atomic mass units to GeV is \( 1 \, \text{u} = 0.931494 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Thus, the rest energy of the nucleus is:

\[
m_X c^2 = 6.01341106 \times 0.931494 \approx 5.601492 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Energy
The total energy of the nucleus is:

\[
E = \gamma m_X c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.601492 \approx 20.0052 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the Options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.0052 \, \text{GeV} \), but none of the options match this value exactly. The closest option is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which is slightly higher than the calculated value. However, the problem may involve rounding or approximations. If the rest mass of the nucleus is approximated as \( 6 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), the total energy becomes:

\[
E = \gamma \times 6 = 3.5714 \times 6 \approx 21.4286 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This matches closely with option **D) 21.419 GeV**. Given the possible approximations in the problem, the intended answer is likely **D**.

### Final Answer:
The energy of the RHIC required to accelerate the Li-6 nucleus to 0.96c is approximately **21.419 GeV**.

Answer: D
