Okay, so I've got this problem about crystal planes and interplanar distances. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance relates to the structure of the crystal. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Oh wait, rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where all the lattice parameters are equal, and all angles are the same. So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, which I think in a crystal is along the lattice vectors. So for a cubic system, the interatomic distance is a, the lattice parameter. But here it's rhombohedral, so all a, b, c are equal, right?

The question is about the (111) plane's interplanar distance. I think interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d(hkl) is given by something like d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... )) but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Wait, I remember the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) + ... ), but wait, that's more for the general case with possibly different a, b, c. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral system,
