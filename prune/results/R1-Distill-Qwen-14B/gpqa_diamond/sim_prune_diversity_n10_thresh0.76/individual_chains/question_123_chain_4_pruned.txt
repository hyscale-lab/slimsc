Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step.

The question says that the ejecta part and the galaxy are inertial frames. Oh wait, inertial frames are those that are not accelerating, right? So they're moving at a constant velocity relative to each other.

From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Oh wait, that's 6e4 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, right? Because in inertial frames, the relative speed is the same but opposite. So if the galaxy sees the ejecta moving towards it at 60,000 km/s, the ejecta would see the galaxy approaching at the same speed. But wait, no, wait. No, in relative motion, the speeds are the same. So if in the ejecta frame, the galaxy center is moving at 60,000 km/s, then in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, right? Because they're inertial frames, so just moving relative to each other at that speed.

Now the question is asking: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Wait, time is different in each frame because of time dilation,
