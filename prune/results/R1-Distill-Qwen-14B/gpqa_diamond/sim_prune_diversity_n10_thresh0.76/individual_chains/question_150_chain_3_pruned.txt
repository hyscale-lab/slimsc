Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. The NMR data is given, so that's probably the key to figuring out the structure before any reactions happen.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift, maybe an aldehyde proton? Or maybe a carboxylic acid, but that would be broader. But aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but in this case, the integration is 1H, which fits an aldehyde. Also, it's a triplet, which is interesting. Aldehyde protons usually are split by adjacent protons, maybe from a vinyl group or something.

- 6.98 ppm: a doublet with 2H. Could be aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted? Like two protons adjacent to substituents.

- 6.51 ppm: another doublet, 2H. Maybe more aromatic protons. So maybe two doublets each integrating to 2H, which might suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. Like in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are split into two doublets.

- 6.27 ppm: broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like -OH groups, but integration is 2H. Wait, but a singlet? So maybe two equivalent protons that aren't near any others. Could they be part of an enol structure or maybe something else?

- 3.66 ppm: a doublet with 2H. That's probably a CH2 group. Maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Like an OCH2 group or something. Wait, but it's a doublet, so maybe next to a CH group. Or perhaps part of an ethyl group attached to something.

So putting this together. Let's think about possible structures.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Formula: C8H9NO.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is zero (no halogens), N counts as +1. So:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5.

So five degrees of unsaturation. That's either five rings, or a combination of rings and double bonds.

But more likely, a couple of rings and some double bonds. Let's think.

Looking at the NMR, I see aromatic protons (so at least one benzene ring, which gives 4 DoU: one ring and three double bonds). Then, the aldehyde would be another double bond, so that's five DoU. But wait, the molecular formula has 8 carbons. Let me count:

If it's a benzene ring (6 C), plus something else. The benzene would account for 6 C, so the rest is 2 C. But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO, so 8 C. So benzene (6 C) plus two more C's.

Wait, but another approach: maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents. Let's think about possible substituents.

Wait, given the NMR, I think the compound has a benzene ring. Because the peaks at 6.98 and 6.51 are aromatic. Also, the 6.27 could be part of another aromatic ring but perhaps in a different substitution pattern.

Wait, but 6.27 is a singlet, which is unusual for aromatic protons unless they are equivalent and not split by adjacent protons. Alternatively, perhaps it's not aromatic. Maybe it's a conjugated diene or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe they're exchanging, like in an enol. But if it's an enol, that's adjacent to a carbonyl, perhaps.

Wait, maybe the structure has a benzaldehyde part. Like a benzene ring with an aldehyde substituent. But let me try to reconstruct the structure.

Let me think about each peak:

- 9.72 (t,1H): likely an aldehyde. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons. So maybe the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group or a CH group. Alternatively, perhaps it's coupled with two equivalent protons, like from a vinyl group. Hmm.

- 6.98 (d,2H) and 6.51 (d,2H): these look like a para-substituted benzene. Each set would be two protons, and each is a doublet, perhaps due to coupling with adjacent protons. So maybe the benzene ring has substituents that cause this splitting. Maybe each group is para, so two substituents across from each other.

Wait, but wait: if it's a para-substituted benzene, you'd expect each set of protons to be a doublet, each integrating to 2H. So that makes sense for a para-substituted benzene.

Then, the 6.27 (bs,2H): what could that be? Maybe another benzene ring but in a different substitution. Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated system, like a dienol or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the 6.27 is part of a vinyl group. Like a CH2=CHâ€“ group. But the broadness could suggest something else.

The 3.66 (d,2H): perhaps an OCH2 group, like an ether or an ester. Or maybe an N-attached group, but considering the formula, probably oxygen.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: benzene (C6H5) plus something else with 2 C and 4 H, plus an O and a N.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a substituted cinnamaldehyde or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with an aldehyde group and another substituent with a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure
