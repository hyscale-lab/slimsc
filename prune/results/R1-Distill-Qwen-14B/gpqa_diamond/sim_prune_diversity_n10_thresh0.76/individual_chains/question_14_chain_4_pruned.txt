Okay, so I have this question about ChIP-seq experiments, and I'm trying to figure out where the peaks would disappear based on the fixation method used. Let's break it down.

First, the question says that they did a ChIP-seq on PFA-fixed samples using an antibody for the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells. After all the usual processing steps like sequencing, quality control, alignment, and peak-calling, they saw some peaks. But when they changed the fixation method to PFA+DSG, those peaks disappeared. Hmm, what's going on here?

I remember that ChIP-seq is used to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. The fixation step is crucial because it cross-links proteins to the DNA they're bound to, preserving those interactions so they can be isolated and sequenced later.

PFA is paraformaldehyde; I think it's a common fixative that cross-links proteins and DNA. But wait, what's DSG? Oh right, DSG is a reducing agent, 1,4-dithioerythritol. It's used in some fixation protocols because it helps in cross-linking proteins that are in close proximity, even if not directly attached. So I think when you use PFA alone, it cross-links proteins to DNA, but when you add DSG, it might make the cross-linking more thorough or perhaps more specific.

Wait, no, I think DSG is used after PFA fixation. Oh, right! So sometimes, after PFA, samples are treated with DSG to reduce disulfide bonds. Or wait, maybe it's part of the fixation process. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh wait, no, DSG is a reducing agent used to break cross-links. Wait no, wait, another approach: I think PFA is a protein-DNA crosslinker, but sometimes other methods are used like using DSG in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps in some protocols, DSG is used to cleave certain crosslinks.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Let me think again. So, when DSG is used with PFA, perhaps it's to improve or alter the cross-linking. Or maybe when you use PFA alone, it cross-links proteins to DNA, but some regions might not get fixed properly, especially if the chromatin is in a particular state.

Wait, the question is about the peaks disappearing when PFA+DSG was used. So the initial peaks were present in
