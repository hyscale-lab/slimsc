Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down. So, the question is about a star with some specific parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels.

Let me read the question again carefully. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. So the transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…, which is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range. That's probably important because it relates to the ionization or excitation of the atoms.

Since the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I can use the Boltzmann equation to find the ratio of the populations of two energy levels. The Boltzmann equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n is the number of atoms in each level
- g is the statistical weight (degeneracy)
- E is the energy of each level
- k is Boltzmann's constant
- T is the temperature

But wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the Teff is lower. But wait, the overall Teff is lower, but the spots are cooler regions, right? Because dark spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere.

Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, the effective temperature when spots are present is 5500 K. So the star's overall photosphere is at a lower temperature when spots are present. Or maybe not? Wait, wait. Let's think.

Wait, the star's surface
