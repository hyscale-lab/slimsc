Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out what value the algorithm assigns to the DNA sequence ACAGTGACC based on the examples given. Let's see what I can do.

The examples given are:
AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

Hmm, I remember that DNA sequences are made up of the bases A, T, C, G. Maybe the algorithm is converting each nucleotide into a number and then summing them or something like that. 

Let me look at the first example: AGG gives 115. So the sequence is A, G, G. Maybe each nucleotide is assigned a specific value. Let's think about possible assignments.

What if each nucleotide is assigned a value based on their position in the alphabet? Like A=1, T=20, C=3, G=7. Wait, but that might not add up right. Let me try that for AGG.

A is 1, G is 7, another G is 7. Sum would be 1 +7 +7 =15. But the output is 115. So that's way off. Maybe it's not a simple sum.

Another thought: Perhaps it's the sum of each base's value multiplied by their position in the sequence. Like, first base is multiplied by 1, second by 2, and so on. Let's test that.

For AGG, positions are 1, 2, 3.

A (1) *1 =1, G (7)*2=14, G (7)*3=21. Sum is 1+14+21=36. Still not 115. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe each base is converted to a different number. Let me think of the standard DNA to number assignments... Oh, wait, there's the genetic code where each triplet codon is translated into an amino acid with a corresponding number, but that might be more complicated than needed here.

Alternatively, sometimes in bioinformatics, each nucleotide is assigned a digit: A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Let's try that.

AGG would be 1,4,4. Sum is 1+4+4=9. Not 115. Doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the output is the product of each base's value. Let's see AGG: 1 *4 *4 =16. Not 115. No.

Another approach: Maybe each nucleotide is assigned a two-digit number, and the output is the sum of all digits. Let's see.

Wait, if I think about the reverse. Let's take 115 and see how it might break down into the components of the sequence AGG. 

AGG has 3 bases: A, G, G.

115 is the output. Maybe each base contributes a certain amount.

Wait, 115 divided by 3 is about 38.3
