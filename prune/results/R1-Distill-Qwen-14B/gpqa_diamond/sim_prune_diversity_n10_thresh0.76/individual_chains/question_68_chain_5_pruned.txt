Okay, so I have this physics problem about a spin 1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, let me think. I remember that spin-1/2 particles have magnetic moments related to their spin. The magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times Sz, right? Oh wait, Sz is the spin in the z-direction. 

So initially, the magnetic field is in the +Z direction. The particle's moment is aligned with B, so it's in the lowest energy state I guess. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude B. 

Wait, when the magnetic field is turned off, does the particle's spin change? Or does it just stop being influenced by the field? Because I think spin is intrinsic and the field affects the energy levels. So when the field is off, the particle's spin isn't precessing anymore, but once the new field is applied, things change.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Oh right, when the magnetic field changes direction, the spin precesses around the new field direction. So the expectation value of the spin components will oscillate.

I remember that in such cases, the oscillation frequency is related to the energy difference between the states divided by Planck's constant. So the energy levels split due to the magnetic field. For a magnetic field in the z-direction, the energy levels are E = -μ·B. But when the field is along y, the situation might be a bit different.

Wait, the spin-1/2 in a magnetic field pointing in a different direction can be treated using the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. So if B is along Y, H = -γ S_z B? Wait no, because the magnetic moment is along the spin direction. So if B is along Y, the magnetic moment would contribute as H = -γ (S·B). Since B is along Y, H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, no, wait. The magnetic moment mu is gamma times the spin, so mu = gamma S. So the Hamiltonian would be H = - mu · B. If B is along y, then H = - gamma B S_y. Because the dot product would be
