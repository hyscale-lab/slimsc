Okay, so I've got this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, I remember that quasars emit a lot of light, including at specific wavelengths. The question mentions the Lyman alpha wavelength, which I think is around 1216 Angstroms. Oh right, Lyman alpha is a transition in hydrogen where an electron moves from the second to the first energy level, emitting a photon in the ultraviolet range.

So the situation is that these clouds of hydrogen are in deep space and they're absorbing the light from background quasars at that Lyman alpha wavelength. But wait, if the clouds are moving away from us, there's redshift involved. The observed wavelength would be longer than the emitted one because of the expansion of the universe.

The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift such that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Oh, right, optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because our atmosphere absorbs it. So the light we detect must have been shifted into the visible spectrum.

I think the Lyman alpha wavelength in the emitted frame is 1216 Angstroms, which is about 0.1216 micrometers or 121.6 nanometers. That's in the UV range. For it to be observed in optical wavelengths, which are roughly 400-700 nanometers, the light needs to be redshifted into that range.

So the formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength) / (emitted wavelength) - 1. Let's denote λ_obs as the observed wavelength and λ_emit as 1216 Angstroms.

We need the observed wavelength to be less than or equal to 700 nm, because beyond that is infrared, which optical telescopes can still sometimes detect, but I think the cutoff here is the visible range. Wait, the question says 'optical', so perhaps the maximum wavelength they consider is about 700 nm.

Wait, but wait. If the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms, and the telescope can only see up to, say, 700 nm (which is 7000 Angstroms), then the redshift z would be (7000 / 1216) - 1.

Let me compute that. So 7000 divided by 1216. Let's see, 1216 times 5 is 6080. 5 times is 6080. 7000-6080=920. 920/1216 is roughly 0.756. So total would be 5.756, so z ≈5.756. But that's a very high redshift. But wait, the options given are 3, 1.2, 2.4, 1.9. So that's way higher.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait! Because the neutral hydrogen is in the foreground, or is it the quasar that's at a higher redshift? Wait no, the quasar emits light that passes through the cloud. So if the cloud is at redshift z_cloud, the quasar is at a higher redshift, z_quasar. The hydrogen in the cloud is at z_cloud, so when the quasar's light passes through, the Lyman alpha absorption occurs at a wavelength λ = 1216*(1+z_cloud) Angstroms. Then, this wavelength must be detected in the optical range.

Wait, but the quasar's light is redshifted due to its own z_quasar. Wait, no, the Lyman alpha absorption occurs at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. But the quasar's light, which is emitted at 1216 Angstroms, is absorbed by the cloud when the cloud is at a certain redshift. So the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms (converted into the rest frame of the cloud), but then this must be redshifted again by the quasar's redshift.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The quasar emits light. The hydrogen cloud is between us and the quasar. So the quasar's light is at some wavelength when it leaves the quasar. The hydrogen cloud, which is at redshift z_cloud, causes absorption at the wavelength 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. But then, when that absorbed photon travels from the cloud to us, it's further redshifted by the quasar's redshift. Wait, that can't be right. Because the quasar is behind the cloud, so the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. So the quasar's emission is at a higher z than the cloud.

Wait, the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the quasar's light passes through the cloud on its way to us. So the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. So the Lyman alpha absorption occurs at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms in the cloud's frame, but when this photon reaches us, it's been redshifted by the quasar's redshift z_quasar. Hmm, no, wait. The cloud is in the path, so the photon emitted by the quasar at wavelength λ_emit_quasar (which is in the quasar's frame) is then absorbed by the cloud at a wavelength of 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the cloud's frame. But this photon, when observed here, has a wavelength that is further redshifted by the quasar's z_quasar. Or wait, no, because the photon is traveling from the quasar to us, passing through the cloud. So the cloud is at a redshift lower than the quasar's.

Wait, perhaps the Lyman alpha line observed in the quasar's spectrum would be at λ_obs = 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z_quasar). But if the cloud is at a certain redshift, the Lyman alpha line from the cloud would be observed at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) * (1 + z_quasar). No, that can't be right. Because the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. So the observed wavelength is the emission wavelength multiplied by (1 + z_cloud), and then again multiplied by (1 + z_quasar). Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the observed wavelength of the absorption line higher than the quasar's
