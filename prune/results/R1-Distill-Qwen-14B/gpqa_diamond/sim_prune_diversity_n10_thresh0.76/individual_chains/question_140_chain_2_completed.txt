Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, which probably means it's something like H2O or NH3 because those have equal numbers. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0 degrees. So maybe B is something that freezes near that temperature, like water? Wait, no, water freezes at 273 K, which is 0 C. Hmm, 277 is a bit higher, so maybe something else. Perhaps another substance that solidifies near that point.

The product of a keto acid reacting with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Wait, a keto acid has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. When it reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Maybe X is something that adds to the acid, like NaOH or another base. But wait, the product's oxygen count is 2? Or the molecule has 2 oxygen atoms in total?

Substance X's analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. That makes me think of something like NaOH or another strong base because they're common reagents. But wait, maybe it's something else. Also, X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So if X is, say, sodium hydroxide, but perhaps the sodium is a heavier isotope like sodium-23 is common, but maybe X is using a heavier isotope. Or maybe X is something like D2O, but that might be a stretch.

Let me think about the reactions. So X reacts with liquid Y violently. Let's consider possible reactions. If X is a strong base, Y could be an acid. Alternatively, if X is a metal, Y could be an acid, leading to H2 gas. Wait, but the gas W has equal neutrons and protons. Let me consider possible gases.

If W is H2O, then each molecule has 2 H and 1 O. So protons: 2, neutrons: 1 (since O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons normally, but wait, the molecule's total neutrons and protons are equal. Wait, no, H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons) and O-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the total protons would be 2 +8 =10, and neutrons would be 8. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe W is CO2? No, CO2 has 12 + 16*2=44, but protons: 6 (C) + 16 (O)*2? Wait, no, each CO2 molecule has 6 protons (from C) and 16 (from O) *2? Wait, no, each O has 8 protons, so 2 O's would be 16. So total protons are 6+16=22. Neutrons: C has 6, each O has 8, so 6 + 8*2= 22. Oh wait, that's same as protons. So W could be CO2. But wait, the reaction between a base and an acid could produce CO2. For example, if X is a carbonate and Y is an acid. But let me think again.

Alternatively, what about H2O? Let me recalculate.

H2O: each H is 1 proton, 0 neutrons. O is 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So total protons in molecule: 2 (from H) + 8 (from O) =10. Total neutrons: 8. 10≠8, so no.

What about CH4? No, but that's a gas. Wait, CH4 has 6 protons (C) + 4*(1 H) = 10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, H has 0. So 6 in total. 10 protons, 6 neutrons. Not equal.

Another possibility is N2? No, that's 14 each. Wait, N2 has 2 N atoms. Each N has 7 protons. So total protons: 14. Neutrons per N: 7 each, so 14. So yes, W could be N2, as each molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that's possible.

But how would that fit into the reaction? If X is a metal, Y could be a liquid acid. But perhaps it's a reaction that produces ammonia, but ammonia doesn't fit the proton and neutron count. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces H2 gas. H2 has 2 H atoms, so 2 protons, and 0 neutrons. That doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe W is something else. Let me think about another molecule. What about O2? O2 has 16 protons (each O has 8), so 16 total. Neutrons: each O-16 has 8, so total 16. So O2 would fit because 16 protons and 16 neutrons per molecule. So that's a possibility.

So if gas W is O2, then the reaction between X and Y produces O2. Let me think about reactions that produce O2. For example, decomposition of a peroxide, or maybe a reaction involving a strong oxidizing agent.

But then, what's the precipitate G? When heated, it releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. Let me think about possible B. If 277 K is about 4 C, then perhaps it's a solid at that temperature. Wait, but melting point is near 277 K, so perhaps it's a substance that melts just above 0 C? Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, sodium hydroxide doesn't fit because it's a solid, but maybe it's another substance. Alternatively, perhaps B is sodium oxide or something else.

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's try to figure out what X is.

The product of a keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So if the keto acid is something like acetone (which is a ketone, but not an acid), wait, no. A keto acid is a compound with both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. For example, something like acetoacetic acid. When it reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Wait, that might not make sense. Or perhaps the product, when formed, has a molecule with two oxygen atoms.

Wait, perhaps the product is water, but that would have an oxygen. Or maybe another molecule. Alternatively, maybe X is a base, and the reaction is a neutralization. For example, a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid) reacting with a base like NaOH would form a salt and water. But the product here would have... I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a dehydrating agent. For example, if X is something like PCl5, which is used to dehydrate acids to form anhydrides. But then the product would have fewer hydroxyl groups.

Wait, another approach: the product of the reaction has 2 atoms of oxygen. If the keto acid is something like RCOCH2COOH, reacting with X, perhaps it loses water. Or maybe X is a base that deprotonates the acid, but that would form a salt with the acid, perhaps with certain oxygen counts.

Alternatively, maybe X is something like NaOH. Let's say the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid, which upon reaction with NaOH would form the sodium salt, sodium acetoacetate. The formula of acetoacetic acid is C4H6O3, and the sodium salt would be C4H5O3Na. Wait, so the product would have how many oxygen atoms? The acid has 3 oxygens, so the sodium salt would have the same number, I think. So that's not matching the part about 2 atoms of oxygen.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me try to think about the reaction between X and Y.

X reacts with Y (a liquid) violently, producing gas W (with equal protons and neutrons in its molecules), precipitate G, which upon heating releases B, with a melting point near 277 K.

So perhaps the reaction is between a metal and an acid. For example, if X is a metal (like sodium) and Y is water. Sodium reacts violently with water, producing H2 gas (but H2's protons and neutrons don't match). Alternatively, maybe Y is an acid, like sulfuric acid, and X is a metal.

Wait, another possibility: X could be sodium, Y is liquid NH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, leading to CO2 gas.

Wait, if W is CO2, then each molecule has 6 (C) + 16 (O) *2 = 6+32=38. Wait, but the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule should be the same. Wait, the question says the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So let's calculate.

CO2: each molecule has 6 protons (C) + 16 (each O has 8, so 2 O's would be 16) → 22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, each O has 8, so total 6 + 16 =22. So yes, CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So W is CO2.

So the reaction is X reacting with Y, producing CO2. So X could be a carbonate, Y could be an acid. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacting with HCl (acid) would produce CO2, water, and NaCl. But then the precipitate G would probably be something else, but maybe if excess acid is present, the carbonate would completely dissolve. Alternatively, perhaps Y is water, but that's unlikely.

Wait, but if X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, the reaction would produce CO2, but what would precipitate? Maybe if Y is a limited amount of acid, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydroxide, and Y is an acid, producing water and a salt. But then the gas would be H2, which doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: X is a sulfite, reacting with an acid to produce SO2 gas. But SO2 has 16 (S) + 32 (O2) → 16+32=48. Protons: S has 16, O each has 8, so 16 + 16=32 protons. Neutrons: S has 16, O has 8 each → 16 + 16=32. So that's 32 protons and 32 neutrons. So W could be SO2. But earlier I thought CO2 was a possibility, but I'm not sure about this.

Wait, but the question says that the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. So let's double-check CO2.

CO2 has 6 (C) + 16 (O) ×2 → 6 +16×2= 6+32=38? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the molecular formula is C:1, O:2. So each C atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (in the common isotope). Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the total protons in CO2: 6 + (8 × 2) = 6 +16=22. Total neutrons: 6 + (8 ×2 )=22. So yes, same number. So CO2 fits.

So, if W is CO2, what reaction produces it? Probably carbonate reacting with acid.

So, X is perhaps a carbonate, and Y is an acid. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacting with HCl. The reaction would produce CO2, water, and NaCl. But then, what's the precipitate G? Because NaCl is soluble. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal carbonate, and Y is a strong acid, producing CO2 and a metal salt. If the metal salt is insoluble, it would precipitate. For example, CaCO3 (calcium carbonate) reacts with HCl to produce CO2, H2O, and CaCl2. But CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is not an acid. Maybe Y is something else, like water. If X is sodium, then sodium reacts with water to produce H2 (but that doesn't fit the W condition). Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal oxide, and Y is water, producing a base. But that doesn't seem to produce CO2.

Another angle: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B has a melting point near 277 K. Let's think about substances that when heated release something. If G is a hydroxide, heating might dehydrate it. For example, copper(II) hydroxide when heated becomes copper(II) oxide and water. But B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4 C. So maybe B is water, but that's a liquid. Alternatively, perhaps B is something that solidifies around that temperature. Wait, 277 K is 4 C, so maybe it's a solid that melts at that temperature. Wait, but melting point is the temperature at which solid turns to liquid. So if B is a solid at 277 K, but melts just above, perhaps it's something like paraffin or ice. But ice's melting point is 273 K, which is 0 C, so 277 is a bit higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is sodium hydroxide? No, because sodium hydroxide is a solid, but it's not a gas. Wait, no, but when heated, some compounds decompose. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is a carbonate which upon heating loses CO2 and becomes something else. For example, sodium carbonate when heated doesn't decompose, but perhaps another carbonate does. Or maybe it's a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) when heated decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So B would be water, but that's a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, let me think. If G is a bicarbonate, heating it would produce CO2 and a hydroxide. Alternatively, maybe G is a sulfate? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a sulfide, which upon heating releases something. But I'm not making progress here.

Let's go back to X. Since X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry, perhaps X is a strong base like NaOH. Wait, but we earlier thought of X as a carbonate. Alternatively, another possibility: X is a dehydrating agent, like PCl5 or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the product of the reaction between a keto acid and X has 2 oxygen atoms. So let's say the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH). If X is a base, like NaOH, the reaction would be neutralization to form the sodium salt and water. The product would be CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+.

Looking at the sodium salt, the formula is C4H5O3Na. So the number of oxygen atoms would be 3 in the salt. But the problem says the product has 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe X isn't a base.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is something that causes the keto acid to lose a water molecule, forming an anhydride. For example, using an acid chloride like PCl5 as a dehydrating agent. Acetoacetic acid reacting with PCl5 might form an anhydride, but I'm not sure about the oxygen count. Alternatively, perhaps X is a reagent that eliminates water, so the product would have fewer oxygen atoms.

Wait, but the product has 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps the keto acid loses water, reducing the number of oxygen atoms. Let me think: the keto acid has a certain number of oxygen atoms, say, 3. If it loses a water molecule (which has one O), the product would have 2 O atoms. So perhaps X is a dehydrating agent, like H2SO4 (concentrated), which can remove water from the acid.

Wait, if the keto acid is something like oxoacetic acid (which is malonic acid?), reacting with H2SO4 would dehydrate it to form an anhydride, which would have 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe.

But then, what is X? X would be H2SO4 in that case. But H2SO4 is a strong acid, not a base. The initial reaction between X and Y produces CO2 gas. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal, and the reaction is a displacement reaction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the first part: X's analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, like NaOH or another base. But X itself incorporates a heavier isotope. Hmm, perhaps X is NaOH, where Na has a heavier isotope, like Na-23 (which is the common isotope, but perhaps in X it's using a heavier one, but that might not make sense). Alternatively, perhaps X is something like D2O (heavy water), where the oxygen is the heavier isotope. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Let's say X has elements A and B. The lightest is, say, hydrogen (1), the heaviest maybe Cl (35.5). But the options are numbers around 25-35, so perhaps the sum is 35 (like 1 + 34? No, 34 is sulfur. Wait, 1 +35=36, but that's not an option here. So maybe another combination.

Wait, the options are 25,29,31,35. So perhaps the heaviest is Cl (35.5), and the lightest is H (1), sum would be 36.5, which isn't an option. So maybe another set.

Wait, maybe X is NaOH. So the elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23), sum 24. But 24 isn't an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, X is something like NH3? No, because then the elements are N and H. Heaviest is N (14), lightest H (1), sum 15. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. The elements are Na, C, O. The lightest is C (12), heaviest is O (16) or Na (23). So lightest is C (12), heaviest Na (23). Sum 35, which is option A.

Wait, but the question says that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within X. So for X=Na2CO3, the lightest element is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 35. That's option A.

So perhaps the correct answer is A) 35.

But let me check if that makes sense in the context of the reaction.

If X is Na2CO3 (sodium carbonate), Y could be an acid like HCl. The reaction would produce CO2 gas, NaCl, and H2O. But NaCl is soluble, so no precipitate. So maybe Y is a limited acid, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is not an acid. Maybe Y is something else. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another thought: if X is NaOH, then the reaction with Y (maybe an acid) would produce water and a salt. But the gas W wouldn't be CO2 unless the acid is carbonated. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfide. For example, Na2S reacting with an acid would produce H2S gas. But H2S doesn't fit the W condition because H2S has 2 H (2 protons) and 32 (each S has 32). So 2 protons, 32 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait, so I'm a bit stuck here. But considering the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements is 35, which would fit if the elements are C and Na, as in Na2CO3. Then, perhaps the answer is A)35.


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts with Liquid Y to release Gas W (with equal numbers of protons and neutrons in its molecule), forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, a substance with a melting point close to 277 K. Additionally, the product of a keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. CO₂ fits this criterion:
   - Protons: 6 (C) + 16 (O₂) = 22.
   - Neutrons: 6 (C) + 16 (O₂) = 22.
   Thus, W is likely CO₂.

2. **Reaction Between X and Y**: The reaction produces CO₂, suggesting X could be a carbonate (e.g., Na₂CO₃) reacting with an acid (e.g., HCl). This reaction typically produces CO₂, water, and a salt.

3. **Precipitate G**: If X is Na₂CO₃ and Y is an acid, the reaction would produce NaCl, which is soluble. However, if Y is a limited amount of acid, a precipitate might form. Alternatively, G could be a hydroxide or another compound that releases B upon heating.

4. **Melting Point of B**: The melting point of B is close to 277 K (4°C). This suggests B could be water (H₂O), which freezes at 273 K (0°C). When G (e.g., a carbonate or hydroxide) is heated, it could release water.

5. **Keto Acid Reaction**: The product of a keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. This suggests X might be a dehydrating agent, such as PCl₅, which removes water from the keto acid, reducing the oxygen count.

6. **Atomic Masses in X**: X is identified as Na₂CO₃ (sodium carbonate). The lightest element in X is carbon (C, atomic mass ≈ 12), and the heaviest is sodium (Na, atomic mass ≈ 23). The cumulative atomic masses of these elements sum to 12 + 23 = 35.

### Conclusion:
The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (C) and heaviest (Na) elements in X are 35. This aligns with the given options and the description of X as a reagent in organic chemistry.
