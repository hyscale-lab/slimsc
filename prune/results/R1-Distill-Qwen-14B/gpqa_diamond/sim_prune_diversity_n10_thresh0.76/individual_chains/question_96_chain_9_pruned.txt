Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Let me think about what I know.

The question gives me the distance d as 10^10 parsecs and the angular size theta as 10^-17 degrees. Wait, the angular size of the event horizon? Oh right, the event horizon's size relates to the black hole's mass. Because I remember that the Schwarzschild radius R_s is proportional to the mass M of the black hole. R_s = 2GM/c², right? So if I can find R_s, I can find M.

But how does angular size come into play here? Oh, right, angular size relates to the actual size and the distance. The formula for angular size is θ ≈ (size) / distance, using small angle approximation since θ is in degrees and small. So θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size (s) divided by the distance (d). But wait, the given θ is in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians first.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Convert theta from degrees to radians.
2. Use theta ≈ size / distance to find the size (Schwarzschild radius R_s).
3. From R_s, find the mass M of the black hole.
4. Use the formula for black hole entropy S to find the entropy.

Right, let's start.

Step 1: Convert theta to radians. 1 degree is π/180 radians. So theta = (1e-17 degrees) * (π/180) = 1e-17 * π / 180 radians. Let me compute that. 1e-17 is 10^-17. Pi is about 3.14, so 3.14/(180) is roughly 0.01745. So 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Step 2: The size is the Schwarzschild radius R_s. Using theta ≈ R_s / d. So R_s ≈ theta * d. Wait, wait, but wait: theta is in radians, and d is in parsecs. So I
