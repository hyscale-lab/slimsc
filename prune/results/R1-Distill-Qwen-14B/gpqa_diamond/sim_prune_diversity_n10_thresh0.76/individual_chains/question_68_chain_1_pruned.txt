Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So the setup is: there's a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma multiplied by Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm. I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin of a particle aligns with it due to the Zeeman effect. The energy levels split, and transitions between them would result in oscillations in certain observables.

Wait, but in this case, the magnetic field is suddenly switched from Z to Y. Let me think about what happens after the field change.

The magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin operator. But wait, the problem says mu equals gamma multiplied by Sz, so maybe it's just the z-component? Or is mu the vector with components gamma Sx, gamma Sy, gamma Sz? Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, the magnetic moment is typically given by mu = gamma * S, where S is a vector. So in the initial state, when the field is along +Z, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sz. The energy levels are determined by the eigenvalues of Sz.

But when the field is suddenly turned off (so no Hamiltonian?), and then turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian will be proportional to Sy. So the system's state doesn't change instantaneously, but the time evolution will be governed by the new Hamiltonian.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when the Hamiltonian changes abruptly (sudden approximation), the state of the system remains the same just after the change, but evolves according to the new Hamiltonian.

So initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz because the field was along Z. Let's say the initial state is |up_z>, which is the eigenstate with eigenvalue ħ/2 (since spin 1/2, S_z eigenvalues are ± ħ/2). Or wait, S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2
