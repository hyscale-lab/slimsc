Alright, I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, let's read the problem again.

Okay, we have an atomic nucleus with mass M at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm. Alright, first, let's note down the given data.

- Initial rest mass energy: 300 GeV. So, M c² = 300 GeV. But wait, in the problem statement, the initial nucleus is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy.

After fission, it splits into two fragments. Let me denote the two fragments as fragment A and fragment B. Suppose fragment A is more massive than fragment B. The problem says one is twice as massive as the other, so let's say fragment A's rest mass is twice that of fragment B's. So, m_A = 2 * m_B. Also, m_A + m_B = 0.99 M. Because the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M.

So, substituting m_A = 2 m_B into the sum equation: 2 m_B + m_B = 3 m_B = 0.99 M → m_B = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. Then m_A = 0.66 M. Because 2 * m_B is 0.66 M. So, m_A is approximately 2/3 M, m_B is 1/3 M.

Wait, so the initial nucleus has mass M, and the two fragments sum to 0.99 M. Hence, the total rest mass after fission is less than the initial. So, the mass difference must have gone into the kinetic energies of the fragments and any other particles, but the question says nothing is else is produced, so all the mass difference is converted into kinetic energy. Wait, no, because when you split a nucleus, kinetic energy is released, and the rest masses are lower. So, the initial rest mass is M, and the sum of the two fragments is 0.99 M. So, the mass loss is 0.01 M, which is 0.01 times M. That's the total mass converted into kinetic energy.

But wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum of the system after fission must still be zero because momentum is conserved. So, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So, their kinetic energies can be calculated, but we'll have to account for relativistic effects.

The question is about the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation. So, I think
