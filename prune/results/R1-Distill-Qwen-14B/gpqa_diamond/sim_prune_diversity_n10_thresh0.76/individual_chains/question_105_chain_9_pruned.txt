Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. But wait, this question is a bit different because it's about star spots, not a planet. Hmm.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor, right, that's the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the total area covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere. But wait, the star itself is a sphere, so the hemisphere area is 2πR²? Or maybe I should think in terms of the star's total surface area. The entire star's surface area is 4πR², so a hemisphere is 2πR². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Each spot is cooler than the surrounding. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So Teff_spot = 5000 K.

Wait, but how does this affect the observed brightness? Oh right, when a star with spots rotates, the brightness variation comes from the spots being in or out of view. But the problem says that the situation resembles an exoplanet's signal. So the brightness dip when spots are visible is similar to what a planet would cause.

But the question is asking, to get the same amplitude in the light curve, what would be the exoplanet's radius relative to the star?

First, I need to calculate the observed brightness variation due to the spots. The star's total brightness without spots would be L_star = 4πR² * σ * Teff^4. When spots are present, the brightness is a bit less. But since the spots are on one hemisphere, as the star rotates, the spots come into view (like when the planet transits, blocking light). Wait, but how does the rotation affect the observed flux?

Wait, the star's brightness when it's not rotating (or when the spots are on the far side) would be the normal brightness. When the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, some of the star's light is blocked. But actually, the spots aren't blocking; they're just darker regions. So the total flux would decrease because the spots are cooler. So the variation in flux is due to the spots rotating into and out of view.

Alternatively, when the star rotates, the spots are visible, reducing the flux. So the amplitude of this variation should be similar to what an exoplanet would cause when it transits.

Wait, but the problem states that the star has a radius equal to the Sun. So Rstar is R_sun, right?

But let's think about the exoplanet scenario. The planet blocks a part of the star's disk, leading to a flux dip. The dip depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is πRp², and the star's area is πRstar² (the area being blocked is a small circle with radius Rp).

But in the spot scenario, the dip is due to the presence of cooler spots on the star. The flux from the star when the spots are visible is lower than when they're not.

So let's compute the change in flux when the star rotates to show the spotted hemisphere.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = σ * Teff^4. Because the star's radius is R, the surface area is 4πR², but when calculating flux per unit area, it's just F0 = σ*Teff^4.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the star's total luminosity: L = 4πR² σ Teff^4. When spots are present, the total luminosity L' = L - (area of spots) * σ (Teff_spot)^4.

Wait, the area of spots is 0.4πR². So L' = L - 0.4π R² * σ (Teff_spot)^4.

But the total luminosity when spots are on the far side is L, and when they're facing us, it's L'.

So the change in flux is (L - L') / L, right? Because when the spots are visible, the flux is L', so the dip is (L - L') / L = 1 - (L' / L).

Let me compute L' first.

L' = L - (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

Since L = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So L' = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4
