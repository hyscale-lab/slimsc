Okay, so I've got this question about a genetic construct and some experiments. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They've created a bicistronic vector, meaning it has two genes (ligand and receptor) in one construct. The vector uses lox-Cre technology, which I remember is for conditional gene expression, like in the Cre-Lox system. So, let's parse the construct details.

The ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. Wait, no, wait. The question says the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. But wait, how's that done? Oh, right, they have stop cassettes. So between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP. And between receptor and eGFP is lox2272-stop-lox2272.

So the setup is: the vector has ligand (CBA promoter) followed by stop cassette, then the receptor preceded by IRES, which is a way to allow internal ribosome entry, meaning the receptor can be expressed in a bicistronic mRNA. Then, each gene (ligand and receptor) is under control of their own promoters? Or is it just the ligand under CBA and the receptor under IRES? Hmm.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES. So in the same mRNA, the ligand and receptor are expressed, but using different methods. The CBA promoter drives the ligand, and the IRES probably allows the receptor to be translated from the same mRNA, but without needing a second promoter.

The stop cassettes between ligand and mCherry, and receptor and eGFP are loxP and lox2272. So, when Cre is present, it will recombine these sites, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed.

Wait, so in the initial construct, without Cre, the ligand is fused to mCherry, but there's a stop cassette in between. So the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry isn't, unless the stop is removed. Same with the receptor and eGFP: the stop cassette will prevent eGFP expression unless Cre is there to excise it.

So, the idea is that when you have Cre, it will excise the stop cassettes, allowing the downstream fluorescent proteins to be expressed. So, ligand is expressed along with mCherry, and receptor with eGFP, but only in cells where Cre is active.

In the experiment, they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and checked Western blot. But that's just to test if the proteins are being expressed. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, but saw the signals proportional to actin. So maybe they didn't see the correct bands? Not sure, but the main issue comes when they breed the mouse model.

They made a mouse homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background, then crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. So the Cre is under the control of SOX10, meaning it's expressed in neural crest-derived cells, which is where the ligand and receptor are supposed to be active.

After the offspring are born, they visualize under a confocal microscope looking for green signal. Green comes from eGFP, which is attached to the receptor. But they don't see any green signal. Why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But in this construct, the ligand and receptor are in the same cell? Or are they separate? Hmm, but the expression is in the same cell. Wait, but if the ligand is secreted, then it's paracrine. But the question doesn't specify that. Well, the presence of a stop cassette before mCherry suggests that the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but I'm not sure. Not sure if this affects the result. The lack of GFP might not directly relate to this.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. If the construct is faulty and the eGFP isn't getting to the cell surface, perhaps due to a stop in processing. But the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins. So in the Western blot, maybe the receptor would be detected, but perhaps not in the right form. But the question states that the
