Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The scenario is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a plasmid to overexpress this protein. They introduced an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine, and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But they can't overexpress the protein. So, the question is why.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I need to figure out what's wrong with it. The options suggest various possibilities, like mutations, translation termination, proteolysis, or missing tRNAs.

First, I remember that the coding sequence (CDS) is the part of the DNA that's transcribed into mRNA and then translated into protein. The sequence given is the plus (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to this. Let me look for any obvious issues in the coding sequence.

One thing that stands out is the presence of stop codons. Stop codons are UAA, UAG, and UGA. The ribosome translates until it hits a stop codon and then releases the protein. If the construct introduces a stop codon early, translation would terminate early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all.

Looking at the sequence, let me scan for the triplet codons that match stop codons. Remember, mRNA is read from 5' to 3', so the DNA sense strand (provided) is the same as mRNA except T for U.

So, the DNA sequence is 5' ... ATG ... (start codon) ... and then various triplets. Let me go through each triplet to see if any are stop codons.

Wait, the start codon is at the beginning: 5' ATG. So the mRNA starts with AUG, which is methionine, the start codon.

Now, let's look through each codon. Let me write out the codons as triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AGC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCG CTA CTG CCG CGG CGT CTA GAG TCA GCC AAA GTC TTG CAG TGT GGC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC GTG TGC GGC TGC GGC GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CTT TTA CGT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTG CGA GAA CGA CAT CGA CAT AGT GCG CGT GGG CGC TGT GCA CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAG CGA TCC TCA ATT TCG CAG GAG GAC GCC TGG AGG ATC CCG CCT TGG AGA AGC TCA GCC TTT TCG CAG GAG GAC GCT GGA GGA TCC CGC CTT GGA GAA GCT CAG CTT TGG CAG GAG AGC CGA GCG TTA CGA CGA TGG GTG CCA CAG CAT CAC CTC CCG AGT GAA 3'

Wait, that's a lot. Let me look for any triplet that matches a stop codon. Remember, the mRNA is complementary, so each codon in the mRNA is the reverse complement of the DNA. For the DNA sequence, the mRNA codon is the same except T becomes U.

Wait, no. The DNA is plus strand, so the mRNA is made from the complementary minus strand. So each mRNA codon is the same as the DNA's complementary strand. So, for the DNA sequence, the mRNA is the same as the DNA, but with T to U. So, any triplet in the DNA that is complementary to a stop codon would create a stop in the mRNA.

Wait, maybe it's easier to just look for the actual stop codons in the mRNA, which would correspond to the DNA's complementary sequences.

Let me think again: for the mRNA, the first codon is AUG (from ATG in DNA). Then the next codon is UAC (from TAC in DNA), which is Tyr. Then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), etc.

Looking through the mRNA codons, I'm looking for UAA, UAG, or UGA.

Wait, the DNA sequence has a TGA triplet in it. Let me find that. Looking back at the DNA sequence:

Looking for TGA in the DNA. Let's scan:
