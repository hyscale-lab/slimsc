Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me think. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

The question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius is 30 meters. Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, so initially, with gamma (Lorentz factor) of 20, one third reach the wall. We need to find a new gamma where two-thirds reach. So, I think it's a problem related to the time it takes for the particles to reach the wall versus their lifetime. Because if they decay before reaching, they won't be detected.

Particles traveling at high speeds (ultra-relativistic) have their lifetime dilated due to time dilation. So the proper time (from their frame) is shorter, but from our lab frame, their lifetime is longer. But because they're moving fast, they might reach the detector before decaying.

So, the key here is probably the relationship between the particle's lifetime, their speed, and the detector's radius. Let me formalize this.

The radius R is 30 meters. The time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by their speed. Since they're moving at a speed close to the speed of light, which is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

The proper lifetime (tau) of the particle is related to the lab frame lifetime (gamma * tau) because of time dilation. For the particle to reach the wall, the lab frame time (t) must be less than or equal to the lifetime (gamma * tau).

Wait, but wait. The particle's lifetime is tau in its rest frame. From our perspective, it's gamma * tau. So the time it takes to reach the wall is t = R / v. We require that t <= gamma * tau. Otherwise, the particle decays before reaching.

But wait, the problem says that one third reach the wall when gamma is 20. So with gamma=20, the fraction that reach is 1/3. We need to find the gamma
