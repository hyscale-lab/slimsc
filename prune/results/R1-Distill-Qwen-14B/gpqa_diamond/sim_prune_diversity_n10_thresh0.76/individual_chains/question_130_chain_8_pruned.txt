Okay, so I've got this question here about the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds detected by optical telescopes. Hmm, let me think through this. I remember that redshift is related to how much the wavelength of light is stretched as it travels through the expanding universe. 

The question says that the clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, Lyman alpha is a specific emission line of hydrogen, right? It's usually in the ultraviolet range. Oh wait, but when there's a redshift, the observed wavelength changes. 

So the quasar emits light, and the hydrogen clouds absorb at 1216 Angstroms. But when the cloud is moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe, that absorption line shifts to a longer wavelength. So the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

But wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift such that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Oh, right! Optical telescopes can't detect wavelengths beyond the visible spectrum. So if the absorbed light (after redshift) is in the optical range, then the quasar's light at that wavelength must be within what optical telescopes can see.

I think optical light is roughly from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Converting Angstroms to nanometers: 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. That's in the ultraviolet, which is why quasars are often used as background sources because their emission can be in UV, which gets absorbed by the intergalactic medium, but when redshifted, it moves into the optical.

Wait, wait, the clouds are in deep space, so their redshifted absorption would be in the visible range for us. So the observed wavelength after redshift should be in the optical range. So the rest wavelength is 1216 A (which is 121.6 nm, as I said). Let's say the minimum optical wavelength we can observe is around 400 nm (4000 A). So the observed lambda would be 4000 A. 

So using the formula lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z), we can
