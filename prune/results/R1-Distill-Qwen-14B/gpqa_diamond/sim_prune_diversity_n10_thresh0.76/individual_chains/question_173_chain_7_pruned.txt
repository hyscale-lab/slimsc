Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: If the uncertainty in space of an electron's location, which is traveling with speed v = 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, is Δx = 0.1 nm. Based on this information, estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron. The options are given as A to D with different exponents.

Hmm. Alright, so this sounds like a problem involving Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. I remember that the principle relates the uncertainties in position and momentum. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, sometimes it's written as Δx Δp ≈ ħ/2, and when estimating the minimum uncertainty, perhaps I can take the equality.

Right, so I need to find ΔE, the minimum uncertainty in energy. But wait, how does that connect to the uncertainty in momentum? Oh, because the uncertainty in energy relates to the uncertainty in momentum via the momentum-energy relation. For a non-relativistic particle, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives me a lower bound on the product of position and momentum uncertainties. Once I find Δp, I can then relate that to the uncertainty in energy.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the uncertainty in momentum Δp using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: Δp ≈ ħ / (2 Δx). Wait, no, the exact expression is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, so for the minimum uncertainty, the product is ħ/2. So Δp = ħ/(2Δx).

2. Once I have Δp, I can find the uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔK. Since K = p²/(2m), the uncertainty ΔK would be (Δp)^2/(2m). Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the derivative because ΔK is approximately |dK/dp| * Δp. Since K is p²/(2m), dK/dp is p/m. So ΔK ≈ (p/m) * Δp. Wait, but p is the average momentum, but perhaps using the average p and
