Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let's read the problem again carefully.

So, there's this alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Their spacecraft can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to find out how long the trip takes from their point of view. The options are whether they die before reaching, or the time is about 72, 81, or 77 years.

Wait, the average lifetime is 150 solar years. So their lifespan is 150 years on Earth's time. But the astronaut is 22 now, so if the trip takes, say, 130 years from Earth's perspective, the astronaut would be 152, which is longer than their average lifespan. So that's important.

But wait, the question is about the astronaut's own experienced time, so we need to consider time dilation. So from Earth's frame, the trip takes a certain time, but from the astronaut's frame, it's shorter because of relativistic effects.

Wait, time dilation is part of Einstein's theory of relativity. The formula for time dilation is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in the Earth's frame, and t' is the time experienced by the astronaut.

But wait, no, actually, the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²
