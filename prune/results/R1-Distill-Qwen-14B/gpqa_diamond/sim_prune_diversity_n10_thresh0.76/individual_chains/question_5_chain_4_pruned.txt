Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read through it again.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement of that observable is made.

The operator P is given in terms of its components: P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The task is to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator P along direction n, which lies in the x-z plane.

Wait, wait. So for a direction n in the x-z plane, that means the direction is arbitrary but confined to the x and z axes. So the direction can be expressed as something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ), maybe? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal. Since n is in x-z, phi is zero, so the direction is along θ from the z-axis towards x.

But wait, the operator here is P, which is a vector operator. So the operator in the direction n would be the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So, mathematically, P · n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n lies in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So, P · n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

So, the operator we're looking at is this combination. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, and we're looking for the eigenvector.

But wait, the question says to calculate the eigenvector of the operator P for muon along n. So I think we need to find the eigenstate of P · n with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps P is a vector operator, and the operator in the direction n is given by that dot product. So the operator for the component along n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y =0. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

We can write this as a matrix. Let me note down the given matrices.

P_x matrix is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]].
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, n is in x-z plane, so let's say n has components (a, 0, b), with a² + b² =1. Wait, no, more accurately, n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² =1, since n_y=0.

Wait, but direction n is arbitrary in x-z plane, so perhaps we can parametrize it as n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Wait, wait, no. Because in spherical coordinates, the z-component is cosθ, and the x-component would be sinθ cosφ. But here phi is zero because it's in the x-z plane. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So, the operator P_n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). So substituting the matrices:

P_n = (sinθ) * (ħ/2 [[0 1],[1 0]]) + (cosθ) * (ħ/2 [[1 0],[0 -1]]).

Factor out ħ/2:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0 1],[1 0]] + cosθ * [[1 0],[0 -1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside. So,

sinθ * [[0 1],[1 0]] gives [[0 sinθ], [sinθ 0]].

cosθ * [[1 0],[0 -1]] gives [[cosθ 0], [0 -cosθ]].

Adding them together:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

So, P_n is (ħ/2) times this matrix. So the matrix part is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

So, the operator is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Wait, let me double-check that. For each term:

First, P_x is (ħ/2)*[[0 1],[1 0]], so when multiplied by sinθ, it becomes (ħ/2 sinθ) * [[0 1],[1 0]].

Similarly, P_z is (ħ/2)*[[1 0],[0 -1]], multiplied by cosθ gives (ħ/2 cosθ) * [[1 0],[0 -1]].

So when we add them together, the components are:

Top-left: (ħ/2 cosθ)*1 + (ħ/2 sinθ)*0 = ħ/2 cosθ.

Top-right: (ħ/2 sinθ)*1 + (ħ/2 cosθ)*0 = ħ/2 sinθ.

Similarly, bottom-left is same as top-right, and bottom-right is (ħ/2 sinθ)*0 + (ħ/2 cosθ)*(-1) ) = - ħ/2 cosθ.

So the matrix is:

[ [ (ħ/2) cosθ, (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ, - (ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

Wait, no. Wait, the P_x term is ( ħ/2 ) * [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by sinθ, it's ( ħ/2 sinθ ) * [[0,1],[1,0]], so the top right is ( ħ/2 sinθ ) * 1 and the bottom left is same.

Similarly, for P_z multiplied by cosθ: ( ħ/2 cosθ ) * [[1,0],[0,-1]], so top left is ( ħ/2 cosθ ), and bottom right is (- ħ/2 cosθ ).

So, combining them, the matrix is:

Top row: ( ħ/2 cosθ ) in (1
