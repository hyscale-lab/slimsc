Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about a light beam propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking, what's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer? The options are A to D.

Wait, okay. So the glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the light beam. So the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. I remember that when you have a medium moving relative to an observer, you have to consider the velocity addition formulas from relativity, but wait, this is a glass which is a material, not a vacuum. So maybe I should think about it in the context of relative motion and how the speed of light is measured.

Wait a second, Einstein's theory says that the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame, but I'm not sure about in a medium. Oh, but the problem states that the speed of light in vacuum is c=1. So here, the glass is a medium with refractive index n, so the speed inside the glass would normally be c/n. But wait, is that in the rest frame
