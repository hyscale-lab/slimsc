Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's try to think through this step by step.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, wait, I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime, but here we're probably dealing with a static, 2-dimensional space because it's only in terms of x and y. But pseudosphere sounds like a surface with constant negative curvature. 

Wait, wait, pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. So, maybe the metric resembles hyperbolic space somehow. Hyperbolic space can have different coordinate systems, like Poincaré coordinates, which might look something like this.

Let me recall the metric for hyperbolic space in Poincaré coordinates. I think it's usually written as ds² = (r²)/(z²) (dx² + dy² + dz²), but that's in 3D. Wait, no, maybe for 2D, it's a bit different. Oh right, the Poincaré disk model for 2D hyperbolic space has the metric ds² = (4r²)/( (1 - (x² + y²)/r²)^2 ) (dx² + dy²). Or something like that. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the Gaussian curvature from the given metric to see if it's indeed a pseudosphere (which has constant negative curvature). The area can be found using the formula for a surface of constant curvature: Area = 2πr² (spherical), but for hyperbolic, it's different.

Alternatively, the area element in a metric is found by sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy²) dx dy. Since this metric is diagonal (g_xy=0), the area element is just sqrt(g_xx g_yy) dx dy. Here, g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, but what are the limits of integration? Because the metric probably covers a certain domain. Let's see, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². To avoid the denominator being zero or negative, let's assume 4 - x² - y² > 0, so x² + y² < 4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2, since sqrt(x² + y²) < 2.

So the area would be the double integral of [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ, using polar coordinates. Wait, but wait, in polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², so the metric becomes ds² = 32/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). So the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dθ.

Let me set up the integral. The area A would be the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r from 0 to 2 (since x² + y² <4 implies r <2). So,

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ.

Let me compute this integral. First, pull out the constants: 32 * ∫θ dθ ∫r [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Compute the θ integral: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

Now the radial integral: ∫0 to 2 r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r², then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. So when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to 0 of [ (r dr) / u ] = ∫ from 4 to
