Okay, so I've got this question about polymer chemistry, specifically about ethylene polymerization using a dual catalyst system. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is a bit detailed, so I'll start by breaking down what's given. The scenario is that a scientist is using a homogeneous organometallic catalyst to make a high-density polymer, which I'm pretty sure is HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene). Now, he wants to add a second catalyst to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone. Both catalysts will only use ethylene as the monomer.

The senior scientist gives four statements, and I need to determine which one is correct. The options are A, B, C, D, each corresponding to one of these statements.

First, I'll recall what I know about ethylene polymerization. HDPE is typically made using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst, which is a transition metal catalyst, usually titanium-based with an organoaluminum co-catalyst. These catalysts help in the insertion of ethylene monomers to form long chains, and the regular structure gives HDPE its high density.

Now, the scientist wants to introduce branching. I remember that in some polymerizations, like LDPE (Low-Density Polyethylene), branches are present, but that's done through a different mechanism, like free radical polymerization. But in the case of Ziegler-Natta, it's more about linear growth. However, there's also a way to induce branching using different catalysts.

Wait, there's a type of catalyst called metallocene catalysts, which are used in producing polymers with different structures. Metallocene catalysts are typically transition metals sandwiched between two cyclopentadienyl ligands. These can produce polymers with varying structures, maybe including branches.

Another point is that to get branching, perhaps a different type of catalyst is used alongside the main one. I think the technique is called chain shuttling. So, maybe the first catalyst, which is perhaps a Ziegler-Natta type, produces the main chains, and a second catalyst, perhaps a metallocene, induces branching by a process like chain transfer.

Now, looking at the statements:

Statement A: One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.
Group VIa metals are like chromium, molybdenum, tungsten. Ziegler-Natta is often Ti or Zr, but some VIa metals are used in other contexts. Activators for Ziegler-Natta are usually organoaluminum compounds, like AlEt3. So if the second catalyst uses a VIa metal, perhaps with a different activator? I'm not sure if VIa needs aluminum-based activators or not.

Statement B: Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.
I think I remember that metallocene catalysts are used in some industrial processes, maybe for producing different types of polyolefins. There's also something called "bimetallic" or "dual" catalyst systems used to control polymer structure. So this statement seems plausible.

Statement C: Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.
