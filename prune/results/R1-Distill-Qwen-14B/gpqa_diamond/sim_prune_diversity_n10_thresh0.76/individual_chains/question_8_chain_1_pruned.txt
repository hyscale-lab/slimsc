Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about plant resistance to a fungal disease. The setup is a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.

So, the experiment involves three genes: G1, G2, and G3. They knocked out each gene to create mutants g1, g2, g3. Also, they made double mutants g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. The main question is about the interactions between these genes, especially since one is a transcription factor upstream of others.

The results of the resistance tests are given. Let me list them again:

- g1: 75% resistance (so less than wild-type, which is 100%)
- g2: 0% (so the mutant is completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0% (also susceptible)
- g1g2: 0% (susceptible)

Hmm. So, when an individual gene is knocked out, g2 is the most affected, with zero resistance. That suggests G2 might be a key gene, maybe a transcription factor as mentioned. Because without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all.

Looking at the double mutants: g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance. What does that mean? It suggests that when G2 is knocked out along with another gene (either G1 or G3), the resistance is completely lost. But wait, the g2 alone is also zero.

Wait, but what about the double mutants that don't involve g2? Like g1g3 is 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is even lower than either individual mutant. 

Now, thinking about gene interactions. If a gene is a transcription factor upstream of others, then knocking it out would prevent the downstream genes from being expressed. So the phenotype would depend on if those downstream genes contribute to resistance.

Let's consider each mutant and their resistance:

- g2: 0% resistance. So without G2, no resistance. So perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for resistance. Like, without G2, none of the resistance genes are expressed, hence zero resistance.

- g1: 75% resistance. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance by a quarter. So maybe G1 is part of the same pathway but not the main transcription factor. Alternatively, G1 could be a gene that contributes but isn't essential, so the plant can still have some resistance without it.

- g3: 50% resistance. So knocking out G3 reduces it by half. So G3 might be another gene downstream or perhaps part of a different pathway.

Now, the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0%. So without G1 and G2, the plant can't resist. But since G2 alone already gives 0%, this doesn't add much. Unless G1 is part of another pathway that could compensate when G2 is missing. But since in the double mutant it's worse than either (but same as g2), maybe G1's role is redundant or part of a parallel pathway that only matters when G2 is present.

Wait, no. Since G2 alone is 0%, the double mutant has the same. So perhaps G1 isn't doing anything when G2 is knocked out. So maybe G1 is downstream of G2, or part of a different pathway.

Wait, another thought: if G2 is a transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would prevent both from being expressed. But in the data, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is zero. But when G1 is knocked out, resistance is 75%, and G3 is 5
