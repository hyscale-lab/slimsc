Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me see what it's asking. So, two planets orbit a star, and they've been detected using both transit and radial velocity methods. The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

First, I need to recall how equilibrium temperature is calculated. I remember that the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the formula is something like Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A)/ (sqrt(epsilon)) ), but wait, I might be mixing some terms. Or perhaps it's based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Let me think again.

Oh right, equilibrium temperature Te is given by the formula:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^{1/4 }

Wait, no, wait. I think I'm confusing a few factors. Let me get it right. The formula should be based on the energy balance. The planet absorbs starlight and radiates as a blackbody.

The star emits energy per unit area as sigma * T_star^4. The planet is at a distance a, so the energy per unit area it receives is sigma * T_star^4 * (R_star / (2a))^2. Because the area it intercepts is pi R_p^2, but the area from which the light spreads is a sphere of radius a, so the flux is inversely proportional to a squared.

Wait, the effective flux at the planet's location is (L_star / (4 pi a^2)), where L_star is the star's luminosity. And L_star is 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4. So substituting, the flux at planet is sigma T_star^4 (R_star^2 / a^2).

The planet absorbs this, considering its albedo A. So the absorbed power per unit area is sigma T_star^4 (R_star^2 / a^2) (1 - A). The planet then radiates this as thermal emission, so setting absorbed equal to emitted gives:

sigma T_planet^4 = sigma T_star^4 (R_star^2 / (a^2)) (1 - A) / 4

Wait, maybe I messed up the division by 4. Oh, right, because a planet's cross-section is pi R_p^2, and the surface area is 4 pi R_p^2, so the planet reflects half the incoming flux (on average) because it's a sphere. So the equation is:

sigma Te^4 = (sigma T_star^4) * (R_star^2 / (a^2)) * (1 - A) / 4

Wait, let's write that correctly. The power
