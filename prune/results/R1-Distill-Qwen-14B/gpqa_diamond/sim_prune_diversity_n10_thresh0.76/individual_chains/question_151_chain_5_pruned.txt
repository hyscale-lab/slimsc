Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable is represented by the matrix operator P, which has its elements given in the question. I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0 at time t.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. The possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probabilities are calculated based on the eigenvectors.

So the observable P is given, and I need to find the probability of getting 0 when P is measured. That means I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of matrix P.

Wait, but wait. How exactly do I proceed? Let me outline the steps I think I need to take.

1. **Find the eigenvalues of matrix P.** Because the possible results are the eigenvalues. I'm looking for the eigenvalue 0, so if 0 is an eigenvalue, I need to find the corresponding eigenvector.

2. **Normalize the eigenvectors if necessary.** Because the state vector must be normalized if we're calculating probabilities.

3. **Express the given state as a linear combination of the eigenvectors.** Because the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

But wait, matrix P is given. Let me write it out first. So, P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). 

Let me write that down:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Wait, is this matrix symmetric? Let's see. The element (1,2) is 1/√2, and (2,1) is also 1/√2. (1,3) is 0, (3,1) is 0. (2,3) is 1/√2, and (3,2) is 1/√2. So yes, it's symmetric. Therefore, P is Hermitian, which makes sense because it's an observable.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let's set up the characteristic equation. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λ I) = 0.

So, the matrix (P - λ I) would be:

[
[-λ, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, -λ]
]

The determinant of this matrix must be zero.

Calculating the determinant... Hmm, this might be a bit involved. Let me see if there's a smarter way. Maybe I can find the eigenvalues by other means, like noticing patterns or symmetries.

Alternatively, perhaps P can be written as a tensor product or in a block form. Or perhaps it's easier to look for eigenvectors with certain symmetries.

Wait, another approach: since P is a symmetric matrix, its eigenvectors are orthogonal, and the sum of the probabilities will be 1.

Another thought: Suppose I guess that the eigenvectors have some simple form. For example, maybe the state (1,0,1) is an eigenvector. Let me test that.

Let me multiply P with this vector [1, 0, 1]^T.

P * [1; 0; 1] = [ (0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*1), ( (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*1 ), (0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*1) ].

Wait, let me compute each component:

First component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*1 = 0.

Second component: (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*1 = (1/√2) + (1/√2) = 2/√2 = √2.

Third component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*1 = 0.

So the result is [0, √2, 0]^T. Which is √2 times the original vector [1, 0, 1]^T. So this implies that [1,0,1]^T is an eigenvector with eigenvalue √2.

Wait, but that's not zero. So for eigenvalue 0, I need to find vectors v such that P v = 0.

So I need to solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the system of equations is:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

(1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (v1 + v3)/√2 = 0 → v1 = -v3.

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → again v2=0.

So the conditions are:

v2 = 0,

v1 = -v3.

So the general solution is any vector of the form (a, 0, -a), where a is a real number. So the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are all scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1).

So the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1).

Wait, but that can't be right. Because a matrix of size 3x3, if it's symmetric, should have three real eigenvalues. So perhaps the eigenvalues are √2 (with multiplicity 1), and 0 (with multiplicity 1?), but wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, when I found [1,0,1]^T as an eigenvector with eigenvalue √2. Hmm, perhaps I should compute the determinant to find all eigenvalues.

Let me compute det(P - λ I) = 0.

The matrix is:

[
-λ, 1/√2, 0
1/√2, -λ, 1/√2
0, 1/√2, -λ
]

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)*(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) -0 ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps expanding along the first row.

So determinant = (-λ) * det(minor of -λ) - (1/√2) * det(minor of 1/√2) + 0
