Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. Hmm, I remember that IUPAC naming can get a bit tricky, especially with multiple substituents and their positions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says the benzene has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. Wait, meta means they're separated by one carbon in between? So each is two positions away from the other. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so if they're all meta, their positions must be arranged so that each is opposite the next. Let me visualize this.

Let me imagine numbering the benzene ring. Let's start by assigning the carboxylic acid as position 1. Then, since the other two substituents (carbaldehyde and cyano) are meta to it, they should be in positions 3 and 5. Wait, but wait, the question says all three are meta to each other. So if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then carbaldehyde would be at position 3, and cyano at position 5. But wait, that's only if each is meta to each other. Alternatively, maybe they are arranged such that each substituent is meta to the others. So 1, 3, 5 positions? But that's possible only if all three are in positions that are meta to each other. Wait, but in a benzene ring, three substituents can't all be meta to each other because that would require each to be two positions apart from the others. Wait, let me think. For example, if substituent A is at position 1, substituent B at position 3, substituent C at position 5. Then each is two positions apart from the othersâ€”so that's meta. So that's possible. So the three substituents (COOH, CHO, CN) are in positions 1, 3, and 5.

But wait, the question says the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to each other. So maybe each substituent is meta to another. So the initial arrangement might be that the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the carbaldehyde is at position 3 (meta to CO
