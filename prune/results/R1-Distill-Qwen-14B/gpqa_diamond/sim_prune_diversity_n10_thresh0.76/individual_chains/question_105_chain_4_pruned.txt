Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack what's being asked.

The question is about a star that's being observed by astronomers. The star has the same radius as the Sun, so Rstar = R_sun. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor, I think, refers to the fraction of the star's surface that's covered by spots. So 20% means 0.2 of the star's surface is spots.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. Hmm, wait, so the spots are cooler or hotter? Since they're dark spots, I'd guess they're cooler. So if the star's Teff is 6000 K, the spots must be at 5000 K? Because 6000-1000 is 5000, right? So spots are 5000 K.

The setup says that the star's brightness variations due to rotation look like those caused by an exoplanet. So the question is, what's the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (Rpl) that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots do, assuming no spots existed.

So the problem is about comparing the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet transiting the star.

Wait, but the question says, "if the star was not covered by spots" â€” so the brightness variation caused by a planet transiting would be the same as the variation due to the spots. So we need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the amplitude of the dip (for the planet) is equal to the amplitude caused by the spots.

Wait, no. The problem says, to produce the same amplitude, what's Rpl/Rstar. So the planet's effect is equal to the spots' effect.

So I need to compute the relative brightness variation caused by the spots and the planet, set them equal, and solve for Rpl/Rstar.

First, let's think about the brightness variation due to the spots. The star is rotating, so as the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then moves away, the observed brightness changes. Since the spots are cooler, when the spots are facing us, the star appears dimmer, and when they're not, it's brighter.

The amplitude of the brightness variation (the depth of the dip) caused by the spots depends on the temperature difference and the area of the spots.

But wait, the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then move away. So the brightness variation would be a dip when the spots are on the side we're looking at.

But the problem says that the brightness variation is due to rotational modulation, which is similar to the effect of a planet transiting. So perhaps we can model the variation in brightness as the star showing more or less of the spotted area.

Alternatively, maybe the variation is when the spots rotate into and out of view, causing a dip in brightness each time. But the exoplanet scenario is when the planet blocks some of the star's light as it
