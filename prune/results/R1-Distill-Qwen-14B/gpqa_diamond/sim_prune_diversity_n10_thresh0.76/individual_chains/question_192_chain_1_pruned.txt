Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, and r is less than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor.

Hmm, point P is outside, so its distance from the conductor's center is L. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. Wait, wait, I think s is the vector pointing from the conductor's center to the cavity's center. So the displacement between the two centers is s, and l is the vector from the cavity's center to point P. The angle between these two vectors is theta. So maybe the displacement from the conductor's center to P is s plus the displacement from the cavity's center to P, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the geometry.

The conductor is initially uncharged, but when you put a charge +q inside the cavity, things change. I remember the concept of electrostatic induction. Since the conductor is conducting, the charges will redistribute. But wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. But when you introduce +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) must have an induced charge. Let me recall: positive charges in the cavity would attract negative charges to the inner surface. Wait, no, wait. If I have a positive charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced negative charge, and the outer surface will have a positive charge. Wait, no, no, maybe the other way around. Wait, the conductor was initially neutral. The charge +q induces a charge on the inner surface. Because the conductor is conducting, the charges will move. The inner surface would have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q then. Because the inner and outer surface charges must add up to zero (
