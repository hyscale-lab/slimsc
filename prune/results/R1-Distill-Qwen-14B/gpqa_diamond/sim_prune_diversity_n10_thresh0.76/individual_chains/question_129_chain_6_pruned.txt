Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions. Let me break it down.

First, the reaction scheme:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints are:
a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different cyclic ketones, so E must be a ketone. Let's think about each step.

Starting with step 1: A + HCN → B. HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. But wait, another possibility is that A is an aldehyde or maybe a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation. So if B has a triple bond, maybe from HCN addition, then it would be hydrogenated. Alternatively, maybe B has a carbonyl that's being reduced. Wait, HCN adds to a carbonyl to form a cyanohydrin (a geminal cyanide). Then, reducing that—like using H2 and a catalyst—would probably break the cyanide group. Wait, when you hydrogenate a cyanide, you get a methylene group. For example, R-CN + H2 → R-CH2. So if B is a cyanohydrin (RC(OH)CN?), maybe upon reduction, the carbonyl becomes a CH2 group, and the CN becomes a CH2 as well? Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another thought: the reduction of a nitrile (RCN) with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically give an amine, but wait, no—actually, nitrile hydrogenation usually produces an amine, but maybe under certain conditions, it can be hydrogenated to an alkane. Or wait, perhaps the reaction isn't on the nitrile but on another group. Hmm, maybe the structure of B is a ketone with another functional group.

Alternatively, perhaps B is an alpha-cyano carbonyl compound. Let me think: When a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So, for example, cyclohexanone would form cyclohexane-1,2-diol cyanide or something. Then, when you reduce that with H2 and Pd, maybe the diol is hydrogenated? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the cyanide group is hydrogenated, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

But let's look at hint a. It says that when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, which form alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. So A must be a ketone, because the Wittig reaction requires a carbonyl group.

So the product of the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let's try to draw that structure. So cyclopentane ring, with substituents at positions 1 and 2 being methyl groups, and at position 4, a propan-2-ylidene group, which is
