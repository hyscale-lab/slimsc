Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it. Let me read the question again.

We have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait, the wave function usually has to satisfy certain conditions, right? Like being square-integrable so that the total probability is 1. Also, the modulus squared of the wave function gives the probability density.

The question says when they measured the position of the particles, none were found at x < 1 or x > 3. So the particle is confined between x=1 and x=3. Hmm, wait, that's interesting because the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, but a wave function can't have an imaginary component like that if it's a real system, or can it? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, wait, perhaps the wave function is actually written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) times e^{-i something}, but the problem says it's (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that seems a bit odd because typically the wave function is a complex function, but when you take the modulus squared, the imaginary parts should contribute in a way that makes the probability real and positive.

Wait a second, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. The wave function is given as a function that has a real part and an imaginary part. So perhaps it's a complex function, like ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (-0.5i), but that seems unusual because usually, the wave function might be a real function or have an exponential (time-dependent) part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written as (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by some complex term, but here the expression is a bit unclear. Wait, looking again: the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. So maybe it's written as the real part a/sqrt(1+x) plus an imaginary part of -0.5i. Hmm, that doesn't make much sense because then the total wave function would have a real component and an imaginary constant component, which would complicate the modulus squared.

Wait, maybe I should double-check. Oh, perhaps the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) * e^{-iφ}, where φ is some phase. But the way it's presented here is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That would mean ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5i). So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when you take the modulus squared, it's |ψ|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + [(-0.5)]^2. Because for a complex number z = x + iy, |z|^2 = x² + y².

Wait, but the problem states that the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. So the probability density must be zero outside this interval. Therefore, the wave function must be zero outside x=1 to x=3. But looking at the given wave function, (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i, how does that behave?

Wait, perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the wave function is zero outside this range, but the given expression only holds within this interval. So the task is to find the normalization constant 'a' such that the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 is equal to 1.

Wait, but the given ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So |ψ(x)|² is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, because (imaginary part is -0.5, squared is 0.25). So the probability density is [a²/(1+x) + 0.25].

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the square of the modulus is the sum of the squares of real and imaginary parts. So for ψ = A + iB, |ψ|² = A² + B².

In this case, A is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B is -0.5, so B² is 0.25. So the probability density is [a²/(1+x) ] + 0.25.

But wait, if the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, then the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must be 1. Because that's the normalization condition.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute that integral.

Breaking it into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to3 + Integral [0.25] dx from 1 to3.

The first integral is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to3.

So a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So the total is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7209.

So a = sqrt(0.7209) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the setup because sometimes the wave function is given in a specific form, and perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the form.

Wait, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, which is correct.

So the integral from 1 to3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx equals 1.

Yes, that's correct.

So the calculation leads to a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a ≈ sqrt(0.7209) ≈ 0.849, which rounds to 0.85. So option B is correct.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is confined between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval equals 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)
2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \)

For the first integral, we use the substitution \( u = 1+x \), so \( du = dx \). The limits of integration change accordingly:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_2^4 \frac{1}{u} du = a^2 \ln(u) \Big|_2^4 = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

For the second integral:

\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Rearranging for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7209 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7209} \approx 0.849
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \( a \approx 0.85 \). Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
