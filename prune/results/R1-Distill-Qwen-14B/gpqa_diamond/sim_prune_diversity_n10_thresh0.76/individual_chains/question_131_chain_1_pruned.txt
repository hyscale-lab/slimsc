Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a reaction involving a dicarboxylic acid and an anhydride, then reacting with a cyclopentadiene derivative. Then, NMR data is given for the products. I need to figure out which two resonances are connected by a NOESY cross-peak in the major product.

First, let me parse the problem. The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has specific NMR spectra. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both C13H16O3.

The NOESY spectrum of the major product has a cross-peak, but the minor doesn't. So, the cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space, meaning they are on adjacent atoms or maybe in a ring structure.

Let me break it down.

First, the anhydride. It's formed from a dicarboxylic acid with cis-alkene. When dicarboxylic acids are dehydrated, they form cyclic anhydrides. So if the original acid has a cis double bond, the anhydride probably has a structure where the two carboxylic groups are connected via an oxygen bridge.

The 1H NMR of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a singlet, I assume. 7 ppm is usually aromatic, but wait, an anhydride would have carbonyl groups but maybe some other protons. Alternatively, maybe an enol or something else. Wait, but the anhydride doesn't have protons on the carbonyl groups. Hmm. Wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak, which suggests maybe a methyl group or some equivalent protons.

Wait, no, 7 ppm is more like alkenyl or aromatic protons, but in an anhydride, maybe the structure has some sort of conjugation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic anhydride where the
