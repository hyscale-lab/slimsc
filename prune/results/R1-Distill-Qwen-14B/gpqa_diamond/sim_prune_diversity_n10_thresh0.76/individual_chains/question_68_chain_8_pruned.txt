Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a spin-1/2 particle. I remember that spin-1/2 particles have their spin aligned in one of two possible states, like electrons. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma multiplied by S_z. So mu = γ S_z, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, I think. 

Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So, the setup changes from a B field along Z to one along Y.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment. So, after the field changes, the average <mu_z> starts oscillating, and we need to find its frequency.

Hmm, I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The energy levels will change, leading to transitions and oscillations in expectation values.

Wait, the magnetic moment is related to the spin. The magnetic moment operator mu is γ times the spin operator S. So, the Hamiltonian in a magnetic field B would be H = -μ·B. Since the magnetic moment is proportional to spin, H = -γ S · B.

But wait, I might have the sign wrong. Oh right, the Hamiltonian is often written as H = -μ·B, but sometimes it's written as H = -γ S · B. Or wait, maybe mu is equal to γ S, so H = -mu · B = -γ S · B. So, the Hamiltonian is proportional to the dot product of S and B.

Initially, the field is along +Z. So the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = -γ B S_z. Then, the field is turned off, and a new field along Y is turned on. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -γ B S_y.

Wait, but when the field is turned off and then on, does the spin state change? Because after the field is turned off, the spin state would no longer have a preferred direction, but wait, the spin state is a quantum state. So, when the field is on, the spin precesses around the field direction. When the field is turned off, the state doesn't change instantaneously, but the dynamics change.

Wait, actually, when the field is suddenly switched, the spin state should remain the same, but the time evolution is now governed by the new Hamiltonian.

So, the initial state is an eigenstate of H_initial. Let me think about that. Since H_initial is diagonal in the S_z basis. So the initial state is |+z> or |–z>?

Wait, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the initial magnetic field along +Z. So if the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, then when the field is along +Z, the magnetic moment aligns, meaning the spin is in the +z direction, so S_z is (ħ/2) times something. Wait, for spin-
