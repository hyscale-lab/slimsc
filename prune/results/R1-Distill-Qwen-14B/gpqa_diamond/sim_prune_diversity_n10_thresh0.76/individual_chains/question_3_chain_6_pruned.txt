Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition of 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z +5σ_x. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the state vector and the operator. For an operator A, the expectation value ⟨A⟩ is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩.

So, the operator here is 10σ_z +5σ_x. Maybe I can compute the expectation value for each part separately and then add them up. That makes sense because expectation values are linear. So, ⟨10σ_z +5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩.

I think I should first find ⟨σ_z⟩ and ⟨σ_x⟩ separately. 

Wait, since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, the expectation value of σ_z should be straightforward. Because any state that's a linear combination of eigenstates would have an expectation value based on their coefficients squared multiplied by the eigenvalues.

Right, for σ_z, the eigenvalues for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are +1 and -1 respectively. So, if the state is a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, then ⟨σ_z⟩ = |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1).

In this case, the state is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let's compute the coefficients. The coefficient a is 0.5, and b is sqrt(3)/2. So |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2. Let me compute that: (sqrt(3))^2 is 3, divided by 4 is 0.75. So, |b|^2 is 0.75.

So ⟨σ_z⟩ = 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. 

Wait, that seems right. So the expectation for σ_z is -0.5. Then, 10⟨σ_z⟩ = 10*(-0.5) = -5.0.

Now, onto ⟨σ_x⟩. Hmm, σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, right? Its expectation value might be a bit trickier because it's not diagonal in the σ_z basis. I think we'll have to compute it using the state.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, in the σ_z basis (which is the same as the computational basis here), the operator σ_x swaps the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ states. So, to find ⟨σ_x⟩, I'll need to calculate ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So, the bra vector is 0.5⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)⟨↓|.

So, let's write this out:

⟨σ_x⟩ = [0.5 ⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↓| ] * σ_x * [0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩ ]

But σ_x acting on |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, and σ_x acting on |↓⟩ is |↑⟩. Let me compute this step by step.

Expanding the terms:

= 0.5 * 0.5 * ⟨↑| σ_x |↑⟩ + 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↑|σ_x |↓⟩ 
+ (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 ⟨↓| σ_x |↑⟩ 
+ (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↓| σ_x |↓⟩.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute each term.

Because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], when you apply σ_x to |↑⟩ (which is [1;0]), you get [0 1;1 0][1;0] = [0;1] = |↓⟩.

Similarly, σ_x |↓⟩ is |↑⟩.

So:

Compute ψ' = σ_x |ψ⟩.
