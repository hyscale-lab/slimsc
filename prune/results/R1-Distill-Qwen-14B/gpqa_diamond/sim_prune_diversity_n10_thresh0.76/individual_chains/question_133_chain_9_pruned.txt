Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the question is asking. 

The problem states that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate. 

I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH of the solution. Since we're dealing with two different phosphate salts, they must be contributing to the various species of phosphate ions in the solution. 

The question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO4^2- or maybe H2PO4^-? Wait, no. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, which is PO4^3-, right? Or wait, orthophosphate is actually H3PO4, but when it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and finally PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So the orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-.

But wait, the problem is asking for orthophosphate ions. So I'm looking for [PO4^3-] in the solution.

The next thing I think about is the buffer solution concept. Since we're adding a weak acid and its conjugate base, or maybe two different salts that form a buffer. Let me think: KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K+ H2PO4^-. When dissolved in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. On the other hand, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2 HPO4·2H2O, which dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from
