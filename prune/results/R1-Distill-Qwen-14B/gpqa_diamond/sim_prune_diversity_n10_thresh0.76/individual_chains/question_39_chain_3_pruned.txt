Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the normalization constant 'a' for a given wave function. 

The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's interesting because it's a complex function. But then again, wave functions can be complex, right? So each particle is in a system where it's confined between x=1 and x=3. Because when they measured the position, particles were only found between 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval, but in this case, the function is given as non-zero between 1 and 3.

Wait, no, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But the problem states that when measuring position, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So that implies that the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3, and non-zero between 1 and3. So the given wave function must be valid between 1 and3, and zero elsewhere. 

But wait, the way the wave function is written here seems to be a function of x. Hmm. So the function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that would be the expression for the wave function ψ(x). But since ψ is a complex function, that's okay. 

But for normalization, the integral of the absolute square of ψ(x) over all space should equal 1. So ∫|ψ(x)|² dx from x=-infty to x=infty equals 1. But since ψ is zero outside 1 and 3, the integral becomes from 1 to 3.

So ψ(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x) - 0.5i for x between 1 and3. Elsewhere, ψ is zero. 

Wait, but wait a second, let me check. Because the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, but I'm not sure if that's correctly written. Because usually, the wave function is a function that can have real and
