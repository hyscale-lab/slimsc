Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N. Oh right, |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, I remember. Coherent states are Gaussian states, right? So when you have a superposition of two coherent states, the resulting state might be non-Gaussian. That makes sense because the Schrödinger cat state is a classic example of a non-Gaussian state.

The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha^2)). Let me write that down: N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) e^(-2 alpha²)). So when phi is pi/4, sin(2phi) is sin(pi/2) which is 1, but here phi is -pi/4. So let me compute sin(2*(-pi/4)) = sin(-pi/2) which is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1 here.

Wait, but the N expression is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) e^(-2 alpha²)). Let me plug in phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

So alpha is 0.5, so alpha squared is 0.25. Then 2 alpha² is 0.5. So e^(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065.

So sin(2phi) is -1. So the expression inside the sqrt becomes 1 + (-1) * 0.6065 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. Then N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627.

So N is about 0.627.

Now, the state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. Let's compute cos(phi) and sin(phi) with phi = -pi/4.

Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So the state becomes (0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ) / 0.627.

Wait, so it's (0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ) divided by approximately 0.627. That simplifies to approximately (0.7071/0.627) times (|0.5> - |-0.5> ), but perhaps I should just write the coefficients as they are.

But wait, maybe I can compute the coefficients more accurately. Let me compute 0.7071 / 0.627. Let's see, 0.7071 divided by 0.627 is approximately 1.127. So the state is approximately [1.127 (|0.5> - |-0.5> ) ].

But wait, let me double-check. 0.7071 / 0.627. Let me calculate that: 0.7071 / 0.627 ≈ 1.127.

But wait, maybe I should carry out the exact calculation. Let's compute N exactly. N^2 = 1 + sin(2phi) e^(-2 alpha^2). With phi = -pi/4, sin(2phi) = -1, and alpha=0.5, so 2 alpha² = 0.5. So e^(-0.5) is approximately 0.60653066.

So N^2
