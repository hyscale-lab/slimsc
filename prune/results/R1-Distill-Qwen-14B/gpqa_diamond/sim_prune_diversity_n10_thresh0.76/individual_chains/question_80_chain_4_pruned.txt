Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out what value the algorithm gives for the input ACAGTGACC based on the examples provided. The examples are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably look for a pattern or a rule that the algorithm is applying. The outputs are 115 and 176 for the given inputs, so I need to find a way to relate the DNA sequences to these numbers.

Let me write down the inputs and outputs:

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

Wait, so AGG is a 3-letter DNA sequence. Maybe each letter is converted into a number, and then summed or multiplied or something like that. Let's see.

AGG has A, G, G. TGCTGA has T, G, C, T, G, A. So maybe each nucleotide is assigned a value, and the total is the sum of those values.

What's the numeric value for each nucleotide? Let's list possible values:

A, T, C, G. Maybe A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4? Or something like that. Let's test this with the first example.

AGG: A=1, G=4, G=4. Sum would be 1+4+4=9. But the output is 115. So that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe each nucleotide contributes more than just 1,2,3,4.

Wait another thought: Maybe the position in the DNA string matters. Like, each position is weighted differently. For example, first position is multiplied by 1, second by 10, third by 100, etc. But let's try that.

Take AGG: A is first, G second, G third. So if each letter's value is multiplied by 10^n where n is the position (starting from 0?), let's see.

Wait, AGG has three letters. Let's assume each letter is assigned a value of 1 for A, 2 for T, 3 for C, 4 for G. Let me try:

AGG: A=1, G=4, G=4. So 1*100 + 4*10 +4*1 = 100+40+4=144. But the output is 115. Hmm, doesn't match.

Maybe the weighting is different. Alternatively, perhaps the values are based on the actual letters' positions in the alphabet. A is 1, T is 20, C is 3, G is 7. But wait, A is 1, T is 20, C is 3, G is 7.

Let me test this for AGG: 1 + 7 +7 =15. Not 115. So that's not it either.

Alternative approach:
