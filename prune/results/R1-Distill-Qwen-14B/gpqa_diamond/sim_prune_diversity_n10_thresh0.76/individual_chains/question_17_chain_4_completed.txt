Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium. The pH is ideal, which probably means all the EDTA is in the right form to bind Ca²+.

The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5×10^10. Wait, K is the formation constant, right? So the formation constant (Kf) tells us how strong the complex is. A large K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

The question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So, I think this involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let me write down the reaction. The complex is CaY²−, where Y is EDTA. So the dissociation would be:

CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4−

The formation constant Kf is given by [Ca²+][Y^4−]/[CaY²−]. Since K is very large, the concentration of the complex [CaY²−] should be almost equal to the initial concentration, because not much dissociates. Wait, wait, no. Because Kf is large, the products (Ca²+ and Y^4−) are favored. Wait, no, Kf is the formation of the complex, so the complex is more stable, so the dissociation is not favored. So the dissociation constant Kd would be 1/Kf, which is very small, meaning dissociation doesn't happen much.

So, in the solution, the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be very low. Because the complex doesn't dissociate much, so [Ca²+] is small.

Let me think about the setup. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. Then, [Ca²+] = x, [Y^4−] = x, and [CaY²−] ≈ 0.02 - x. But since K is so large (5e10), x will be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the expression for Kd (dissociation constant) is Kd = [Ca²+][Y^4−]/[CaY²−] = x² / 0.02

But wait, Kd is 1/Kf, which is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So setting up the equation: x² / 0.02 = 2e-11

Multiplying both sides by 0.02: x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

Taking the square root: x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5? Let me calculate that. 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. Square root of 4 is 2, square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, so that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the approach. Because sometimes in such problems, people get confused between Kf and Kd. Let me make sure I got that right. The formation constant is Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−}) So Kf is 5e10. So when the complex dissociates, the dissociation constant Kd is 1/Kf, which is 2e-11. So yes, that part is correct.

So the calculation goes: x² = (Kd) * [CaY²−] = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 10^(-6.5) = approximately 6.32e-7, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions that dissociate. At equilibrium:
- \([Ca^{2+}] = x\),
- \([Y^{4-}] = x\),
- \([CaY^{2-}] \approx 0.02 - x \approx 0.02\) (since \( x \) is very small compared to 0.02).

The expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[CaY^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.02} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
