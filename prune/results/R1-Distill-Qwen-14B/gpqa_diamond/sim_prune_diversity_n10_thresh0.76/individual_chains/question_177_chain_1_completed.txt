Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the luminosities of two stars. Let me read it through again.

Alright, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times bigger. Interesting, but I'm not sure yet how mass factors into this. The question is about luminosity, which I think relates more to radius and temperature. 

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. So, I remember something about Wien's Law here. Wien's displacement law says that the wavelength of maximum emission is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody. The formula is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Oh, because if lambda_max is the same, then T is the same. So both stars have the same temperature?

Wait, but wait. I think that's only if we're assuming they're perfect blackbodies, which the question says. So yes, same temperature.

Hmm, but wait, if the masses are the same ratio as the radii, maybe that's a clue about their densities or something else. But for luminosity, I think the main factors are radius and temperature. Because luminosity L of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Since both stars have the same T, as we determined from the same lambda_max, then the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, the (T1/T2)^4 factor is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Squaring that gives (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is 2.25. But wait, let's look at the options.

Option A is ~2.25, option D is ~2.23. Hmm, but wait, maybe there's more to it. Did I miss something?

Wait, the problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, Doppler shift. The star moving towards us would have its light blueshifted, and moving away would be redshifted. But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. So, their rest wavelengths are the same? Or their observed wavelengths are the same?

Wait, the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, if there's a Doppler shift due to radial velocity, that would affect the observed wavelength. So I think I need to factor that in.

Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength. For Star_2, which is moving at 700 km/s, its observed wavelength is either longer or shorter, depending on the direction. Let's think about the Doppler effect formula for light.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, actually, wait, the relativistic Doppler shift is a bit more precise. For non-relativistic speeds, the approximation is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is positive if moving away (redshift) and negative if moving towards (blueshift). Or is it the other way around? Let me think again. If a star is moving away, the wavelength increases (redshift), so the observed lambda is longer. So if v is positive for moving away, then lambda increases. So the formula is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) for transverse Doppler, but for radial, maybe it's (1 + v_r / c) when v_r is positive for moving away.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula. Let me recall: the relativistic Doppler shift formula is (lambda_observed / lambda_rest) = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, no, I think that's for transverse Doppler. For radial, the formula is (1 + v_r / c), but only when v is much less than c, so the approximation holds. Since 700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light (c is about 3e5 km/s), which is small, so maybe the approximation holds.

Wait, but wait. Let's clarify. The Doppler effect for wavelength when moving directly towards or away is given by:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c )

But wait, some sources say it's (1 + z) = (1 + v_r / c), where z is the redshift. Wait, actually, no. Wait, the Doppler formula is:

If a source is moving away at velocity v, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c) for v << c.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get the formula right. The formula for the Doppler shift when the source is moving away is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is positive for moving away.

So, in this problem, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But the problem doesn't specify the direction. Hmm, but the problem says that the observed brightest wavelengths are the same. So, for Star_1, which has v_r = 0, lambda1_obs = lambda1_rest. For Star_2, lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c ), where v_r2 is 700 km/s, but wait, wait: if the star is approaching us, v_r would be negative, and moving away positive. But the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Wait, radial velocity is typically measured as the component along the line of sight. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, that could be positive (moving away) or negative (moving towards). But the problem doesn't specify direction. Hmm, but since the observed lambda_max is the same for both, let me think.

Star_1 has v_r =0, so lambda_max1 = lambda1_rest. Star_2 has v_r =700 km/s. Let's assume that it's moving away, so v_r is positive. So lambda_max2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c ). And since lambda_max1 = lambda_max2_obs, lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c).

But from Wien's law, lambda1_rest = b / T1, and lambda2_rest = b / T2. So if lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest, then T1 = T2. But wait, that's only if (1 + v_r2/c) is 1, which would require v_r2=0. But in our case, Star_2 has a radial velocity, so its observed lambda_max is shifted.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me approach this step by step.

We have:

lambda_max_obs (Star 1) = lambda1_rest.

lambda_max_obs (Star 2) = lambda2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c).

And the problem states that these two observed wavelengths are the same. So:

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c).

But from Wien's law, lambda_rest is inversely proportional to temperature. So, lambda1_rest = b / T1, lambda2_rest = b / T2.

Thus:

b/(T1) = (b/(T2)) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Canceling b and rearranging:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2 / c )

Wait, so T1 is lower than T2 because (1 + v_r2/c) is greater than 1, so denominator is bigger. But wait, that would make T1 smaller than T2, but earlier I thought that both stars have the same temperature because they have the same observed lambda_max. Hmm, this is a contradiction.

Wait, no, because the observed lambda_max is same, but the rest wavelengths are different because of the Doppler shift.

Wait, let me clarify:

Star_1: lambda_max_obs = lambda1_rest.

Star_2: lambda_max_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c).

And the problem states that these are equal, so:

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c )

But from Wien's Law, lambda_rest = b/T. So for Star_1, lambda1_rest = b/T1. For Star_2, lambda2_rest = b/T2.

So substituting:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, that seems confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I should write it as:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Which would mean that T1 is lower than T2 if v_r2 is positive (since 1 + v/c is greater than 1). But we assumed both stars have the same observed lambda_max, which implies, after considering Doppler shift, that their rest wavelengths are different, hence their temperatures are different.

Wait, but I thought that the observed lambda_max is same, so the rest lambda_max might be different because of Doppler shift. So the temperatures might not be same? That complicates things because earlier I thought T1 = T2, but that's only if the Doppler shift doesn't apply. But since Star_2 is moving, the observed lambda_max is shifted, so their rest lambda_max must be different, leading to different T.

So, perhaps I was wrong earlier to assume that T1 = T2. Hmm.

So, I need to reevaluate.

The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same. So, for Star_1, which has v_r = 0, lambda1_obs = lambda1_rest. For Star_2, lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c ). And lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs.

So, lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c )

But from Wien's law, lambda_rest is b/T. So:

lambda1_rest = (b)/(T1 )
lambda2_rest = (b)/(T2 )

So, (b/T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So, T2 is higher than T1 because (1 + v_r2/c ) is greater than 1. Because v_r2 is 700 km/s, which is positive (assuming it's moving away), so (1 + 700/(3e5)) ≈ 1 + 0.002333 ≈ 1.002333.

So, T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So, Star_2 is slightly hotter than Star_1.

Okay, now I have to find the luminosity ratio L1/L2.

Luminosity is given by Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So, L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

The ratio L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Now, (T1 / T2 )^4 = (T1 / (T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )) )^4 = (1/(1 + v_r2/c ))^4.

Which is 1/(1 + 0.7e3/(3e5))^4.

Wait, 700,000 m/s? Wait, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. c is 3e5 km/s, which is 3e8 m/s. Wait, no, wait. 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. c is 299,792,458 m/s, approximately 3e8 m/s.

Wait, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. So 700,000 / (3e8) = approximately 0.002333...

So, (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 1.002333.

So, [1/(1.002333)]^4 ≈ (0.997677)^4.

Let me calculate that. 0.997677^4.

Calculating step by step:

0.997677 squared is approximately (1 - 0.002323)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002323 + (0.002323)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.004646 + 0.000005 ≈ 0.995359.

Then, square that again for the fourth power: (0.995359)^2 ≈ 0.99075.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it more accurately.

But perhaps using the approximation for small x: (1/(1+x))^n ≈ 1 - n x, when x is small.

Here, x is 0.002333, n=4.

So, (1/(1.002333))^4 ≈ (1 - 0.002333)^4 ≈ 1 - 4*0.002333 + (6*(0.002333)^2) - ... 

But for small x, higher terms are negligible. So, approximately:

1 - 4*(0.002333) = 1 - 0.009332 ≈ 0.990668.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.990668.

So, L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.990668) ≈ 2.25 * 0.990668 ≈ approx 2.2265.

Wait, 2.25 * 0.990668 = Let me compute 2.25 *0.99 = 2.2275, and 2.25 * 0.000668= approx 0.001497. So total ≈ 2.228997.

Wait, but wait, maybe it's better to compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1.002333 is 1 + 700/(3e5) = 1 + 700/300,000 = 1 + 0.002333... So, 1/(1.002333) ≈ 0.997677.

So, (0.997677)^4.

Let me compute 0.997677^2 first:

0.997677 * 0.997677.

= (1 - 0.002323)^2.

= 1 - 2*0.002323 + (0.002323)^2.

= 1 - 0.004646 + 0.00000539.

= approximately 0.99535939.

Now, square that to get it to the 4th power.

(0.99535939)^2.

= (1 - 0.00464061)^2.

= 1 - 2*0.00464061 + (0.00464061)^2.

= 1 - 0.00928122 + 0.00002154.

= approximately 0.99074032.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = (0.997677)^4 ≈ 0.99074.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99074 ≈ 2.2272.

So, approximately 2.227. Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is very close.

Wait, the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23.

So, 2.227 is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that without considering the Doppler shift, it would be 2.25, but taking into account the Doppler, it's a little less, around 2.23.

So the correct answer would be D) ~2.23.

But wait, wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the Doppler shift consideration? Because I assumed that the observed lambda_max of Star_2 is longer (since v is positive), but what if it's moving towards us, making v negative? Then (1 + v/c) would be less than 1, making lambda_obs shorter. But since lambda_obs is same for both stars, that would imply that Star_2's rest lambda is longer than Star_1's.

Wait, let me think. If Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed lambda_max would be shorter than its rest wavelength because of blueshift.

But the problem says that the observed lambda_max is the same for both stars. So, Star_1's lambda_rest is the same as Star_2's observed lambda.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving towards us, then its observed lambda would be shorter than its rest lambda. So, lambda_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v_r/c ), where v_r is negative (if moving towards us). So, (1 + v_r/c ) would be less than 1, making lambda_obs smaller than lambda2_rest.

So, for Star_1, lambda1_obs = lambda1_rest.

For Star_2, lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c ) = lambda1_obs.

So, lambda2_rest = lambda1_obs / (1 + v_r2/c )

But v_r2 is negative if moving towards. For example, if v_r2 is -700 km/s (moving towards us), then (1 + v_r2/c ) is (1 - 700e3 / 3e5 ) = (1 - 0.002333) = 0.997667.

So, lambda2_rest = lambda1_rest / 0.997667.

Which is larger than lambda1_rest. Because dividing by a number less than 1 makes the value larger.

So, lambda2_rest is longer than lambda1_rest. Which implies that T2 = b / lambda2_rest is lower than T1.

Wait, but that contradicts our earlier conclusion. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it from another angle.

Let me consider that the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same. So, lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2.

For Star_1, since v_r1=0, lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1.

For Star_2, lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Setting them equal:

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But from Wien's law, lambda_rest = b / T.

So:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Rearranged:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So, T2 is higher than T1 if v_r2 is positive (moving away), or lower if v_r2 is negative (moving towards).

Wait, but in the problem, the radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s. The problem doesn't specify direction, just says 700 km/s. So is it moving away or towards?

Ah, but the problem says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So, it's possible that Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700 km/s (moving away), or -700 km/s (moving towards). But in either case, let's see what happens.

Case 1: Star_2 moving away (v_r2 = +700 km/s)

Then, from the equation, T2 = T1 * (1 + 700e3/(3e5) ) ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

Which makes T2 higher than T1.

So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1 / T2 )^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1 / 1.002333 )^4 ≈ 2.25 * (0.9907) ≈ ~2.227.

Case 2: Star_2 moving towards us (v_r2 = -700 km/s)

Then, T2 = T1 * (1 - 700e3/(3e5) ) ≈ T1 * 0.997667.

So, T2 is lower than T1. Then,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (1 / 0.997667 )^4.

Compute 1/0.997667 ≈ 1.00234.

So, (1.00234)^4 ≈ approximately 1.0094.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.272.

Which option is that? Looking at the options, the closest would be B) ~2.32 or C) ~2.35. But 2.27 is closer to 2.27, but none of the options match. So perhaps the initial assumption is that Star_2 is moving away, leading to a lower L1/L2 ratio.

Wait, but the problem says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. It doesn't specify the direction, but usually radial velocity is given as a signed value, where positive is moving away, negative is moving towards. But in the problem, it just says 700 km/s, which might imply it's moving away.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering the direction of the radial velocity, and that the Doppler shift doesn't affect the calculation because the observed lambda_max is same. But that's not the case because the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the Doppler shift's effect is negligible because 700 km/s is small compared to the speed of light. Let me calculate the percentage: 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333, which is 0.2333%. So, Doppler shift would cause a small change in observed wavelength. Therefore, the temperature ratio is approximately 1.002333.

But in the previous calculation, when considering the Doppler shift, the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.227, which is option D.

But wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift, assuming that the velocities are negligible, and thus the luminosity ratio is 2.25, which would be option A. But that seems incorrect because the problem does provide the velocity and says that the observed lambda_max is same.

Wait, but the problem says that the stars' observed brightness peaks are at the same wavelength. That implies that after considering their motion, their observed lambda_max is same. Thus, the Doppler shift must be accounted for.

Therefore, the correct approach is to include the Doppler shift, leading to a luminosity ratio of approximately 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity \( L \) of a star is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature. The problem provides the following information:

1. **Radius Ratio**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), so \( \frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \).
2. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, implying that the Doppler shift must be accounted for when determining the rest wavelengths and temperatures.
3. **Wien's Law**: The peak wavelength of emission is inversely proportional to the temperature, \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( b \) is Wien's constant. The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by the Doppler shift formula:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v_r / c),
   \]
   where \( v_r \) is the radial velocity and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Relating Rest Wavelengths and Temperatures
Since the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars:
\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v_r / c).
\]
Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T} \), we substitute:
\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot (1 + v_r / c).
\]
Canceling \( b \) and rearranging:
\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_r / c).
\]
For Star_2, \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), so:
\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left(1 + \frac{700}{300,000}\right) \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333.
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4.
\]
Substituting \( \frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \) and \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \):
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4.
\]
First, calculate \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \). Next, calculate \( \left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4 \). Using the approximation \( (1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x \) for small \( x \), where \( x = 0.002333 \):
\[
\left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4 \approx 1 - 4 \cdot 0.002333 \approx 0.9907.
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.227.
\]

### Step 3: Closest Option
The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately \( 2.227 \), which matches option **D (~2.23)**.

ANSWER: D
