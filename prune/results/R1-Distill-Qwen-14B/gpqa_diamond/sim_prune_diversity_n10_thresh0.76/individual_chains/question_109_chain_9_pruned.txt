Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let's read the question again to make sure I get the details right.

So, we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I need to find which partial wave is not permitted, considering both angular momentum and parity conservation.

Wait, the options are all different transitions, right? Each option shows the initial state, then the final state plus the emitted particle. For example, option A is 1S0 -> 7D1 + p.

First, I should probably figure out what each part of the term symbol means. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), where S is total spin, L is orbital angular momentum, and J is total angular momentum.

The initial state is 1S0. So, 1S0: the 2S+1 is 1, meaning S=0. L is S, but no, wait, L is the orbital part. Wait, 1S0: the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 means S=0, L=0 (since it's S), and J=0? Because for a state with S=0 and L=0, J can only be 0.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is 1S0, so S=0, L=0, J=0. So the NN system has spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0, and total angular momentum 0.

They emit a particle X, so the final state is an NN state plus X. So, I think the total angular momentum and isospin should be conserved.

But wait, the problem is about partial waves, which are about orbital angular momentum. So the term 'partial wave' refers to the orbital angular momentum L of the emitted particle X, I think.

Wait, the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. So each option is a transition where the NN system goes from 1S0 to some state plus emitting X. The partial wave is the L of X.

So, for each option, I need to compute the possible L for X and see if it's allowed.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think step by step.

Let me list the approach:

1. For each option, figure out the initial and final state of the NN system.

2. The initial state is 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0.

3. The final state of the NN system will have some S', L', J'. The emitted particle X has its own angular momentum, which is the same as the orbital angular momentum in the decay (since it's the orbital part that contributes to the partial wave).

Wait, but in emission, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle (X) is the same as the orbital part of the transition, right? So when the NN system emits X, the orbital angular momentum carried away by X is the L of the partial wave.

So, the total angular momentum before and after should be conserved.

But the problem also mentions parity. Since parity is a multiplicative quantum number, we can use parity conservation to find constraints.

So, the initial parity is the parity of the 1S0 state. For a state with orbital angular momentum L, the parity is (-1)^L. So for 1S0, L=0, so parity is (+1).

The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the entire final system (the NN state plus X) must have the same parity as the initial system because parity is conserved in strong interactions (assuming this is a strong decay; though the question doesn't specify, but since it's about Pauli stats and angular momentum, I think it's assuming conservation).

Wait, but parity might not always be conserved, but in this problem, Pauli statistics require certain conditions, but also the conservation of angular momentum and parity is mentioned. So I think we have to consider parity conservation.

So the initial parity is (+1). The final parity would be the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X.

The parity of the NN state after emission is (-1)^{L'}, where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state. And X has parity (-1)^{Lx} * (-1), where Lx is the orbital part of X.

Wait, no. The intrinsic parity of X is given as -1. So the parity of X's state is (-1)^{Lx} * intrinsic parity. So intrinsic parity is -1, so X's parity is (-1)^{Lx} * (-1).

Then, the parity of the entire final system (the NN state and X) is [ (-1)^{L'} ] * [ (-1)^{Lx} * (-1) ].

But wait, the initial system is two nucleons in 1S0 state with parity (+1). So the final total parity should also be (+1), assuming parity is conserved.

So,

[ (-1)^{L'} ] * [ (-1)^{Lx} * (-1) ] = (+1)

So,

(-1)^{L' + Lx} * (-1) = 1

Which can be rewritten as (-1)^{L' + Lx + 1} = 1.

Which implies that L' + Lx +
