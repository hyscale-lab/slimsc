Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, but wait, quantum states are usually represented as vectors with unit length, right? Because the sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1. Let me check: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the vector has a magnitude of sqrt(6). So I probably need to normalize it first. Or maybe the question already accounts for that, but I'll keep that in mind.

The operators for observables P and Q are given as matrices. The matrix for P has elements like (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), then (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, I think I should write that out.

Wait, let me write down matrix P. First row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Second row: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]. Third row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, does this matrix look familiar? It's a symmetric matrix, so that's good for an observable's operator.

Then matrix Q is diagonal: [1, 0, 0], [0,0,0], [0,0,-1]. So Q's eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So if we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

The question asks: what's the probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q after measuring P? Or wait, no, the question says: after measuring P, then measuring Q. So the measurements are in sequence, and we're looking for P's result being 0 and Q's being -1.

Wait, but when you measure an observable in quantum mechanics, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So first, we measure P, which could have several possible outcomes (eigenvalues), each corresponding to a particular eigenvector. For each possible eigenvalue of P, the state collapses to that eigenvector. Then, when measuring Q, the state is in that eigenvector, so we compute the probability of getting each eigenvalue of Q.

So the process is: first find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q.

But wait, P's matrix is a bit more complicated. Let me think about it. Let me write it down again. Matrix P:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]

Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Hmm, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Alternatively, perhaps P is a spin operator or something similar. But maybe it's easier to compute its eigenvalues
