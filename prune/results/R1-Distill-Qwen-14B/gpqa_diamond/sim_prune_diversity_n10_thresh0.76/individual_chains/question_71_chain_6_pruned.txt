Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says there are five exoplanets in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They used the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation, but I don't think that's directly relevant here. The key thing is they're in resonance, which probably means their orbital periods are in a nice ratio, maybe like how Neptune and Pluto are in a 3:2 resonance.

The main question is about the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both have the same albedo, which is the reflectivity. So their albedo doesn't affect the ratio, which simplifies things.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming radiation from the star and the outgoing infrared radiation. The formula, I think, is something like T = T_star * ( ( L / (16 * π² * σ * D²) ) )^(1/4), but wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the inverse square law for radiation. 

Wait, more accurately, the formula for the equilibrium temperature (assuming a blackbody and no atmosphere) is T = T_star * ( R_star / (2 D) )^(1/2), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star the radius, and D the distance from the star. Alternatively, since all the planets are around the same star, their T_star and R_star are the same, so the temperature ratio would depend on the inverse square root of their distances.

But wait, another approach: the formula for equilibrium temperature when you know the orbital periods. Because Kepler's third law relates the period to the distance. The law in astronomical units (AU) and years is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³, but more usefully, P² is proportional to a³ when the mass of the star is constant. So for the same star, a is proportional to P^(2/3).

Wait, that's right. So the distance D (semi-major axis) of each planet is proportional to P^(2/3). So if Planet 2 has a period twice that of Planet 1, then D2 = (2)^(
