Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, for relative speed in relativity, I remember that you can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, wait, because both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So from astronaut 1's frame, what's the speed of astronaut 2?

Wait, no. Wait, the question is about the relative speed. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, then the relative speed of B with respect to A would be (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. u is 0.6c (A's speed from rest frame), v is 0.5c (B's speed from rest frame). So the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)). Simplifying numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7) * 0.1c ≈ 0.014285... c. Wait that's about 0.014285c. Wait, but looking at the options, option C says 0.14c. Hmm, did I mix up u and v? Because the formula is for the relative speed of u
