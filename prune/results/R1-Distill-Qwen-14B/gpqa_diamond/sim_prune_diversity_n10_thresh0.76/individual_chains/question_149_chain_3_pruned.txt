Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The scenario is that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly correct except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is what we expect. So, each peak is about half a proton. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the reason for these duplicate peaks.

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, matching the expected molecule. So what's going on here?

Hmm. Let's think about the possible options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If that's the case, the NMR would probably show the peaks of the precursor as well. But the question says the NMR is consistent except for these two alpha-proton peaks. Plus, the LC-MS would show two peaks with different masses if it's a precursor. But the problem states both have the same mass spectrum, so maybe A isn't the answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so LC-MS would show two peaks of same mass. But in NMR, enantiomers would have identical spectra because the environment is the same for each proton. So if the molecule was a racemic mix, the NMR would not show two separate peaks for the same proton; it would just see a single peak since the environments are identical. So the B option doesn't fit the NMR observation. So probably not B.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what 'double coupling' means. Maybe during the formation of the amide bond, there's some coupling that leads to more splitting. But wait, the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So it's not that each peak is due to coupling with another proton. Maybe it's a different kind of coupling, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps this refers to some kind of isomerism, like cis and trans, but I'm not certain.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR spectra would differ. But the NMR here is almost the same except for these two peaks. Wait, no. If it's a diastereomer mixture, each would have different environments for protons. But why would the same alpha-proton split into two? Unless the diastereomers have that same proton in different environments, so in the mixture, the peaks would split. But wait, the integrals add to 1H, which suggests that each is about 0.5H. If it's a diastereomer mixture, maybe the environment is such that the same proton in each diastereomer has slightly different shifts, leading to two separate peaks. Hmm.

Wait, but how does that explain the LC-MS part? The LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass. Diastereomers have different physical properties but same molecular weight. So they would elute at different times, giving two peaks in LC-MS. And their mass spectra would be the same because same molecular formula. So that fits.

But back to the NMR part. If the crude compound is a mixture of diastereomers, the alpha-proton would have two different environments, so each would appear as a separate peak. But would the integrals add up to 1H? Because each diastereomer would contribute one alpha-proton. So if the mixture is 50:50, each peak would have integral 0.5H, adding to 1H. That makes sense.

But why wouldn't the coupling cause the peaks to split further? Oh, the question says that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So maybe in each case, the splitting is not due to coupling. Alternatively, in each diastereomer, the proton is in a different environment but not coupled to others, leading to two separate singlets. Or perhaps the splitting is due to another reason.

Wait, but what about if the molecule has a double bond or some other structure that allows for different configurations, leading to diastereomers. For example, if there's a stereocenter that's not formed correctly, you could have a mixture of diastereomers. But how would that affect the NMR?

Alternatively, perhaps it's an issue with the synthesis. Maybe during the formation of the amide bond, a double bond formed, leading to cis and trans isomers. But wait, if it's a double bond, that's another possibility. If the amide bond forms with different stereochemistry, leading to E and Z isomers, which are diastereomers.

But wait, in the NMR
