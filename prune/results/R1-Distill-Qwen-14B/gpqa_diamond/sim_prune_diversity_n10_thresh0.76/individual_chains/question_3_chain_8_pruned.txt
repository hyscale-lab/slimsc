Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me think. The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says the particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So the state vector is a combination of the spin-up and spin-down states for the σz operator. And I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz.

The operator we're looking at is 10σz + 5σx. I need to find the expectation value of this operator. Oh right, the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state.

So breaking it down, the expectation value of 10σz +5σx is equal to 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. Because expectation values are linear, so I can separate them.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. The state is a superposition, so I'll compute ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So, the coefficients are 0.5 for |↑⟩ and sqrt(3)/2 for |↓⟩. Let me write this as ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is a*(a)* (eigenvalue for |↑⟩) + b*(b) (eigenvalue for |↓⟩). Because σz acting on |↑⟩ gives +1, and on |↓⟩ gives -1.

So, a^2 * (+1) + b^2 * (-1). Let's compute a^2: (0.5)^2 = 0.25. b^2: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So, 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now, what about ⟨σx⟩? Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which doesn't have |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as eigenstates. Instead, it has eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, but perhaps it's easier to compute it directly using the expectation value formula.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, the operator σx in the computational basis has basis states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. To compute ⟨σx⟩, we can use the formula ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Alternatively, I can represent the state as a vector and compute the matrix product. Let me write ψ as a column vector. Assuming |↑⟩ is [1; 0], and |↓⟩ is [0; 1], then ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So, ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, σx|ψ⟩ is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the dot product of ψ and σx|ψ⟩. Wait, no. Actually, ψ is a column vector, and ⟨ψ| is a row vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So the expectation value is ψ† σx ψ. Which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute σx multiplied by ψ:

σx ψ = [ (0)(0.5) + (1)(sqrt(3)/2), (1)(0.5) + (0)(sqrt(3)/2) ]^T
= [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ]^T.

Then, ψ† (σx ψ) is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ].

So, the dot product is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5).

Calculating that: 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3))/4. The second term is the same, so together it's (sqrt(3))/4 + (sqrt(3))/4 = (sqrt(3))/2.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. Oh, no, wait. The σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so the product σx ψ is [0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2) ]^T which is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So the dot product is (0.5)(
