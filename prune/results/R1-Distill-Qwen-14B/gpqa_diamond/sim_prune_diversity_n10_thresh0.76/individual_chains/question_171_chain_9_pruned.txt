Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, I need to figure out the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for six different substances when they react with excess bromine. Let's see, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the directing effects of substituents on the benzene ring determine where the electrophile attacks.

Each of the substances is a benzene ring with a substituent. The substituents are:

1) CH3 (methyl)
2) COOEt (ethyl ester)
3) Cl (chlorine)
4) NO2 (nitro group)
5) C2H5 (ethyl group)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The structures are:

1) C6H5-CH3 → methyl benzene (toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 → phenyl ester, like ethyl benzoate
3) C6H5-Cl → chlorobenzene
4) C6H5-NO2 → nitrobenzene
5) C6H5-C2H5 → ethyl benzene. Oh wait, no, wait: wait, benzene with ethyl group. So, ethylbenzene.
6) C6H5-COOH → benzoic acid.

So, each of these will undergo bromination. The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. Since bromine is in excess, I think that the reaction goes to completion, but for each substitution, the para product's yield fraction is what's important.

Wait, but wait. Electrophilic substitution—the substituents direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to certain positions. For example, activating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2, etc.) are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups are meta directors.

Let me list each substituent and its effect.

1) CH3 (methyl): It's an activating group because it's an alkyl group. Methyl is a strong activating, ortho/para-directing substituent. So, when bromination occurs, the para product will be major, but the ortho is also significant.

2) COOEt (ester group): Esters are deactivating. Wait, ester is an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. So, it's a deactivating, meta-directing substituent. So, the incoming Br would go meta to the ester group.

3) Cl: Chlorine is deactivating because of the electronegativity. It's a meta director. But wait, is Cl an activating or deactivating? Oh, wait: the chlorine atom has a lone pair, so it can donate some electrons through resonance? Or is it more about inductive effect? Oh right, Cl is ortho/para directing but deactivating because the inductive effect (withdrawing electrons) is stronger than the resonance donating. Wait, no, wait: wait, when the substituent has lone pairs, like -O- groups, they can donate through resonance. But Cl is attached via sigma bond, so the resonance is limited.
