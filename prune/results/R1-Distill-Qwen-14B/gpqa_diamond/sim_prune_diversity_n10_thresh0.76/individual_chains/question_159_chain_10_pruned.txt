Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and comoving distances, which is a bit over my head, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question says.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and below that, the flux drops a lot. So the peak is at around 790 nm, which is in the near infrared. I remember that the peak wavelength of emission can sometimes relate to redshift because of the expansion of the universe. Oh wait, maybe it's about the Lyman-alpha emission or something else? Or perhaps it's about the emission lines shifting into the infrared due to redshift.

Wait, no. The peak in the spectrum could be due to the quasar's own emission, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about the Lyman-alpha forest or something else. Hmm... but the key here might be the flux drop at shorter wavelengths. That suggests that the observed spectrum is being cut off because the wavelengths are being stretched beyond what we can observe. Or perhaps the quasar's emission lines are moving into the infrared.

Wait, quasars are very bright and emit across the spectrum. The peak at 790 nm is in the near infrared, so in terms of rest frame, what would that correspond to? Because if the quasar is at some redshift z, then the observed wavelength λ_obs is λ_rest * (1 + z). So if the peak is at 790 nm, maybe the rest wavelength is shorter. For example, if the rest wavelength was in the optical or UV.

Wait, let's think about the rest frame emission. Suppose the quasar emits a peak at a certain wavelength, say, in the UV. If the universe is expanding, that wavelength is stretched. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then the rest wavelength λ_rest would be 790/(1+z). But wait, if the flux drops at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm, that could be because below that, the quasar's emission is not reaching us. Maybe because the wavelength is too redshifted? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the emission line we're seeing is shifted into the near infrared. For example, the Lyman-alpha line is at 121 nm in the rest frame. If we observe it at 790 nm, then (1+z)=790/121. Let me calculate that. 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.529. So z is about 5.529. That's a high redshift.

Wait, but the question mentions the near infrared and optical spectrum. So maybe the peak is from a certain emission line, like the Lyman-alpha, which is in the UV for the quasar's rest frame. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is in the infrared, that would imply a significant redshift.

Alternatively, if the peak in the spectrum is due to the Balmer series in hydrogen, like H-alpha emission. H-alpha is at about 656 nm. If observed at 790 nm, then (1+z) = 790 /656 ≈ 1.204
