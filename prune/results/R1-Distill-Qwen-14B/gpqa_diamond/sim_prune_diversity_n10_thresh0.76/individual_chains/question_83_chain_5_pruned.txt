Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. Alright, the problem is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, it's a neutralization reaction, right?

The question says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, let me break it down. First, the initial solution after dilution. The initial concentration and volume of acetic acid, and then adding water. Oh right, dilution changes the concentration. So I need to calculate the new concentration after mixing. 

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So initially, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the new volume is 40 cm³. So M2 would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me compute that: 0.05 *20=1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when diluted, its dissociation might change. But I think for the initial pH calculation, it's not necessary unless told otherwise. But wait, the first part is about the pH at 25% titration, not the initial solution. Hmm, okay, maybe I should calculate the equivalence point first. Because for the equivalence point, I need to know how much NaOH is needed.

So, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO-Na+ + H2O. So moles of acetic acid initially: M = moles/volume (L). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 moles.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. The volume needed (V) at equivalence would be moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid. So 0.001 moles = 0.1 M * V → V = 0.01 L → 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question says at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now
