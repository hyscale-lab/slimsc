Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly as expected, except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Both have similar chemical shifts and equal integrals adding up to 1H. So, the integral suggests it's one proton, split into two. But the peaks don't appear to be due to coupling because they've ruled that out based on the coupling pattern. Hmm.

Then the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum as expected for the target molecule. So, same mass but two separate peaks. Wait, same mass usually suggests same molecular weight. But why two peaks then?

Let me look at the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different, right? Because the precursor would have a lower mass than the product. But the question says both peaks have the same mass. So A might not be it.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers would have the same molecular weight, so same mass. In LC-MS, if the column is chiral, it would separate enantiomers, giving two peaks. But if the column is achiral, the enantiomers would elute together. Wait, but the question says the LC-MS was run at elevated temperature. Not sure how that affects it. Also, for achiral columns, you wouldn't see two peaks for enantiomers. But if the column is chiral, they would split. So that's a possibility. But the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. Enantiomers would have identical NMRs, right? Because they're mirror images. So the NMR would show a single peak for each proton. So that can't be the case. Because the NMR has two peaks for the same alpha proton. So B might not explain the NMR. Unless maybe something else is wrong.

Wait, but if the NMR is showing two peaks for the same proton, but the integral is 1H in total. And the peaks are same shift and similar. So if the molecule has some kind of symmetry or perhaps a diastereomer, perhaps
