Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Let me think about the data given and how to parse it.

First, looking at the IR data: there are medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretches, maybe from an amine or amide. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which makes me think of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, ester, amide, or maybe an acyl chloride. But since the options don't include any chlorides, it's probably an ester or amide.

Moving on to the 1H NMR data. The peaks are:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) – that's a triplet, probably from a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons, so maybe it's an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ethoxy group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – a broad singlet for two protons. Broad signals often indicate exchange with protons that are in a different environment, like NH groups. But wait, the integration is 2H. Maybe it's an NH2 group, but I don't see any options with amines. Alternatively, it could be something else like an OCH2 group, but the shift is a bit high for that. Or perhaps it's a neighboring group to an oxygen? Hmm.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) – a quartet, which is two protons. Quartet suggests coupling with two protons on adjacent carbons. So maybe an OCH2CH2O group? Or perhaps a CH2 attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Wait, the 1.20 ppm triplet is a CH2CH3, so maybe the quartet is from a CH2 next to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2O... or maybe OCH2 that's next to another CH2 with two protons.

Then, 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Those are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the protons are split into two doublets. So maybe the aromatic protons are split because of substituents in the para positions.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule has an aromatic ring with substituents at the para positions. Let me look at the options.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide would have a CONH2 group. The ethoxy is at position 3, which is meta. But the NMR shows the aromatic protons as two doublets, implying a para substitution. So that might not fit.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH2. If the ethoxy is at para, then the aromatic protons would be two doublets. That fits. Also, the formamide would have a carbonyl (IR at 1720), and the ethoxy group would have the triplet at 1.20 ppm and a quartet somewhere else. Let me check the NMR shifts.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate would be CH2CH2COO-. The 4-aminophenyl group would have NH2, which could explain the broad peak at 4.0 ppm (but wait, NH2 protons are usually broader and might integrate to 2H). But the NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm for 2H. The propionate might have an ethyl group. Let me see: the 1.20 ppm triplet could be the CH2CH3 of a propionate. Then the quartet at 4.5 could be the OCH2 group from the ester. The aromatic protons would be from the 4-aminophenyl group, which would have two substituents para to each other (NH2 and COOEt). So in that case, the aromatic signals would be two doublets, which fits the NMR data.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. This would be an ester, with the structure OEt attached to the benzoate. The benzoate would have a COOEt group. The 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group in the para position to the ester. Now, the IR would show the ester carbonyl at ~1720 cm-1, which matches. The ethyl group would have the triplet at 1.2 ppm (CH2CH3) and a quartet at around 4.1-4.3 ppm (OCH2CH3). Wait, but the NMR here shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm. Hmm, maybe that's a bit off. Also, the amino group would be NH2, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe that's the NH2. Let's think about that.

Looking back at the IR data: we have strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are N-H stretches. So an amide or amine. So the compound has either NH2 or NH groups.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: 3-Ethoxybenzamide. Structure: benzamide (CONH2) with ethoxy at para position? No, it's meta. Wait, 3-ethoxy would be meta. Then the aromatic protons would not be two doublets. Because in meta substitution, the protons are more complex. So the NMR shows two doublets, which is more likely para substitution. So A is probably not the answer.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is HCONH-Ph-OEt. The formamide has two NH groups, but wait, no. Formamide is HCONH2. So in this case, the NH2 would be attached to the phenyl ring. Wait, no. The structure is HCONH-(4-OEt-phenyl). So the NH2 would be next to the carbonyl. So the NH protons would be around 8-9 ppm as
