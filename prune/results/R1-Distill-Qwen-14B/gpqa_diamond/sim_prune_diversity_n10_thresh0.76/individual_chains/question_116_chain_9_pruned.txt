Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with compound A. Let me break down what each part says.

Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet means each is next to three others.

The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests these are probably methyl groups (since each CH3 has 3 H, so two of them would give 6H). The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H makes me think of two CH2 groups, each with two H. But wait, the quartet comes from each H splitting into four peaks, which usually means each is adjacent to three H. Oh, but wait, when you have two CH2 groups next to each other, like in an ethyl group, the splitting can be more complex. Let me think: in an ethyl group (CH2CH3), the CH2 is next to the CH3. The CH2 H's would split into a quartet because each is next to three H from the adjacent CH3. Yes, that makes sense. So the quartet at 1.3 ppm is probably the CH2 in an ethyl group. Wait, but the integration is 4H, so that would be two sets of CH2 each with 2 H. Or maybe one CH2 attached to another group.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. So the triplet (0.9 ppm, 6H) is probably two CH3 groups, each as a triplet. Each CH3 would be adjacent to a CH2 group. So the structure for A might be something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that would have more H's. Let me count: Each CH3 has 3 H, so two CH3 groups would be 6 H. The quartet is 4 H, which could be two CH2 groups. Wait, if the quartet is from the CH2 next to a CH3, then each of those CH2 H's would be next to the CH3's H. So, maybe the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2 something. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's cyclopropane? No, because cyclopropane would have different splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a neopentyl group or something else.

Wait, another approach: the triplet at 0.9 ppm is 6H. That suggests two equivalent CH3 groups. The quartet at 1.3 is 4H, which could be two CH2 groups. So maybe the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH2X, but maybe it's something else.

Wait, let me think about the splitting again. The triplet for 6H (all are CH3 groups). So each CH3 is adjacent to a CH2 group. So the quartet is from the CH2 groups. Each CH2 is adjacent to a CH3 and another CH2. Wait, but the quartet would then be from each H in the CH2 being next to a CH3. Let me see: when a CH2 is next to a CH3, each H in CH2 would see three H from the CH3, so their splitting would be a quartet. So the structure could be (CH3)2CHCH2CH2- something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a cyclohexane derivative. Let's say A is a cyclohexane with two ethyl groups? No, but cyclohexane's protons are usually around 1.5-2 ppm, so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 2,2-dimethylbutane or something like that. Wait, 2,2-dimethylbutane would be
