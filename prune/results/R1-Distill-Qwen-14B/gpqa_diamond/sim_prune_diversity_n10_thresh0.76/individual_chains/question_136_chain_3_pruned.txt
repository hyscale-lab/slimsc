Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: There's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r² from the origin. So the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I'm supposed to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, right. I remember that divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. Wait, but wait, the question is asking for the volume integral of the divergence, which is the same as the surface integral of the vector field dotted with the normal vector. So maybe I can compute it either way.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute the divergence first and then integrate. Let me think about the divergence in spherical coordinates since the field is radial. Since the field is only radial, the divergence might be simpler.

In spherical coordinates, for a vector field that only has a radial component, say F = F_r(r) e_r, the divergence is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r). So I can use this formula because the other components (theta and phi) are zero.

Given that F(r) = 1/r², so F_r = 1/r². So plugging that into the divergence formula:

∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ), because F_r is 1/r².

Let me compute what's inside the derivative first. r² times (1/r²) is 1. So the expression becomes (1/r²) d/dr (1). The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·F = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin, then the volume integral would be zero. But wait, wait a second. Wait, the vector field given is F(r) = (1/r²) e_r. But that's for r not equal to zero. But I think that field is actually the electric field of a point charge, right? Because Coul
