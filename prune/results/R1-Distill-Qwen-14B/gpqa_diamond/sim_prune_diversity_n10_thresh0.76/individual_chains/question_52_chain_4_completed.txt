Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star with certain parameters—1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem then talks about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted compared to when it is.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ratio of populations in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two states to the temperature and the energy difference between them.

The Boltzmann equation is usually written as:
n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

Where:
- n is the number of particles in each state,
- g is the statistical weight (degeneracy),
- E is the energy of each level,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature.

The ratio n2/n1 is what we're looking at. The problem says this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower (5500 K instead of 6000 K). But wait, does the temperature we plug into the Boltzmann equation refer to the effective temperature of the star or the temperature of the photosphere where the atoms are?

Wait, the problem states that the stellar photosphere is in LTE, so each region of the photosphere is at local temperature. But when the star has spots, part of the surface is cooler, right? The dark spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So, how does this affect the overall ratio we observe?

Wait a minute, I think the question is simplifying things and perhaps we can model the effective temperature as the average temperature. Or maybe it's considering the change in average temperature and how that affects the ratio.

Wait, no, because the spots cover 40% of the surface. So maybe the observed spectrum is a combination of the spotted and unspotted regions. But wait, the problem says that when the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So perhaps the effective temperature is lower, but the question is about the ratio of populations in the photosphere, which might not be uniform.

Wait, perhaps the star's photosphere is not isothermal, but when the spots are present, the average temperature is lower. Alternatively, perhaps the spots are cooler regions, but the rest of the photosphere remains at 6000 K. So when the star has spots, part of the photosphere is at a lower temperature, affecting the overall ratio. But wait, the Boltzmann ratio depends on the temperature where the absorption lines are formed. If the line is formed in a region that's either in the spot or the normal photosphere, then the ratio would be a combination of the two regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the entire photosphere as if it's at a uniform temperature when spots are present, which is 5500 K. But that might not be accurate. Hmm, the problem states that the effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered. So maybe the overall flux is lower, but the photosphere isn't uniformly 5500 K. The spots are cooler regions, and the rest is 6000 K.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So each part of the photosphere is at its own temperature. But when we observe the star, the line formation in the spots and the non-spots regions would contribute to the total line profile. However, the problem states that the ratio observed decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps the average ratio across the photosphere (with varying temperatures) changes.

But wait, the problem is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. So, perhaps we can model the average ratio as a combination of the two regions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying things and considering the effective temperature as the temperature for the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, let me think. The effective temperature is the overall blackbody emission, but for line formation, the local temperature matters. However, if the spots are cooler, the line formation in those regions would have a different ratio than the non-spots. But the observed ratio would be a combination of these two. But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in the photosphere as a whole. Maybe the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when the spots are present, but that doesn't make much sense because the non-spotted regions would still be at 6000 K.

Alternatively, perhaps each region contributes to the observed line based on their flux. So the overall equivalent width or the line strength would be a combination of the two regions, but the ratio n2/n1 in each region would be based on their respective temperatures.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Let's think about the ratio when there are no spots (Teff = 6000 K) and when there are spots (average Teff =5500 K). But that might not directly apply because the ratio depends on the local temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and considering that when the star has spots, the observed photosphere is at a lower effective temperature, so the n2/n1 ratio would be lower. So we can find the ratio of the ratios between 6000 K and 5500 K.

Wait, but the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes. So if the ratio is higher when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots, what's the factor?

Let me think about how the ratio depends on temperature. The ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp(-(E2-E1)/(k T)). So as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases. So higher T means higher n2/n1.

Wait, wait, wait. The energy levels: let's denote E2 as higher than E1. So E2 - E1 is positive. So the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when T increases, the denominator gets bigger, making the exponent more negative? Or wait, (E2-E1)/(kT) becomes smaller as T increases, making the exponent less negative. So the exponential term increases as T increases.

So, higher T leads to higher n2/n1 ratio. So when the star has spots, and the temperature is lower (5500 K), the ratio should be lower than when T is 6000 K. Which matches the problem statement.

So, the ratio without spots is at 6000 K, and with spots, it's at 5500 K. So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

But wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So (n2/n1)_6000 is higher than (n2/n1)_5500. So the factor is (higher)/(lower) → greater than 1. So the factor by which the ratio changes (without spots compared to with spots) is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

So let me compute that.

The ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), but more accurately, it's (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). But the problem states that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Hmm, but how does that relate?

Wait, 1448 Å is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet, which I think is part of the spectrum where Ti lines are prominent. But how does that help? Maybe it's about the energy difference E2 - E1.

The energy difference can be found using the relation E = hc/λ.

So E = hc / λ.

Let me compute E2 - E1, which is ΔE = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, about 2.9979e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 2.998e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m )

Let me compute that:

First, compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 2.998e8 = approximately 1.985e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So ΔE ≈ (1.985e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) ) = approximately 1.371e-18 J.

But wait, 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So 1.371e-18 J is about 8.56 eV.

Wait, that seems too high for a typical atomic transition. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another way, let me compute it more accurately.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c=2.99792458e8 m/s

λ =1448 Å =1448e-10 m =1.448e-7 m.

So ΔE = (6.62607e-34 * 2.99792e8) / 1.448e-7

Let me compute numerator:

6.62607e-34 * 2.99792e8 = 

Let me compute 6.62607 * 2.99792 ≈ 19.854

So 19.854e-34+8 = 19.854e-26 = 1.9854e-25 J·m.

Divide by denominator 1.448e-7 m:

ΔE = 1.9854e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.371e-18 J.

Convert J to eV:

1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J. So ΔE in eV is 1.371e-18 / 1.60218e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a very large energy difference for a Ti transition. Titanium has atomic number 22, so it's a heavier element. Maybe the transition is in the higher energy levels, but 8.5 eV seems high for optical transitions. Wait, perhaps I messed up the wavelength unit?

Wait, 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, which is in the UV range. So transitions in the UV could indeed have higher energy, but 8.5 eV is about 144 nm (since E=1240 eV·nm / λ). So 1240 / 144 ≈ 8.6 eV. Yes, that's correct.

So ΔE ≈ 8.56 eV.

Now, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE / (k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant.

k = 8.617333262...e-5 eV/K.

So let's compute the exponent for both temperatures.

First, for T1 =6000 K:

ΔE/(k T1) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) 

Calculate denominator: 8.617e-5 *6e3 = 8.617e-5 *6e3 = 8.617e-5 *6000 = (8.617 *6000) * 1e-5 = 51702 * 1e-5 = 0.51702 eV.

So ΔE/(k T1) = 8.56 / 0.51702 ≈ 16.55.

So exponent is -16.55.

Similarly, for T2=5500 K:

ΔE/(k T2) =8.56 / (8.617e-5 *5500 )

Compute denominator: 8.617e-5 *5500 = 8.617e-5 *5.5e3 = 8.617e-5 *5500 = same as 8.617 *5500 *1e-5.

8.617 *5500 ≈ 47,393.5. Multiply by 1e-5 → 0.473935 eV.

So 8.56 /0.473935 ≈ 18.07.

Exponent is -18.07.

So now, the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for T1=6000 K, ratio1 = exp(-16.55) ≈ let's compute that.

exp(-16.55) is a very small number. Let's see: ln(2)=0.693, so 16.55 is about 23.3 ln(2). Because 23 *0.693 is about 15.93, and 23.3 *0.693 ≈ 16.14, which is close to 16.55.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute using natural logs.

But I can also compute this using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the ratio of the two ratios.

The factor is (n2/n1)_T1 / (n2/n1)_T2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] 

Which is exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Let me compute that.

Compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) 

= (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) 

= 500 / (33,000,000) ) 

= 5 / 330,000 

= 1 / 66,000 ≈ 1.515e-5.

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 1.515e-5 K^-1.

ΔE/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) 

= 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99,325 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 9.93e4 K.

So the exponent is (9.93e4 K) * (1.515e-5 K^-1) ) 

= 9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 

= 9.93 * 1.515 * 1e-1 

= approx 15.04 * 0.1 

= 1.504.

So the exponent is approximately 1.504.

So the factor is exp(1.504) ≈ e^1.504.

e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

e^1.504 ≈ 4.4817 * e^0.004 → e^0.004 ≈ 1.004.

So 4.4817 * 1.004 ≈ ~4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait a second, but earlier I thought that when the star has spots (T2=5500 K), the ratio is lower, so the factor (n2/n1)_T1/(n2/n1)_T2 is about 4.5. So the ratio when the star has no spots is about 4.5 times higher than when it does. Therefore, the factor is 4.5. So the correct answer is C.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having spots (effective temperature \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \)). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), which corresponds to an energy difference:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}.
\]

Using \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 2.998 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), the energy difference is calculated as:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(2.998 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.371 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The Boltzmann factor for each temperature is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT} = \frac{8.56}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})T}.
\]

For \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \frac{8.56}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})(6000)} \approx 16.55.
\]

For \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} = \frac{8.56}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})(5500)} \approx 18.07.
\]

The ratio of the populations is proportional to the exponential of the negative of these values. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

First, compute \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Next, compute \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,325 \, \text{K}.
\]

Thus, the exponent is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (99,325)(1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.504.
\]

Finally, compute the factor:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.504) \approx 4.5.
\]

This means the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two energy levels is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots.
