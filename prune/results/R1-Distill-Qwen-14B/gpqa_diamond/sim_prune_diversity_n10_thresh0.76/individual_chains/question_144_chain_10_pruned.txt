Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about mesons and their decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question says X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like unstable particles that don't exist for very long; they decay quickly. So, the mean decay distance would depend on how long they live, right?

The given data is: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. So, I'm thinking the decay length is really tiny, which makes sense because they don't live long.

Wait, how do I find the mean decay distance? I think the decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Decay length L is roughly c multiplied by the lifetime τ, and then multiplied by the velocity v. Because L = v * τ * c (since lifetime is in seconds, and velocity is m/s, multiplying gives meters).

But first, I need to find the lifetime τ. The uncertainty principle tells us that the lifetime is related to the width Γ. From what I remember, τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. Oh right, because Γ is the energy uncertainty, and τ is the corresponding time uncertainty, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but units matter here. Let me get the units right. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units of GeV·s or something like that. I think ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·seconds. But wait, Γ is in MeV, so I should convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, Γ is 0.32 GeV. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32. Let me calculate that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32
