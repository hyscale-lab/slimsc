Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear physics and approximations in many-body calculations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is about the impulse approximation. I remember that this approximation treats the nucleons in a nucleus as if they're free, right? So the idea is that each nucleon is acting independently, almost like they're not bound together. The question lists four assumptions and asks which combination leads to the impulse approximation.

Let's look at the four statements one by one.

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
   So this is saying that each nucleon interacts independently without considering others. That sounds like the basic premise of the impulse approximation because each interaction is treated as an individual event.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
   Wait, "transparent" here probably means that other nucleons don't affect the interaction. So the nucleus doesn't change much except for the one nucleon involved. That makes sense because if the other nucleons are unaffected, the approximation treats them as if they're not there, hence the "impulse" on a single nucleon.

3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
   Oh, this is about the internal structure of the nucleon. If the quarks are non-relativistic, their motion is treated classically, which simplifies calculations. But does this directly imply the impulse approximation? I'm not sure. The impulse approximation is more about the treatment of interactions between nucleons and external forces, not about the internal quark dynamics. So maybe this isn't directly one of the main assumptions for the approximation.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.
   That's a big point. Binding forces are what hold the nucleons together in the nucleus. If we ignore them, each nucleon acts as if it's free. So this statement is directly implying the approximation because it's saying the nucleon isn't bound during the interaction, hence behaves like a free particle.

Now, the question is which of the options (1-4) are the assumptions that together imply the impulse approximation.

The impulse approximation requires that each nucleon is treated as if it's free, meaning their interactions are with external forces (like an electromagnetic or electroweak interaction) without considering their binding to the nucleus. So the key factors are that the interaction is with individual nucleons, the nucleus is transparent (meaning others don't affect), and no binding forces (so the nucleon isn't held).

Wait, what about statement 3? The quarks being non-relativistic. I think that might be part of a different approximation, like the non-relativistic treatment of the nucleon's internal structure, but not directly related to the impulse approximation itself. The impulse approximation is more about the nucleus as a whole being treated as a collection of free particles interacting with external fields. So statement 3 doesn't directly contribute to that.

So the relevant statements are 1, 2, and 4. Let's see the options:

Option A: 1,2,4 â†’ Yes, that's the three statements
