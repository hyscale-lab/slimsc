Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to determine the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: CH3COOH, HCl, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. The key is to find out if there's an excess of acid or base after the neutralization. Then, based on that excess, calculate the pH.

So the given solutions are:
1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid, a weak acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base, since Ba(OH)2 dissociates completely)

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? So it'll dissociate into Ba²+ and OH⁻ ions. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH⁻. 

I think I should calculate the moles of H+ and OH- from each solution first. 

Let's break it down:

For CH3COOH: it's a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But since I'm dealing with a mixture, maybe I can treat it as just contributing H+ ions in some way. Wait, but when you mix it with a strong base, the base's OH- would react with the H+ from the strong acid and the weak acid. Hmm, maybe I need to consider all the H+ and OH- sources.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ from all acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then see which is in excess.

Let me compute the moles for each:

1. CH3COOH: Volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L. Molarity 0.1 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.1 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, each mole contributes 1 mole of H+? Or does it not dissociate much, so maybe I can ignore it for the initial neutralization? Wait, but when mixing with a strong base, the H+ from weak and strong acids would react with OH-.

2. HCl: 400 mL = 0.4 L. 0.2 M. Moles = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives 1 mole H+.

3. Ba(OH)2: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 M. Each mole gives 2 moles OH-. So moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. OH- moles from this: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but wait. When you mix an acid and a base, they react according to H+ + OH- → H2O. So first, I should sum all the H+ from acids, sum all OH- from bases, and see which is in excess.

Total H+ from acids:
- CH3COOH: 0.05 moles (but wait, as a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate completely. Hmm, this complicates things because the H+ from acetic acid isn't as straightforward as strong acids. So how do I handle that?)

Ah, right. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate, contributing 0.08 moles H+. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it'll only partially dissociate; but in the presence of strong base, perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH will react with the OH-?

Wait, maybe I should first consider the neutralization between strong acid and strong base, and then see if any weak acid is left.

Let me think: the strong acids are HCl, which gives H+; the strong base is Ba(OH)2, which gives OH-.

So total H+ from strong acid (HCl) is 0.08 moles. Total OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles.

They will react: H+ + OH- → H2O.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol
Moles of OH-: 0.18 mol

So OH- is in excess. The excess is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH-.

Wait, but what about the CH3COOH? Since it's an acid, I think the OH- might also react with its H+.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so in solution, it'll produce some H+ which can react with OH-.

So perhaps I should first calculate the total H+ from all acids (strong and weak) and the total OH- from the base, then see which is in excess.

But how to find the H+ from CH3COOH?

Alternatively, perhaps I can treat the CH3COOH as a source of H+ which will react with the OH- from the base.

Wait, let me approach it step by step.

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

2. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

H+ from HCl will react with OH-: 0.08 + 0.08 = 0.16 moles of H2O formed. Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Now, the CH3COOH (0.05 moles) is an acid; it will donate H+ which can react with the remaining OH-.

So the OH- is 0.10 moles; the CH3COOH can contribute H+.

But since CH3COOH is a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate. So how much H+ can it contribute?

The reaction would be: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.

Each mole of CH3COOH can donate 1 mole H+ (assuming it dissociates completely, but actually, it only donates a little).

Wait, but in reality, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so the amount of H+ it can donate is less than its concentration. But when it's mixed with a strong base, it will react as much as possible.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the OH- will react with the CH3COOH, converting it into acetate ions.

So, the OH- will neutralize some of the CH3COOH.

We have 0.10 moles of OH- left after neutralizing the HCl. So how much CH3COOH will OH- consume?

Each mole of OH- can neutralize one mole of CH3COOH. So 0.10 moles OH- can neutralize 0.10 moles CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 - 0.10 = -0.05? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, wait: CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. And OH- is 0.10 moles. So the CH3COOH can only neutralize 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, the OH- will react with CH3COOH: 0.05 moles CH3COOH and 0.05 moles OH-.

This will produce 0.05 moles of CH3COO^- and 0.05 moles H2O.

The remaining OH- after that: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So now, the total solution will have excess OH- of 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait: The initial H+ from HCl was 0.08, which reacted with 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.10 moles OH-.

Then, the 0.10 moles OH- reacted with 0.05 moles CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles OH-.

So the solution now has 0.05 moles of excess OH-.

But wait, also, the CH3COOH that didn't react is... wait, no, in this case, the OH- is stronger, so all CH3COOH is neutralized, and there's still some OH- left.

Wait, the CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. The OH- after HCl neutralization is 0.10 mol. So the OH- can take 0.05 mol of CH3COOH (since that's all there is), leaving 0.05 mol of OH-.

So now, the total solution is a mixture where the excess is OH-.

So, the solution has an excess of 0.05 moles OH-.

But wait, the final solution has all three solutions mixed together. So the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

Wait, because pH + pOH = 14.

So pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, that's one of the options. Option A is 12.62.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I account for all the contributions correctly?

Let me double-check the steps.

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 mol.

2. Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M * 2 = 0.18 mol.

3. Neutralize H+ from HCl with OH-: 0.08 H+ reacts with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 OH-.

4. Now, any remaining OH- will react with CH3COOH. CH3COOH is 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 mol.

5. So, 0.05 mol OH- will react with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH- remaining.

6. Total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

7. [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

8. pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

9. pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So the pH is 12.62, which is option A.

Alternatively, another thought: when adding a weak acid and a strong base, perhaps I should consider the buffer solution? But in this case, since OH- is in excess, the solution is basic, so the buffer approach (like using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation) wouldn't apply. Because the OH- has neutralized all the weak acid and still has some left over, leading to an excess of OH-.

So yes, the calculation seems correct.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixing of the three solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (weak acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (strong base). The steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from strong acid (HCl):**
   \[
   \text{Moles of H⁺ from HCl} = 0.4 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.08 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from strong base (Ba(OH)₂):**
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ba(OH)₂} = 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol}.
   \]
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, so:
   \[
   \text{Moles of OH⁻} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Neutralization between H⁺ (from HCl) and OH⁻:**
   \[
   \text{Excess OH⁻} = 0.18 \, \text{mol} - 0.08 \, \text{mol} = 0.10 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

4. **Reaction of remaining OH⁻ with CH₃COOH (weak acid):**
   CH₃COOH can donate H⁺, which reacts with OH⁻. The moles of CH₃COOH are:
   \[
   \text{Moles of CH₃COOH} = 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{M} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}.
   \]
   The remaining OH⁻ (0.10 mol) reacts with CH₃COOH (0.05 mol), leaving:
   \[
   \text{Remaining OH⁻} = 0.10 \, \text{mol} - 0.05 \, \text{mol} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

5. **Calculate the concentration of excess OH⁻:**
   The total volume of the solution is:
   \[
   \text{Total volume} = 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
   \]
   The concentration of OH⁻ is:
   \[
   [\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
   \]

6. **Calculate pOH and pH:**
   The pOH is:
   \[
   \text{pOH} = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
   \]
   The pH is:
   \[
   \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
   \]

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.
