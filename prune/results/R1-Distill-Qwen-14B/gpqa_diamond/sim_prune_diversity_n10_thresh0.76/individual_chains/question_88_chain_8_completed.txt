Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice via oral gavage. Then they do in vivo imaging and see that some of the fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, and some get entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cells, then sequence their variable heavy chain genes, which show high variability. The question is asking which process is taking place.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), and they play a role in immune responses, especially for things that are ingested or come into contact with the gut. Rotavirus is a virus that causes diarrhea, and it's usually taken in through the mouth, so it makes sense that the immune response involves the gut.

The GFP-tagged proteins are probably antigens. When they're delivered orally, the mice's immune system would respond to them. But the question is about what happens after they're taken up.

The fluorescence being destroyed by stomach acid might mean that some proteins are broken down before they can be absorbed, but others might make it through. The ones that reach the Peyer patches would then be processed by the immune system.

When they isolate the proliferating cells, these are likely B cells that have been activated by the antigen. The variable heavy chain gene sequencing showing high variability indicates that each B cell has a different antigen receptor, which makes me think about the process that creates diversity in antibodies.

Wait, I remember that there are a few processes that contribute to antibody diversity. The primary one is VDJ recombination, which happens during B cell development in the bone marrow. This creates the initial diversity of the B cell receptors. Then, after an antigen is encountered, somatic hypermutation occurs, which introduces more mutations, increasing diversity. Class switching recombination changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG) but doesn't add diversity to the variable region. 

So in this case, since the B cells are proliferating in the Peyer patches (which are part of the secondary lymphoid organs), the process after initial VDJ recombination would be somatic hypermutation. Because the question describes high variability in the variable regions, that must be due to mutations introduced after the initial antigen encounter.

Wait, but waitâ€”the process of VDJ recombination is during the development of B cells in the bone marrow, before they encounter an antigen. So when the B cells are activated by an antigen, they start proliferating and then undergo somatic hypermutation, which leads to more varied antibodies. So the process happening here is somatic hypermutation.

Looking at the options, option A is somatic hypermutation, which fits. Option D is VDJ recombination, which is earlier. So the correct answer should be A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence is observed in the Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The GFP-tagged proteins are likely recognized as antigens by the immune system. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cell population, identified through sequencing, suggests a process that increases antibody diversity.

Among the options, VDJ recombination (option D) occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow and establishes the initial diversity of B cell receptors. However, this process happens before antigen exposure. Somatic hypermutation (option A), on the other hand, occurs after antigen encounter and introduces additional mutations to increase diversity in the variable regions of the B cell receptors. This aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes. Complement activation (option B) and class switching recombination (option C) do not contribute to variability in the variable regions.

Since the experiment involves antigen-activated B cells in secondary lymphoid organs like the Peyer patches, the process responsible for the observed variability is somatic hypermutation.

Answer: A
