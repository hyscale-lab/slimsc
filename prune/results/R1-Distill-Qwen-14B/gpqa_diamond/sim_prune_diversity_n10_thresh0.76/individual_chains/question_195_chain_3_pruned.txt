Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that there's a planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The planet's transit impact parameter is 0.2, and its orbital period is 3 days. Now, we need to find the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which is 2.5 Earth radii, so bigger than the first one. This second planet should also exhibit both transit and occultation events. Both planets share the same orbital plane and have circular orbits.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that for a planet to transit its star, it must pass directly in front of the star from our point of view. The impact parameter is the measure of how close the planet's path comes to the center of the star. If it's zero, the planet goes right through the center, and if it's larger, the path is more off-center.

But wait, the problem here is about two planets in the same system. Both are transiting, right? Or maybe one is transiting, and the other is being occulted? Wait, the second planet is the one we're trying to find the period for. Oh, the question says that the second planet will exhibit both transit and occultation events. Wait, not sureâ€”transit is when the planet passes in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness, and occultation is when it passes behind the star, which we might not see dip but perhaps a brightening if the planet emits light, which it doesn't. Or maybe occultation refers to the planet being hidden by the star, but that doesn't make much sense. Anyway, maybe the key point is that both planets are in such a way that as they orbit, their positions relative to the star and us allow both events.

Wait, but why would the second planet need to have both transit and occultation events? Oh, maybe it's more about the timing of their orbital periods. For the second planet to both transit and be occulted, perhaps their orbital periods must be such that their positions allow for these events. Alternatively, maybe the point is that when the first planet transits, the second is occulted, and vice versa, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what conditions are
