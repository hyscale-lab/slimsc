Okay, I've got this chemistry question about optical activity. Let me see what I can do. So, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a compound has chiral centers, which are carbon atoms attached to four different groups. But wait, sometimes other factors come into play, like the presence of a plane of symmetry or meso compounds. Meso compounds have chiral centers but are achiral because they have a plane of symmetry, so they’re not optically active.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure here is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2, with a Cl on C1. For a double bond, the configuration is Z, which means the higher priority groups are on the same side. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? The central carbon (C2) is connected to: Cl (from C1), two CH3 groups (from C2), and the double bond. Wait, no, C2 is CH2 attached to a CH3 and double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me draw it out.

Actually, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So, the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and two CH2 groups perhaps. Wait, but wait, but the molecule is but-1-ene, so it's ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substitution. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no—it's but-1-ene, so positions 1 and 2 are double bonded. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another CH2 group, perhaps? So the structure is ClCH2–C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but the molecule would be Cl–C(CH2CH2... Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl attached to the double bond. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2–CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would mean Cl is on C1. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would make it ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with the double bond. Wait, perhaps it's Cl on C1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl–C=CH–CH2CH3
