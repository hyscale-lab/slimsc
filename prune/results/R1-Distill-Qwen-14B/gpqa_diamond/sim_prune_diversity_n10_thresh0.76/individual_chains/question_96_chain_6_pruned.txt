Okay, so I've got this problem here about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area via the formula S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh right, I think the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), but sometimes I've seen it written differently. Maybe it's S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G)? I'm not sure, but I think the key point is that the entropy depends on the area of the event horizon.

So the question gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon as 10^-17 degrees. The distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy.

First, I should find the radius of the event horizon. Because when you have an angular size, you can relate it to the actual size using θ ≈ (size)/(distance), assuming that the size is much smaller than the distance, which is usually true for distant objects.

So θ in radians is approximately equal to the size (like the diameter) divided by the distance. Wait, but θ is the angular size, which is the angle subtended by the diameter of the event horizon. So the diameter D = 2R, where R is the Schwarzschild radius.

The formula for the Schwarzschild radius is R = (2 G M)/(c^2). So the diameter D is 2R = (4 G M)/(c^2). But maybe I can find D from the angular size.

Wait, let's step through this. The event horizon's angular size θ is given as 1e-17 degrees. Let me convert that to radians because the other formulas use radians. Degrees to radians: multiply by π/180. So θ_rad = 1e-17 * π/180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

But wait, θ is the angular size, so using the small angle approximation, θ ≈ D / d, where D is
