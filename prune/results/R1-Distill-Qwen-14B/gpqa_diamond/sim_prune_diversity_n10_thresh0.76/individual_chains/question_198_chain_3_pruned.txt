Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think this through step by step. 

So the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. And the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm. I remember that stability constants (β) tell us about the stability of metal-ligand complexes. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it indicates a greater tendency to form. Each β corresponds to a complex with a certain number of ligands. So β1 is probably for Co(SCN)1^+ or something similar, β2 for Co(SCN)2^2+, and so on.

Wait, the complexes are formed stepwise. So for each n, βn is the formation constant for the nth ligand. So for Co(SCN)_n^(2-n), βn is the constant for adding the nth SCN-.

The question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think that's the Co(SCN)2^2+ complex, which is blue. So we're looking for the fraction of Co in the form of [Co(SCN)₂]²+ among all possible forms.

So to find the percentage, I need to calculate the fractions of each possible complex and then find the fraction for n=2.

The general approach is to use the stability constants to find the fraction of each complex. The formula for the fraction of the nth complex is (β1β2...βn / (β1β2...βn + β1β2...β(n+1) + ... + β1β2...β4)) ) multiplied by the concentration of the metal and ligand, but wait, maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, I think we can model this using the formation of complexes step by step. The total concentration of Co is 0.01 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. But the [SCN-] will change as it forms complexes with Co.

Wait, but considering that SCN- is in large excess, perhaps the total [SCN] is approximately 0.1 M. But I'm not sure. Maybe the solution assumes that the ligand is in large excess, so the free SCN- concentration doesn't change much. Or perhaps it's better to model it without that assumption.

Another thought: the fraction of each complex can be found using the ratio of the successive stability constants. The distribution of the complexes depends on the β values and the ligand concentration.

I remember that the fraction of each complex can be calculated using the formula:

fn = (βn * [Co] ) / ( [SCN]^n + β1 [Co] [SCN]^{n-1} + ... + βn [Co] )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, there's a general method where using the stability constants, you can compute the fraction of each complex based on the log of the product of the β's and the ligand concentration.

Wait, another approach: the fraction of each complex is given by the product of the previous β's and the ligand raised to (n) over the sum for all possible complexes. Let me think. 

Wait, I think the formula for the fraction of the nth complex is (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n) / (sum for m=0 to 4 of (β1β2...βm [SCN]^m)).

But wait, the [SCN] here is the total ligand concentration minus what's bound, but if the ligand is in excess, maybe we can approximate [SCN] as 0.1 M.

Alternatively, since the problem gives [SCN-] as 0.1 M, perhaps the solution assumes that the free [SCN] is approximately 0.1 M because the amount of SCN bound is small compared to the total.

So, let's proceed under that assumption.

So, the general formula for the fraction of each complex is:

fn = (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n ) / ( sum_{m=0}^4 (β1β2...βm [SCN]^m) )

Wait, but wait: the complexes each have different charges. But I think the charge doesn't directly affect the distribution because the stability constants are given for each step, so the fractions are based on the β's and the ligand concentration.

Wait, no, because the β's are for each step. Let me think again. The formation of each complex is done step by step. So, for each complex, the formation constant is the product of the previous β's.

Wait, for each complex, the overall stability constant K for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) would be the product of β1, β2, ..., βn.

So, K1 = β1 = 9 → K1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-])
K2 = β1*β2 = 9*40=360 → [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2)
K3 = 9*40*63 = 22680 → [Co(SCN)_3]^3+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3)
K4 = 9*40*63*16= 362880 → [Co(SCN)_4]^4+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4)

Wait, but how do these K's affect the fractions?

Alternatively, the fraction of each complex is given by the terms involving K's times the ligand concentration to the appropriate power, divided by the sum of all such terms.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the ratio of each complex's concentration relative to the others, considering the β's and the ligand concentration.

The problem is that the total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the total SCN is 0.1 M.

But I think for the purpose of this problem, the approach is to calculate the mole fractions of each cobalt species.

Wait, the total cobalt species are the free Co^2+ plus all the complexes.

Each complex is formed in
