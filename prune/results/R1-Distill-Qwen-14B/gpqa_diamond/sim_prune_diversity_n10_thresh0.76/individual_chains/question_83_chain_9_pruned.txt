Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Alright, let me break this down. First, I'll think about the initial step—diluting the acetic acid. When you mix equal volumes of a solution, the concentration halves, right? Because when you mix two equal volumes, the total volume doubles. So, the initial concentration is 0.05 M, and after dilution with 20 cm³ of water (which is equal volume), the new concentration should be half. Let me calculate that.

Original volume = 20 cm³, original concentration = 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So, the new concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, and when diluted, its concentration decreases. Right, so 20 cm³ of 0.05 M is diluted with 20 cm³ water. So the diluted solution has a volume of 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid remain the same because we're only adding water. So moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So original moles are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 0.04 L, so the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct.

Next, when titrating with NaOH. The titration reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base) is a neutralization reaction. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid present.

But first, let's figure out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So, the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence are also 0.001 moles. Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume required is moles / concentration, so 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

The question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. So 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Wait, wait, let me think. 25% of the equivalence point is when 25% of the required NaOH is added. Since equivalence is at 10 cm³, 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So, at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added.

So first, let's compute the pH at 25% titration. At this point, some of
