Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question involves two reactions and then analyzing the products using HPLC. Let's break it down.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce ketones to alcohols. So, the 3-ketone group in hexan-3-one would be reduced. Wait, but the structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the carbonyl is at position 3. When LAH reduces that, it'll become a secondary alcohol. The structure after reduction would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, I think. Because the starting material is S configuration at the 5-methoxy group, but wait, noâ€”wait the starting compound is (S) at the 5 position? Or wait, no, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the configuration at C3 (the ketone) is a carbonyl, which is not a stereocenter. When we reduce the ketone to an alcohol, that creates a new stereocenter at C3. Wait, does the starting material have a stereocenter elsewhere?

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3? No, wait, 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon. Let me draw the structure. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2 positions. Let's number from left to right.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3? No, wait, 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon from the ketone. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3? No, because hexan is six carbons. Wait, hexan-3-one: positions 1,2,3,4,5,6. So, position 3 is the ketone. So structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O
