Okay, let me try to tackle this physics problem. Hmm, so we have an electron and a positron moving towards each other. They annihilate and produce two photons. The question is about the angle between these two photons.

Wait, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, like an electron and positron, they produce gamma photons. But since they're moving, there's some conservation laws involved here.

So, the electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. Both are moving along the horizontal axis, so their initial motion is along the same line.

Lorentz factor gamma is the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. For an electron, the rest mass is about 0.511 MeV. So the electron's total energy is gamma * m_e cÂ². Similarly for the positron.

But wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction. So maybe I should consider their momenta as vectors. Let me think: the electron's momentum would be gamma_e * m_e * v, and the positron's would be gamma_p * m_e * v, but in the opposite direction because it's from the right.

Wait, no. Wait, the positron's velocity is in the opposite direction. So the positron's momentum is to the left, but its gamma is 2. So when they collide, their momenta are in opposite directions.

But wait, I'm not sure about the directions. The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left (so to the right), and the positron is moving from the right to the left. So the electron's momentum is to the right, and the positron's is to the left.

Conservation of momentum must hold. So the total momentum before collision must equal the total momentum after.

Before collision, the total momentum is (gamma_e m_e v_e) - (gamma_p m_e v_p), because the positron's direction is opposite. Wait, but wait: I need to make sure about the signs. Let me think of the electron's velocity as positive (right) and the positron's as negative (left) because it's moving from the right.

So the electron's momentum is gamma_e * m_e * v_e, and the positron's is gamma_p * m_e * v_p, but since it's moving
