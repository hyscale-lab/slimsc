Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see, the question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4), which I think is a two-component vector in the Hilbert space. 

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an operator is calculated by taking the conjugate transpose of the state vector, multiplying by the operator, and then multiplying by the state vector again. So the formula should be something like <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ, where ψ is the state vector.

Wait, the state is given as (3i, 4). So ψ would be a column vector: [3i, 4]^T. Then the conjugate transpose, ψ†, would be [ -3i, 4 ] because the conjugate of 3i is -3i, right? Or wait, the complex conjugate of i is -i. So yes, 3i's conjugate is -3i, so the first component becomes -3i. The second component is 4, which is real, so it stays 4.

The Pauli matrices are given. σ_y is the Pauli-Y matrix, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So I need to compute ψ† σ_y ψ. Let me break this down into steps.

First, multiply ψ† with σ_y. So ψ† is a 1x2 matrix, σ_y is 2x2. Let me write ψ† as [ -3i, 4 ].

Multiplying ψ† (1x2) with σ_y (2x2), the result should be a 1x2 matrix. Let me compute each element:

First element of the product (row 1, column 1):
( -3i ) * 0 + 4 * i = 0 + 4i = 4i.

Second element of the product (row 1, column 2):
( -3i ) * (-i) + 4 * 0. Let's compute that. (-3i)*(-i) = 3i^2. Since i^2 is -1, that's 3*(-1) = -3. 4*0 is 0. So the second element is -3.

So ψ† σ_y is [4i, -3]. Now, we need to multiply this by ψ, which is [3i; 4]. So it's a 1x2 multiplied by a 2x1, giving a scalar.

So the calculation is (4i)(3i) + (-3)(4).

Compute each term:

First term: 4i * 3i = 12 i². Since i² is -1, that's 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: (-3) *4 = -12.

Adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24. Wait, but wait a second. S_y is represented by (ℏ/2) σ_y, right? Because spin operators are (ℏ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the question says S_y, which is the spin operator, so I think the operator is (ℏ/2) σ_y.

Oh right! So the expectation value is (ℏ/2) times the result we just calculated. So the expectation value <S_y> would be (ℏ/2) * (-24/ (something? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the calculation we did was <σ_y>, because in the matrix multiplication, we got the expectation value of σ_y. So to get S_y, we need to multiply by ℏ/2.

Wait, no, let me think again. The spin operator S is given by S = (ℏ/2) σ. So S_y = (ℏ/2) σ_y. So when we compute <S_y>, it's equal to (ℏ/2) <σ_y>, where <σ_y> is the expectation value of σ_y.

So the calculation earlier gave us <σ_y> = -24/(... wait, no. Wait a minute, let me recheck the calculation again because I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the state vector is (3i, 4). So ψ is [3i; 4]. Let me compute the normalization factor first because I think I missed that. Oh wait, the problem doesn't mention normalization, but I think for the expectation value, we have to consider the state as normalized. Or perhaps it's already normalized.

Wait, the state vector's norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components.

So |3i|^2
