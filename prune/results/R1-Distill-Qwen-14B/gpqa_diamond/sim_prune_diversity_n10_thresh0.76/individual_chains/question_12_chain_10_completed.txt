Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the kinetic energy of product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let's see. The question says that a Pi(+) pion is at rest and decays into a mu(+) muon and a neutrino. Oh wait, wait—actually, the given equation is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. So that must be a neutrino, maybe a muon neutrino since it's a muon in the decay products.

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c², and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c². Wait, wait, but neutrinos are super light. Like, their masses are negligible compared to these particles. So maybe I can approximate the neutrino's mass as zero. That should simplify things, right?

So the problem is to find the kinetic energy of the product particles. Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum here. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

So, let's denote the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's as -p. Wait no, actually, they have to be equal and opposite vectors. So, if the muon has momentum p, the neutrino must have -p. But wait, neutrinos are leptons like electrons, so their momentum is just as much as the muon's but opposite.

Wait, but since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its energy comes entirely from its momentum. So the neutrino's energy is just |p|c. Because for massless particles, E = pc.

Now, the total energy is conserved. The initial energy is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. So the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino should equal that.

The muon's energy is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy. So E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. And the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c.

So, the total energy equation is:

m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu

Which is:

139.6 MeV = (105.7 + K_mu) + E_nu

But also, from momentum conservation, the magnitudes of the momenta are equal. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|. And for the muon, the energy is related to its momentum and rest mass by E_mu^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2. So,

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2 )

But the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c.

So putting it all together, the energy equation becomes:

139.6 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c

Hmm, that's an equation in terms of p c. Let me set x = p c. Then the equation is:

139.6 = sqrt( x^2 + 105.7^2 ) + x

I can solve this for x.

Let me rearrange:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side:

= (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 x + x²

So:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 * 139.6 x

Let me compute the squares. 105.7 squared is approximately (100 + 5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2. 100^2 is 10000, 2*100*5.7 is 1140, 5.7^2 is about 32.49. So 10000 + 1140 = 11140, plus 32.49 gives about 11172.49 MeV². Wait, actually, 105.7 is in MeV/c², so 105.7 squared is (105.7)^2 = approximately 11172.49 (MeV)^2.

Similarly, 139.6 squared: 139^2 is 19321, and 0.6 squared is 0.36, and cross terms 2 * 139 * 0.6=166.8. So 139.6^2 = (139 + 0.6)^2 = 139² + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6² = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16 (MeV)^2.

So plugging back:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 x

Rearranging:

2 * 139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Compute 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67

So 2 * 139.6 x = 8315.67

x = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6) 

Calculate denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2

So x ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute that.

8315.67 / 279.2. Let me approximate.

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 = 8376, minus 279.2 → 8376 - 279.2=8096.8. That's about 29. So 29 would give around 8096.8, which is less than 8315.67.

Wait, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67.

So 8315.67 is 8376 minus 60.33. So 30 - (60.33 / 279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784.

So x ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, x is p c, so p = x / c. But in units where c=1, p would be x.

But I think in our case, since all energies are in MeV and masses in MeV/c², the momentum would have units of MeV/c. So x is in MeV/c * c → which is MeV. So that's why x is in MeV/c * c → so x is in MeV (since (MeV/c)*c = MeV).

So, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = x = ~29.784 MeV.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately. Let's compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2:

Well, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 = 8376 → minus 279.2 → 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

Then 279.2 * 29.7 → 29*279.2 is 8096.8. 0.7 more is 0.7 *279.2 = 195.44. So 8096.8 + 195.44 = 8292.24.

So 29.7 gives 8292.24. The target is 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67 - 8292.24 = 23.43.

How much more is 23.43 / 279.2 per 0.1? 279.2 * 0.083 ≈ 23.2. So approximately 29.7 + 0.083 ≈ 29.783 → x ≈29.783 MeV.

So E_nu ≈ 29.783 MeV.

Now, E_mu is 139.6 - E_nu → 139.6 - 29.783 ≈ 109.817 MeV.

So E_mu = 109.817 MeV.

But E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is m_mu c² + K_mu. m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², so m_mu c² is 105.7 MeV.

So K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.817 - 105.7 = 4.117 MeV.

Wait, so the kinetic energy of the muon is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is about 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 2.84, 26.8

B)7.2,32.8

C)3.52,20.8

D)4.12,29.8

So D) is 4.12 and 29.8, which matches our calculation. But wait, wait, wait—the problem is about the KE of the product particles. So the neutrino's energy is entirely kinetic because its rest mass is zero. The muon's kinetic energy is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's is about 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but the options seem to pair the two KEs as the options. So option D is 4.12 MeV (muon) and 29.8 MeV (neutrino). So that must be the correct answer.

But let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, another approach: the total energy of the system is 139.6 MeV. The muon's rest energy is 105.7, so the available energy is 139.6 -105.7 =33.9 MeV. But that's not the case because the neutrino takes some energy.

Wait, no, that's not correct because the decay isn't just the muon and the pion's rest energy; the neutrino carries away some energy and momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the muon's kinetic energy is ( (m_pi² - m_mu²) ) / (2 m_mu) ) ?

Wait, I think that formula is applicable in cases of decay at rest. Let me recall.

In beta decay when a nucleus at rest decays into a daughter nucleus, electron, and antineutrino, the kinetic energy of the electron can be found using (M_initial² - M_final²)/(2 M_initial) )

Wait, but wait, the formula is (M_initial)^2 - (M_final)^2) divided by (2 * M_initial). Wait, no, let me think again. Let me think about the maximum kinetic energy the electron can have. When the neutrino takes negligible energy, the electron's KE is (M_initial^2 - M_final^2)/(2 M_initial).

But in our case, the neutrino's energy is significant because the pion's mass is not much larger than the muon's. Wait, but the pion is 139.6 MeV, the muon is 105.7 MeV. So the pion is heavier, but not by a huge amount. So the muon can't take all the energy, but in this case, the neutrino takes a significant part.

So applying that formula: (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi)

m_pi=139.6, m_mu=105.7.

Calculate numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.

We can compute this as (139.6 +105.7)(139.6 -105.7) = (245.3)(33.9) = let me compute that.

245.3 * 33.9:

245 *33 = 7785, 245 * 0.9=220.5 → 7785+220.5=7905.5.

But 245.3 *33.9 is approximately 245 *34=8330 (since 0.9 is close to 1), but more accurately:

Compute 245.3 *33.9:

= 245.3 * (30 +3 +0.9) = 245.3*30 =7359, 245.3 *3=735.9, 245.3 *0.9=220.77.

Adding together: 7359 +735.9=8094.9 +220.77=8315.67.

So numerator is 8315.67 (MeV^2).

Denominator is 2 *139.6 =279.2 MeV.

So K_max = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Wait, that's the maximum kinetic energy the muon can have, but in reality, the neutrino takes some of that energy. So the maximum KE for the muon is about 29.78 MeV. But in our problem, the muon's KE is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's is about 29.78 MeV. So the total energy is 139.6.

Wait, but that would mean the muon's KE is 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is ~29.78 MeV. So the sum is about 33.9 MeV, which is exactly 139.6 -105.7=33.9 MeV.

Wait, that makes sense. Because 105.7 +4.12 =109.82, plus 29.78 gives 139.6.

So that's correct.

So the answer should be option D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Wait, the options pair the KEs. So the muon is 4.12, neutrino is 29.8.

Yes, that matches option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process of a stationary positively charged pion (π⁺) into a positively charged muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν). The rest masses are given as follows:  
- Rest mass of π⁺: \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)  
- Rest mass of μ⁺: \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)  

Since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum of the system must still be zero, meaning the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta. Additionally, the total energy is conserved, so the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino equals the rest energy of the pion.

### Energy Conservation
The total energy of the pion is its rest energy:  
\[
E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The total energy of the muon is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:  
\[
E_{\mu} = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu}.
\]

The neutrino's energy is entirely kinetic, as its rest mass is negligible:  
\[
E_{\nu} = K_{\nu}.
\]

From energy conservation:  
\[
E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]

### Momentum Conservation
The magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal and opposite. For the muon, its energy is related to its momentum \( p \) by:  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2}.
\]

For the neutrino, since its mass is negligible:  
\[
E_{\nu} = p c.
\]

### Solving for Momentum
Let \( x = p c \). Substituting into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x.
\]

Rearranging and squaring both sides:  
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - x,
\]
\[
x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x + x^2,
\]
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x,
\]
\[
279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49,
\]
\[
279.2x = 8315.67,
\]
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the neutrino's energy is \( E_{\nu} = x \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \), and the muon's total energy is:  
\[
E_{\mu} = 139.6 - E_{\nu} = 139.6 - 29.78 \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:  
\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.82 - 105.7 \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**
