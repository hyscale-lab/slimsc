Okay, so I've got this question about stellar atmospheres and elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it step by step. 

Alright, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I don't think the mass plays a role in this particular problem. The focus is on the elemental abundances determined using the EW method under LTE. 

The abundances given are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Oh wait, I remember that [X/Y] notation is the logarithm (base 10) of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y relative to the Sun. So [Fe/H] means the abundance of Fe compared to H relative to the Sun. 

The Sun's composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. So for the Sun, nFe/nH is 10^(7.5 -12) = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, nMg/nH is 10^(7 -12)=10^(-5). 

Wait, let me get that right. Because 12 + log10(nX/nH) equals the value given. So, for nFe/nH, it's 10^(7.5 -12) = 10^(-4.5). So nFe = 3.16e-5 * nH.

Same for Mg: 10^(7-12) = 1e-5, so nMg is 1e-5 * nH. 

Now the question is to find the ratio of silicon atoms (nSi) in Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find nSi_1 / nSi_
