Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential, which means the potential is the same in all directions. The potential given is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Hmm, I remember that this is similar to a harmonic oscillator setup, but in three dimensions. Oh right, because in three dimensions, each direction (x, y, z) acts like a harmonic oscillator, and since the potential is isotropic, they all have the same frequency ω.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. So, I need to figure out the energy levels and the degeneracy (the number of states with the same energy) for the third excited state.

Wait, wait, let's start by recalling the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think the energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh right, in three dimensions, the energy levels are given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). But since the system is isotropic, the energy only depends on the sum n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is a non-negative integer (like 0,1,2,...).

Wait, but wait. No, actually, let me think again. The ground state is when n_x = n_y = n_z = 0, so n = 0. The first excited state would be when one of them is 1 and the others zero, so n =1. The second excited state would be when either two are 1 or one is 2. So wait, no, the order is a bit tricky because the energy depends on n, which is the sum.

The energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = (N + 3/2) ħω, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. The ground state is N=0, E= (3/2) ħω. The first excited state (N=1) would have E= (5/2) ħω. The second excited state (N=2) would have E= (7/2) ħω. The third excited state (N=3) would have E= (9/2) ħω. Wait, no. Wait wait, the problem says "third excited state." Oh, wait, no: the ground state is the zeroth excited state. So ground state is 0, first excited is N=1, second is N=2, third is N=3. So yes, the third excited state corresponds to N=3.

So the energy would be E = (3 +3/2) ħω? Wait, no, E = (N + 3/2) ħω. So for N=3, it's 3 + 3/2 = 9/2. So E = (
