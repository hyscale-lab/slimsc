Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, it's a multiple-choice question, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So, I'm assuming that means they're spread out evenly in all directions, but wait, in reality, the distribution isn't uniform because of things like the Milky Way's structure, but the question says to assume uniformity. So, I'll go with that assumption.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. So, I need to relate parallax to the number of stars in a given range of parallax.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. Right, the parallax angle (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so distance d = 1/plx. So, as plx increases, the distance decreases because the star is closer.

Now, the number of stars per unit volume of space depends on how many stars are in a given volume. But here, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So, I'm thinking in terms of how many stars you'd find in a thin shell of space at a certain distance, considering a small change in parallax.

Wait, another approach: since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (number per unit volume) is constant. Let's say n is the number density, so n is a constant.

The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr is approximately 4πd² dr. Because for a thin shell, the volume is the surface area (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness dr.

So, the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dr.

But how does this relate to parallax? Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that into the equation.

dr is the change in distance. Let's relate dr to the change in parallax dplx. Since plx = 1/d, differentiating both sides, dplx = - (1/d²) dr. Hmm, so dr = -d² dplx.

Wait, but we're considering a small range of plx, so dplx is positive. But since d is positive,
