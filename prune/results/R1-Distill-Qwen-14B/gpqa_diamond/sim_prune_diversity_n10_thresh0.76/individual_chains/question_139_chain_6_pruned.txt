Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about two compounds, A and B, which when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce two different diketones. I need to figure out which starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when certain compounds react with nitrous acid (which is formed from NaNO2 and HCl), they undergo specific reactions. In this case, the products are diketones, so I should think about what reactions would form diketones.

Wait, the reaction conditions include HCl, NaNO2, and water. Oh right, I think that when amines are treated with nitrous acid, they can form diazonium salts, which might undergo other reactions. But wait, the products here are diketones, so maybe the starting materials are alcohols or ketones?

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is a secondary alcohol, and it's treated with something that oxidizes it, maybe? Because oxidation of secondary alcohols typically gives ketones. But how does that relate to the reagents given?

Wait, no, wait. I think I'm mixing things up. Nitrous acid is more commonly involved in diazotization, like with aromatic amines or aliphatic amines. Diazonium salts can do various things, like coupling reactions, or maybe even form carbocations if they lose nitrogen.

Oh wait, another possibility. Maybe the starting materials are alcohols that are adjacent to a leaving group. Like, if you have a vicinal diol (two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons), treating with nitrous acid and HCl could lead to the formation of a carbonyl group. I recall something about the Stephen reduction or maybe the use of nitrous acid in the dehydration of diols.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing with the oxidation of alcohols. For instance, vicinal diols (like 1,2-diols) can undergo cleavage under certain conditions. But what reaction conditions cause that?

Wait, another angle: the products are diketones, meaning two ketone groups. So each product has two carbonyl groups. That suggests that the starting materials might have had two functional groups that each can form a ketone upon reaction.

Let me look at the products. The first product is 4-isopropylcyc
