Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound based on FTIR and 1H NMR data. I remember that FTIR is good for functional groups, and NMR tells us about the structure and environment of protons.

So, the FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Oh wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H peak because they can form hydrogen bonds more extensively than alcohols. Also, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. That sounds like a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. But since the O-H is present, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid would be around 1700. Wait, but if it's an ester or something else, the carbonyl might be a bit higher? Or maybe not. Hmm.

Looking at the NMR part: several peaks, but none are vinyl hydrogens. So, no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens. That eliminates any possibility of alkenes or aromatic rings, I think. The 1H NMR shows a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets. That complex splitting suggests that the protons are adjacent to a carbon with several neighboring groups. Wait, so like a carbon connected to multiple other carbons, each with their own sets of protons. It could be a branching point, maybe where there are multiple adjacent CH2 groups or something.

Looking at the options, all of them have a COOH group since the IR suggests a carboxylic acid. Let's list the options:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So, that's like a central CH connected to two C2H5 groups and a CH2COOH. Wait, how's that structure? Let me draw it. It's like:

CH2CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH? No, wait, the formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)... Wait, perhaps it's a structure where there are two substituents on a central carbon.

Wait, maybe all the options have a similar structure. Let's think about each one.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the chain is CH3CH2 connected to a carbon (C(H)(CH3)), which is connected to another C(H)(CH3), then COOH. Wait, that structure would have a central carbon connected to another CH2CH3 and two CH3 groups. So, the substituents would be two CH3, one CH2CH3, and a COOH group. Wait, no, the structure is: the COOH is a separate group. Let me try to imagine the structure.

Alternatively, looking for the NMR signals: the doublet of triplets of quartets. Each split comes from adjacent protons. For example, if a proton is next to a CH2 group, it would split into a triplet. If it's next to another group that's split into a triplet, it could get more complex.

Wait, I think that when a proton is next to a carbon that has two different sets of neighboring protons, it can lead to splitting patterns like doublets of triplets. For example, if a proton is next to a CH2 group that's next to another CH2, each would contribute to splitting.

Wait, maybe the structure has a geminal di-substitution, like two different groups on a carbon. For example, a carbon connected to two different substituents, each with their own neighboring hydrogens.

Looking at the options, perhaps the splitting is due to vicinal coupling. Let's think about each option.

Option D: The structure would be something like CH2CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. Wait, but actually, each of those carbons has CH3 groups. Wait, that would make the structure perhaps something like:

CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, the central part is C(H)(CH3) connected to another C(H)(CH3). So, each of those carbons is attached to a CH3 and a CH2CH2 group. Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, perhaps each of those CH groups is attached to two CH3 groups and a CH2CH2. No, wait, the formula is a bit confusing. Let me clarify each option.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So this would be:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH.

So, the central carbons are each attached to a C2H5 group and a CH3, but wait, let me see. Each C(H)(C2H5) is connected to another C
