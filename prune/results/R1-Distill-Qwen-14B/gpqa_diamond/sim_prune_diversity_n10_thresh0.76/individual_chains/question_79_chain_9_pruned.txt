Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction it undergoes and the resulting NMR spectra. The reaction uses 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to match it to one of the four options provided.

First, let me think about what reaction conditions are being used. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a commonly used reagent in organic chemistry, particularly for epoxide ring-opening reactions. It's a strong, bulky base and is often used in the presence of epoxides to form carbamates or to open epoxide rings. Wait, wait, no—I think I might be mixing it up. Oh, right! 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a catalyst used in the Sharpless epoxidation. But wait, that's for epoxidizing epoxides. Or is there another reaction? Alternatively, maybe it's a base for elimination reactions. Hmm, but wait, the reaction is done at 403 K, which is pretty high—like maybe an elimination? Or perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed reaction.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows specific signals. Let me look at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has several signals. Let's list them:

δ 2.28 (3H, s) → a singlet, maybe a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split the signal, like an electronegative atom or a ring. Maybe a CH3 connected to O or another group.

δ 2.31 (3H, s) → another singlet, same as above. So two singlet methyl groups, each integrating to 3H. So two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't cause splitting.

Then, the aromatic region:

6.75 (1H, d)
7.08 (2H, d)
7.68 (1H, d)
7.71 (2H, d)

Wait, the coupling here seems a bit off. Let me think. The pattern suggests two doublets that are each doublets of two H's. Maybe this is a para-substituted aromatic ring with substituents at two positions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a styrene-type structure.

Wait, the 13C NMR data:

δ 21.3 (1C, s) → probably a methyl group attached to an electronegative atom, like O. Like in an epoxide, maybe.

28.4 (1C, s) → another methyl, perhaps.

Then the carbons around 126-130 are aromatic carbons. The 126.9 (2C, s) and 12
