Okay, so I'm trying to solve this science question about a ligand-receptor pair and a genetic construct. Hmm, let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, the setup is that someone identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to study their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets for binding. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices.

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions, right? So the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. There are stop cassettes in between: ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression via Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, so that's a control for loading. Then they made a mouse model that's homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope. They expected to see green (from eGFP), but they didn't. Why?

The options are A to D. Let me break down each part.

First, the construct: bicistronic, so both ligand and receptor are on the same vector. The ligand is first, so it's under the CBA promoter. The receptor is after an IRES, which allows internal ribosome entry, so maybe the receptor is expressed in a different way.

Wait, the stop cassettes have different lox sites. The ligand has loxP, and the receptor has lox2272. Oh, right, in Cre/Lox systems, the loxP sites are recognized by Cre recombinase. So if you have loxP and lox2272, they are different. Cre will only cut the same sites, I think. So, maybe in the vector, the ligand is under CBA, but with a stop cassette (loxP-stop). The receptor is under a different promoter, perhaps, with its own stop cassette (lox2272). But wait, the setup says the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after IRES. So, does that mean the IRES is between the ligand ORF and the receptor? So, the vector would be something like: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF with loxP stop -> IRES -> receptor ORF with lox2272 stop -> eGFP.

Wait, but in the initial description: ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry. The receptor is 3' and fused to eGFP. Oh, but with stop cassettes in between.

So the plasmid is: CBA promoter drives the ligand ORF, which is followed by a loxP-stop. Then, there's an IRES, then the receptor ORF, followed by lox2272-stop and then eGFP.

Wait, no. Because in the question, it says "the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus." So the ligand is first, then the receptor. But the stop cassettes are between ligand and mCherry, and between receptor and eGFP.

Wait, maybe the construct is designed so that each gene (ligand and receptor) has its own expression cassette. So ligand is under CBA promoter, followed by ORF, then a stop with loxP. Then, the receptor is under a separate promoter? Or maybe the IRES comes after the ligand's stop.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to draw it out.

The vector is bicistronic, so two ORFs. So the vector structure is probably:

5' - [CBA promoter] - [ligand ORF] - [loxP stop] - [IRES] - [receptor ORF] - [lox2272 stop] - [eGFP] - 3'

Wait, but I don't think IRES is after ligand. IRES is used for internal ribosome entry, which allows the second gene to be expressed without a separate promoter. So maybe the construct is:

CBA promoter drives ligand ORF, then a stop with loxP. Then, an IRES, then receptor ORF, then stop with lox2272, then eGFP.

Wait, but the IRES would come after the first stop, right? Because the IRES is used to initiate translation of the second gene. So the first ORF (ligand) is under CBA, then after that comes the stop, and then the IRES, then the receptor ORF, then another stop, and then eGFP.

So in this setup, without Cre, the ligand would be expressed because the CBA promoter is active. But the IRES would drive the receptor's expression. Wait, but in the absence of Cre
