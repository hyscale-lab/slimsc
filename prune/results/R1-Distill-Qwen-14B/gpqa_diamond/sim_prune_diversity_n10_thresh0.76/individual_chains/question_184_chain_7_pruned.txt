Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, let me first draw the target molecule to visualize it better. So, the benzene ring has three substituents. The positions are numbered such that the tert-butyl group is at position 2, the ethoxy group at position 1, and the nitro group at position 3. Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me think: in the given name, 2-(tert-butyl) is position 2, 1-ethoxy is position 1, and 3-nitro is position 3. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a meta arrangement relative to each other?

Wait, no. Let me think about the numbering. The longest chain or the substituents' priority. Ethoxy is an ether, tert-butyl is a bulky substituent, and nitro is a strong electron-withdrawing group. But for numbering, the substituents are meta to each other? Not exactly sure, but maybe the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions adjacent, but in a way that they are all on the same side? Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about the synthesis steps.

So, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Wait, that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, the substituents are adjacent to each other, making it a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring.

But wait, when you have three substituents on a benzene ring, it's usually a meta or para arrangement, but in this case, it's a 1,2,3 arrangement, which is adjacent. That would mean the substit
