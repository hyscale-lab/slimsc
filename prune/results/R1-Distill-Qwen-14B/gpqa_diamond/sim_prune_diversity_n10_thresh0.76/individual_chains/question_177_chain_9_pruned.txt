Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times larger than Star_2's. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively.

The question is about the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. The options are A to D with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm. I think the key concepts here are blackbody radiation and the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Let me recall the formula. The luminosity L of a star is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. 

Wait, right. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. So if we can find the temperature ratio, I can find the luminosity ratio.

The problem says both stars emit most brightly at the same wavelength. Blackbody radiation peaks at a wavelength λ_max given by Wien's law: λ_max ∝ 1/T. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same, right? Because T = constant / λ_max. So T1 = T2, since λ_max1 = λ_max2.

Wait, but wait. The radial velocities are given. Star_1's velocity is 0, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Oh, but wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength is different from the rest wavelength. But the problem says they found the same wavelength at which they appear brightest. So the observed λ_max is the same for both.

Hmm, so that complicates things. Because if the star is moving, the observed λ_max would be different. Let me think. The Doppler effect for light says that the observed wavelength λ' is related to the rest wavelength λ by λ' = λ (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity
