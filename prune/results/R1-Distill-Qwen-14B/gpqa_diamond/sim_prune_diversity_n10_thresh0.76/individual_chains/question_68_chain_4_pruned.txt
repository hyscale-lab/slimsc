Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. It's about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm. Let me read it again.

So the setup is: there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. After that, the average z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. The question is about finding the oscillation frequency of this average.

The options are A to D, with various expressions involving gamma, B, and square roots.

Alright, let's break this down. I'm a bit rusty on spin precession, but I think I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin of a particle aligns with it. When the field changes direction, the particle's spin starts to precess around the new field direction. This precession leads to oscillations in the components of the magnetic moment.

Wait, so initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. The particle's magnetic moment mu is gamma Sz. So initially, mu would be along the same direction as the field, since the particle is aligned with it. The spin operator Sz has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for spin-1/2 particles. But when the magnetic field is along Z, the energy eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along Z.

When the magnetic field is suddenly switched off and then turned on in the Y direction, the situation changes. The particle's spin was previously in a state aligned with the Z-axis. But now, the new magnetic field is along Y. So the particle's spin state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, which depends on the Y-component of spin.

Let me think about the Hamiltonian. The energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by H = -mu · B. So when B is along Y, H = -gamma (S · B), which is -gamma B Sy.

Wait, no: mu is gamma Sz, so mu · B would be gamma B S_z when B is along Z. But when B is along Y, mu · B becomes gamma B S_y? Wait, no, because mu is a vector, so it's the dot product of mu and B. So if B is along Y, then mu · B is gamma B S_y.

Wait, more accurately, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the dot product is gamma times the dot product of S and B. Since B is along Y, S · B is S_y multiplied by B (since B is in the Y direction and magnitude B). So H = -mu · B = -gamma B S_y.

So the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. Now, the time evolution of the spin state is governed by this Hamiltonian. When the magnetic field was along Z, the state was an eigenstate of Sz. But when the field is turned to Y, the state is no longer an eigenstate of Sy.

Wait, the system is initially in an eigenstate of Sz (since it
