Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, indicating some reaction had occurred. Two new spots appeared, meaning two products were formed. The options are A to D, each suggesting different products. I need to determine which of these is correct.

First, I need to understand the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Breaking it down: the benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached. The substituent on the oxygen is a butenyl group. Specifically, the butenyl is 3-en-1-yl, meaning the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, wait: but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, since the numbering starts from the end where the group is attached to the oxygen. Let me draw that.

So the structure is: the benzene ring connected to an oxygen, which is connected to a four-carbon chain. The chain is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let me think. The butenyl group is four carbons long, with a double bond starting at position 3. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but wait, the substituents: 2,2-dimethyl. So, the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait no, because the butenyl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond.

Wait, butenyl is four carbons with a double bond. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond between carbons 3 and
