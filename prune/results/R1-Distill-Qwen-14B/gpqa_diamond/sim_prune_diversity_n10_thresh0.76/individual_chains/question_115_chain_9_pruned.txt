Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, right? So, the setup here is an electron moving left to right (along the horizontal axis) and a positron moving right to left. Both have Lorentz factors given, 4 and 2 respectively.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, which is the factor by which time and space dimensions are contracted. But more importantly, when calculating energy, the rest mass energy multiplied by gamma gives the total energy of the moving particle. So for each particle, their energies would be gamma times the rest mass energy.

The rest mass of an electron (and positron, since they're same mass) is about 0.511 MeV, right? So, the electron has gamma=4, so its energy is 4 * 0.511 = 2.044 MeV. The positron has gamma=2, so its energy is 2 * 0.511 = 1.022 MeV. But wait, since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum will be opposite to the electron's.

Now, when they annihilate, they produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy. And their directions are such that one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So, they're both moving to the right but at different angles relative to the horizontal. The question is, what's the angle between them?

Wait, but how do I approach this? I think I should consider conservation of energy and momentum. Since the electron and positron are annihilating, their total energy and momentum must equal the sum of the photons' energy and momentum.

So let's model this. Let's set up a coordinate system. Let's say the horizontal axis is the x-axis. The electron is moving along +x, and the positron along -x. Their momenta are in opposite directions.

Each particle's momentum can be found using p = gamma * m * v. But since gamma is given, and for electrons/positrons, m is the same, the momentum is gamma * m * v. Alternatively, another way to write momentum is p = gamma m v = gamma m (beta c) / c. Wait, beta
