Okay, so I have this physics problem about the scattering amplitude in an elastic collision. Hmm, I remember that scattering amplitude relates to how particles scatter off a target. The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momentum states, I think. Oh right, phase shifts are part of the scattering amplitude in partial wave analysis.

The phase shifts given are δ₀ = 90 degrees, δ₁ = 67, δ₂=55, δ₃=30, δ₄=13. And we're told to ignore the rest beyond δ₄. So I guess we only consider these five terms.

The question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I think the imaginary part is related to the cross-section or perhaps the amplitude's imaginary component which contributes to the differential cross-section.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) is typically expressed in terms of partial waves. The general expression is f(θ,φ) = sum over l, m of (something involving spherical harmonics and phase shifts). But when we're looking in the direction of the incident beam, which I think is θ=0, φ=0, right? Because that's the forward direction.

In that case, the expression for the scattering amplitude might simplify. I remember that for the forward direction, the amplitude is dominated by the lowest phase shifts, especially δ₀, because higher l terms might average out or contribute less.

Wait, the formula for the imaginary part might be related to the sum of the sine of the phase shifts. Because I recall that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by (1/(2ik)) times the sum over l of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l). Or wait, maybe it's (2l+1) sin(δ_l) multiplied by something.

Hold on, let me think. The scattering amplitude f is given by f(θ,φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ sum_{m=-l}^l ( (2l+1) ( δ_{m,0} ) [ e^{iδ_l} - 1 ] ) P_l^m (cosθ) e^{i m φ} ) ) / (ik l (l+1) ) )

But when θ=0 and φ=0, the equation might simplify because the spherical harmonics Y_{lm} would be evaluated at these angles. Since cosθ=1, the associated Legendre polynomials P_l^m(1) are zero except for m=0 and l even? Wait, no, for P_l^0(1), it's 1 for all l. Because P_l^0(x) is the Legendre polynomial, and at x=1, it's 1.

So the amplitude at θ=0, φ=0 would be sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} -1 ] ) / (ik (l(l+1)) ) ) * (1) * (1) )

But wait, what's k? k is the wave number, which is related to the momentum of the electrons. The electrons have energy E=50 MeV. Since electrons are light, relativistic effects might be significant, but perhaps we can proceed with non-relativistic first.

Wait, no, wait. The energy is 50 MeV, which is much higher than the rest mass energy of an electron (~0.511 MeV), so relativistic effects are definitely important. Hmm, but maybe the question expects a non-relativistic approach, or perhaps a simple relation for the wavelength.

Wait, but the problem gives the phase shifts, so perhaps I can avoid calculating k directly and instead use the given data to find the imaginary part.

The question is about the imaginary part of f. So let's compute Im(f).

Expanding the amplitude:

f = sum [ (2l+1)(e^{i δ_l} - 1) ] / (i k l (l+1) )

So e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. Then e^{i δ_l} -1 = (cos δ_l -1) + i sin δ_l.

So when we divide by i k l(l+1), we can split this into real and imaginary parts.

Let me separate the numerator:

(2l+1)( (cos δ_l -1) + i sin δ_l ) / (i k l(l+1) )

Divide each term by i:

= (2l+1) (cos δ_l -1) / (i k l(l+1) ) + (2l+1) i sin δ_l / (i k l(l+1) )

Simplify each term:

First term: (2l+1)(cos δ_l -1) / (i k l(l+1) ) = [ (2l+1)(cos δ_l -1) ) / (k l(l+1)) ) ] * (1/i) = -i [ (2l+1)(1 - cos δ_l) ) / (k l(l+1)) ) ]

Second term: [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (k l(l+1)) ) ] * (i /i ) = [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (k l(l+1)) ) ]

So the entire f is sum over l of [ -i (2l+1)(1 - cos δ_l)/(k l(l+1)) ) + (2l+1) sin δ_l/(k l(l+1)) ) ]

So the imaginary part of f is sum over l of [ (2l+1) sin δ_l / (k l(l+1)) ) ]

Because the first term is real multiplied by -i, so in the overall sum, the imaginary part comes from the second term's coefficient.

Wait, no, wait: f is the sum of two terms. The first term is -i times something real, so it contributes to the imaginary part. The second term is real, so it contributes to the real part of f.

Wait, no, wait: When you have an expression A + B, where A is a real number and B is an imaginary number, then the real part is A and the imaginary part is B. But in this case, the terms are in terms of real and imaginary parts.

Wait, let me think again. Let's write f as sum [ term_l ]

Each term_l is:

[ -i (2l+1)(1 - cos δ_l)/(k l(l+1)) ) ] + [ (2l+1) sin δ_l/(k l(l+1)) ) ]

So, for term_l, the real part is (2l+1) sin δ_l/(k l(l+1)) ), and the imaginary part is - (2l+1)(1 - cos δ_l)/(k l(l+1)) ).

Wait, but the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction. So we need to sum over all l the imaginary parts.

Wait, no, wait. Because for the scattering amplitude, the imaginary part is the coefficient of i in the expression. So the imaginary part is the sum of the imaginary parts of each term.

So each term has an imaginary part of - (2l+1)(1 - cos δ_l )/(k l(l+1) )

Therefore, the total imaginary part of
