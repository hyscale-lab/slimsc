Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph is used on the VLT telescopes, which are pretty big, 8m each. The key thing here is the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel. The question says it needs to be at least 10 after a 1-hour exposure.

I think the S/N depends on factors like the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, and the instrument's efficiency. Oh wait, because ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, maybe it also depends on the spectral resolving power and how that affects the number of photons collected per pixel.

Wait, but for this question, the main factors are the apparent brightness of each star and the distance, which affects how bright the star appears to us. The formula I vaguely remember is that the flux received from a star decreases with the square of the distance. So the apparent magnitude is the absolute magnitude plus 5 log (distance in parsecs) minus 5. Or wait, the formula is m = M + 5 log d - 5, where d is the distance in parsecs. So the further away, the fainter the star appears.

Each star in the options has an absolute magnitude (M) of 15 mag, except Canopus and Polaris. Wait, no, options a and b have different absolute magnitudes. Let me check again.

Looking at the options:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a very bright star, maybe around magnitude 0.7. But I'm not exactly sure.

b) Polaris: It's a well-known star, the North Star. Its apparent magnitude is about 2, but I think it's a bit variable. But since it's a variable, maybe the question uses an average value.

c) Star with M=15, distance 10 pc: So m = 15 +5 log(10) -5 = 15 +5*1 -5 = 15+5=20-5=15? Wait, wait. Wait, log(10) is 1. So 15 +5(1) -5=15+5=20-5=15. So m=15. So apparent magnitude 15.

d) M=15, distance 200 pc: m =15 +5 log(200) -5. Let's compute log(200). Log(2e2) is log(2) + 2 = ~0.301 +2=2.301. So 5 * 2.301 = approx 11.505. So m=15 +11.505 -5 = 21.505. That's really faint, like around 21.5.

e) M=15, distance 5 pc: m=15 +5 log(5) -5. Log(5)=0.69897, 5*0.69897≈3.495. So m=15+3.495-5=13.495. So about 13.5.

f) M=15, distance 50 pc: m=15 +5 log(50) -5. Log(50)=1.69897, 5*1.69897≈8.495. So m=15+8.495-5=18.495. So around 18.5.

So the apparent magnitudes for each star:

a) Canopus: m ~
