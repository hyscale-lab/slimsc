Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, like a muon, the spin operators are usually represented as S_x, S_y, S_z, but here the operator is P, which might be analogous to spin. The given components P_x, P_y, P_z are 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, I think P is similar to the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

The problem states that the direction n is in the x-z plane. So, the direction vector n would have components n_x, n_z, and n_y=0. Wait, no, the x-z plane includes any direction where y is zero. So, any vector (a, 0, b) where a² + b² =1. So the direction can be represented as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the x-axis, I think. Or maybe n makes an angle θ with the z-axis. Wait, usually in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal from x. But since n is in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π, so maybe we don't need to worry about φ. Or perhaps φ is arbitrary since it's in the x-z plane, but the problem says "along an arbitrary direction in x-z plane", so the eigenvector should be expressed in terms of θ, perhaps.

Wait, the operator P is along direction n. So the operator P is given by the vector P · n multiplied by ħ/2. So, P = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z) where n is in x-z plane, so n_y=0. So, P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² =1. So, n_x is cosθ, n_z is sinθ, if θ is the angle from the x-axis. Or wait, maybe n_z = cosθ and n_x = sinθ. I get confused sometimes. Let me think: in the x-z plane, θ is the angle from the positive x-axis, so n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, the operator P is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). 

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, let's denote the eigenvalue as λ = +ħ/2.

The general approach is to write the matrix of P and then find its eigenvectors. But since the direction n is arbitrary, the eigenvector will depend on θ.

Let me write the matrices for P_x, P_y, P_z:

From the problem statement:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P is n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Substituting n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ:

P = (cosθ) * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (sinθ) * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix:

Each term is scaled by (ħ/2), so factor that out:

P = (ħ/2) * [ cosθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + sinθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Adding the matrices inside:

The (1,1) element is 0* cosθ + 1 * sinθ = sinθ.

The (1,2) element is 1* cosθ + 0 * sinθ = cosθ.

The (2,1) element is same as (1,2) because of the structure of P_x and P_z. Wait no: P_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by cosθ, it's [[0, cosθ],[cosθ, 0]]. P_z is [[sinθ, 0],[0, -sinθ]].

So adding them:

The (1,1) element is sinθ.
(1,2) is cosθ.
(2,1) is cosθ.
(2,2) is -sinθ.

So the matrix P is:

[ [ sinθ, cosθ ],
  [ cosθ, -sinθ ] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So P = (ħ/2) * [[ sinθ, cosθ ], [ cosθ, -sinθ ] ]

We need to find the eigenvector |v> such that P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So, the eigenvalue equation is:

[ [ sinθ, cosθ ], [ cosθ, -sinθ ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Wait, because when you factor out ħ/2, the equation becomes (P matrix) * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>, so the matrix multiplied by the vector equals the eigenvalue times the vector. So the eigenvalue is ħ/2.

So the equation is:

[ [ sinθ * a + cosθ * b, ... wait, no, let me set up the equations
