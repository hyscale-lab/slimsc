Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the temperature is 25°C, and the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+.

Wait, so the complex is Ca-EDTA. So the formula would be something like CaY²- maybe, where Y is the EDTA part. So the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- or something like that? Or wait, I think EDTA has four negative charges. So the complex is CaY²–, right? Or perhaps CaY^2- because Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would combine to give a charge of (2+) + (4-) = (2-), so the complex is CaY²-.

I think the formation of the complex is represented by the equation: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²–. The formation constant, K, is given. Oh wait, the K for the complex is 5x10^10. So K is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

So the formation constant K would be [CaEDTA²–]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, sometimes K is written the other way around. Wait, no, formation constants are typically written as Kf = [complex]/([metal][ligand]). So yes, K is 5e10.

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaY²–] as 0.02 M.

Now, the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So I need to find [Ca²+].

Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, but in reality, the EDTA is in solution as the complex. Wait, but in the solution, the majority is CaY²–, right? Because the K is very large (5e10), which is a big number, so the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. So the [Ca²+] would be very low.

Wait, but let's think about it. The initial condition is that the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial [CaY²–] is 0.02 M. Then, it dissociates a little bit into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, the problem assumes that the pH is ideal, which probably means that the concentration of EDTA^4– is high enough. Because sometimes EDTA exists in different protonated forms, and the pH affects the fraction that's in the Y^4– form, which is the one that complexes with Ca²+. But since pH is ideal, maybe we assume that all the EDTA is in the Y^4– form? Or perhaps that the EDTA is at a pH where it's fully deprotonated, so [EDTA^4–] is known.

Wait, the problem states that the pH is ideal, so perhaps I don't have to worry about the various forms of EDTA. So I can just consider that the only EDTA in the solution is the Y^4– form, which complexes with Ca²+.

But wait, if the CaY²– is in solution, and it dissociates, then:

CaY²– ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4–.

The K for this reaction is the dissociation constant, which would be the inverse of the formation constant. So Kd = 1/Kf = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So Kd is 2e-11.

The initial concentration is 0.02 M of CaY²–. Let's say that at equilibrium, the concentration of CaY²– is 0.02 - x. But since Kd is very small, x will be very small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the equilibrium expression would be Kd = [Ca²+][Y^4–] / [CaY²–].

But wait, what's the initial condition for Y^4–? Because when CaY²– dissociates, it produces Y^4–. So the initial Y^4– concentration is zero, but in the problem setup, the solution is only the complex. Wait, no, perhaps the solution is prepared by dissolving the CaY²– salt. So the solution contains CaY²– and maybe other ions, but considering it's in solution, and the complex is the only source of Ca²+ and Y^4–.

Wait, perhaps the solution is just the complex, so the initial concentrations are: [CaY²–] = 0.02 M, [Ca²+] = 0, [Y^4–] = 0. Then, when some of the complex dissociates, x is the amount that dissociates. So [Ca²+] = x, [Y^4–] = x, and [CaY²–] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So,

Kd = (x)(x) / 0.02 ≈ 2e-11.

So x² = 0.02 * 2e-11.

x² = 4e-13.

Taking square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, so sqrt(4e-13) is about 2e-6.5, which is 6.32e-7 approximately.

Wait, 2e-6.5 is the same as 2 / (10^6.5) = 2/(3.16e6) approximately. 10^6 is 1e6, and 10^0.5 is about 3.16. So 10^6.5 is 3.16e6. So 2/(3.16e6) is approximately 6.32e-7.

So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M.

But wait, let me double-check the steps. The formation constant K is given as 5e10, so the dissociation constant Kd is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. Correct.

We have [CaY²–] = 0.02 M. At equilibrium, [Ca²+] = x, [Y^4–] = x. So Kd = x^2 / 0.02 ≈ 2e-11.

So x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = ~6.32e-7.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻) at 25 °C, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the inverse of the formation constant \( K_f \), so:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

At equilibrium, the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and Y⁴⁻ will be equal, denoted as \( x \), while the concentration of the complex \([ \text{CaY}^{2-} ]\) will decrease by \( x \). Since \( K_d \) is very small, \( x \) will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Thus, we approximate:

\[
K_d = \frac{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{Y}^{4-} ]}{[ \text{CaY}^{2-} ]} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
