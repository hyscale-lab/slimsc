Okay, so I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through step by step.

The state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Oh wait, N is the normalization constant which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). Right, because when you have superpositions of coherent states, the normalization comes from the overlap between them.

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. Let me plug these in.

First, compute N. Let's calculate each part step by step. Sin(2phi) when phi is -pi/4. 2phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1. Then exp(-2 alpha²) with alpha=0.5. Alpha squared is 0.25, multiplied by 2 gives 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. 

So N squared is 1 + (-1)*0.6065. Wait, wait, N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2 alpha^2)). So let's compute the term inside the square root: 1 + (-1)(exp(-2*(0.5)^2)).

Which is 1 - exp(-0.5). Exp(-0.5) is about 0.6065, so 1 - 0.6065 is 0.3935. Therefore, N is sqrt(0.3935) which is approximately 0.6276.

Wait, but wait a minute. Because N is the normalization, it's 1 over the square root of that value. Or is it? Let me check the formula again. Oh, the given N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha^2)). So yes, N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6276.

So the state is [cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5>
