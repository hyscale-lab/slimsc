Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The question is about two electrons in p orbitals. They're talking about their orbital angular momentum states. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. So, I think each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l, and the total is given by the third number, which is 2. The m value is -1.

Wait, but each electron is in a p orbital, so each has l=1. So l1 and l2 are both 1. That makes sense because the state is |1,1,2,-1>. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, which is the sum of l1 and l2 (since 1+1=2). And m is -1, which is the z-component.

The question is about measuring L1z and L2z, which are the z-components of the orbital angular momenta of each electron. I need to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ. 

Hmm, so L1z and L2z are the individual z-components. Each of these operators corresponds to the z-component of angular momentum for each particle. For a p orbital, the possible m values are -1, 0, +1. So each L1z and L2z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

The state is a coupled state, so it's a combination of the individual states. I think I need to express the given coupled state in terms of the product states of each electron's individual states. Because when you measure L1z and L2z, you're looking at the product of their individual states.

So, the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = m_total. In this case, m_total is -1. But wait, the given state is |l1, l2, l, m>, so m is the sum of m1 and m2. So m = m1 + m2.

So for the state |1,1,2,-1>, m is -1. That means the sum of m1 and m2 is -1. But each m can be -1, 0, +1.

The possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1 are:
(-1, 0), (0, -1), and maybe (-1, 0) and (0, -1). Wait, what's the possible combinations?

Let me list all possible pairs where m1 + m2 = -1:
m1 can be -1, m2 would be 0
m1 can be 0, m2 would be -1
m1 can't be +1, because then m2 would have to be -2, which isn't possible since m can be only -1,0,+1.

So only two possibilities: (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

Now, the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of these product states. The expansion coefficients are given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. But wait, maybe it's easier to think about the orthonormal basis here.

Alternatively, I remember that the coupled state |l1,l2; L, M> can be expressed as a sum over m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = M, of the product of the individual states multiplied by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

In this case, M is -1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, but how do I find the coefficients?
