Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The general reaction is acid + base → salt + water, and the heat from that reaction is what we're after. Oh wait, but neutralization typically refers to releasing heat, so it's exothermic, meaning the enthalpy change should be negative.

The problem gives three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, but wait a second, when you mix an acid and a base, they react. But here we have three solutions. So I need to figure out which are the acids and which are the bases. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid as well (well, the first dissociation is strong, the second is weaker but for concentrated solutions, maybe it's considered here as fully dissociated). Ba(OH)2 is a strong base because it's a group 2 hydroxide, I think.

When you mix these three, the HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is the base. So the acids are reacting with the base. But wait, how much of each acid reacts with the base? Because if you have excess of one, the other might not all react. So I need to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base to see which is the limiting reagent.

Each acid will contribute H+ ions. HCl is a strong acid, so each mole of HCl gives 1 mole H+. H2SO4 is also a strong acid, so each mole gives 2 moles H+ because it's H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole gives 2 moles OH- because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH^-.

So the steps are:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4.
2. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.
3. Determine the total moles of H+ and OH-.
4. The neutral
