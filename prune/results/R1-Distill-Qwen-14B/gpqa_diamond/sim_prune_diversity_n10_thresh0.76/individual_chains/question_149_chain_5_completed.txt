Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, and they integrate to 1H together. Also, the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. Interesting.

Alright, let's break it down. So, in the NMR, the two peaks for the same proton usually could be due to coupling, but the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling. So, maybe it's something else. Wait, I remember that sometimes in NMR, if there's some kind of diastereotopicity, you can get splitting. Wait, diastereotopic protons are a thing. Or maybe something about the molecule's structure causing different environments for the same proton.

Wait, the problem says that the two peaks have similar shifts and roughly equal integrals, adding up to 1H. So, each peak is integrating to about 0.5H. That suggests each is a separate environment for the same proton. But why?

Another thought: maybe the molecule has some kind of symmetry or is in a state where there are two different conformations that are interconverting. Or maybe it's a racemic mixture. Wait, no, enantiomers wouldn't split NMR peaks unless there's something else. Because in enantiomers, the environments are mirror images, so the protons would have the same shift, right? Unless the machine can't tell them apart, but in racemic mixtures, sometimes you get a single peak because the shifts are the same. So why are there two peaks here?

Wait, the question says that the two peaks have similar shifts, so maybe not enantiomers. Because in enantiomers, the shifts would be same, but maybe for diastereomers, the shifts would be different. But here, the shifts are similar, so perhaps not.

Wait, but the NMR shows that each of these peaks integrates to about 0.5H each. So, it's like each peak is a different environment for the same proton. So perhaps there's some kind of coupling or exchange happening, but non-spin-spin. Wait, another thought: maybe the molecule is a mixture of diastereomers, which would give different coupling patterns. But if the diastereomers have the same mass, then the LC-MS would show two peaks, right?

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. So both have the same molecular weight, so they're the same compound. But the NMR has two peaks for the same proton. How?

Wait, maybe it's a mixture of conformers. But conformers usually exchange rapidly on the NMR timescale, so you'd see a single peak. Unless the interconversion is slow. But I don't think that's common except in some cases.

Another possibility: the molecule has a double bond with some kind of coupling that's not spin-spin. Wait, maybe during the synthesis, something like an amide bond formed in two different ways, leading to different structures. Or perhaps a double coupling where two different stereoisomers were formed. Wait, the options include 'double coupling' during amide bond formation.

Wait, the options are A to D. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. But the LC-MS shows same mass, so it's not a precursor. Precursors would have lower mass. So A is probably not it.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. But if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak because both enantiomers have the same shift. Unless the machine is unable to resolve them, but that's not common. Plus, the shifts are similar, not the same. So maybe not B.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during an amide-bond forming reaction. Hmm, I'm not sure what that means. Double coupling... Maybe when the amide forms, there's another coupling, like with another proton or something, leading to two peaks. But I'm not familiar with that term. Need to think.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. But wait, the shifts here are similar. Maybe if the diastereomers are close in structure, their alpha-protons have similar shifts, but why two peaks for the same proton?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in a state where the alpha-proton has two different environments due to the molecule's stereochemistry. For example, if the alpha carbon is a stereocenter, and the molecule exists as two diastereomers, then each diastereomer would have a different shift for the alpha-proton.

Wait, but if the molecule is a diastereomeric mixture, then each diastereomer would have its own set of protons. But in this case, the same alpha proton is split into two peaks. Hmm, unless the diastereomers have the same shift for that proton. Unlikely, but possible if the environment is similar.

Wait, but the question says the NMR has two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So each peak corresponds to a different environment of that same proton. So perhaps the compound exists in a pair of diastereomers where the alpha proton is in a different environment in each.

But wait, diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR signals would split. So for that alpha proton, each diastereomer would have a different shift. So if you have a mixture, you would get two peaks for that proton in the NMR.

But why would the shifts be similar? Maybe the diastereomers are such that the alpha proton's environment isn't too different. Like, if the change is on a different part of the molecule, the alpha proton's environment remains similar, but not exactly the same.

So, the NMR shows two peaks (one for each diastereomer's alpha proton), and the integral adds up to 1H. Because each diastereomer contributes 0.5H? Wait, but each molecule has one alpha proton, so if you have a 50:50 mixture, each diastereomer contributes 0.5H, so the integral for each is 0.5, adding up to 1H. That makes sense.

And the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass because both are the same molecular weight (same compound), but different in stereochemistryâ€”so diastereomers, which have same molecular weight but different physical properties. So yes, LC-MS would separate them as two peaks.

So the most likely explanation is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers, making option D correct.

Wait, but what about option C: 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. What does that refer to? Maybe during the formation of the amide, two different amide bonds formed, leading to different structures. But that would probably result in different masses, which wouldn't match the LC-MS data.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the amide bond formed with two different coupling partners, but that doesn't seem to fit.

So, I think option D is the correct answer.


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (together integrating to 1H). The LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The task is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
   This is unlikely because the LC-MS data shows two peaks with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. A precursor would have a lower mass, which is not observed here.

2. **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, and their NMR spectra typically show identical peaks because the environments of the protons are mirror images. Additionally, enantiomers would not produce two peaks in the LC-MS spectrum with the same mass unless they are in a racemic mixture, which is not supported by the data provided.

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
   The term "double coupling" is not clearly defined in the context of amide-bond formation. If such a process occurred, it would likely result in structural isomers with different masses, which contradicts the LC-MS data showing two peaks of the same mass. This makes this option less plausible.

4. **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties, including NMR shifts, which can result in separate peaks for the same proton in the NMR spectrum. The similarity in chemical shifts for the alpha-proton in this case could arise if the diastereomers have similar environments for that proton. The LC-MS data supports this explanation because diastereoisomers have the same molecular weight but different physical properties, leading to two peaks of equal intensity.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, as this accounts for the observed NMR and LC-MS data.
