Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the net potential energy of a system with a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says: A charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of this system.

The options are A, B, C, D. I remember that potential energy in such configurations often involves considering the work done in assembling the charges or the energy stored in the configuration.

Wait, the sphere is grounded. So that means it's connected to the Earth, which is a large conductor that can supply or absorb charges without changing its potential. Grounding usually means that the potential of the sphere is zero. So any excess charge on the sphere will reside on its surface.

When you bring a charge q near a grounded conducting sphere, the sphere will induce charges on its surface. Since the sphere is neutral to begin with and it's grounded, the induced charges will adjust to ensure the sphere remains neutral. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, if the sphere is grounded, any induced charges would allow the sphere to have a net charge, but in this case, the sphere is initially neutral. So when you bring a charge near it, it will induce opposite charges on the near side and same charges on the far side, but since the sphere is grounded, the induced same charges can leave, right?

Wait, no, that's when the sphere is isolated. Grounding allows charges to flow in or out. So when
