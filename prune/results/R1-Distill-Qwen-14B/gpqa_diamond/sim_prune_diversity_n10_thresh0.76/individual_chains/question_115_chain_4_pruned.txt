Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into photons. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when a particle and its antiparticle meet, they annihilate each other, producing energy, usually in the form of gamma photons. But this problem is a bit more detailed, so I need to think carefully.

Alright, let's parse the question. An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma_e = 4. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. So gamma_p = 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons, each with the same energy. The directions of the photons are both towards the right, one upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, so both photons are emitted to the right but at different angles. Since their energies are the same, maybe their momenta are the same in magnitude but opposite in direction? Or perhaps not. Let's think about conservation of energy and momentum here.

So, the initial system is the electron and the positron. After annihilation, two photons are produced. Since the electron and positron are each other's antiparticles, their rest masses are the same, but their velocities and momenta are opposite.

First, I should find the total energy and momentum of the system before the collision. Then, the photons must carry away the same total energy and momentum, but in the form of photons.

Let me think about the rest mass energy. The rest mass of an electron (and positron) is about 0.511 MeV. But because they're moving, their total energy is gamma times m*c squared.

So, the electron has gamma_e =4, so its energy is 4*m*c². Similarly, positron's energy is gamma_p * m c². But wait, since the positron is moving towards the left (from the right), maybe I should consider the direction when calculating momentum.

Wait, let me set up a coordinate system. Let's say the electron is moving along the positive x-direction (from left to right), and the positron is moving along the negative x-direction (from right to left). Oh wait, wait. Wait, the question says the positron is moving along the
