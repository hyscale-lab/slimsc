Okay, so I need to figure out how to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ using a 0.1 M strong monobasic acid. Then I have to find the minimum volume of the acid needed and the pH of the solution. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide. Since it's a hydroxide, it's probably going to react with an acid. Since the acid is monobasic and strong, like HCl, the reaction should be straightforward. The general reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. So, I can write the balanced equation as Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O.

Wait, yes, that makes sense. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of HCl to dissolve it completely.

Next, I should find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 I have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Iron is about 55.85 g/mol, Oxygen is 16, and Hydrogen is 1. So, Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). Let me calculate that: 55.85 + (3*(16 + 1)) → 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

I have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. Moles = mass / molar mass. So moles = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol. Let me compute that: 0.1 divided by approximately 106.85 is about 0.000936 moles. Wait, wait, let me do that more accurately. 106.85 is roughly 107, so 0.1/107 is around 0.0009346 moles. So approximately 9.346×10^-4 moles.

Since the reaction ratio is 1:3, each mole of Fe(OH)3 needs 3 moles of HCl. So the HCl needed is 3 * 0.0009346 ≈ 0.0028038 moles.

Now, the HCl solution is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter. So, to find the volume needed, I can use M = n/V → V = n/M. So, V = 0.0028038 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028038 liters, which is 28.038 cm³. So approximately 28.04 cm³. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which aligns closely. But wait
