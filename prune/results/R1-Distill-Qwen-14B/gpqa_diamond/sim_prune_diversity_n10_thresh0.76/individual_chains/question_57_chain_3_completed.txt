Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons, and I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, okay, let's see. The given phase shifts are delta_0=90 degrees, delta_1=67, delta_2=55, delta_3=30, and delta_4=13 degrees. The rest are ignored. The electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm not sure if that energy is directly needed for this calculation right now.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using the partial waves. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) / ( (1 + cosθ)^2 + ... )? Or wait, maybe the expression is more straightforward. Oh right, the general form is f(θ) = (1/k) * sum ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) * [some angular part], but I'm not recalling the exact formula. Oh wait, maybe the angular dependence is ( (1 + cosθ)^2 ) / something? Or perhaps it's the Legendre polynomials involved.

Wait, I think the scattering amplitude can be written as f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ] * [ (1/(1 + cosθ))^{something} ]... Hmm, no, maybe not exactly. Alternatively, I remember that the differential cross-section involves the square of the amplitude, but here the question is about the imaginary part.

Wait, let's think again. The scattering amplitude is given by f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l} (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * (something with cosθ). Oh wait! Oh right, the amplitude in terms of phase shifts is f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) sinδ_l * (1/(1 + cosθ))^{something}? Or is it (1/(1 - cosθ))^{...}?

Wait, let me get this straight. The general expression for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [ sin(δ_l) e^{i δ_l} ] * [ (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) ]^{l} ?

Wait, that's not right. Alternatively, I think it's f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l} (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * (something involving cosθ). Oh wait, perhaps the angular part is the associated Legendre polynomial, but in the case of elastic scattering, maybe it's simplified.

Wait, another approach: in the case of elastic scattering, the amplitude for each partial wave is f_l(θ) = (1/(k)) (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * ( (1 - cosθ)^{something} )

Wait, maybe I should refer to the Born approximation or partial wave expansion. Let me think. The partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l +1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ)

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * ( (1 + cosθ)/(2) )^{l} ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's look up the formula in my notes: Oh right, the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(k)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] * [ (1 + cosθ)^{2l} / (1 - cosθ) ) ] ?

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I think the correct expression is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] * ( (1 - cosθ)/(2) )^{l} * (1/(1 - cosθ)) )?

No, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the real and imaginary parts. Because the problem is asking for the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0 degrees. So φ can be ignored because when θ=0, the scattering is along the beam direction, and the amplitude depends only on θ=0.

Wait, but when θ=0, cosθ=1. So perhaps we can evaluate the amplitude at θ=0.

Wait, let's think about the angular dependence for each l. I think for each partial wave, the amplitude contribution is proportional to ( (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) )^l. Hmm, but at θ=0, that would be (0/2)^l for each l, except when l=0. Wait, if l=0, the term would be ( (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) )^0 = 1.

So perhaps the contributions from l>0 are zero at θ=0. Wait, that can't be right because then the amplitude would only have the l=0 term. But the phase shifts given include l=0 to l=4.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The general expression for the partial wave amplitude is:

f_l(θ) = (1/k) (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * ( (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) )^{l/2} }

Wait, the square root of (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) is sin(θ/2) / (1 + cosθ/2). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the expression is ( (1 - cosθ)/(2) )^l times something.

Alternatively, the correct expression for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] * [ (1 - cosθ) / (1 + cosθ) ) ]^{l} * (1 + cosθ)^{something} ?

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's easier to think about the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude. The imaginary part, Im(f), would be the sum over l of (1/k) (2l +1) Im[e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l] multiplied by the angular factor evaluated at θ=0.

Wait, but e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l = [cos δ_l + i sin δ_l] * sin δ_l = cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l. So Im(f) for each l is (1/k) (2l +1) sin^2 δ_l * angular_factor.

Wait, but what's the angular factor at θ=0? Because if the angular part is ( (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) )^l, then at θ=0, cosθ=1, so (0/2)^l = 0 for any l>0. Only l=0 would contribute, but for l=0, (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) = 0/2=0, so 0^0 is 1. Wait, but for l=0, the angular term would be 1, so f_0(0) = (1/k)(1) * sin δ_0.

But wait, the given phase shifts include δ_0=90 degrees, which is π/2 radians. So sin δ_0 = 1. So f_0(0) = (1/k) * 1 * 1 = 1/k.

Hmm, but what about other l's? Wait, at θ=0, for any l>0, the angular part is ( (1 - 1)/(1 + 1) )^l = 0^l = 0 for l >=1. So only the l=0 term contributes at θ=0.

Wait, does that mean that the imaginary part of f(θ=0) is (Im(f_0(0)) ) = (1/k) sin^2 δ_0 * something?

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. The imaginary part of f(θ) would be the sum over l of (1/k) (2l+1) Im[ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] multiplied by the angular function.

Wait, but for each l, e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l = sin δ_l [cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ].

So e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l = sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l.

So the imaginary part is sin^2 δ_l.

So Im(f) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l +1) sin^2 δ_l * [ ( (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) )^l ] evaluated at θ=0.

But at θ=0, (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) = 0/2 = 0 for any l>0. So for l>0, the term (0)^l is zero, except when l=0, where it's 1^0=1.

So the only term that contributes is l=0. Thus, Im(f) = (1/k) (2*0 +1) sin^2 δ_0 * [ (0/2)^0 ] = (1/k) (1)(1)(1) = 1/k.

Wait, but that can't be right because the other phase shifts are given, and the problem says to ignore the rest beyond l=4, but perhaps even so, their contributions at θ=0 are zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me check: the phase shift for l=0 is δ_0=90 degrees, so sin^2(90)=1. So Im(f) at θ=0 would be (1/k) *1*1 = 1/k.

But then the question is to compute the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So the value is 1/k. But wait, k is the wave number. The electrons are 50 MeV. So what's k?

Wait, the wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE}/ħ. But I'm working in units where ħ=1 and c=1, but maybe I should use actual units.

Wait, the energy E is 50 MeV. The mass of the electron is m_e=0.511 MeV/c². So E>>m_e, so we can approximate k as sqrt(2mE) / ħ.

Wait, but let's compute k.

In natural units where ħ = c = 1, then E (MeV) = m (MeV/c²) * c², but since c=1, E (MeV) = m (MeV/c²) * c² → m (MeV/c²) = E (MeV) / c² → wait, perhaps I should be careful about units.

Alternatively, in particle physics, the wave number k can be expressed as sqrt(2mE), where m is the mass of the electron, and E is the kinetic energy. Wait, but wait, no. The total energy is E_total = K + m c². Wait, but when E is given as 50 MeV, I think it's the kinetic energy.

Wait, but in scattering experiments, the kinetic energy is often much smaller than the rest mass energy for heavy targets, but in this case, electrons are light. So for electrons, 50 MeV is much larger than m_e c² (≈0.511 MeV), so E≈pc, so p≈E/c, and k = p/ħ ≈ E/(ħc).

But perhaps to compute k accurately, I should use the relativistic expression. The total energy E_total is gamma m c², and the momentum p is gamma m v. So E_total² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

But if E is 50 MeV, which is the kinetic energy, then the total energy E_total is K + m c² = 50 + 0.511 = 50.511 MeV.

So, E_total = 50.511 MeV.

Then, the momentum p can be found from E_total² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, (pc)^2 = E_total^2 - (m c²)^2 = (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ (50.511)^2 ≈ 2551.4 MeV².

So p c ≈ sqrt(2551.4) ≈ 50.51 MeV.

So p = (50.51 MeV) / c.

Then, the wave number k = p / ħ.

But in natural units (ħ=1, c=1), k = p = 50.51 MeV.

Wait, but units can get confusing here. Alternatively, in terms of units where ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, so 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV fm) → so 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

Wait, let me think. The wave number k has units of inverse length. So to compute k in terms of MeV, since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, then 1 fm = ħ c / 197.33 MeV.

So k = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV/c) / (ħ) → but since c= ħ (in natural units?), no, wait. Maybe I should compute k in terms of inverse femtometers (1/fm).

So, p = 50.51 MeV / c.

Wait, c is in units of MeV fm/ħ, so since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, to compute p in units of MeV fm⁻¹ (since p has units of MeV/c, and c is in MeV fm/ħ), perhaps this is getting too tangled. Let me approach it step by step.

The momentum p is given by p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c² ? Wait, no. Wait, from E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → pc = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2).

So p = sqrt( E_total² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

Wait, let me compute p in units of MeV fm⁻¹.

Given E_total = 50.511 MeV, m c² = 0.511 MeV.

So pc = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ 50.511 MeV.

So p = (50.511 MeV) / c.

But I need p in units of MeV fm⁻¹.

We know that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm. So 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV fm) → 1 fm ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV) * ħ c.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, so 1 fm = ħ c / (197.33 MeV).

Now, p in units of MeV fm⁻¹ is:

p = (50.511 MeV / c) / (ħ) → because k = p / ħ.

Wait, but ħ has units of MeV fm. So:

k = p / ħ = (50.511 MeV / c) / (ħ)

But since c = (ħ c) / ħ = (ħ * c) / ħ → Wait, perhaps it's better to express in terms of units.

Alternatively, since ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, then c = (197.33 MeV fm) / ħ → So 1/c = ħ / (197.33 MeV fm).

Thus, p = (50.511 MeV) * (1/c) = (50.511 MeV) * (ħ) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → p = (50.511 * ħ ) / (197.33 fm) )

But k = p / ħ = (50.511) / (197.33) ) * (ħ / (ħ fm)) ) → 50.511 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2562 → so k ≈ 0.2562 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused with the units. Let me compute k numerically.

We have E = 50 MeV (kinetic energy), so E_total = 50 + 0.511 ≈ 50.511 MeV.

pc = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ 50.511 MeV.

So p = (50.511 MeV) / c.

Now, the wave number k is given by p/ħ. So, we need to express p in units where ħ has units of MeV fm (since ħ c ≈ 197 MeV fm).

So, p = (50.511 MeV) / c.

But c is in units of MeV fm / ħ → because ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → c = (197.33 MeV fm) / ħ.

So, p = (50.511 MeV) / ( (197.33 MeV fm) / ħ ) ) → p = (50.511 MeV * ħ) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → the MeV cancels.

So p = (50.511 / 197.33) * ħ / fm → approximately 0.2562 * ħ / fm.

Then, k = p / ħ = (0.2562 * ħ / fm ) / ħ → k ≈ 0.2562 fm⁻¹.

So 1/k ≈ 3.905 fm.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that the imaginary part is 1/k, so Im(f) = 1/k = 3.905 fm.

But that's not matching any of the options. The options are A) 87163.4 fm, B) 355.351 fm, C) 177.675 fm, D) 251.271 fm.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Hmm, perhaps I was wrong in thinking that only the l=0 term contributes. Let me think again. The amplitude f(θ) is given by summing over all l, each term being (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * something.

Wait, perhaps the angular part for each l is ( (1 + cosθ)^{2l} ) / (1 - cosθ) )^{2l} or something else. Alternatively, the angular dependence for each l is ( (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) )^{l}.

Wait, no, maybe the expression is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * ( (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) )^{l} * (1 + cosθ) )

Wait, because I'm getting mixed up, perhaps I should refer back to the partial wave expansion formula.

Wait, I found in my notes that the differential cross-section in elastic scattering is given by:

dσ/dΩ = |f(θ)|^2 = (1/k²) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1)^2 sin² δ_l ( (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) )^{2l} )

But that's for the differential cross-section, not the amplitude.

Wait, but the amplitude itself is f(θ) = (1/(k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ( (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) )^{l}.

Wait, but if that's the case, then at θ=0, cosθ=1, so (1 - cosθ) is 0. So for any l>0, the term (0/2)^l is zero. Only l=0 contributes, because (0)^0 is 1.

So f(0) = (1/k) (2*0 + 1) e^{i δ_0} sin δ_0 * ( (0/2)^0 ) → (1/k) e^{i δ_0} sin δ_0.

But δ_0 is 90 degrees, so sin δ_0 = 1, and e^{i δ_0} = i.

So f(0) = (i) / k.

Thus, the imaginary part of f(0) is 1/k.

Earlier, I calculated 1/k as approximately 3.905 fm, but that's not matching any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in computing k.

Wait, let's recompute k more carefully.

Given E = 50 MeV (kinetic energy), so the total energy E_total = 50 + 0.511 = 50.511 MeV.

So, E_total² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 = E_total² - (m c²)^2.

m c² = 0.511 MeV → (m c²)^2 = (0.511)^2 ≈ 0.261 (MeV)^2.

E_total² = (50.511)^2 ≈ 50.511 *50.511 ≈ 2551.4 MeV².

So (pc)^2 ≈ 2551.4 - 0.261 ≈ 2551.1 MeV² → pc ≈ sqrt(2551.1) ≈ 50.51 MeV.

So p = (50.51 MeV) / c.

Now, the wave number k is p / ħ.

But in natural units, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm → so 1 fm = 1/(197.33 MeV) * ħ c.

Wait, so we can express p as:

p = (50.51 MeV) / c → but c = (ħ c) / ħ → so p = (50.51 MeV) * ħ / (ħ c) ) → 50.51 MeV * ħ / (197.33 MeV fm) → because ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So p = (50.51 / 197.33) * ħ / fm → approximately 0.2562 * ħ / fm.

Thus, k = p / ħ = 0.2562 fm⁻¹.

So 1/k ≈ 1/0.2562 ≈ 3.905 fm.

Hmm, but according to my earlier calculation, the imaginary part is 1/k ≈ 3.905 fm. But none of the options are close to that. The options are around 177 fm or similar.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that only the l=0 term contributes. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the angular dependence isn't ( (1-cosθ)/(1+cosθ) )^l, but something else. Maybe it's ( (1 + cosθ) )^{something}.

Wait, another approach: I think the correct expression for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) sin δ_l ( (1 + cosθ)/2 )^l.

Wait, perhaps it's f(θ) = (1/(k)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] ( (1 - cosθ)/(2) )^l.

Wait, but at θ=0, cosθ=1, so (1 - cosθ)=0. So for all l>0, the term is zero. Only l=0 contributes. So f(0) = (1/k) * (1) * (e^{i δ_0} sin δ_0 ) * 1.

Since δ_0=90 degrees, e^{i δ_0}=i, sin δ_0=1 → f(0) = i/(k). So Im(f(0)) = 1/k ≈3.905 fm.

But the options don't have that. So I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is different. Maybe it's f(θ) = (1/(k)) sum (2l +1) ( e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) ( (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) )^{l}.

At θ=0, (1 - cosθ)=0, so for l>0, the term is zero. Only l=0 contributes, which is 1/(k) * 1 * (e^{i δ_0} sin δ_0 ) → which is i/(k), so Im(f)=1/k.

Hmm, that's the same as before.

Wait, but maybe the formula is for the real part, and the imaginary part comes from a different expression. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the optical theorem.

Wait, the optical theorem states that the total cross-section is related to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (θ=0).

The formula is:

σ_total = 4π |Re(f(0))|^2 + (4π/k) Im(f(0)) sin δ_0.

Wait, no, perhaps the optical theorem says that the total cross-section is (4π/k) Im(f(0)).

Wait, the optical theorem says that the total scattering cross-section is given by:

σ_total = (4π/k) Im(f(0)).

But in the case of elastic scattering, the forward scattering amplitude is f(0), and the optical theorem relates the total cross-section to Im(f(0)).

Wait, what if the question is asking for Im(f(0))?

Then, Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) σ_total.

But wait, the problem doesn't provide σ_total, so perhaps I'm going the wrong way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute Im(f(0)) as sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l * something else, but I thought only l=0 contributes.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the angular dependence. Let's re-examine.

Another approach: perhaps the scattering amplitude in the partial wave expansion is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * ( (1 + cosθ)^2 )^{l} / (something else).

Alternatively, perhaps the angular part is ( (1 + cosθ) )^{2l} / (something else). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression for f(θ) is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * ( (1 + cosθ) )^{2l} / ( (2)^{2l} ) )

Wait, that might make sense, because for each l, the angular dependence is ( (1 + cosθ)/2 )^{2l}.

But at θ=0, (1 + cosθ)/2 = (2)/2=1. So each term would contribute.

Wait, but then, for each l, the term is (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * 1^{2l} / (2^{2l}).

So f(0)= (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * 1/(4^l).

Wait, but that's different. Because then, all l's contribute.

So let's compute each term for l=0 to l=4.

Compute f(0) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * (1/4^l).

Then, the imaginary part is the sum of (1/k) (2l+1) Im[ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] * (1/4^l).

Im[ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] = Im[ (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) sin δ_l ] = sin^2 δ_l.

So Im(f(0)) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l * (1/4^l).

So for each l:

Compute (2l+1) * sin^2 δ_l * (1/4^l ), sum over l=0 to 4.

Let's compute each term:

l=0:

(2*0 +1)=1,

sin^2(90)=1,

1/4^0 =1.

Term: 1*1*1=1.

l=1:

(2*1+1)=3,

sin^2(67 degrees) → since 67 degrees is approximately 1.17 radians.

Compute sin(67)= approx 0.9205 → sin^2≈0.8472.

So term=3 * 0.8472 * (1/4) =3*0.8472 *0.25≈ 3 * 0.2118 ≈0.6354.

l=2:

(2*2+1)=5,

sin^2(55 degrees) → 55 degrees is about 0.9599 radians.

sin(55)=0.8192 → sin^2≈0.6710.

So term=5 * 0.6710 * (1/16) → 5 * 0.6710 ≈3.355 → divided by 16 → approx 0.2097.

Wait, wait, (1/4^2)=1/16. So 5 *0.6710*(1/16) =5 * 0.6710 /16.

0.6710 *5 =3.355 → 3.355 /16 ≈0.2097.

l=3:

(2*3 +1)=7,

sin^2(30)= (0.5)^2 =0.25.

Term=7 *0.25 * (1/64) → 7 *0.25=1.75 → 1.75 /64≈0.02734.

l=4:

(2*4 +1)=9,

sin^2(13 degrees) → 13 degrees is about 0.2268 radians.

sin(13)≈0.22495 → sin²≈0.0506.

Term=9 *0.0506 * (1/256) → 9 *0.0506≈0.4554 → 0.4554 /256≈0.001779.

So summing all terms:

l=0: 1 → 1.

l=1: 0.6354 → total 1.6354.

l=2: 0.2097 → total 1.8451.

l=3: 0.02734 → total 1.8724.

l=4: 0.001779 → total 1.8742.

So Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * 1.8742.

Now, compute 1/k.

Earlier, we calculated k ≈ 0.2562 fm⁻¹.

So 1/k ≈3.905 fm.

Thus, Im(f(0)) =3.905 *1.8742 ≈7.31 fm.

Wait, but that's still not matching any of the options given. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1/k.

Let me recompute k.

E =50 MeV (kinetic), E_total =50 +0.511=50.511 MeV.

pc = sqrt( E_total^2 - (m c²)^2 ).

m c²=0.511 MeV.

E_total^2 =50.511^2≈2551.4 MeV².

(m c²)^2=0.511^2≈0.261 MeV².

So (pc)^2≈2551.4 -0.261≈2551.14 → pc≈50.51 MeV.

So p = 50.51 MeV / c.

But how to find k in fm⁻¹.

We know that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm → so c = (197.33 MeV fm) / ħ.

So p = 50.51 MeV / [ (197.33 MeV fm) / ħ ] → p = (50.51 MeV * ħ ) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → 50.51 /197.33 ≈0.2562 → p=0.2562 ħ / fm.

Thus, k = p/ ħ = 0.2562 / fm → k≈0.2562 fm⁻¹ → 1/k≈3.905 fm.

So Im(f(0))= (1/k)*1.8742 ≈3.905 *1.8742≈7.31 fm.

But the options don't have 7 fm. So I must be making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is different. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to compute the sum over l, but considering that the angular part isn't (1/4^l), but something else.

Alternative approach: perhaps the correct expression for f(0) is sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l * (1/2^{2l}) ), multiplied by (1/k).

Wait, let me think about this. If the angular part is ( (1 + cosθ)/2 )^{2l}, then at θ=0, it's ( (2)/2 )^{2l} =1^{2l}=1.

So each term is (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l * 1 → f(0) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

But that can't be right because the cross-section would then be large.

Wait, perhaps the correct angular part is ( (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) )^{l}.

At θ=0, this is (0/2)^l=0 for l>0, so only l=0 contributes.

So Im(f(0))= (1/k) * (2*0+1) sin^2 δ_0 → 1/k *1 *1=1/k.

Which brings us back to the initial approach, giving Im(f)=3.905 fm.

But again, this doesn't match any of the provided options.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula for the amplitude. Let me check: the correct expression for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * ( (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) )^{l}.

Wait, but at θ=0, this is zero for all l>0, so only l=0 contributes.

So Im(f(0))=1/k.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to sum all the phase shifts, but my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the sum of all phase shifts, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(k)) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * ( (1 + cosθ) )^{2l} / ( (2)^{2l} ) )

Which would make the angular part ( (1+cosθ)/2 )^{2l}.

At θ=0, (1+cosθ)/2=1, so each term is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * 1.

So Im(f(0))= (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

So compute sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Let's compute each term:

l=0: (1) * sin^2 90=1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2 67 → sin(67)=0.9205 → sin²≈0.8472 → 3 *0.8472=2.5416.

l=2:5 * sin^2 55 → sin(55)=0.8192 → sin²≈0.671 → 5 *0.671=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin^2 30 → 7*(0.25)=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2 13 → sin(13)=0.22495 → sin²≈0.0506 → 9 *0.0506=0.4554.

Sum all these:

1 +2.5416=3.5416,

+3.355=6.8966,

+1.75=8.6466,

+0.4554=9.102.

So sum=9.102.

Thus, Im(f(0))= (1/k) *9.102.

k is 0.2562 fm⁻¹ → 1/k=3.905 fm.

So Im(f(0))=3.905 *9.102≈35.53 fm.

Wait, option B is 355.35 fm, which is 10 times that, but it's around 35.5, which is close to 35.53.

Wait, but 35.53 is not one of the options. The closest option is option B:355.351 fm, which is approximately 10 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in degrees and I should convert them to radians when calculating sine.

Wait, the sine function in the calculation uses degrees? Because in the formula, δ_l is in radians. So perhaps I should have converted degrees to radians.

Wait, yes! That's a critical mistake. All trigonometric functions in physics are in radians. So I must have made a big mistake by using degrees.

So let's recompute everything with δ_l in radians.

Given phase shifts:

δ_0=90 degrees → π/2 radians → approx 1.5708 rad.

sin(π/2)=1.

δ_1=67 degrees → approx 1.16937 radians.

sin(1.16937)= approx 0.9205.

δ_2=55 degrees → approx 0.95993 radians.

sin(0.95993)≈0.8192.

δ_3=30 degrees → approx 0.523599 radians.

sin(0.523599)=0.5.

δ_4=13 degrees → approx 0.226893 radians.

sin(0.226893)= approx 0.22495.

So the previous calculations for sin² δ_l are correct because the phase shifts were treated in radians.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the initial formula for Im(f(0)). Let me clarify.

If the correct expression for Im(f(0)) is (1/k) sum_{l=0}^n (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l, then with the sum of 9.102, and 1/k=3.905 fm, Im(f(0))=35.53 fm.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ (sin δ_l)^2 ] * (1/(2^{2l} )) ), which would be (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l / 4^l.

Wait, earlier, when I used (1/4^l), the sum was 1.8742, leading to Im(f(0))=7.31 fm.

But again, this isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ (sin δ_l)^2 ] * (1/(2^{2l} )).

Wait, let's compute that again.

Compute each term with 1/4^l.

l=0: (1) *1 *1 =1.

l=1:3 * (0.9205)^2 * 1/4 → 3*(0.8472)/4 → 3*0.2118 →0.6354.

l=2:5*(0.8192)^2 *1/16 →5*(0.6710)/16 →5*0.04194 →0.2097.

l=3:7*(0.5)^2 *1/64 →7*(0.25)/64 →1.75/64≈0.02734.

l=4:9*(0.22495)^2 *1/256 →9*(0.0506)/256 →0.4554/256≈0.001779.

Sum all terms: 1 +0.6354=1.6354 +0.2097=1.8451 +0.02734=1.8724 +0.001779≈1.8742.

So Im(f(0))= (1/k)*1.8742 →3.905 *1.8742≈7.31 fm.

But again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(k)) sum (2l+1) [ (sin δ_l)^2 ] * (1/(2^l)).

Wait, let's try that.

Compute each term with 1/2^l.

l=0:1 *1 *1=1.

l=1:3 *0.8472 * 0.5 →3 *0.4236=1.2708.

l=2:5 *0.6710 *0.25 →5 *0.16775=0.83875.

l=3:7 *0.25 *0.125 →7 *0.03125=0.21875.

l=4:9 *0.0506 *0.0625 →9 * 0.0031625=0.02846.

Sum:1 +1.2708=2.2708 +0.83875=3.10955 +0.21875=3.3283 +0.02846≈3.35676.

Im(f)=3.35676 *3.905≈13.10 fm.

Still not matching options.

I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part is given by (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ (sin δ_l)^2 ] * (1/(2^{2l} )) ), which gives 1.8742 *3.905≈7.31 fm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, then:

sum=9.102 → Im(f)=9.102/(2*0.2562) →9.102/(0.5124)≈17.76 fm.

Ah, 17.76 is close to option C:177.675 fm. But it's an order of magnitude larger. Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the wave number k is in 1/fm, but when calculating 1/k, it's in fm. So if I have 1/k=3.905 fm, and multiply by 9.102, I get 35.53 fm.

But option B is 355.35 fm, which is 10 times larger. So what if I made a mistake in the units of k?

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in terms of 1/(fm) correctly.

Let me recompute k.

Given E=50 MeV (kinetic), E_total=50.511 MeV.

pc= sqrt( E_total² - (m c²)^2 )= sqrt(50.511^2 - 0.511^2 ) ≈50.511 MeV.

So p=50.511 MeV / c.

Now, in units where ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, so 1 fm= ħ c/(197.33 MeV) → 1 fm= (197.33 MeV fm )/(197.33 MeV ) → 1 fm=1 fm. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, let's compute p in units of MeV fm⁻¹.

p=50.511 MeV / c → but c= (197.33 MeV fm ) / ħ.

So, p= (50.511 MeV) * ħ / (197.33 MeV fm ) → the MeV units cancel.

So p= (50.511 / 197.33) * ħ / fm → approximately 0.2562 * ħ / fm.

But ħ has units of MeV fm, so p has units of MeV fm * fm⁻¹ ) → MeV.

Wait, no: ħ has units of MeV fm. So ħ / fm → MeV.

So p= (50.511/197.33) * (MeV fm ) / fm → 0.2562 MeV.

So p=0.2562 MeV.

Thus, k= p / ħ → but ħ has units of MeV fm.

Wait, so p=0.2562 MeV → units are MeV.

Thus, p=0.2562 MeV → k= p / ħ.

But ħ c=197.33 MeV fm → ħ= (197.33 MeV fm ) / c → but c is in units of speed, so perhaps I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps k is given by p/(ħ) → and p in units of MeV, ħ in units of MeV fm.

So p=0.2562 MeV, ħ=197.33 MeV fm.

k= p/ħ= 0.2562 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) → the MeV units cancel → 0.2562 /197.33 → approximately 0.00130 fm⁻¹.

Wait, so 1/k≈768 fm.

Wait, that's a big difference. So Im(f)= (1/k) * sum.

If sum is 9.102, then Im(f)=768 *9.102≈6996 fm.

But that's way larger than any option.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Perhaps I should look for alternative approaches or think about this differently.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part is given by (1/(k)) sin^2 δ_0.

Wait, from the l=0 term: Im(f)= (1/k) (1) *1=1/k.

If 1/k is 3.905 fm, then Im(f)=3.905 fm.

But none of the options are near that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im(f(0))= (1/(k)) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) [ (sin δ_l)^2 ] * (1/(2^{2l} )) )

Earlier, that sum was 1.8742, so Im(f)=3.905 *1.8742≈7.31 fm.

Still, no match.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the sum of (2l+1) * tan δ_l.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total cross-section using the optical theorem and then find Im(f(0)).

The optical theorem says σ_total = (4π/k) Im(f(0)).

But I don't have σ_total. So perhaps I can't proceed with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the given options are expecting us to compute just the l=0 term, giving 1/k=3.905 fm, but none of the options are near that.

Wait, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, 355 is about 93 times 3.905 (since 3.905*93≈362). Not exact, but perhaps I made a mistake in units. Wait, maybe k is in inverse meters, not inverse femtometers.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the unit conversion for k. Let me try again.

p=50.511 MeV / c.

In natural units, c=1, and ħ=197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, no, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, p=50.511 MeV / (c).

In terms of ħ: p=50.511 MeV / (c) = (50.511 MeV ) * (1/(c)).

But c is in units of MeV fm / ħ, so p= (50.511 MeV ) * ( ħ/(MeV fm )) ) → because 1/c = ħ/(MeV fm).

So p=50.511 * ħ / fm.

But ħ=197.33 MeV fm.

So p=50.511 * 197.33 MeV fm / fm → 50.511 *197.33 MeV.

Wait, that gives p= (50.511 *197.33) MeV.

But that can't be right because p would have units of MeV, which is energy, not momentum.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in unit conversions. Let me attempt to compute p in units of MeV fm⁻¹.

Given ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ= (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

But c is in units of (fm s⁻¹), but perhaps more accurately, in terms of units where c= speed of light.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation p (MeV/c) = E (MeV) / c^2 * v, but this is getting too tangled.

Perhaps the correct approach is to use the approximation that for high-energy electrons, E≈pc. So p≈E/c.

At E=50 MeV, p≈50 MeV/c.

Now, converting p to units of MeV fm⁻¹:

Since ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, then 1 fm = ħ c / (197.33 MeV ) → 1 fm = (197.33 MeV fm )/(197.33 MeV ) → 1 fm=1 fm. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the wave number k is given by p/(ħ), where p is in units of MeV/c.

So p=50 MeV/c.

In units where ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, then 1 fm= ħ c/(197.33 MeV).

So p=50 MeV/c → since c is in units of fm per some time, perhaps it's easier to think of p in units of MeV fm⁻¹.

Wait, p=50 MeV/c → but c in units of fm/s.

But I'm getting stuck. Perhaps it's better to use a formula for k in terms of E.

k= sqrt(2mE)/(ħ).

But m is the electron mass, which is 0.511 MeV/c².

So,

k= sqrt(2 * m_e * E ) / ħ.

Since E=50 MeV.

So,

k= sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV/c² *50 MeV ) / ħ.

But units can be tricky. Let's compute this numerically.

m_e=0.511 MeV/c².

E=50 MeV.

So numerator: sqrt(2 *0.511 *50 )= sqrt(51.1)= approx7.15 MeV/c².

Wait, but units are in MeV/c² under the square root. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of natural units.

Alternatively, perhaps in natural units, ħ= c=1, so:

k= sqrt(2 m_e E ) = sqrt(2 *0.511 *50 ) = sqrt(51.1)= approx7.15.

So 1/k≈0.14.

But what are the units of k? In natural units, 1/(k) would be in fm, perhaps.

Wait, but earlier, I thought k is about 0.256 fm⁻¹, but perhaps that approach was incorrect.

I'm getting stuck, and perhaps I should give up and try to find an alternative approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is approximately half of option B.

Wait, going back to the sum of (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l, which was 9.102, and 1/k=3.905, giving 35.53 fm. But that's not an option. However, if I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps the sum is 18.204, which would give around 71 fm, but still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula involves (1/(2k)) times the sum, leading to 35.53/2≈17.76 fm, which is close to option C:177.675 fm. But it's an order of magnitude larger.

Wait, perhaps the units for k were in 1/m instead of 1/fm. Let me check.

If k is in 1/m, then 1/k would be in meters. But the options are in femtometers (fm), which is 1e-15 m.

So, if 1/k=3.905 fm, then 1/k=3.905e-15 m.

But I'm not sure. I think I'm stuck, and perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm, but I'm not confident.


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) e^{i \delta_l} \sin \delta_l \left( \frac{1 - \cos \theta}{1 + \cos \theta} \right)^l.
\]

At \(\theta = 0\), \(\cos \theta = 1\), so \((1 - \cos \theta) = 0\). For \(l > 0\), the term \((1 - \cos \theta)^l\) vanishes, leaving only the \(l = 0\) term:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{k} (2 \cdot 0 + 1) e^{i \delta_0} \sin \delta_0.
\]

The imaginary part of \(f(0)\) is:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sin^2 \delta_0.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \(1/k\)
The wave number \(k\) is related to the momentum \(p\) by \(k = p / \hbar\). For high-energy electrons (\(E \gg m_e c^2\)), \(E \approx pc\), so:

\[
p = \frac{E}{c}.
\]

The given energy is \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\), and the speed of light \(c\) is related to \(\hbar\) by \(\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}\). Thus:

\[
p = \frac{50 \, \text{MeV}}{c} = \frac{50 \, \text{MeV} \cdot \hbar}{\hbar c} = \frac{50 \cdot \hbar}{197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}}.
\]

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{50}{197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}} \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

\[
k \approx 0.2536 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

\[
\frac{1}{k} \approx 3.947 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(\text{Im}(f(0))\)
The phase shift for \(l = 0\) is \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ = \pi/2 \, \text{radians}\). Thus:

\[
\sin^2 \delta_0 = \sin^2 \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1.
\]

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{k}.
\]

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 3.947 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare with Options
The computed value of \(\text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 3.947 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. However, option \(C\) (\(177.675 \, \text{fm}\)) is approximately \(45\) times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the interpretation of the angular dependence or the inclusion of higher-order terms in the partial wave expansion. Given the provided options, the closest match to the reasoning is:

**Answer: C**
