Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Wait, wait, wait. I'm a bit confused about the structure here. 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Hmm. Oh, wait, maybe it's a typo or maybe it's a different notation. Let me think. Oh! Oh, wait, benzene rings with substituents are often numbered, but sometimes the substituents are written as -d, which I think stands for deuterium? So maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, meaning the ring has a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? I think that's the correct structure. So the benzene ring has a Br at position 1 and a deuterium (D) at position 2.

So the reaction is with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia solvent. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic substitution, strong bases can abstract protons to form benzyne intermediates. Wait, benzyne? That's when a dihalobenzene loses two halides to form a triple bond, but wait, in this case, we have a bromine and a deuterium.

Wait, another thought: when NaNH2 is used in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, it can abstract a proton adjacent to a leaving group, leading to the formation of a benzynelike intermediate. But wait, in this case, the bromine is at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2. So what happens when we treat this with a strong base like NaNH2?

So the bromine is a good leaving group. But wait, bromide is a leaving group, but deuterium? Wait, deuterium is a hydrogen isotope, so in reactions, deuterium is usually a poor leaving group unless under specific conditions. But NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine, forming a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, but the substituents here are Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So if the base abstracts a proton from position 2, but position 2 has a deuterium instead of a hydrogen. Oh, wait, wait! Deuterium is a heavier isotope of hydrogen. But in terms of acidity, deuterium is slightly less acidic than hydrogen because the bond strength is higher. So in a solution with a strong base like NaNH2, would the base abstract a deuterium (in this case, from position 2)?

Wait, but if the base can't abstract the D because it's less acidic, then maybe it abstracts a hydrogen from another position. But wait, the only substituents are Br and D. Wait, the ring has other hydrogens as well, right? So the benzene ring has positions 1 (Br), 2 (D), and the other positions (3,4,5,6) have regular Hs.

So the reaction is NaNH2 in NH3. This is a common condition for dehydrohalogenation, forming a benzyne intermediate. Benzyne is a triple bond in the ring, which is aromatic and can undergo various reactions, including trapping with another nucleophile.

Wait, but for benzyne formation, you typically need two leaving groups in adjacent positions. For example, 1,2-dihalobenzenes lose two halides to form a triple bond. But in this case, we have a Br and a D. Br is a good leaving group, but D is not. So can we form benzyne here?

Wait, but wait. Let me think: if the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, but that would be either position 2 (which has D) or position 6. Wait, position 2 has a D, not an H. So NaNH2 is a strong base, but would it abstract a D?

I think the acidity of D is lower than H. So in such a solution, maybe the base prefers to abstract a protium (H) rather than deuterium. So if the H adjacent to Br is available, the base would abstract that, forming a carbanion, which then would lose the Br as Br^-.

Wait, but in our case, the substituents are Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So positions adjacent to Br are positions 2 and 6. Position 2 has a D, so maybe the base can't abstract that. So would it abstract from position 6?

Wait, position 6 is a regular H, so the base would abstract that. So when that happens, the carbanion forms at position 2 (but wait, no, because the H is at position 6), the base takes H+ from position 6, so the negative charge is at position 6. Wait, no. Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions are arranged as 1, 2, 3, etc., in a circle. So position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (Br) from the other side.

Wait, if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, then the adjacent Br is at position 1, so the carbanion would form at position 6. But then, the Br would leave as Br^-.

Wait, but in such a scenario, losing Br and the abstracted H would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 2? Or would it form a triple bond between 6 and 1?

Wait, when a proton is abstracted from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1, the carbanion forms at position 6. The Br would leave, so we have a triple bond between positions 1 and 6? Or maybe between 6 and 5? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because the base can't abstract the D at position 2, so there's no adjacent H for the Br to form a triple bond with. Wait, but the ring has other Hs. Let me think about the positions.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Position 1 is Br. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 is D, position 6 is H (since in the starting material, only positions 1 and 2 have substituents; the others are H). So the base can abstract the H from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1.

So when the base (NH2^-) abstracts the H from position 6, the carbanion forms at position 6. Then, the Br leaves as Br^-, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6? Wait, but that would form a triple bond between 1 and 6, but isn't that a meta position? No, wait. Wait, the positions adjacent to each other are 1-2 and 1-6. So if the base removes H from position 6, the adjacent Br at 1 is leaving, so the triple bond would be between 1 and 6, which are adjacent (like positions 1 and 6 in a benzene ring are ortho to each other? Wait, no, in benzene, each position is adjacent to two others. So position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. So removing H from 6 would make the triple bond between 1 and 6, making a diynyl group? Or would it form a triple bond between 1 and 2?

Wait, no. If the H is abstracted from position 6, the adjacent Br is at position 1. Then, when Br leaves, the negative charge would be at position 1 and 6, so the triple bond forms between positions 1 and 6, making a benzynes structure with a triple bond between 1 and 6.

But wait, benzynes are usually formed when two adjacent halogens are present, and both are removed to form the triple bond. But in this case, we only have one Br and a D. So the reaction might not proceed to form benzyne. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is a leaving group. But D is not a good leaving group under normal conditions. Wait, in some cases, deuterium can act as a leaving group, but usually under specific conditions, like in heavy water with acid or base. But in this case, the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a polar aprotic solvent. Hmm.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, then the Br at position 1 could leave, forming a carbanion at position 6. So the structure would have a negative charge at 6, which could then attack another molecule or perhaps form a ring.

Wait, but in this case, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a stable intermediate. Alternatively, maybe the deuterium isn't a leaving group, so the reaction doesn't proceed as expected.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is not involved in the reaction. The NaNH2 is a base, so it abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, which is position 6. So the Br leaves as Br^-, forming a carbanion at position 6, which would then have a negative charge. But without another leaving group, this might not form a triple bond. Wait, but to form a triple bond, you need two adjacent leaving groups. So if only one is present, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed.

Wait, but maybe the D is a leaving group. In that case, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 2 (but position 2 has D, not H), which is not possible. So maybe the reaction doesn't form a triple bond.

Hmm, so if the reaction can't form benzyne, then what else could happen in this situation?

Wait, perhaps the deuterium doesn't play a role, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, leading to the formation of a benzynelike intermediate, but with only one leaving group. So perhaps the mechanism is different.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is a simple elimination. After losing H from position 6 and Br from position 1, a triple bond forms between positions 1 and 6. So the benzene ring would have a triple bond between 1 and 6, making a benzynes structure. But benzynes are usually highly strained and reactive, so they tend to undergo cycloaddition reactions or other trapping mechanisms.

But in this problem, the solvent is condensed ammonia. So once the benzynes is formed, perhaps it can add another amide ion or ammonia molecule. Alternatively, the benzynes might not form because the conditions aren't right.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. When treated with NaNH2 in NH3, what happens?

Well, NaNH2 is a strong base. It abstracts a proton alpha to the Br to form a benzyne intermediate. But in this case, the alpha positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has a D, so the base can't abstract that. Position 6 has an H, so the base can abstract that.

So, the base (NH2^-) abstracts the H from position 6. The Br at position 1 is a good leaving group. So the Br leaves, creating a carbanion at position 6. But wait, that's only one leaving group; for a triple bond to form, you need two adjacent leaving groups.

Hmm, maybe I'm not considering the possibility correctly. Wait, maybe the deuterium is a leaving group. But deuterium isn't a good leaving group under normal conditions. Unless under heavy water and certain conditions. But here, the solvent is ammonia, not heavy water. So I think the D is not leaving.

Wait, but perhaps the D doesn't matter, and the base abstracts the H from position 6, leading to a situation where Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between 1 and 6. So the benzene becomes benzyne with the triple bond between 1 and 6.

But wait, I thought that for benzyne formation, you need two adjacent leaving groups. So if we have only one, how does that work? Maybe the base abstracts the H, the Br leaves, and the ring becomes a diradical or some other intermediate. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzyne because only one leaving group is present. So what else could happen?

Wait, could the deuterium at position 2 act as a leaving group? Unlikely, because D is not a good leaving group. So the only possibility is that the base abstracts H from position 6, and the Br leaves, but without another leaving group, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a triple bond. So maybe the product is just the deprotonated benzene with Br and D substituents. But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond and perhaps another substituent. Wait, but if only one Br is present, how do you form a triple bond? You need two adjacent leaving groups to eliminate.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to recall: when a benzene ring has two substituents that can leave, like two bromines in adjacent positions, NaNH2 would deprotonate to form benzyne. But in this case, we have Br and D. So only Br is a good leaving group. So if the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br (position 6), then the Br leaves, and the ring becomes a diradical or a carbanion, but without another leaving group, it can’t form a triple bond. So perhaps no reaction occurs.

But that can't be right because the question states that the reaction is taking place. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the D is a good enough leaving group under these conditions. So when the base abstracts a proton from position 6, the Br leaves, and the D at position 2 could also leave, but that would require D to be a leaving group, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is not involved, and the base abstracts the H from position 6, leading to the loss of Br and the formation of a carbanion at position 6. But without another leaving group, the ring can't form a triple bond. So perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 6 and a deuterium at position 2, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another possibility: when the base abstracts the H from position 6, the Br leaves, and the ring becomes a diradical. Then, perhaps it undergoes some kind of reaction, but without another leaving group, it's not possible to form a triple bond. So maybe the product is a mono-substituted benzene with a negative charge, but that's not stable.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium at position 2 is replaced by an amide group. Wait, how? Because NaNH2 is a source of NH2^- ions. So maybe a substitution reaction occurs, replacing D with NH2.

Wait, but D is a poor leaving group. So unless the D is somehow converted into a better leaving group, substitution isn't likely. Alternatively, perhaps the D is abstracted by the base, but D is not a proton, so I don't think that's possible.

Wait, another angle: in some cases, when a base abstracts a proton adjacent to a substituent, it can lead to elimination, forming a double bond. But in benzene, all bonds are equivalent, so forming a double bond would require breaking two sigma bonds, which leads to the formation of a triple bond in the ring (benzyne).

Wait, but without two adjacent leaving groups, you can't form the triple bond. So perhaps in this case, only one substitution occurs, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the D at position 2 is a good enough leaving group under these conditions. Let me think: if the base abstracts a proton from position 2 (but wait, that's a D, not H), that's not possible. So the H can only be abstracted from position 6.

So, the base abstracts H from position 6, leading to the loss of Br from position 1, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6. Then, the benzynes can react with another molecule or perhaps undergo some trapping.

But wait, in the given solvent, which is condensed ammonia, the benzynes might trap with an amide ion. So maybe the benzynes can add an amide group, leading to a product like benzene with an amide substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzynes intermediate, which then can add an amide group from the solution. So when the benzynes forms, it might react with another amide ion, leading to a new substituent.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the possible products. Let me think about what the question is asking: how many possible organic products are formed?

If NaNH2 abstracts a proton from position 6, then Br leaves, and the triple bond forms between positions 1 and 6, forming benzyne. Then, the benzynes could react with ammonia or amide ions in the solution.

Wait, but what's the role of the solvent here? The solvent is condensed ammonia. So when the benzynes forms, it might react with NH2^- as a nucleophile. So perhaps the benzynes would add an NH2 group at some position, leading to a new substitution.

Wait, but where would the NH2 group add? Benzynes are symmetric, so adding NH2 could happen in two different positions, leading to different products. Or maybe only one position is possible.

Wait, benzynes is a triple bond between two positions, and when it reacts with a nucleophile, the nucleophile can attack either end, leading to products with the new group in either of the adjacent positions.

Wait, in the case of benzyne, when it reacts with a nucleophile like NH2^-, the nucleophile can add to either end of the triple bond, forming either ortho, meta, or para products. But wait, no, in benzyne trapping, the nucleophile adds to form adjacent substituents.

Wait, no, actually, when a benzynes intermediate is formed, adding a nucleophile will add across the triple bond, leading to two new substituents adjacent to each other. So for example, if the triple bond is between positions 1 and 6, adding NH2^- would add to position 1 and 6, creating a 1,2-diamine benzene structure.

But wait, in this case, the starting material already has a Br at 1 and D at 2. So after the reaction, would the Br and D be replaced or not?

Wait, perhaps I should think of the reaction steps:

1. 1-bromo-2-d benzene reacts with NaNH2, which abstracts a proton from position 6, adjacent to Br at 1.

2. The Br leaves, forming a carbanion at position 6, but without another leaving group, the structure becomes benzyne (triple bond between 1 and 6).

3. The benzynes intermediate then reacts with another amide ion (NH2^-), adding it across the triple bond, leading to a 1,6-diamino benzene ring.

Wait, but the starting material already has substituents at positions 1 and 2. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzynes formation leads to loss of Br and D, but that doesn't make sense because D isn't a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible products. If the reaction forms a benzynes intermediate, perhaps it will trap with another amide ion. The benzynes has a triple bond, so when the nucleophile (NH2^-) adds, it can add in two different ways, leading to different products. But wait, the triple bond is symmetric, so the product would be the same regardless of where the nucleophile attacks.

Wait, no, in the case of benzynes, the addition of a nucleophile across the triple bond would lead to two new substituents on adjacent carbons. So if the triple bond is between 1 and 6, adding NH2^- would lead to NH2 groups at positions 1 and 2? Or positions 6 and 1?

Wait, perhaps the positions are 1 and 6, so adding NH2^- would lead to substitution at both positions, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 group would add to the triple bond in a way that forms a new ring structure. Hmm.

But I'm getting stuck on this. Let me think about the possible products again. The starting material has Br at 1 and D at 2.

If the reaction forms a benzynes (triple bond between 1 and 6), then when NH2^- adds, it would add to each end of the triple bond. So the product would have NH2 groups at positions 1 and 6. But wait, the original Br was at position 1, which would be replaced by NH2. So the product would be 1-amino-6-deutero benzene? Or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the D at position 2 remains, and the Br at 1 is replaced by NH2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a benzynes intermediate. Maybe the base abstracts a proton, the Br leaves, and the ring becomes a carbanion at position 6. Then, the ring could undergo some kind of trapping reaction. But I'm not sure what that would look like.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed because only one leaving group is present. But that can't be the case because the question is asking about possible products, implying that some reaction occurs.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the deuterium is inert, and the reaction is similar to a typical dehydrohalogenation to form benzyne, but with only one leaving group. So the reaction may not proceed, but the question says it does, so maybe there's an alternative pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is replaced by something else. For example, the base could abstract a proton adjacent to D, but since D is a poor leaving group, that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple substitution, replacing Br with NH2. But that would be an SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution), which typically requires a good leaving group and a strongly activating group. Bromine is a leaving group, but without an activating group, SNAr is unlikely. Also, NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it's more about elimination than substitution.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to outline possible products:

1. If the reaction forms a benzynes intermediate and then traps with NH2^-, the product would be a benzene ring with NH2 groups at positions 1 and 6. But the starting material already has a Br at 1 and D at 2. So after substitution, Br would be replaced by NH2 at 1, but position 6 would have a new NH2 group. So that would give a di-substituted benzene with NH2 at 1 and 6, and D at 2. But that seems unlikely because the D is at position 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzynes, but instead forms something else.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction forms a carbanion at position 6, which could then react with something else. But in the solvent of NH3, perhaps the carbanion could pick up an NH2 group.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the carbanion could undergo some kind of ring expansion or contraction, but that's unlikely.

Another thought: Maybe the D is not involved, and the reaction leads to substitution of Br with NH2. But for SNAr, you typically need a strongly activated ring, which this isn't. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is replaced by NH2. But again, without a good leaving group, that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, and the Br leaves, forming a benzynes intermediate. Then, when the benzynes reacts with NH3, it adds an NH2 group at position 6, leading to a new substitution.

So the product would be 1-amino-6-deutero benzene. But wait, the starting material has Br at 1 and D at 2. So during the reaction, Br would be replaced by NH2 at 1, and another NH2 would add at 6. So it would have NH2 at 1 and 6, and D at 2. But that seems like a di-substituted product.

But I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps only one substitution occurs, leading to a mono-substituted product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a benzynes intermediate, which then adds an NH2 group. But since the benzynes is a symmetric triple bond, the product would have the NH2 group added in two different positions, leading to two possible products. But wait, if the triple bond is between 1 and 6, adding NH2 groups to each end would lead to positions 1 and 6 being substituted. So the product would be 1,2-diaminobenzene? No, because the triple bond is between 1 and 6, so adding to those would lead to positions 1 and 6, which are adjacent. So that would be 1,2-diaminobenzene, but the starting material already has D at 2.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to think about the possible products:

1. The reaction may form a benzynes intermediate, which then adds an NH2 group to form 1,6-diaminobenzene, but considering the starting substituents, it's more likely that the product would have NH2 at 1 and something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the loss of Br and D, but that doesn't make sense because D isn't a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple substitution, replacing Br with NH2. So the product would be 1-amino-2-d benzene. But would that happen under these conditions? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could then react with something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a benzynes intermediate, which then undergoes some kind of trapping. The benzynes would have a triple bond between 1 and 6. When it reacts with ammonia, the NH2 group could add across the triple bond, leading to a 1,6-diaminobenzene. But the starting material has D at position 2, so the product would have NH2 at 1 and 6, and D at 2. So the product would be 1,2,6-trisubstituted benzene, but that seems unlikely because NH2 groups are strong activating groups and would typically add in positions that are activated.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the reaction again. The key is that the starting material has Br at 1 and D at 2. The reaction is with NaNH2 in NH3. NaNH2 is a strong base, so it abstracts H from position 6, leading to the loss of Br and forming a triple bond between 1 and 6 (benzyne). The benzynes then can react with the amide ions in the solution.

The benzynes is symmetric, so when the nucleophile (NH2^-) attacks, it can do so at either end of the triple bond. So the product would be a diamine with the NH2 groups at positions 1 and 6. But the starting material already has D at position 2. So the product would have Br replaced by NH2 at 1, and another NH2 at 6, with D at 2. But wait, the benzynes would lose the Br, so the substitution would occur at 1 and 6.

Wait, no, the benzynes is formed by losing Br and H from position 6. So the Br is gone, and the triple bond is between 1 and 6. Then, the benzynes would add NH2 groups to 1 and 6. But the original substituent at position 2 is D, so that would remain.

Wait, so the product would have NH2 at 1 and 6, and D at 2. But how many distinct products would that be?

Wait, but the reaction may lead to different positions of substitution. Since the benzynes is symmetric, adding NH2 to positions 1 and 6 would result in the same product regardless of which end the NH2 adds. So it would form a single product, 1,6-diamino-2-d benzene.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the benzynes can react in two different ways, leading to different products.

Wait, another possibility: the benzynes could undergo an intramolecular attack, leading to a ring contraction or expansion. But that's probably beyond the scope of this question.

Alternatively, perhaps when the benzynes forms, it can add an NH2 group to either end, but since the benzynes is symmetric, it results in only one possible product.

So, in this case, the reaction would produce one product: 1,6-diamino-2-d benzene.

But wait, the benzynes is formed by losing H and Br, so the product would have the NH2 groups at positions 1 and 6. But the starting material has D at 2, so the product would have D at 2 and NH2 at 1 and 6.

But is that possible? Or would the D be replaced?

Wait, perhaps the D remains, so the product would have NH2 at 1 and 6, and D at 2. So that's a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzynes and instead forms a different product. For example, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to a carbanion which then captures an amide group, leading to substitution at position 6.

But in that case, the product would be 6-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another possibility: the base abstracts the H from position 6, forming a carbanion at 6. Then, the Br leaves, and the ring becomes a benzynes, which then reacts with another amide ion to add an NH2 group across the triple bond. So the product would have NH2 at positions 1 and 6, with D at position 2. So that's one product.

But perhaps the D at position 2 could also react in some way. But since D is not a good leaving group, that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a single product, where Br is replaced by NH2 at position 1, and another NH2 is added at position 6. So the product would have NH2 at positions 1 and 6, and D at 2.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that can't be the case as the question implies that a reaction occurs.

Wait, another angle: The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. When NaNH2 abstracts a proton from position 6, the Br leaves, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6. The benzynes then adds an amide group, leading to substitution at positions 1 and 6. So the product would be 1,6-diamino-2-d benzene. Thus, only one product is formed.

But wait, perhaps the benzynes could add the amide group in a different way, leading to more than one product. Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't form the benzynes and just forms a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a single product where the Br is replaced by NH2, and the D remains. So the product would be 1-amino-2-d benzene. But would that be the case?

Wait, if the base abstracts H from position 6, leading to the loss of Br and the formation of a carbanion at 6. Then, the NH2^- could attack the adjacent position, leading to substitution at position 6. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a single product, leading to substitution at position 6. So the product would be 6-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options provided. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

The question is about the number of possible products. If the reaction forms a single product, the answer is B)1. If it forms two products, the answer is C)2.

But how many products can form from this reaction?

If the benzynes adds an amide group in a way that leads to two different products, then the answer would be 2. But if the addition leads to only one product due to symmetry, then the answer is 1.

Wait, benzynes is symmetric around the triple bond. So when the amide ion attacks, it can attack either end, but due to the symmetry, the product would be the same. So only one product is formed.

Therefore, the reaction would produce one product. So the correct answer would be option B)1.

But wait, in the starting material, position 2 has D. So when the benzynes forms, the positions 1 and 6 are where the substitution occurs. So the product would have NH2 at 1 and 6, and D at 2. So that's a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzynes and instead leads to substitution of Br with NH2, resulting in a single product with NH2 at 1 and D at 2. But I'm not certain.

In the absence of more information, I think the most plausible answer is that only one product is formed. So the answer is B)1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base that typically abstracts a proton adjacent to a leaving group, facilitating the formation of a benzyne intermediate. In this case, the bromine at position 1 is a good leaving group, and the adjacent hydrogens are at positions 2 and 6. However, position 2 contains a deuterium (D), which is less acidic and a poor leaving group compared to protium (H). Therefore, the base abstracts the hydrogen at position 6, leading to the loss of bromine at position 1 and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, creating a benzyne intermediate.

The benzyne intermediate is highly reactive and can react with the amide ion (NH₂⁻) in the solvent. The amide ion acts as a nucleophile and adds across the triple bond of the benzyne. Due to the symmetry of the benzyne intermediate, the addition of the amide ion occurs in a single manner, resulting in a single product where the NH₂ group is added across positions 1 and 6. The starting material also has a deuterium at position 2, which remains unaffected during the reaction.

Thus, the reaction produces a single organic product: 1,6-diamino-2-deutero benzene. There are no other possible products because the benzyne intermediate reacts in a single way, and the deuterium at position 2 does not participate in the reaction.
