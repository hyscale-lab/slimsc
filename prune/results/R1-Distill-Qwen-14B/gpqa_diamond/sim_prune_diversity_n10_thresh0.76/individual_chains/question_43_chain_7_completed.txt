Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about naming a benzene ring with several substituents using IUPAC nomenclature. Hmm, I remember that the numbering of substituents on a benzene ring starts with the functional group of highest priority.

Wait, the question says the molecule has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Oh, and there are other groups too: ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Plus, the methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile.

First, I think I need to sketch this structure to visualize it better. Let me imagine the benzene ring. The main functional group here is the carboxylic acid because it has the highest priority. So, the numbering will start from there.

Let me number the carboxylic acid as position 1. Then, the substituents around it are at specific positions. The carbaldehyde (formyl group) is meta to the carboxylic acid. Since meta is three positions away, the formyl would be at position 4? Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, the numbering comes from the substituent with the highest priority, so the carboxylic acid is at position 1.

Wait, no. The main substituent in benzoic acid is the COOH group. So, the ring is numbered such that the COOH is at position 1. Then, other substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers.

So, the substituents are: COOH (position 1), formyl (position 3?), nitrile (position 5?), and other groups like hydroxyl, methoxy, and dimethylamino.

Wait, the problem says all three groups (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano) are meta to one another. Oh wait, that's confusing. Because each is meta to the others? Or all three are meta to the same position?

Wait, perhaps the three substituents are arranged in such a way that each is meta to the others. That would mean they are in positions 1, 3, and 5 of the ring. Since the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the formyl would be at position 3, and the cyano at position 5. But wait, that's a possibility.

But the problem states that the carboxylic acid, the formyl, and the cyano are all meta to each other. So, each is meta relative to the others. So, that would require them to be at positions 1,3,5 on the ring. Let me confirm that: if the COOH is at 1, then the formyl is at 3, which is meta to 1 (since 3 is two positions away, which is meta). Similarly, the cyano would be at 5, which is also meta to 1 and to formyl (since 5 is two positions away from 3). Hmm, that makes sense.

So, positions 1: COOH, 3: formyl (CHO), 5: CN.

Then, the problem states that ortho to the carboxylic acid (positions 2 and 6) are a hydroxyl (OH) and a dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2). Wait, ortho to COOH (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. So, which substituents are there? One is OH, another is N(CH3)2. So, positions 2 and 6 have these groups.

But wait, the problem says the methoxy and the alcohol are also ortho to the nitrile. The nitrile is at position 5. So, ortho to 5 would be positions 4 and 6. Because in a benzene ring, the positions adjacent to 5 are 4 and 6.

Wait, the substituents ortho to the nitrile (position 5) are positions 4 and 6. But one of those substituents is position 6, which is already occupied by either the OH or the N(CH3)2.

Wait, but the problem says the methoxy and alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile. So, both OH and OMe are ortho to CN (position 5). So, the nitrile is at position 5, and the ortho positions are 4 and 6.

So, substituents at positions 4 and 6 would be OMe and OH. But wait, position 6 is also ortho to COOH (position 1). So, let me try to map this out.

Let me try to assign each position:

1: COOH (carboxylic acid)
3: CHO (formyl group)
5: CN (cyano group)

Now, substituents ortho to COOH (1) are positions 2 and 6. Those substituents are a hydroxyl (OH) and a dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2). So, either position 2 is OH and 6 is NMe2, or vice versa.

But the problem also says the methoxy is para to COOH. Para to 1 is position 4. So, position 4 has OMe.

Wait, that's a key point. The methoxy is para to COOH, so position 4 is OMe. Also, the OH and OMe are both ortho to the nitrile (position 5). Ortho to 5 are positions 4 and 6. So, position 4 is OMe, so position 6 has to be the other substituent. But position 6 is also ortho to COOH (position 1).

Wait, position 6 is ortho to COOH (1) and ortho to CN (5). So, position 6 could have either OMe or OH. But wait, OMe is at position 4.

So, the substituents at positions 2 and 6 are OH and NMe2. Let me see:

Option 1: Position 2 is OH, position 6 is NMe2.

But then, the methoxy is at position 4 (para to COOH). Now, are OMe and OH both ortho to CN (position 5)?

Position 5 (CN) has ortho positions 4 and 6. Position 4 is OMe, which is correct. Position 6 is NMe2, which is not OH. So, in this arrangement, only OMe is ortho to CN, but the OH is at position 2, which is meta to CN (since position 2 is two away from position 5). So, this doesn't satisfy the condition that both OMe and OH are ortho to CN.

So, this arrangement doesn't work.

Option 2: Position 2 is NMe2, position 6 is OH.

So, position 6 is OH, which is ortho to CN (at 5). Methoxy is at 4, also ortho to CN (at 5). So, both OMe and OH are ortho to CN. That works.

So, let's see the substituents:

1: COOH

2: NMe2 (dimethylamino)

3: CHO

4: OMe

5: CN

6: OH

So, now the numbering is as follows:

1: COOH

2: NMe2

3: CHO

4: OMe

5: CN

6: OH

Wait, but the substituents at positions 2, 4, 5, 6.

Another way to look at the numbering is the main chain. The main group is the carboxylic acid, so it's the benzoic acid. The substituents are at positions 2,3,4,5,6.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial arrangement. Let me check again.

Wait, the main functional group is the carboxylic acid. So, position 1 is where the COOH is attached. The other substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers.

So, positions 2,3,4,5,6 are the others.

So, substituents are:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2)

Position 3: formyl (CHO)

Position 4: methoxy (OCH3)

Position 5: cyano (CN)

Position 6: hydroxyl (OH)

Wait, but in this arrangement, the formyl is at position 3 (meta to COOH), which is correct. The nitrile is at 5, which is meta to COOH as well since 5 is two positions away from 1 (since 1,3,5 is a meta arrangement).

But wait, the nitrile is at 5. Then, the substituents on positions 4 and 6 (ortho to 5) are OMe (4) and OH (6). So, both OMe and OH are ortho to CN, which fits the problem statement.

So that seems correct.

Now, when writing the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, and the numbering starts from the COOH group.

Wait, but the substituent order is based on their priority when numbering the ring. So, the substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible set of numbers.

Wait, but the main chain is the benzoic acid, so the numbering is fixed with COOH at position 1. Then, the substituents are numbered in the order of their priority, but wait, no. Actually, substituents are numbered in such a way that the substituents with higher priority get the lowest numbers.

Wait, but the substituents are listed in alphabetical order in the name, regardless of their position numbers.

Wait, the substituents are: 2-(dimethylamino), 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy.

So, the name would be:

The base is benzoic acid.

Then, substituents are at positions 2,3,4,5,6: dimethylamino, formyl, methoxy, cyano, hydroxy.

But wait, in IUPAC nomenclature, the substituents are listed alphabetically in the name. So, the order would be based on the substituent's name.

So, the substituents are:

-Cyano (CN), which is at position 5.

-Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2), at position 2.

-Formyl (CHO), at position 3.

-Hydroxy (OH), at position 6.

-Methoxy (OCH3), at position 4.

So, the alphabetical order is:

1. Cyano (C comes before D, H, M)
2. Dimethylamino (D)
3. Formyl (F)
4. Hydroxy (H)
5. Methoxy (M)

Wait, but wait: the substituents are written in alphabetical order, but their positions in the numbering are determined by the numbering that gives the lowest possible numbers.

Wait, no. The substituents are written in alphabetical order regardless of their positions. The numbering of the ring is such that the functional group with the highest priority gets the lowest number, and then substituents are numbered to give the lowest possible set of numbers. But for substituents with the same priority, their numbering is arranged to give the lowest set.

Wait, but in this case, the main group is the COOH, and then the substituents are numbered 2,3,4,5,6.

So, the substituents in the name are listed in alphabetical order.

So, let's list the substituent names:

- 2-(dimethylamino)
- 3-formyl
- 4-methoxy
- 5-cyano
- 6-hydroxy

The substituents in the name will be ordered alphabetically as:

Cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

So, the name would start with benzoic acid, followed by the substituents in that order.

So, the name would be 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D says: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. That matches.

Wait, let's check other options.

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Hmm, position 3 is cyano, but according to our structure, cyano is at 5. So A is incorrect.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Wait, substituents are in different positions. Let me see: 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy,5-formyl,6-dimethylamino. Our structure has hydroxy at 6, cyano at 5, formyl at 3, etc. So this doesn't match.

Option C: 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid.

So substituents are at 2: dimethylamino; 3: formyl;4: OMe;5: CN;6: OH. But according to our structure, that's exactly correct. So the name would be 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid.

Wait, but according to alphabetical order, the substituents are ordered as cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy. So the substituents in the name should come in that order, prefixed by their position numbers.

So, the correct order in the name would be:

5-cyano, 2-dimethylamino,3-formyl,6-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

Wait, no. Because the substituents are ordered alphabetically, not by their position. So the substituents are:

cyano (C), dimethylamino (D), formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M).

So the name should be:

5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Looking at the options, Option D is exactly that.

Wait, but I thought Option C had the substituents in the correct positions. Let me check the options again.

Option C: 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid.

Wait, in this option, the substituents are in the correct positions but not in alphabetical order. Because in the name, the substituents are ordered alphabetically, regardless of their positions. So the substituent with the earliest letter in the alphabet comes first.

So, the correct name should have the substituents ordered as cyano (C), then dimethylamino (D), then formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M).

Thus, the name would be: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. Which is Option D.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the substituents are meta to each other. Let me confirm again.

In our structure, COOH (1), CHO (3), CN (5). So they are all meta. Correct.

The substituents at positions 2 and 6 are NMe2 and OH. And at position 4 is OMe.

And the OMe and OH are both ortho to CN (5), which is correct.

So, the substituents are:

2: NMe2

3: CHO

4: OMe

5: CN

6: OH

So, their positions are correct.

Hence, the correct IUPAC name is Option D.


To determine the correct IUPAC name of the given molecule, we start by identifying the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring. The carboxylic acid group (COOH) is the functional group of highest priority and is assigned position 1. The other substituents are then numbered relative to this group.

### Key Information:
1. **Substituents on the benzene ring**:
   - **Carboxylic acid (COOH)** at position 1.
   - **Carbaldehyde (CHO)** is meta to COOH, so it is at position 3.
   - **Cyano group (CN)** is meta to COOH and CHO, so it is at position 5.
   - **Dimethylamino group (N(CH₃)₂)** is ortho to COOH, so it is at position 2.
   - **Hydroxyl group (OH)** is ortho to COOH and also ortho to CN, so it is at position 6.
   - **Methoxy group (OCH₃)** is para to COOH and ortho to CN, so it is at position 4.

2. **Substituent positions**:
   - Position 1: COOH
   - Position 2: N(CH₃)₂
   - Position 3: CHO
   - Position 4: OCH₃
   - Position 5: CN
   - Position 6: OH

3. **Alphabetical order of substituents**:
   - Cyano (C)
   - Dimethylamino (D)
   - Formyl (F)
   - Hydroxy (H)
   - Methoxy (M)

4. **Constructing the IUPAC name**:
   - The base name is **benzoic acid**.
   - Substituents are listed in alphabetical order, prefixed by their positions:
     - 5-cyano
     - 2-(dimethylamino)
     - 3-formyl
     - 6-hydroxy
     - 4-methoxy

Thus, the correct IUPAC name is **5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**, which matches **Option D**.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect positions for cyano, dimethylamino, and formyl groups.
- **Option B**: Incorrect positions for hydroxyl and methoxy groups.
- **Option C**: Substituents are in correct positions but not listed in alphabetical order.
- **Option D**: Correct positions and substituents listed in alphabetical order.
