Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The problem says we've got a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh wait, that's the potential for a 3D harmonic oscillator, right? Because in one dimension, the harmonic oscillator has that form, and since it's isotropic, it's the same in all directions.

So the question is about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. Hmm. I remember that in 3D, the harmonic oscillator can be treated as three independent 1D oscillators, each in the x, y, and z directions. So the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz.

The energy levels for each direction are E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the quantum number (n=0,1,2,...). So the total energy in 3D would be the sum of each direction's energy. So E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, but wait. Oh right, actually, the principal quantum number for the 3D harmonic oscillator is given by n = nx + ny + nz. Because each direction contributes its own quantum number. So the energy is E = (n + 3/2) ħω.

So the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers. Now, the third excited state. Hmm. Wait, the ground state is n=0 (since all nx, ny, nz are 0), which gives E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω.

The first excited state would be when n=1, because that's the next possible sum. So the states are ordered by increasing n. So the third excited state would be when n=3, because the ground state is n=0 (no excitation), first excited n=1, second n=2, third n=3.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. Ground state is n=0, so that's the zeroth excited state. Then first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So the third excited state corresponds to n=3.

So the energy is E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's the first part of the answer.

Now, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. So for each energy level with a given n, how many different ways can the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz add up to n? Because each unique combination (nx, ny, nz) with the same sum will have the same energy, and each is an eigenfunction.

So for a given n, the number of eigenfunctions (or the degeneracy) is the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation nx + ny + nz = n. That's a combinatorics problem. How many ways can three non-negative integers add up to n?

I remember that the formula for the number of solutions is (n + 3 - 1) choose (3 - 1) ) = (n+2 choose 2). Or (n+2)(n+1)/2. Wait, because for (n + 3 - 1) choose (3-1), that's (n+2) choose 2.

So for n=3, that would be (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5 *4 /2 = 10. So 10 eigenfunctions. So the degeneracy is 10.

Looking back at the options:

Option A is (9/2) ħω and 10. So that matches.

Option C is (9/2) ħω but 3, which doesn't match because the degeneracy for n=3 is 10.

Option B and D have expressions involving pi and r, which don't look like the correct energy expression. Because the energy is (n+3/2) ħω, so they should have that form. So options B and D can be dismissed because their energies don't fit.

So the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ moving in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels of the system are determined by the quantum numbers $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ associated with the three independent one-dimensional oscillators. The total energy is given by $E = \left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number.

The ground state corresponds to $n = 0$, and the third excited state corresponds to $n = 3$. Substituting $n = 3$ into the energy formula, the energy of the third excited state is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

Next, the degeneracy of the energy level corresponds to the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given $n$. This is determined by the number of non-negative integer solutions to $n_x + n_y + n_z = n$. For $n = 3$, the number of solutions is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{n + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Correct, as it matches the energy $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$ and the degeneracy 10.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as the energy expression does not match the harmonic oscillator energy formula.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it lists the correct energy but the wrong degeneracy (3 instead of 10).
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as the energy expression does not match the harmonic oscillator energy formula.

The correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
