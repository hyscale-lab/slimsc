Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that's problematic because it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. The plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and see which mutation would eliminate the compound.

The question gives me the intact gene sequence and four mutant sequences, each showing changes in the first exon area. My job is to figure out which mutation would most likely stop the anti-nutritional compound from being made. So, I'm guessing this is about a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, possibly by causing a premature stop codon or a frameshift that changes the protein significantly.

Wait, but how do I approach this? Let me think about the basics. Mutations can be missense (changing one amino acid), nonsense (introducing a stop codon), or they can cause frameshifts which change the reading frame and downstream amino acids. Alternatively, if the mutation is in a non-critical region, maybe it won't affect the protein much.

Looking at the sequences, the first thing I should do is compare each mutant's DNA sequence to the intact gene. I'll probably need to look for where the changes are and what they mean in terms of the mRNA and the resulting protein.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ (the 5’ end is the start, right? Because genes are transcribed into mRNA, which is read from 5' to 3').

Let me look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So comparing to the intact gene, let's see where the differences are. Let's line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT GCG …
Wait, the fourth codon in intact is CTC (which is a serine), and in Mutant1, it's TAC. So the fourth codon changes from CTC to TAC.

CTC is serine, TAC is tyrosine. So that's a missense mutation, substituting serine with tyrosine. But would that affect the function? Maybe, but unless it's in a critical region, it might not be enough. Also, looking further, I see the last part of the sequence in mutant1 ends with TCGC instead of TCGT. So the last codon in the example part is CGT in intact, which is arginine, and in mutant1, it's CGC (still arginine). So that part isn't affected.

So mutant1 has two changes: the fourth codon (from CTC to TAC) and the last codon (
