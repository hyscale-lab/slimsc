Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the algorithm does. Let's see. The question gives two examples:

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

And then I need to find the output for ACAGTGACC. The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351.

Hmm, where do I start? Well, maybe I should look for a pattern in how the inputs are converted to their outputs.

First, looking at AGG. AGG is a DNA sequence, right? Or maybe RNA? Well, DNA is usually A, T, C, G, but RNA uses U instead of T. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Wait, the output is a number, so maybe each nucleotide is converted into a number and then summed.

Let me think: AGG has three nucleotides. Maybe each letter corresponds to a number. Let's see. A is the first in the alphabet, so maybe 1. G is the 7th letter. So A=1, G=7, G=7. So AGG would be 1 +7 +7 =15. But wait, the output is 115. Hmm, that's way bigger. So maybe each letter is multiplied by something or assigned a different value.

Wait, maybe the numbers are based on the position in the DNA/RNA, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each base contributes a two-digit number. Let's think about that.

Another approach: Maybe each nucleotide is converted to its ASCII value and then summed. Let's check that. The ASCII for 'A' is 65, 'G' is 71. So AGG would be 65 +71 +71 = 207. But the output is 115, which is way smaller. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe it's a different coding system. Like each base is assigned a value, perhaps A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4? Let
