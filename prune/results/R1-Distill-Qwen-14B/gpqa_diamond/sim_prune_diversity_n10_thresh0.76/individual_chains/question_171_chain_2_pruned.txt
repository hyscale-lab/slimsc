Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring influence where the bromine adds. The question is about the para isomer's weight fraction in each case, and we need to arrange the substances from least to most in terms of para yield.

Let me think. Electrophilic substitution is directed by the groups already present. Activating groups activate the ring, making it more reactive, and they direct the incoming electrophile to specific positions—like ortho, meta, or para. Deactivating groups do the opposite, making the ring less reactive and also directing where the substitution happens.

So for each substituent, I need to determine if it's activating or deactivating and whether it's ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.

Looking at the substances:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. Alkyl groups are activating and ortho/para-directing. So the bromine would add mostly at para position, I think, but also some ortho. Wait, but wait, para is usually more favored because of steric hindrance in ortho. Or maybe not—maybe the methyl group directs equally to ortho and para. But in any case, it's activating, so the ring is more reactive, and the substitution is more likely. So for this substituent, para is a major product.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's an ethyl ester, so the group is OOCR (where R is ethyl). Wait, wait, the substituent here is an ester group. Esters are deactivating because of the electronegative oxygen. They have a carbonyl group, which is electron-withdrawing. So ester groups are deactivating and meta-directing. Because the group is deactivating, the ring is less reactive, so the substitution is harder. But since it's meta-directing, the bromine would add mostly in the meta position relative to the ester group. That means the para isomer is not a major product here, but wait, no. Wait, wait, the substituent is meta-directing, so the incoming electrophile adds
