Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Each reaction uses different starting materials and reagents, and then the products from both are combined. They're then analyzed using two different HPLC columns: one normal-phase and one chiral. The question is about how many peaks each will show.

Alright, let me break down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

Wait, LAH is lithium aluminum hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. Hexan-3-one is a ketone. So LAH would reduce the ketone group. But wait, the molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is hexane with a ketone on carbon 3 and a methoxy group on carbon 5.

When LAH reduces the ketone, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product would be 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but in reality, the structure is CH2CH2 is between the ketone and the methoxy group. So after reduction, the ketone (C=O) becomes CH-OH. So the product is 3-hexanol with a methoxy group on C5.

But wait, the starting material is (S) configuration. So the product after reduction would be a secondary alcohol, and the configuration at that center would depend on the reaction. Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically doesn't change the configuration because it's a ketone, which is a planar sp2 center. So when you reduce a ketone, the new alcohol's configuration depends on the starting material's structure. Wait, but since the starting ketone is at C3, the reduction would create a secondary alcohol at C3. But the configuration around C3 after reductionâ€”I think the configuration there was originally (S) in the starting material, but wait, the starting material's configuration is at C5? No, wait. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.
