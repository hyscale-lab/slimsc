Okay, so I've got this problem about quantum mechanics, specifically dealing with spin-half particles. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, the Pauli z-matrix. The task is to find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z +5σ_x. The options are given, and I need to choose which one is correct.

Hmm, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable on a large number of identical systems in the same state. So to find ⟨10σ_z +5σ_x⟩, I can probably break this into two parts: find ⟨10σ_z⟩ and ⟨5σ_x⟩ separately, then add them together.

Wait, but expectation values are linear. So yes, the expectation of a sum is the sum of expectations, and the expectation of a scalar times an operator is the scalar times the expectation of the operator. So that simplifies things: 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩.

So I just need to find ⟨σ_z⟩ and ⟨σ_x⟩ for the given state, then plug them into the equation.

First, let's think about the state. It's given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. So, the coefficients are a = 0.5 and b = √3/2. Wait a second, I should check if this state is normalized. The sum of the squares of the magnitudes of a and b should be 1.

Calculating: |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2 is (√3/2)^2 = (3/4)=0.75. Adding them: 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, the expectation value of σ_z is straightforward. σ_z has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. The expectation value ⟨σ_z⟩ is |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1).

Wait, let me compute that. a is 0.5, so |a|^2 is 0.25. So 0.25*(1) is 0.25. b is √3/2, so |b|^2 is 0.75, and 0.75*(-1) is -0.75. Adding them together: 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σ_z⟩ is -0.5.

Wait, but wait! The operator is 10σ_z, so 10 times that expectation. So 10*(-0.5) is -5.

Now, onto σ_x. The expectation value of σ_x is a bit trickier because σ_x doesn't have |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as eigenstates. Instead, σ_x has eigenstates along the x-axis, which are (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/√2 and (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/√2. But that's not directly helpful here. 

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the expectation value of σ_x. Let me recall that σ_x is represented by the Pauli matrix:

σ_x = [[0, 1],
        [1, 0]]

So, for a general state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨σ_x⟩ is (a* b + b* a)/ (a* a + b
