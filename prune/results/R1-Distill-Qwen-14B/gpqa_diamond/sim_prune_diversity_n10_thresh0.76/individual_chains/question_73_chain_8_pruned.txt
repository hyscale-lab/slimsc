Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let's see. Two astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Alright, let's break this down.

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the same direction. So, both are moving along the positive x-axis. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. You have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is:

v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²))

Wait, no, wait. Wait, u is the velocity of the second object from the first's frame, but I have to be careful. Let me think. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So, from the first astronaut's frame, what's the speed of the second?

Wait, no. The first astronaut is stationary in their own frame. So the second astronaut's speed relative to the first would be (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, wait, no. Let me get the formula right. The formula for relative velocity when object A is moving at u and object B at v in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So in this case, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait, actually, the formula is correct. So let's compute the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - ( (0.6c)(0.5c) ) / c². Let's compute that. 0.6*0.5=0.3. Multiply c^2 by that, so 0.3c². Then divide by c²: 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
