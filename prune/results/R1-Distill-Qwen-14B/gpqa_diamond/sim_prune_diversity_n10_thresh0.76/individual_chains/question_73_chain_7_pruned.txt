Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step.

Alright, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, question is, what's the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting their speeds, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just do a simple subtraction. I remember that you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1v2)/(c²)), but wait, I should get that right. Oh wait, no, wait, if both are moving in the same direction, then the relative speed would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - v1v2/c²). Or is that the formula for when one is moving relative to another? Let me think. Oh right, the formula for adding velocities in relativity is (v1 + v2)/(1 + v1v2/c²) when they're moving in the same direction. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, the standard velocity addition formula is for when one is moving at speed u in another frame moving at speed v. So, if I'm in a frame where the first astronaut is moving
