Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about a decay process where two nucleons of flavor A convert into two B's and emit particles E and V. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's given that the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q.

Then there's a variant where instead of emitting two V particles, they emit one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is how this affects the energy spectrum of E. 

Hmm, I remember that in beta decay, when a nucleus emits a beta particle (like an electron), the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because the process involves the weak interaction, which allows for a range of energies. But wait, in some cases, if you have multiple particles emitted, it can affect the spectrum.

In the original decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So the E's and V's are both emitted. Now, the V's must have some energy and mass. I think that when multiple particles are emitted, each particle can take a range of energies as long as energy and momentum are conserved.

But in the variant, instead of two V particles, it's one M, which is massless. So M has zero mass, so its energy is just its momentum times c squared or something. But how does that affect the E particles?

Wait, in the original case, the E's and V's are lighter, but the question says E and V are much lighter. So maybe their rest mass is negligible compared to the nucleons. So in the original decay, the energy available (Q value) is shared among all the emitted particles.

In the first case, each E and V would take some energy, so the E particles' energy would vary, leading to a continuous spectrum. The endpoint Q would be the maximum energy an E could have if the other particles take the minimum possible energy (like when all other particles get their rest mass energy, but V's are massless. Wait wait, V is much lighter too, so maybe they're treated as massless as well. Hmm.)

Wait, but in the original, there are two E and two V.
