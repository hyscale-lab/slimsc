Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that the Hamiltonian represents the energy of the system, and its eigenvalues correspond to the possible energy levels.

The problem states that the Hamiltonian H is equal to ε times the dot product of σ and n vectors. Wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So each component σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli spin matrices. And n is a unit vector, meaning it's pointing in some direction, but arbitrary. So n could be any direction, but for the eigenvalues, maybe the direction doesn't matter? Or does it?

I recall that the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues of ±1. But here, the Hamiltonian is a combination of all three. Let's think about this. The dot product σ·n would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. So H = ε (σ·n) = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z).

Wait, each Pauli matrix is a 2x2 matrix. So σ·n would also be a 2x2 matrix. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. What's the general approach here?

Oh, right! The eigenvalues of a matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(H - λ I) = 0. But wait, σ·n is a traceless matrix because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and n is a unit vector. So the trace of H would just be zero as well because H is ε times a traceless matrix.

For a 2x2 matrix, the trace is the sum of eigenvalues, and the determinant is the product. If the trace is zero, then the sum of eigenvalues is zero, so they must be λ and -λ. So the eigenvalues should be symmetric around zero.

What about the magnitude? Well, for any Pauli matrix, its eigenvalues are ±1, and each Pauli matrix squares to the identity matrix (σ_i^2 = I). Let me think about σ·n squared. (σ·n)^2 is (σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z)^2. Expanding that, each σ_i σ_j term. Remember that σ_i σ_j = iε_ijk σ_k when i≠j, and σ_i² = I when i=j.

Wait, but wait, when you square σ·n, you get (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Let's compute that. Each term when squared would be σ_i^2 n_i^2, and cross terms would be σ_i σ_j n_i n_j for i≠j.

So (σ·n)^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I + i sum_{i<j} (n_i n_j σ_i σ_j) - but wait, when you square the sum, the cross terms would involve σ_i σ_j, which for i≠j is i times ε_ijk σ_k. But σ_i σ_j = I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me get it straight.

Each σ_i σ_j is equal to δ_ij I + i ε_ijk σ_k. So when i≠j, σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k. So when we expand (σ·n)^2, it becomes:

Sum over i of (n_i σ_i)^2 + Sum over i≠j (n_i n_j σ_i σ_j)

Which is sum_i (n_i^2 σ_i^2) + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j (i ε_ijk σ_k )

But σ_i^2 is I, so the first term is (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I. The second term involves the cross terms. So,

= (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2
