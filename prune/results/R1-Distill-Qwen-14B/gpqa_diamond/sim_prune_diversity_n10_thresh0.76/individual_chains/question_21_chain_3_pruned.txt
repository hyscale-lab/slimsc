Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about isomers, tautomerism, and optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through it.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond, leading to different structural isomerism, like in keto-enol tautomerism. 

Benzoquinone is a quinone, right? Quinones have two ketone groups. Wait, I think benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. Because, like, it can form enols. If you have two ketone groups, maybe they can tautomerize. Or wait, maybe not? Let me think. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Tautomerism usually happens when there are adjacent positions where a hydrogen can shift. For example, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, each separated by a CH2 group. So like O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO. So each oxygen is on a carbonyl group. Do these have the possibility for tautomerism?

Wait, what's the structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? It's a six-membered ring with ketones at positions 1,3, and 5. So each of those is a carbonyl group. Now, each of those is adjacent to a CH2 group. So maybe the structure allows for enol tautomerism, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is symmetric enough that tautomerism isn't possible because any tautomer would be the same as the original structure. Or perhaps tautomerism isn't possible because the necessary hydrogen isn't present.

Wait, in benzoquinone, the structure is two carbonyl groups connected by a benzene ring. Oh wait, no, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups in the para positions. So, for example, the structure is O=C6H3-C=O. So, each carbonyl is on adjacent carb
