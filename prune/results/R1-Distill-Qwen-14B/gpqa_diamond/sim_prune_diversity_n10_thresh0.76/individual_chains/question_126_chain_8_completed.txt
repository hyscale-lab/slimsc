Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves two reactions, both using different starting materials and reagents, followed by combining the products and running them on two types of HPLC columns. The goal is to determine how many peaks the chemist observes in each case.

First, let's try to understand each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

I remember that LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one is a ketone in the third carbon. The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. When LAH reduces a ketone, it replaces the carbonyl group with a hydroxyl group. So, the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at the 5th carbon, but when we reduce the ketone, where does the hydroxyl group go?

Wait, the starting compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure is:

CH2CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me think. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2C=O, so in position 3. So the molecule is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, let me count the carbons. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, perhaps better to draw it.

Structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one:

Carbon chain: 1 2 3 4 5 6

Positions: 

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

Wait, wait. Wait, the correct structure is:

The compound is hexan-3-one, which is (CH2)2COCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CH-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, perhaps better to build it.

Hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, hexan-3-one is actually:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but the substituent at position 5 is methoxy. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, position 5 in hexan-3-one. Let me number correctly.

Wait, hexane is six carbons. The ketone is on C3. So:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, perhaps that's more accurate. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. No, wait, no. Let's number from the other end. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The correct structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the main chain is six carbons, with a ketone on C3 and a methoxy group on C5.

So, structure:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2.

Wait, but that's five carbons. Oh, wait, no. Maybe it's better to write it as:

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

So, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one would have the ketone at position 3, with positions 1,2,3,4,5,6.

So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, hexane has six carbons. So, hexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? So, the carbonyl is on C3.

Wait, no, that would make it pentan-3-one if it's five carbons. Wait, no, wait. Hexan-3-one is:

The structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that would be 6 carbons in total: 1 (CH2), 2 (CH2), 3 (C=O), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH2), 6 (CH3). Wait, no, that's six in a row.

Wait, perhaps the structure is: 

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would be heptan-3-one. Hmm, perhaps I'm messing up the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2. Wait, maybe not. Let's think differently. Maybe it's more straightforward to imagine the reduction.

When (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH, a strong reducing agent, the ketone will be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

But wait, does the stereochemistry change? LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically gives the alcohol with retention of configuration because it's a two-step process (addition followed by protonation). Wait, no, wait, when using LAH, the reduction of ketones usually goes through a two-step mechanism. LAH is a source of H^- which adds to the carbonyl, forming an alkoxide, which is then protonated during workup. So, the stereochemistry of the starting material at C5 is S, but the reduction is at C3. So, the product would have an OH group at C3, and the configuration at C5 remains as S.

So, the product from Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but when you add a hydroxyl group to a new carbon, does that create a new stereocenter? Let me see. The starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, has a chiral center at C5. When we reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol, we add an -OH group to C3. Now, what about the configuration at C3? The ketone is planar, so upon reduction, the OH can add from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, in this case, the starting material is chiral at C5. But the reduction at C3 would create a new chiral center at C3, unless the molecule is symmetric in some way.

Wait, the starting molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps no. Let me try to draw it. Carbon 1: CH3, carbon 2: CH2, carbon 3: C=O, carbon 4: CH2, carbon 5: CH(OCH3), carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, that would make the structure:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, that would be seven carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3? No, maybe I should think about the reaction.

After the reduction, the ketone at C3 becomes an alcohol. So, the product is 3-hexanol derivative.

Wait, but the starting material is 5-methoxy. So, the product is 3-hydroxy, 5-methoxyhexane. And the configuration at C5 is S.

Wait, but the reduction at C3 could form a new stereocenter. So, the product will have two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

But wait, does the reduction of the ketone produce a racemic mixture, leading to a new stereocenter at C3? Or does the starting material's configuration affect this?

Wait, LAH reduction of a ketone typically leads to the formation of a secondary alcohol with the same stereochemistry as the starting material? No, wait, no. Wait, the starting ketone is not chiral at the carbonyl carbon. So, when reduced, the addition of hydride can be from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, the starting material is chiral elsewhere, but the ketone is not. So, the reduction would create a new chiral center at C3, with equal R and S configurations, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, if the starting material is already chiral, how does that affect the new stereocenter?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the C5 is chiral, but the C3 is not. So, when reducing the ketone at C3, the addition of the hydride could come from either the top or bottom face, leading to two possible configurations at C3. So, the product would have two stereocenters: C3 (new) and C5 (existing).

But wait, the starting material's configuration at C5 is S. When the ketone is reduced, the C3 becomes a new stereocenter. So, the product would have two stereocenters, but the configuration at C3 is racemic, meaning the product would be a mixture of (R) and (S) at C3, each with the S configuration at C5.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer. So, when reducing the ketone, the hydride can attack from either face, leading to a racemic mixture at C3. But since the starting material is S at C5, the new stereocenter at C3 would have no relation to C5â€™s configuration. So, the product would be a mixture of four stereoisomers? No, wait, each C3 configuration (R and S) would be present in equal amounts. So, the product would be a 50:50 mix of (R,S) and (S,S) or (R,R) and (S,R) at C3 and C5? Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of diastereomers.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the product structure. Let me imagine the product is 3-hydroxy-5-methoxyhexane. So the molecule is:

CH2CH2-C-OH-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but the exact positions might not matter as much as the number of stereocenters. So, in the product, C3 has a hydroxyl group, and C5 has a methoxy group. So, if both C3 and C5 are chiral centers, then each can have R or S configurations.

But in the starting material, C5 is S. Upon reduction, C3 becomes a new chiral center, but the reduction doesn't affect the configuration at C5. So, the product will have two stereocenters, C3 and C5.

Wait, but in the starting material, the ketone is on C3. So, the structure is:

(CH2)2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. So, the C3 is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4), the carbonyl group, and the rest. Wait, no, because in a ketone, the carbonyl is between two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that would make C3 the carbonyl carbon, connected to two CH2 groups on either side, and a CH(OCH3) on one side. So, when reduced, the C3 becomes CH(OH), connected to two CH2 groups, and a CH(OCH3) on the other side. So, the new C3 would have four different substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (but wait, are they identical?), and a CH(OCH3) group.

Wait, no, because the two CH2 groups are on either side. So, if the molecule is symmetric around C3, then the CH2 groups on either side of C3 would be identical, making C3 not a chiral center. But in this case, the substituents would be: (from C3) two CH2 groups, an OH, and a CH(OCH3) group. Are the two CH2 groups identical? Let me see.

The group on the left of C3 is CH2CH2 (from C1 and C2), and on the right is CH(OCH3)CH2CH3 (from C4, C5, C6). So, the substituents on C3 are:

- Two CH2 groups (but one is connected to C2, which is CH2CH3, and the other is connected to C4, which is CH(OCH3)CH2CH3). So, the substituents are actually not the same. Therefore, C3 becomes a chiral center upon reduction.

So, the product is 3-hydroxy-5-methoxyhexane, with chiral centers at C3 and C5.

But wait, during the reduction, the hydride attack can be from either face of the planar carbonyl, leading to two possible configurations at C3. So, the product would be a racemic mixture at C3, but the configuration at C5 remains S.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer. So, the product would be a mixture of two diastereomers, each with 50% of the C3 configurations. So, from one enantiomer, we get two diastereomers, each a racemic mixture? Or perhaps just a 50:50 mix of R and S at C3, leading to four possible stereoisomers?

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's more straightforward to think about Reaction I's product as a diastereomeric mixture. Wait, no, because the starting material is a single enantiomer. So, you start with a single (S) configuration at C5. When you reduce the ketone to an alcohol, you add a new stereocenter at C3, which can be R or S. So, the product would be a 50:50 mixture of (R,S) and (S,S) diastereomers, or (R,R) and (S,R) depending on the structure. Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the product would have two stereocenters, leading to four possible stereoisomers, but the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of two stereoisomers because the starting material is a single enantiomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers.

In any case, Reaction I gives a product with two stereocenters, so possibly two diastereomers.

Wait, no, if the product has two stereocenters, and each is present in a racemic form, but the starting material is a single enantiomer, then the product will have two stereoisomers, each with 50% of the C3 configuration.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move on to Reaction II and come back.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3C(O))2CH. It's a diketone. NaBH4 is a reducing agent, but it's a weaker agent compared to LAH. Wait, but NaBH4 typically doesn't reduce ketones as effectively as LAH, but in some cases, it can. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, actually, NaBH4 can reduce ketones, but it's more reactive towards aldehydes. However, in the presence of strong electron-withdrawing groups, like in diketones, NaBH4 can reduce the ketones.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups. So, when treated with excess NaBH4, both ketones will be reduced. Each ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. So, the product would be 2,4-pentanediol.

But wait, let me think about the structure. Pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pentane has five carbons. So, positions 2 and 4 are ketones.

Structure: O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that would be six carbons. Let me correct. Pentane-2,4-dione is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that's five carbons. So, it's:

O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's four carbons between the two ketones. No, perhaps it's:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, five carbons in total, with ketones on C2 and C4.

When reduced with NaBH4, each ketone group is reduced to an alcohol. So, each C=O becomes a CH(OH). So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol: HO-CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, no, the structure would be HOCH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but no, the original structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, after reduction, it becomes CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

But wait, this molecule has two secondary alcohols. Now, are these alcohols on the same or different carbons? The molecule is symmetric, so the two OH groups are on C2 and C4, which are symmetric in the molecule. So, the molecule is meso.

Because the molecule is symmetric, the two OH groups are mirror images of each other. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Therefore, even though there are two stereocenters (C2 and C4), the molecule is achiral because of the plane of symmetry.

So, the product of Reaction II is a single compound, 2,4-pentanediol, which is meso, so it doesn't have any stereoisomerism. Therefore, only one product is formed.

Wait, let me double-check. The structure after reduction is:

HOCH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, correction: the starting material is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. After reduction, each C=O becomes CH(OH), so the structure becomes CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. Now, looking at the molecule: C2 and C4 each have an OH group attached.

But the molecule is symmetric. The central carbon (C3) is CH2, and C2 and C4 are mirror images. So, the molecule is a meso compound, meaning that it has two stereocenters but is achiral. Therefore, the product is a single compound, not a mixture.

So, Reaction II gives a single product.

Now, combining the products from both reactions.

Reaction I gives a product with two stereocenters, but what's the exact number of stereoisomers? If the product is a racemic mixture at C3, then it would be two diastereomers. Wait, no, because the starting material was a single enantiomer. So, when reduced, the product would have a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers.

Wait, let me think again. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Upon reduction, C3 becomes a new stereocenter, so the product is (R/S at C3, S at C5). So, the product has two stereocenters. The starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product will be a mixture of two diastereomers, each with 50% composition.

Wait, because the structure is asymmetric, the product would have two stereocenters, leading to four possible stereoisomers. But the reaction produces two of them in equal amounts. So, the product is a 50:50 mix of two diastereomers. So, how many peaks would these produce in an HPLC?

In normal-phase HPLC, which is based on eluting strength and partitioning between the stationary phase (non-polar) and the mobile phase (polar), diastereomers would have different retention times because their physical properties (like polarity) differ. So, each diastereomer would give a separate peak.

In the case of the Reaction I product, there are two diastereomers, so two peaks in the normal-phase HPLC. But wait, also, each diastereomer might have internal enantiomers, which would only be separated in a chiral column.

Wait, no, the product from Reaction I has two stereocenters, but the starting material was a single enantiomer. The reduction introduces a new stereocenter that is racemic. So, the product would have two stereocenters, with each of the two diastereomers (R,S and S,R) being present. But wait, no, the starting material's configuration at C5 is S. So, after reduction, the product has two possible configurations at C3 (R and S), leading to two diastereomers: (R,S) and (S,S). Wait, no, because the starting material is (S) at C5, and C3 is now a new stereocenter. So, the product would have two stereoisomers: (R,S) and (S,S), each at 50%.

But wait, would these two diastereomers have the same physical properties? No, because their structures are different. So, in a normal-phase HPLC, which separates based on polarity and other physical properties, these two would elute at different times, giving two peaks.

But wait, are any of these diastereomers enantiomers? Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. So, if the product has two stereocenters, the diastereomers are not enantiomers. So, each diastereomer would have a different retention time. Therefore, in normal-phase HPLC, which doesn't distinguish enantiomers, each diastereomer would give a separate peak, leading to two peaks from Reaction I.

Reaction II produces a single product, which is a meso compound. So, it doesn't contribute any stereoisomers, so no additional peaks here.

So, combining the products, from Reaction I we have two diastereomers, and from Reaction II we have one product. So, the combined mixture would have three components: two from Reaction I and one from Reaction II.

Wait, wait, no: the products are combined. So, the products from Reaction I and II are mixed together. So, the total number of components would be the sum of the products from each reaction.

So, Reaction I's product is two diastereomers (from the reduction), and Reaction II's product is one meso compound.

So, in the normal-phase HPLC, which doesn't distinguish enantiomers, each diastereomer would be a separate peak, and the meso compound would be a single peak. So, total peaks: 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (Reaction II) = 3 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

But wait, Reaction I's product is a racemic mixture at C3? No, no, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction adds a new stereocenter that is racemic. So, the product is a 50:50 mixture of R and S at C3, leading to two diastereomers.

Wait, but wait: the starting material is (S) at C5, and upon reduction, C3 becomes R or S. So, the two diastereomers are (R,S) and (S,S) at C3 and C5 respectively. So, each diastereomer would have a different physical structure, leading to different retention times in normal-phase HPLC.

So, in the normal-phase HPLC, the combined products would have:

- Two peaks from Reaction I (the two diastereomers)

- One peak from Reaction II (the meso compound)

Thus, total of 3 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

Now, for the chiral HPLC column. A chiral column can separate enantiomers as well as diastereomers. So, for each compound, if it has multiple stereocenters and is a diastereomer, the chiral column would separate them. Also, if any compound has internal enantiomers, the chiral column would separate them into multiple peaks.

Let's look at each product:

Reaction I's product: two diastereomers (each being a pair of enantiomers? No, because diastereomers are not mirror images. Wait, each diastereomer is a pair of enantiomers only if the molecule has an even number of stereocenters, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, each diastereomer in Reaction I has two stereocenters. Are these diastereomers themselves enantiomers? No, because they are not mirror images. So, each diastereomer is a single compound, but if it's chiral, the chiral HPLC would separate each enantiomer.

Wait, but wait: Reaction I's product is a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers, each of which is a racemic mixture. No, wait no. Let me think: the product of Reaction I is 50:50 (R,S) and (S,S) at C3 and C5. Wait, no, the product has two stereocenters, and the configurations are R/S at C3 and S at C5.

Wait, no, the starting material is (S) at C5. Upon reduction, C3 can be R or S. So, the product is a mixture of (R,S) and (S,S), each at 50%. Each of these is a diastereomer.

Each diastereomer is a pair of enantiomers? No, because each diastereomer is a single enantiomer. Wait, each diastereomer has a specific configuration, and the presence of two stereocenters would mean that each diastereomer is a distinct stereoisomer, but not necessarily a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps each diastereomer is itself a pair of enantiomers. Because each diastereomer has two stereocenters, but whether they are in R/S or S/R configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps not. Let me think: for a molecule with two stereocenters, there are four possible stereoisomers. But if the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reaction produces a racemic mixture at one stereocenter, then the product will have two pairs of enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture at C3, but the C5 is fixed as S. So, the product is a mixture of (R,S) and (S,S), each present as racemic pairs? No, wait, no. Each diastereomer (R,S and S,S) is itself a single enantiomer. Because the starting material was a single enantiomer, and the reaction adds a new stereocenter, the product would be a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers, each of which is a single enantiomer. But that doesn't make sense because if the product has two stereocenters, each diastereomer is a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's approach it from another angle. The product from Reaction I has two stereocenters, and the starting material was a single enantiomer. So, the product is a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers, each of which is a racemic mixture. No, that's not right. Because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have two diastereomers, each of which is a racemic mixture. So, each diastereomer would have an equal amount of R and S configurations, leading to four possible stereoisomers in total, but in a 50:50 ratio between the two diastereomers, each of which is a racemic pair.

But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture of two diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps a better way to think: the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. It's a single enantiomer. Upon reduction, the product is a mixture of (R,S) and (S,S), each at 50% in equal amounts. So, each of these is a diastereomer.

Now, each diastereomer has two stereocenters, so each is a single enantiomer. But wait, no, if a compound has two stereocenters, each enantiomer is a different configuration. So, each diastereomer in the product is a pair of enantiomers. Wait, no, that's not correct because diastereomers are not mirror images. So, each diastereomer is a single compound, not a pair.

Wait, I'm getting really confused here. Maybe I should think about what the chiral HPLC would show.

In a chiral column, enantiomers would separate into two peaks, while diastereomers would also separate. So, for each compound in the mixture, if it has multiple stereocenters, the column will separate all enantiomers and diastereomers.

So, let's go back.

Reaction I's product: two diastereomers (each with two stereocenters). Each diastereomer is a single enantiomer, but wait, no: each diastereomer is a pair of enantiomers if the molecule is chiral. No, diastereomers are not necessarily enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps each diastereomer is itself chiral, but not each other's mirror images. So, each diastereomer would have a pair of enantiomers, leading to four stereoisomers in total, but only two in the product.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try a different approach.

The product from Reaction I is a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers. So, each diastereomer is two enantiomers. Therefore, the total would be four stereoisomers. But in the product, each diastereomer is present as a racemic mixture, leading to two peaks in the chiral column.

Wait, no. If each diastereomer is a pair of enantiomers, then in a chiral column, each pair would split into two peaks. So, with two diastereomers, each with two enantiomers, there would be four peaks in the chiral HPLC.

But wait, the product is a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers, each of which is a racemic pair. So, in the chiral column, each diastereomer's enantiomers would split into two peaks. So, for each diastereomer, two peaks, leading to a total of four peaks from Reaction I.

But wait, that can't be right because the product is only a 50:50 mix of two diastereomers, each of which is a single enantiomer. No, that's not correct. If each diastereomer is itself a pair of enantiomers, then the product has four stereoisomers in a 50:50:50:50 ratio. But wait, no. Let me think again.

If the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, and upon reduction, the product has a new stereocenter at C3 that is racemic, then the product is a 50:50 mixture of (R,S) and (S,S). Now, each of these is a diastereomer, and each is a single enantiomer because their configurations are fixed.

Wait, no. Diastereomers can be enantiomers, but they don't have to be. Each diastereomer would have its own set of enantiomers. So, if a compound has two stereocenters, each stereoisomer would have a pair of enantiomers.

So, for Reaction I's product, which has two diastereomers (each with two stereocenters), each diastereomer would have a pair of enantiomers. So, in the product, the mixture would consist of four stereoisomers: (R,S), (S,R), (S,S), and (R,R), each present in certain ratios.

Wait, no. If the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, then for each stereoisomer of C3, you have a fixed C5 configuration (S). So, the product would be (R,S) and (S,S), each present in 50% ratio. So, each of these diastereomers is a single enantiomer, because the C5 is fixed as S and C3 is R or S. Wait, no, because C3 can be R or S, leading to two stereoisomers, each of which is chiral and has its own mirror image.

Wait, perhaps each diastereomer is a pair of enantiomers, but in the product, you have only two diastereomers, each present as a racemic pair. So, the product is a mixture of four stereoisomers, each with 25% concentration.

But that doesn't make sense. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product can't have four stereoisomers because that would require the product to have two new stereocenters, each leading to a racemic mixture. But in reality, the product would have two stereocenters, and the reaction introduces a racemic mixture at C3. So, the product would have two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers.

But this is getting too confusing. Let's try a different approach. Let's imagine that Reaction I's product is a racemic mixture of two diastereomers, each of which has its own pair of enantiomers. So, in a chiral column, each diastereomer's enantiomers would split into two peaks, leading to four peaks from Reaction I.

Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is achiral. So, it would not produce any peaks in the chiral column because it's not chiral. Wait, no. The meso compound is a single compound, but it's not chiral. So, in a chiral column, it would elute as a single peak because it doesn't have any chiral centers to cause separation.

Wait, no, the meso compound has two stereocenters but is achiral. So, in a chiral column, it would still be a single peak because it's not chiral. So, for Reaction II, the meso compound would give one peak in the normal-phase HPLC and one peak in the chiral HPLC, but wait, no, because it's not chiral, it wouldn't be separated based on chirality. So, in the chiral HPLC, the meso compound would elute as a single peak because it's not chiral, but perhaps it would have a different retention time compared to its enantiomers.

Wait, but since the meso compound is achiral, it doesn't have any enantiomers, so in the chiral column, it would just elute as a single peak, same as in normal-phase.

So, putting it all together:

In the chiral HPLC, the products would elute as follows:

- Reaction I: four stereoisomers (two diastereomers, each with two enantiomers) â†’ four peaks.

Wait, no, if each diastereomer is a racemic pair, then each would split into two peaks. So, two diastereomers â†’ four peaks.

But the product from Reaction I is a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers, each of which is a racemic pair. So, in the chiral HPLC, each diastereomer would split into two peaks (enantiomers), leading to four peaks from Reaction I.

Reaction II's product: meso compound â†’ single peak in both HPLCs.

So, total peaks in chiral HPLC: 4 (from Reaction I) + 1 (from Reaction II) = 5 peaks.

But wait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I's product is a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers, each of which is a racemic pair, leading to four peaks in the chiral HPLC, and Reaction II's product is a single peak. So, total of 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC.

In the normal-phase HPLC, which doesn't separate enantiomers, the peaks would be:

- Reaction I: two diastereomers â†’ two peaks.

- Reaction II: one meso compound â†’ one peak.

Total: three peaks.

So, the chromatogram would have three peaks in normal-phase and five in chiral. But looking at the options, option A says 5 peaks in chiral and 4 in normal-phase. Option C says 4 and 2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me consider Reaction I's product again. The product is a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers, each of which is a racemic pair. So, each diastereomer would split into two peaks in the chiral HPLC. So, two diastereomers â†’ four peaks. Plus the meso compound's single peak â†’ total of five peaks in chiral HPLC.

In normal-phase, each diastereomer is a single peak, and the meso compound is another. So, three peaks in normal-phase.

But the options don't have 5 and 3. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 5 and 4

B) 3 and 2

C) 4 and 2

D) 3 and 3.

Hmm, none of the options match my current conclusion of 5 and 3. So, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about Reaction I's product.

Alternative approach: maybe Reaction I's product is a single diastereomer. Let me think again.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes an alcohol. The new stereocenter at C3 can be R or S, leading to two possible stereoisomers. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a 50:50 mix of R and S at C3, leading to two diastereomers.

Each diastereomer is a pair of enantiomers, so in a chiral HPLC, each would split into two peaks, leading to four peaks from Reaction I. Reaction II's product is a single peak.

So, in the chiral HPLC, total peaks: 4 + 1 = 5.

In normal-phase: 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (from Reaction II) = 3.

Looking at the options, none have 5 and 3. The options are:

A) 5 and 4.

But perhaps I'm wrong about Reaction I's product. Maybe Reaction I's product is a single diastereomer, not two. How?

Wait, perhaps the reduction doesn't create a new stereocenter. Let me check.

Wait, the original compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The ketone is at C3. Reduction would add an -OH group to C3. Now, the substituents around C3 are:

- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4)

- A CH(OCH3) group (from C5)

- The new OH group.

Are any of these substituents the same? Let me think. The substituents are:

- CH2CH3 (from C2 side)

- CH(OCH3) (from C5 side)

- Two CH2 groups (but on opposite sides; perhaps they are the same? No, because the molecule is asymmetric due to the methoxy group.

So, the substituents on C3 are four different groups: -CH2CH3, -CH2CH2CH3, -CH(OCH3), and -OH. Therefore, C3 becomes a chiral center upon reduction.

So, the product has two stereocenters, C3 and C5. The starting material is (S) at C5, and the product has (R or S) at C3.

So, the product has two stereocenters, and the reaction produces a racemic mix at C3. So, the product is a 50:50 mix of (R,S) and (S,S) configurations.

Each diastereomer is a single enantiomer, so in the chiral column, each would split into two peaks (their enantiomers), but wait, no. If each diastereomer is a single enantiomer, then the product would have two diastereomers, each appearing as a single peak in normal-phase and two peaks in chiral.

Wait, this is getting too confusing, and I'm not making progress. Let me try to summarize:

Reaction I: product has two stereocenters â†’ four possible stereoisomers. But the product is a 50:50 mix of two diastereomers (each with one stereocenter being racemic). So, in normal phase: two peaks. In chiral phase: four peaks (each diastereomer splits into two enantiomers).

Reaction II: product is a single meso compound â†’ one peak in both columns.

Total peaks:

Chiral: 4 (from I) + 1 (from II) = 5.

Normal phase: 2 (from I) + 1 (from II) = 3.

But the options don't have 5 and 3. So, perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternative possibility: Reaction I's product is a single diastereomer, not two. How?

Wait, perhaps the reduction doesn't lead to a racemic mixture. Maybe the starting material's configuration influences the product's configuration.

Wait, LAH reduction of ketones typically proceeds with syn addition. Wait, no, LAH adds hydride to the carbonyl, which is a planar sp2 carbon, so the addition is from either face, leading to racemic mixture.

So, the product would be a racemic mix at C3, leading to two diastereomers.

In that case, in the chiral HPLC, each diastereomer would split into two peaks (their enantiomers), leading to four peaks from Reaction I.

Reaction II's product is one peak.

So, total in chiral HPLC: 5 peaks.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option C: 4 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal-phase.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is a single diastereomer, not two. How could that happen? If the starting material's configuration leads to a specific configuration at C3.

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to a preference for a certain configuration, but I don't think so. LAH usually gives racemic mixtures.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer because the starting material's configuration leads to a specific outcome. But I don't think so.

Another approach: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, and the product from Reaction II is a meso compound. So, in the normal-phase HPLC, the two enantiomers from Reaction I would co-elute as one peak, and the meso compound as another. So, two peaks from I and one from II â†’ total three in normal-phase.

In the chiral HPLC, the enantiomers from Reaction I would split into two peaks (each enantiomer), and the meso compound as one (since it's achiral, it doesn't split). So, three peaks: two from I's enantiomers and one from II.

Wait, but that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I's product is a single stereoisomer. How?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, and upon reduction, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with the same configuration at C5. But wait, the new OH at C3 would make it a new stereocenter.

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to formation of a new stereocenter, and the product is a racemic mixture, but the only product formed is a single diastereomer because the starting material's configuration leads to only one possible diastereomer. But that doesn't make sense.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess based on the options.

Alternative plan: each reaction produces certain products, and when combined, how many stereoisomers are there.

Reaction I: product has two stereocenters, leading to four possible stereoisomers. But the reaction produces a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers, each a racemic pair.

Reaction II: product is a meso compound, so one stereoisomer.

So, total stereoisomers in the mixture: 2 (from I) * 2 (enantiomers) + 1 (from II) = 5.

But in reality, each diastereomer is a racemic pair, so the product from I is four stereoisomers, but in a 25% each ratio. So, in the chiral HPLC, each would split into peaks, leading to four peaks from I and one from II â†’ five peaks.

Normal-phase: each diastereomer is a single peak, so two from I and one from II â†’ three peaks.

But the options don't have 5 and 3.

Looking back at the options:

Option C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

How would that happen?

If Reaction I's product is a single diastereomer, then in normal-phase, one peak. Reaction II's product: one peak. So, total two peaks in normal-phase? No, because Reaction I's product would have two stereocenters, leading to two peaks in normal-phase.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Reaction I's product: two stereocenters, leading to two diastereomers. Each diastereomer is a pair of enantiomers. So, in normal-phase HPLC: two peaks (each diastereomer is a single peak because the column doesn't separate enantiomers). Reaction II's product: meso â†’ one peak. So, normal-phase total: 3 peaks.

In chiral HPLC: each diastereomer's enantiomers split into two peaks â†’ 2 diastereomers * 2 peaks = 4 peaks. Plus Reaction II's meso â†’ one peak. So, total 5 peaks in chiral.

But options don't have 5 and 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option C: 4 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal-phase.

How?

If Reaction I's product has two diastereomers, each of which is a single enantiomer (not a racemic pair), then in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks. Reaction II's product: one peak. So, normal-phase total: 3 peaks.

In chiral HPLC: each diastereomer would split into two peaks (enantiomers), so two diastereomers â†’ four peaks. Reaction II's product: one peak. So, chiral total: 5 peaks. Still doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I's product is a single diastereomer, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, not a racemic mix. But that would require the reduction to proceed with some selectivity, which is unlikely unless there's some existing chiral induction.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer because the starting material's configuration leads to a specific outcome. For example, the reduction leads to a specific configuration at C3 due to the existing chiral center. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer, so in the normal-phase HPLC, it's one peak. Reaction II's product is another peak â†’ two peaks total.

In the chiral HPLC, the single diastereomer would split into two enantiomers â†’ two peaks. Reaction II's product is a meso â†’ one peak. So, chiral total: three peaks.

But this doesn't match any options either.

I think I'm stuck, so perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4 and 2.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, looking at the options, option C says 4 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal-phase.

So, perhaps in normal-phase, Reaction I gives two peaks (two diastereomers), and Reaction II gives one peak. So, three peaks in normal-phase. But none of the options say 3 and 5.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in Reaction I's product.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer, not two. Because the starting material's configuration leads to a specific configuration at C3.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's configuration at C5 influences the configuration at C3 during reduction. But I don't think so because the reduction is at C3, which is not adjacent to C5. So, the configuration at C5 shouldn't influence the configuration at C3.

I think I'm stuck, and the best I can do is make an educated guess based on the options. The most plausible answer seems to be option C: 4 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal-phase.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I's product is a single diastereomer, leading to 2 peaks in normal-phase (but that doesn't fit). Hmm.

Another approach: the total number of stereoisomers in the combined mixture.

Reaction I: four stereoisomers (two diastereomers, each a racemic pair) â†’ four.

Reaction II: one stereoisomer (meso) â†’ one.

Total: five.

In a chiral column, each stereoisomer would split into peaks if they are enantiomers. So, five stereoisomers, each would split into two peaks, but wait, no. Only the chiral ones would split. The meso compound is achiral, so it would be a single peak.

So, chiral column: four stereoisomers from Reaction I (each a pair of enantiomers) â†’ four peaks, plus one from Reaction II â†’ total five.

Normal-phase: two diastereomers from Reaction I (each as a single peak) â†’ two peaks, plus one from Reaction II â†’ three peaks.

But the options don't have 5 and 3.

I think I must have made a mistake in evaluating the products. Perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4 and 2.

Wait, let's think again. Maybe Reaction I's product is a single diastereomer, not two. So, in normal-phase, one peak. Reaction II's product: one peak. So, normal-phase total: two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, the single diastereomer would split into two peaks (enantiomers), and Reaction II's product: one peak. So, chiral total: three peaks. But that's option D: 3 and 3.

But the options don't have that.

I'm really stuck, but I think the correct answer is option C: 4 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.


The problem involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed in normal-phase and chiral HPLC chromatograms.

### Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup
- **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one has a chiral center at C5 (S configuration) and a ketone at C3.
- **Reagent**: LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol, introducing a new stereocenter at C3.
- **Product**: The product is a mixture of two diastereomers: (R,S) and (S,S), each present in a 50:50 ratio. These diastereomers are chiral and would be separated in a chiral HPLC column but would co-elute in a normal-phase HPLC column.

### Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup
- **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione is a symmetric diketone.
- **Reagent**: NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming 2,4-pentanediol.
- **Product**: The product is a meso compound, which is achiral. It would elute as a single peak in both normal-phase and chiral HPLC columns.

### Combined Products
- **From Reaction I**: Two diastereomers (each a racemic mixture of enantiomers) contribute to the chromatogram.
- **From Reaction II**: A single meso compound contributes to the chromatogram.

#### Normal-Phase HPLC
- Diastereomers have different physical properties and would elute as separate peaks, resulting in **2 peaks** from Reaction I.
- The meso compound would elute as a single peak, resulting in **1 peak** from Reaction II.
- **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**: 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (from Reaction II) = **3 peaks**.

#### Chiral HPLC
- Each diastereomer from Reaction I would split into two peaks (enantiomers), resulting in **4 peaks** from Reaction I.
- The meso compound, being achiral, would elute as a single peak.
- **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC**: 4 (from Reaction I) + 1 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.

### Conclusion
The chromatograms would show **3 peaks in normal-phase HPLC** and **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**. However, none of the provided options match this result. Based on the reasoning and the closest match to the expected outcomes, the best answer is:

ANSWER: C
