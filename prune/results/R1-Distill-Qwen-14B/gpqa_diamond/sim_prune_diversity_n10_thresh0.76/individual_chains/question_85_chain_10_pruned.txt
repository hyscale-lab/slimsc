Okay, so I've got this question here about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but I'll think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says there are two planets orbiting a star. Both detection methods, transit and radial velocity, found them. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Interesting, our Sun is about 5778 K, so this star is a bit hotter.

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times Earth's. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius 1.3 Earths. Both orbits are circular. The question is about their equilibrium temperatures.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh, and the planet's own greenhouse effect isn't considered here, right? Because equilibrium temperature is a basic model, assuming no atmosphere or anything, just reflecting some light.

The formula, I think, is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^0.25. Where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is its radius, a is the planet's orbital distance, and A is the albedo. Oh wait, but wait—no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again.

Wait, another version: the equilibrium temperature T is given by T = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.25. Yeah, that sounds right because the star's luminosity is L = 4πR_star² σ T_star⁴. The planet reflects some of that and absorbs the rest, so the energy it absorbs is L*(1 - A)/(16πa²). Wait, no, the planet's cross-section is π r², and it emits from its whole surface area 4π r², so the energy
