Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct products from two reactions. Hmm, let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol treated with THF, KH, and then H+. I remember that KH is a strong base, a potassium hydride, which is often used in deprotonation reactions. THF is a common solvent for such reactions.

Looking at the structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol, it's a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atomâ€”in this case, the alcohol group. The structure has a 5-membered and a 3-membered ring? Wait, no, wait. The spiro notation [3.5] means two rings: one with 3 carbons (but spiro implies that it has a bridge, so maybe it's a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring connected at the spiro atom).

But the alcohol is on the spiro position. So, the structure is a spiro compound with a vinyl group attached. The alcohol is -OH at position 1, which is the bridgehead.

When a strong base like KH is used, it typically deprotonates acidic protons. In this case, the alcohol is a potential proton source. The -OH can be deprotonated to form an alkoxide.

But wait, the compound has a conjugated double bond (vinyl group), which might make the alpha protons acidic. The spiro alcohol might have some ring strain, making the alpha protons more acidic. So, maybe the base (KH) abstracts a proton alpha to the oxygen, leading to some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

Alternatively, since the starting material has a double bond, maybe a hydride shift or some elimination could occur. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think about the mechanism. If the alcohol is deprotonated, what happens next?

Another possibility: the base could induce an elimination reaction. Since the starting molecule has a double bond, perhaps a neighboring group effect or some conjugate elimination could happen.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of a strong base like KH and THF, could the alcohol be depro
