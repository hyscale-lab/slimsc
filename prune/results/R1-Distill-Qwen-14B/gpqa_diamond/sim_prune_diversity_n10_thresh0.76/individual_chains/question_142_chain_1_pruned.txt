Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out where a given density matrix is located in the qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ equals 1/2 times (|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. So, this ρ must represent a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>.

Let me write out the matrix form of ρ to make it clearer. The basis states |0> and |1> are the standard computational basis. The |0><0| term is a diagonal matrix with 1 in the top-left and 0 elsewhere, and similarly for |1><1|, which is diagonal with 1 in the bottom-right. So when I add them together, I get a 2x2 matrix where both diagonal elements are 1. Then, multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2, and the off-diagonal elements remain 0. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with entries [0.5, 0; 0, 0.5].

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I think qubit space is represented in a Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of the state space of a qubit. Each point on the sphere corresponds to a quantum state, with pure states on the surface and mixed states inside.

Wait, how does the density matrix relate to the Bloch sphere? Oh right, any density matrix can be represented as a point in the Bloch sphere. For a single qubit, the density matrix ρ can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So, let's express ρ in that form. Our given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute that. The identity matrix I for a qubit is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

But wait, our ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2 = (I)/2. Because |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]], so adding them gives I. So ρ is I/2. 

So putting that into the general form: I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiply both
