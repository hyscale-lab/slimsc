Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The problem involves an electron state and some operator whose matrix elements are given, and I need to find the probabilities of measuring certain eigenstates and the average value of the operator. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the state vector is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Since |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin, I can represent this state as a two-component vector. So let me write that out.

The state |alpha> can be written as a column vector. Let me calculate the components. The coefficient for |up> is (1+i), and for |down> it's (2-i). So the vector would be:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) ] |up> + [ (2 - i) ] |down>

But wait, I need to normalize this state because the problem says it's "proportional" to that. So the normalization factor is the inverse of the square root of the sum of the squares (magnitudes) of each component.

Let me compute the magnitude squared of each component. The first component is (1+i), so its magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. The second component is (2 - i), whose magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5. So the total squared norm is 2 + 5 = 7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state becomes:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

Next, the operator in question has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i != j and 0 otherwise. Wait, so for a 2x2 matrix (since up and down are two states), the matrix would look like:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Because A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero. So this operator is actually proportional to the Pauli X matrix, but scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator is (hbar/2) * σ_x.

Wait, but operators in quantum mechanics are often written using Pauli matrices. So maybe this operator is (hbar/2) σ_x. Since σ_x has eigenstates that are the eigenstates of the operator. So the eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because σ_x is the spin-x operator, and its eigenstates are the eigenstates for the spin in the x-direction.

But wait, what's the operator in the problem? The operator A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else zero. So that's exactly the matrix (hbar/2) times [[0,1
