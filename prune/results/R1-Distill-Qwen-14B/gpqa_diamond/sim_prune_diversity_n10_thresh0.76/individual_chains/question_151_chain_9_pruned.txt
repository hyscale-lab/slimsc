Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific outcome. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

Alright, the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait—states in quantum mechanics are usually represented as vectors, but they have to be normalized. Oh right, the norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components. So let me calculate that first. The vector is [-1, 2, 1], so the squares are 1, 4, and 1. Adding them up gives 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). But wait, for probabilities, I think I need the state vector to be normalized, so I should probably divide each component by sqrt(6), right? Because the total probability must add up to 1. So the state vector is actually (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T.

Next, the observable is given by the matrix P. Let me write down P as given. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the structure of P. Wait, in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues (which correspond to possible measurement outcomes) are real. Is P Hermitian here? Let me check.

Looking at P, the (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the (2,1) element is also 1/sqrt(2). Similarly, the (2,3) and (3,2) elements are both 1/sqrt(2). The other elements are zero. So the matrix is symmetric, which for real matrices implies Hermitian. So yes, P is a valid observable matrix.

The question is to find the probability of getting a measurement of 0 when we measure P. So I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and then calculate the probability of the state being in that eigenspace.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the expectation value and so on, but wait, no—the probability of a particular outcome is the square of the amplitude of the component of the state in the corresponding eigenvector.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Let me try to find the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix (P - λ I) would be:

Row 1: [ -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ]

Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))^2 ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 [ something ].

Wait, calculating determinants can get a bit messy. Let me write it out more clearly.

The determinant is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)^2 ] - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) ] + 0.

Wait, maybe expanding along the first row would be easier.

So,

det(P - λ I) = -λ * det( [[-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ]] ) 
              - (1/√2) * det( [[1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ]] )
              + 0 * something.

Calculating each minor:

First minor for -λ: the 2x2 determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)^2 = λ² - (1/2).

Second minor: the 2x2 determinant is (1/√2)*(-λ) - (1/√2)*0 = (-λ)/√2.

So putting it all together,

det = -λ (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) * (-λ)/√2.

Simplify each term:

First term: -λ³ + (λ)(1/2) = -λ³ + λ/2.

Second term: (1/√2)(λ/√2) = λ/(2).

So the determinant becomes:

(-λ³ + λ/2) + (λ/2) ) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ.

Set this determinant equal to zero:

-λ³ + λ = 0 → λ(-λ² + 1) = 0 → λ(1 - λ²) = 0.

So the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1. The question asks for the probability of measuring 0.

So now I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0.

Let's solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the system is:

Row 1: (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v3 = -v1.

Row 3: (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 → same as row 1, v2=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form (v1, 0, -v1). So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1).

Wait, because if v1 is a scalar, say a, then the vector is (a, 0, -a). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1).

Now, to find the probability of the system being in this eigenspace, we need to compute the inner product of the state vector with this eigenvector, square the absolute value, and that's the probability.

Wait, but the state vector is given as (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me write that as ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).

The eigenvector for λ=0 is (1, 0, -1). Let me normalize it. The norm of (1,0,-1) is sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Now, the inner product between the state vector and this eigenvector is:

( (-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + ( (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 ) + ( (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) )

= (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )

= [ -1/(sqrt(12)) ] + [ -1/(sqrt(12)) ] = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) since sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3).

Wait, sqrt(12) is 2√3, so 1/sqrt(12)=√3/(6) or 1/(2√3). Hmm, let me compute that:

Wait, 1/sqrt(12) = 1/(2*sqrt(3)).

So each term is (-1)/(2 sqrt(3)). So two such terms add up to (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(
