Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident about all these reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about two different reactions: one involving the Cope rearrangement and another which is a thermal process, probably another rearrangement. The goal is to pick the major products from each reaction, A and B, and choose the correct option from A to D.

Let's start with the first part: Reaction A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me draw the structure to visualize it better. So, the benzene ring is connected to a CH2-O- group. The oxygen is attached to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So, the structure is benzene-O-CH2- attached to a 1,3-diene? Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no, but it's substituted. Let me think: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would have the double bond starting at C2. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3? No, wait. But wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- but with double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, no, but wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, no, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond between C1 and C2? No, wait, numbering. The substituent is but-2-en-1-yl, which is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, the numbering starts from the end closest to the point of attachment. So,
