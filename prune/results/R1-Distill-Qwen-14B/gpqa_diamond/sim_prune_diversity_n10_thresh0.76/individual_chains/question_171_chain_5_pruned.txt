Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, I need to figure out the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for six substituted benzene rings. Let me try to break this down.

The question gives me six substances, each with a benzene ring attached to a different substituent. The reaction is an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and each will form a monobromo derivative. I'm supposed to arrange them from the lowest to the highest weight fraction of the para-isomer.

Wait, weight fraction of the para-isomer... Oh right, in some cases, the substitution can lead to more than one product, especially when the substituent directs the incoming group to certain positions. But since it's an excess of bromine, maybe it's a bromination reaction. So the substituent's directing effect will determine where the bromine adds.

Each substituent is either activating or deactivating, and ortho/para or meta directing. I remember that:

- Nitro groups (-NO2) are strong deactivating and meta-directing. So if a benzene ring has a nitro group, the incoming electrophile (Br+) will mainly go meta to it, but wait, nitro is meta, so the bromine would add in the meta position. But wait, in mono-substitution, the substituent directs the incoming group.

Wait, the benzene has a substituent, and when we add Br, the product is a mono-bromo derivative. So the substituent's directing effect determines where the Br adds.

So for each substituent, I need to determine if it's ortho/para or meta-directing. Also, activating or deactivating. But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So I'm assuming that for each substituent, the possible positions for Br addition are either ortho, meta, para, etc., but depending on the substituent.

Wait, but wait, when you have a substituent, the ring is activated or deactivated. So if the substituent is an activating group (like -OCH3, -NH2), the ring is more reactive. Deactivating groups (like NO2, COOH) make the ring less reactive, but they still direct.

But for each substituent, when you add Br, the product's regiochemistry depends on the substituent. Let
