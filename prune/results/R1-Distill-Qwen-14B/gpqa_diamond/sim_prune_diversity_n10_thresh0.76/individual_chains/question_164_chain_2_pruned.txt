Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. Then, spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations in each system.

In system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm, alright. So I remember that in binary systems, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of the stars. The more massive star has a smaller velocity because it's less massive objects that orbit more quickly around the center of mass. Oh wait, right, the more massive star moves slower because it's closer to the center of mass. So the velocity is inversely proportional to the mass.

The formula I think is something like the mass function, but maybe I need to relate the velocities and the orbital period to find the masses.

Wait, let me think. For a binary system, the masses of the two stars are related to their velocities. The ratio of their masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of their velocities. Because of the center of mass balance: m1 * v1 = m2 * v2. So m1/m2 = v2/v1.

But wait, in the problem, the given velocities are the amplitudes of the RV variations. So each star's velocity is given. Let's say for system_1, star A has velocity 10 km/s, star B has 5 km/s. So the mass ratio m1/m2 = v2/v1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So m1 is half the mass of m2. Therefore, the total mass would be m1 + m2 = 0.5m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2. Wait, no, wait: the ratio is m1/m2 = v2/v1. So if m1 is 0.5 m2, then m2 = 2 m1.
