Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me an unknown compound, and I need to identify it using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, and I have to pick the right one. Let me start by looking at each piece of data.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Also, the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group. Wait, but in the options, I see some have COOH groups, which is a carboxylic acid. So maybe that's relevant.

Looking at the 1H NMR part: several peaks, none are vinyl hydrogens. So no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens, maybe. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. I think splitting like that comes from neighboring hydrogens. Let's see.

The options are:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, all these structures have a COOH group. So the FTIR makes sense because COOH has both O-H (broad) and carbonyl (around 1700). 

Looking at the NMR: if there are no vinyl hydrogens, we can rule out any structures with double bonds. But all options seem to be substituents on a central chain, maybe a bicyclic structure? I'm not sure. Wait, maybe it's a structure like a di-substituted cyclohexane derivative?

Wait, let me think. The NMR signals are complex multiplets. So maybe the protons are next to multiple sets of neighboring protons. For example, in a geminal (same carbon) or vicinal (next carbon) position.

Looking at the options, each structure has a central carbon connected to two different groups and a COOH. Let's break them down one by one.

Option A: The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. Wait, no, looking again: it's CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So it's like a central two carbons each attached to CH3 and C2H5 groups, and a CH2COOH at the end. So the central carbons are each connected to two different groups. So each H on these carbons would have neighbors on adjacent carbons.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure is something like CH2CH3 attached to a C connected to C2H5 and another CH group, then another C with C2H5 and CH, then COOH. Hmm. The end is COOH, so maybe the structure is more like a branching point.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the possible splitting in the NMR. The first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That could mean each proton is split by three neighboring sets. Similarly, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure that would lead to such splitting. If a proton is next to two different sets of protons, each with different coupling constants, the splitting can compound.

Alternatively, maybe it's a situation where a CH group is adjacent to two different CH2 groups or other CH groups with varying numbers of protons.

Let me think about each option's structure and the expected NMR splitting.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C
