Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. Let's see what the question is about. Oh right, it's about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+.

The problem states that the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh wait, stochiometric means the molar ratio is 1:1, right? So for every mole of Ca-EDTA, there's one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA. 

The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in the solution. I think I need to use the formation constant, which is given as KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10. Formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-.

Wait, but since the solution is at ideal pH, I don't have to worry about the protonation states of EDTA. That simplifies things.

The formula for the formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Right. But in this problem, the solution contains the complex, so [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M. But wait, what about the other species?

Wait a second, in the solution, the EDTA is present as the complex. So essentially, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- to some extent. But because Kf is so large (5e10), the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA should be very low.

So let me think about the initial setup. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the change as x. So when the complex dissociates, it produces x moles of Ca²+ and x moles of EDTA^4- per liter. So [Ca²+] = x and [EDTA^4-] = x. And [CaEDTA²-] is approximately 0.02 - x
