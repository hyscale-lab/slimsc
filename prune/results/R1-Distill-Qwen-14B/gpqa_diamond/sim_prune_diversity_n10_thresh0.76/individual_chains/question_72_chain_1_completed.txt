Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these synthesis problems can get pretty tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions leading to a final product, and we need to determine the number of distinct hydrogen atoms. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7. Hmm, okay, let's see.

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1] structures are like norbornene or something similar. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group on carbon 7. So, it's an ether group, which is bulky. I think tert-butoxy is a good leaving group under certain conditions, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, this compound is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide with a dihalide... Oh wait, that sounds like a possible Finkelstein reaction. But wait, Finkelstein is usually for swapping halides, like converting bromides to iodides. But when you have dibromide, maybe it's a different scenario.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction where the tert-butoxy group is a leaving group. Wait, but sodium iodide in a polar aprotic solvent? Or perhaps it's more about the dihalide. The dihalide is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the 5 and 6 positions has a CH2Br2 group? No, wait, bis(dibromomethyl) would mean two dibromomethyl groups on adjacent carbons.

Wait, no, the structure is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the cyclohexadiene has at positions 5 and 6 two substituents, each of which is a dibromomethyl group. So each substituent is CH2Br2? Or maybe CH2Br but two Brs on the same carbon? Wait, no, when it's dibromomethyl, it's Br2C-CH2-... No, wait, no, dibromomethyl is CH2Br2? Or is it (CH2Br)2? Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (dibromomethyl) groups, so each substituent is CH2Br2. Wait, but that can't be right because CH2Br2 isn't possible. Oh wait, dibromomethyl is (CH2Br)2, but that's also not possible. Wait, perhaps each substituent is a Br on a methyl group. So it's CH2Br on each substituent. Wait, the name is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), so each substituent is a methyl group with two Br atoms. So each is CBr2H, but that would be a methyl group where the central carbon is attached to two Br atoms. So each substituent is CH2Br2? No, wait, no. Because if it's methyl, the structure is CH3, but if it's dibromomethyl, then it's CH2Br2. Wait, that's a bit confusing, but I think each substituent is a (CH2Br2) group attached to the cyclohexadiene.

Wait, maybe I should draw this. The cyclohexadiene has double bonds at 1,3 positions. So positions 5 and 6 (which are adjacent) each have a CH2Br2 group. So each of those is a di-substituted bromo group. So when this reacts with sodium iodide, maybe it's a substitution reaction where the iodide replaces the bromide.

Wait, but sodium iodide is a source of iodide ions. If we have dihalides, perhaps they undergo some elimination or substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the tert-butyl ether is a good leaving group, so in the first step, the starting material could lose the tert-butoxy group to form a carbocation, and then the dihalide could attack.

Wait, another possibility is that the dihalide is undergoing an elimination reaction, but with two equivalents, maybe the dihalide is acting as a di-electrophile. Hmm, not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So it's a norbornene derivative. If I have two equivalents of the dihalide, perhaps each molecule of dihalide will add across the double bonds of the norbornene? But the norbornene has two double bonds? Wait, no, norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, which has one double bond. So the starting material is a diene, so two double bonds. Wait, no, norbornadiene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So two double bonds in the ring.

So the starting material has two double bonds. When it's treated with the dihalide and sodium iodide, perhaps a diaddition occurs? Maybe each diene is adding a dihalide group.

Alternatively, sodium iodide could be a catalyst for some elimination. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the reaction conditions are elevated temperature. So perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction? But the dihalide is a dienophile? Or no, wait, the norbornadiene is a diene, and the dihalide isn't a typical dienophile. Hmm.

Alternatively, considering the presence of two equivalents of the dihalide, perhaps the dienophile is reacting in a cycloaddition. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is undergoing a substitution reaction.

Wait, sodium iodide and dihalide: perhaps the iodide is displacing the bromide in the dihalide. For example, each dibromomethyl group could undergo substitution with iodide. But that would require a good leaving group, which bromide is. So perhaps the dihalide is being converted into a diiodide? But why would that happen?

Wait, but the dihalide has two bromines on each substituent. So each substituent is CH2Br2. When treated with NaI, perhaps each Br- is replaced by I-. But that would require two equivalents per substituent. So each of the two substituents has two Br atoms, so four Br in total. So with two equivalents of dihalide, but wait, the dihalide is already a di-substituted dihalide. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is undergoing elimination when treated with NaI. For example, when a dihalide undergoes elimination in the presence of a base, it can form an alkyne. But wait, NaI is not a strong base, but maybe in a polar aprotic solvent, it's possible.

Wait, but the starting dihalide is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each substituent is a CH2Br2. Upon treatment with NaI, maybe each Br is replaced by I. So each substituent becomes CH2I2. But why would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is acting as an electrophilic dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction with the norbornadiene as the diene. But Diels-Alder usually uses a diene and a dienophile (like a carbonyl or another diene). The dihalide here is a dienophile? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornadiene. The tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group, especially under basic conditions. So perhaps the norbornadiene is undergoing ring-opening via an SN2 mechanism, forming a diol or something else. But with the dihalide present, maybe it's adding across the ring.

Wait, maybe the tert-butoxy group leaves, forming a carbocation at position 7, and then each of the dihalide's bromides attacks. But wait, the dihalide has two CH2Br2 groups. So perhaps each of the norbornene's rings adds a dihalide substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornadiene is undergoing some kind of cycloaddition with the dihalide. Let me think about the structure. The dihalide has two substituents, each with CH2Br2, so maybe the dihalide can react as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, the norbornadiene has two double bonds. Maybe each double bond reacts with a dihalide. But each dihalide has two Brs on each substituent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is a dienophile, and the norbornadiene is the diene. So each double bond in norbornadiene could react with the dihalide. But since there are two double bonds, maybe each reacts, leading to two additions.

Wait, but the dihalide is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the dihalide itself is a diene with substituents. So it's a diene with two substituents, each carrying two Brs. Maybe it's a conjugated diene.

So, if the norbornadiene (the starting material) is the diene, and the dihalide is the dienophile, then two Diels-Alder reactions would occur? But I'm not sure if the dihalide is a good dienophile. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is acting as a dienophile in a [4+2] cycloaddition.

Wait, but Diels-Alder typically uses a diene and a dienophile like a ketone, nitro compound, etc. The dihalide here might not be the best dienophile, but perhaps under certain conditions, it can participate.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is acting as an electrophilic species, and the norbornadiene is adding to it. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think again about the reaction conditions. Sodium iodide is present. Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. The starting material has a tert-butoxy group, which is a good leaving group. So in the presence of a base, perhaps the O-t-Bu group leaves, generating a carbocation. Then, the dihalide could attack.

Wait, but the dihalide has two CH2Br2 groups. So if the starting material loses the tert-butoxy group, forming a carbocation at position 7, which is a bridgehead in norbornene. But bridgehead carbocations are not very stable. Hmm, that might not be feasible.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is undergoing some elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the dihalide is reacting as a dienophile, adding across the norbornadiene's double bonds. So each of the two double bonds in norbornadiene would react with the dihalide. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Wait, perhaps when the dihalide reacts with the norbornadiene, each of the diene's double bonds adds to the dihalide, leading to a ring-opening or a ring-forming addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is adding as a dienophile, leading to a six-membered ring formed each time. But considering the bicyclic structure, maybe the dihalide is adding in such a way to form a new ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a 1,4-addition for each diene in the norbornadiene, leading to two new rings.

But I'm not making much progress here. Maybe I should think about other steps and see if that helps.

Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, forming product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150°C, forming product 4. We're to find the number of distinct hydrogens in product 4.

So perhaps product 4 is a fully aromatized compound. Let me think about each step.

First step: product 1 is formed. Maybe it's a diels-alder adduct. Then, treating with H2SO4 (aqueous) might hydrolyze some groups. Then treatment with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO suggests some kind of sulfonation or perhaps a dehydration or ring closure.

Wait, SO3 in DMSO with pyridine is a common condition for sulfonation, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent, and with SO3, perhaps it's involved in some kind of sulfonate formation.

Wait, another thought: treating with aqueous H2SO4 might protonate certain groups or cause epoxidation. Alternatively, in the first step, product 1 could have some diol groups if product 1 is a diels-alder adduct that, upon treatment with acid, forms a diol.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a diels-alder reaction, giving a bridged structure with two ester groups or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is a dienophile, and the norbornadiene is reacting in a way to form a new ring. So product 1 would have two new rings added via diels-alder, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is acting as a dienophile, and the norbornadiene is the diene. So each diene in norbornadiene reacts with the dihalide, but since the starting material has two double bonds, perhaps two diels-alder reactions occur, leading to two six-membered rings attached.

But I'm not entirely confident.

After product 1 is treated with H2SO4, forming product 2. Perhaps this step is an acid-catalyzed cyclization or ring formation. For example, if product 1 has hydroxyl groups, they might form hemiacetals or similar structures, but I'm not sure.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. I think this is a sulfonation step where a sulfonic acid group is introduced. Alternatively, SO3 in DMSO with pyridine is used for sulfonating alcohols. So if product 2 has hydroxyl groups, they would be converted to sulfonic acids in product 3.

Finally, product 3 is heated at 150°C to form product 4. Heating sulfonated compounds could lead to elimination reactions, such as the formation of aromatic rings via deprotonation and elimination.

Wait, perhaps product 3 has sulfonic acid groups and some leaving groups, and upon heating, they undergo elimination to form aromatic rings.

Putting it all together, product 4 might be a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple rings. The question is about the number of distinct hydrogen atoms.

So, let's try to imagine the structure step by step.

First step: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI.

If the dihalide is a dienophile, each diene in the norbornadiene would react with the dihalide in a Diels-Alder reaction. So each of the two double bonds in the norbornadiene would form a six-membered ring with the dihalide.

Wait, but the dihalide is a single molecule with two substituents. So perhaps each molecule of dihalide would react with the norbornadiene's two double bonds, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each double bond reacts with one equivalent of dihalide, leading to two adducts.

But with two equivalents of dihalide, perhaps each dihalide reacts with one double bond, leading to two adducts. Alternatively, each dihalide could react with both double bonds, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is undergoing a different reaction. Perhaps the O-t-Bu group is a leaving group, and the dihalide is substituting in.

Wait, but the O-t-Bu is at position 7 of the norbornadiene. If it leaves, it would generate a carbocation at position 7. Then, perhaps the dihalide could attack that carbocation.

Wait, the dihalide is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each substituent is CH2Br2. So each substituent is a methyl group with two Br atoms.

If the carbocation is formed at position 7, perhaps each of the two substituents in the dihalide (each CH2Br2) could attack the carbocation, leading to a bridged structure.

But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is a dienophile, and the norbornadiene is acting as the diene, leading to a Diels-Alder adduct. The norbornadiene has two double bonds, so perhaps each reacts with a dihalide, but since there are two dihalide equivalents, maybe two adducts form.

But I'm not certain. Let me think about what the product after Diels-Alder would look like. The Diels-Alder would add substituents across the diene, creating a six-membered ring with two substituents from the dienophile.

So, if the dihalide is the dienophile, each diene in norbornadiene would react, leading to two six-membered rings attached to the norbornene structure.

But I'm not entirely confident about this.

If product 1 is a Diels-Alder adduct with two new rings attached, then treating with aqueous H2SO4 might protonate the adduct. Alternatively, perhaps the adduct has ester groups that are hydrolyzed under acidic conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the Diels-Alder adduct is a bicyclic structure with two new rings, each from a diels-alder reaction.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction forms a tricyclic compound. For example, the dihalide adds across both double bonds of the norbornadiene, leading to two new rings fusing with the original bicyclo structure.

But I'm not entirely sure.

After that, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, which might cause some ring opening or hydration. Alternatively, if product 1 has epoxide groups, the acid could open them. But I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the Diels-Alder adduct forms a bridge, and upon acid treatment, it undergoes some rearrangement or ring formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a [2+4] cycloaddition, leading to a new ring system.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is adding to the norbornadiene's double bonds via electrophilic addition, leading to vicinal dihalides. But then, NaI might be a catalyst for substitution.

But I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should proceed to the next steps.

Assuming product 1 is a Diels-Alder adduct with two new rings, product 2 is formed by treating with aqueous sulfuric acid. This could lead to the formation of diols, perhaps by hydrolysis of ester groups or epoxides. Alternatively, if the adduct has ketones, they might be reduced in acidic conditions, but I'm not sure.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 in DMSO with pyridine. I think this is a sulfonation reaction. So any hydroxyl groups in product 2 would be sulfonated to form sulfonic acid groups in product 3.

Finally, heating product 3 at 150°C leads to elimination of certain groups, possibly forming aromatic rings.

Putting this all together, perhaps product 4 is a highly symmetrical aromatic compound with several rings and substituents.

But to determine the number of distinct hydrogen atoms, I need to figure out the structure. Let's think about possible symmetries.

If the final product is something like a naphthalene derivative with substituents, the number of distinct hydrogens would depend on the symmetry. For example, a highly symmetrical molecule like benzene has only one type of hydrogen. But if there are substituents in a symmetrical pattern, the number of types decreases.

Wait, let's imagine that the final product is a tricyclic aromatic compound with multiple substituents. For example, if it's a molecule like adamantane but fully aromatic, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cubane-like structure, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps after the elimination steps, the molecule forms multiple fused benzene rings, leading to a structure with several equivalent and nonequivalent hydrogens.

Another thought: if the starting material has a tert-butoxy group, which is a bulky substituent, and after several reactions, perhaps it's converted into a sulfonic acid group, which is also bulky.

Wait, perhaps the first step forms a bridge structure where the dihalide adds across the diene, leading to a bicyclic structure with two new substituents. Then, acid treatment leads to some ring opening or formation of diol groups, which are then sulfonated, leading to product 3. Heating this could eliminate some groups, forming rings.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction leads to a compound that, upon treatment with acid, forms a diol, which is then sulfonated to form a sulfonic acid, which upon heating eliminates to form an aromatic ring.

Wait, if the sulfonic acid group is in a position that allows elimination, perhaps it forms a benzene ring. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the steps leads to the formation of a new ring, so the final product is a highly fused aromatic system.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging to count the distinct hydrogens.

Wait, looking at the options, the possible answers are 4,7,8,10. So, probably the product has some symmetry, leading to a moderate number of distinct hydrogens.

Another approach: perhaps the final product is a highly symmetrical structure, such as a cube or a sphere with multiple identical faces, leading to a small number of distinct hydrogens.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a norbornene-derived structure with multiple substituents that are arranged symmetrically.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction adds two substituents from the dihalide across the norbornadiene, leading to a more complex ring system. Then, after sulfonation and elimination, the molecule becomes aromatic with several equivalent hydrogens.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a tricyclic compound with multiple substituents that have different environments, leading to several distinct hydrogens.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. Maybe I should think about the possible number of H environments.

If the final product has several bridges and rings, the number of distinct H could be between 4 and 10.

Wait, another thought: during the sulfonation step, any -OH groups present in product 2 are converted to -OSO3H groups in product 3. Then, upon heating, elimination occurs, perhaps forming a new ring.

If the product after elimination has a structure similar to a cubane, which has 8 equivalent Hs, but cubane is a cube with all Hs equivalent, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, if the final product is a structure with multiple rings, like naphthalene, which has 8 hydrogens, but in different environments. Wait, naphthalene has 8 Hs, but in two equivalent sets (4 in each ring, but some equivalent via symmetry). Wait, no, naphthalene has 8 Hs in different positions. Actually, in naphthalene, there are two equivalent sets: four Hs are equivalent (in the 1 and 4 positions), and the other four are also equivalent (2,3,5,6). So total of two types, but that's not matching the options.

Wait, maybe the final product has a structure where each substituent leads to a different environment for Hs, leading to more distinct Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a highly substituted bicyclic compound with multiple substituents, leading to a higher number of distinct Hs.

Wait, considering the first step uses two equivalents of dihalide, perhaps the product has two substituents from each dihalide, leading to four substituents. Then, after sulfonation and elimination, those substituents might form certain groups that affect the symmetry.

Another angle: the initial product 1 would have four substituents (since two dihalide molecules are used, each adding two substituents, but perhaps each dihalide adds one substituent per double bond). Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each dihalide adds two substituents, so two dihalide molecules would add four substituents.

But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide adds as a substituent across each double bond of the norbornadiene, leading to two substituents per dihalide. So two dihalides would add four substituents in total. Then, upon treatment with acid, these substituents might form diols or other functional groups.

But I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about the possible options and see which makes the most sense.

The options are 4,7,8,10. So, for a molecule with a certain level of symmetry, the number could be 8.

Wait, another thought: if the final product has a structure that leads to 8 distinct hydrogen atoms, maybe it's something like two benzene rings with substituents arranged symmetrically.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a cube-like structure with eight equivalent positions, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a structure similar to adamantane, which has 14 equivalent Hs, but that's not one of the options. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a molecule with multiple identical substituents arranged symmetrically, leading to fewer distinct Hs.

Wait, perhaps the product has two rings, each contributing four distinct Hs, but that's a total of eight.

Alternatively, maybe the product has a structure where several Hs are in equivalent positions due to symmetry, leading to a total of 7 or 8 distinct Hs.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a molecule where each substituent leads to its own set of Hs, but due to the molecule's symmetry, the number is reduced.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging.

Wait, another angle: the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. After the first reaction, perhaps the tert-butoxy group is replaced by something else. Then, after the subsequent steps, the product becomes more symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms a structure with two new rings, which upon sulfonation and elimination, becomes a fully aromatic compound with high symmetry.

But I'm not certain.

Another thought: the starting material is a norbornadiene derivative. The Diels-Alder reaction would add a six-membered ring across each double bond. So, perhaps the first step forms a more complex polycyclic structure.

Then, the acid treatment could lead to ring opening or rearrangement. Sulfonation would add SO3 groups, which upon heating, might eliminate to form rings, leading to an aromatic structure.

Assuming the final product is a highly symmetrical aromatic compound, perhaps the number of distinct Hs is 8.

So among the options, 8 is option A, and 7 is option D.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the product has 10 distinct Hs, but that seems high.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the number of steps and possible functional groups.

The first step adds substituents. The second step (acid) might remove some groups. The third step (sulfonation) adds SO3 groups. The fourth step (heating) eliminates groups to form rings.

So, perhaps the final product has six-membered aromatic rings, which would have Hs in different environments.

Wait, norbornene is a bicyclic structure with bridgehead Hs. If the structure becomes more fused, the Hs may be in different environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a molecule like cubane, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a structure with three rings, leading to several distinct Hs.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should just make an educated guess based on the options and the possible structures.

Considering that the starting material has a bicyclo structure and after several reactions, perhaps the final product is a tricyclic compound with multiple substituents, leading to 8 distinct Hs. So the answer would be A)8.


The problem involves a multi-step synthesis starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which undergoes a series of reactions to form the final product, product 4. The goal is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**:  
   The starting material reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. The tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group, and the reaction likely involves substitution or cycloaddition. The dihalide may act as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction with the norbornadiene, forming a polycyclic structure. The use of two equivalents of dihalide suggests that two new substituents are added to the norbornadiene structure.

2. **Reaction 2**:  
   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. This step could involve protonation, hydrolysis, or rearrangement of functional groups, potentially forming diols or other intermediates.

3. **Reaction 3**:  
   Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This step likely introduces sulfonic acid groups (-SO₃H) to any hydroxyl groups present in product 2, forming product 3.

4. **Reaction 4**:  
   Product 3 is heated at 150°C. This step likely involves elimination or rearrangement, leading to the formation of aromatic rings or a more stable polycyclic structure. The final product, product 4, is likely a highly symmetrical polycyclic aromatic compound.

### Symmetry and Distinct Hydrogens:
The final product is expected to have a structure with significant symmetry due to the reaction sequence and the formation of aromatic rings. This symmetry reduces the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. Based on the options provided (4, 7, 8, 10), the most plausible number of distinct hydrogen atoms is **8**, as the final product likely has a structure with moderate symmetry, such as a tricyclic aromatic compound.

Answer: A
