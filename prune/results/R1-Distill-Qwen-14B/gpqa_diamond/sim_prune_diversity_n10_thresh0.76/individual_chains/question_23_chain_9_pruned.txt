Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about a reaction where a specific compound is treated with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Hmm, okay, I'll try to draw its structure in my mind. So, benzene ring with an ether group (-O-) attached. The substituent on the oxygen is a butenyl group. Specifically, 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let me break that down: the butenyl chain is four carbons long, with a double bond starting at position 3. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, butenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, that can't be. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl. The butenyl group has four carbons. The double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, but but has four carbons, so the numbering would be 1, 2, 3, 4. So the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, that's single bonds. The -en-1-yl part: 1-yl means the substituent is on carbon 1. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between 3 and 4. Wait, no, that's not possible because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Oh, wait, no. Let me correct that: but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, but that's five carbons.
