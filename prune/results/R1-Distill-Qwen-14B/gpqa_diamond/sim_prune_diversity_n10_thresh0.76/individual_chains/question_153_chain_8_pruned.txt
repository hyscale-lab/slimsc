Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about Michael additions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition reaction. I need to figure out the products for each and then match them with the options provided.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate under NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH. I remember that dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it has two malonate groups which can form enolates. The other reactant is a methyl acrylate with a p-tolyl group.

In a Michael addition, the enolate of the donor attacks the beta position of the acceptor. So, the donor (dimethyl malonate) forms an enolate, which attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. The acceptor here is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, the structure of the acceptor is CH2=CH-(p-tolyl), but wait no, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, but 3-position would mean the substituent is on the acrylate's central carbon?

Wait, maybe it's CH2-C-(p-tolyl)=CH2? No, wait, maybe the structure is:

The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is at the 3-position. So, perhaps it's CH2=C-(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Wait no, because 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Hmm, maybe the structure of the acceptor is CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)-COOCH3. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is on C2.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structures. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOMe)2, right? So when it forms an enolate, it would deprotonate one of the alpha positions to the carbonyl. The enolate would attack the beta position of the acceptor.

The acceptor is the acrylate. So, the Michael addition would add the malonate's enolate to the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So, the enolate (from the donor) attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 group in the acceptor?), but wait, the acceptor is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Wait, for the Michael addition, the donor's enolate attacks the acceptor
