Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me jot down what I know and try to work through it.

The question is about exoplanets and their orbital periods. So, three planets: Planet1, Planet2, Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variations. But I'm not sure if that method affects this problem directly, so maybe I can set that aside for now.

The key information given is the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. Also, their albedo is the same, 0.3, like Earth's. The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = [(L (1 - a))/(16 π σ D^2)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance. Oh wait, but since the star's luminosity might be the same for all planets (assuming they orbit the same star), and albedo is the same, the equilibrium temperature would depend inversely on the square root of the distance. Because T is proportional to (L^(1/4)) / (D^(1/2)).

Wait, let me think again. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) ), where T_star is the star's effective temperature. But since all planets are around the same star, R_star and T_star are the same, and a is same for all. So the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D). So if T1 is the temperature of Planet1, T2 of Planet2, etc., then T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D), so the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt(D2/D1). Or wait, maybe I got the ratio the other way around. Let me think.

If T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D), then T1/T2 = (sqrt(D2)) / sqrt(D1). So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Because T1 = k/sqrt(D1),
