Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The question is about finding the correct statement regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the intrinsic angular momentum, often called spin, for a muon (which is a lepton, like an electron but heavier) has components represented by matrices. The given operator Ay is c multiplied by matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I can write S as:

S = [ [0, -i],
      [i, 0] ]

So the operator Ay is c * S. Let me compute that. Since c = h/(4π), multiplying each element of S by c gives:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ].

Wait, but wait—what are the eigenvalues of Ay? I remember that for a spin-½ particle, the possible eigenvalues of the angular momentum components (like Sx, Sy, Sz) are ± ħ/2. But wait, since Ay is c times S, and c is h/(4π), then perhaps the eigenvalues of Ay are ± (h/(4π)) * (ħ/2) ? Wait, no, wait. Maybe I should think about the matrix S first.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues of S would help. The matrix S is a Pauli matrix, right? Oh wait, no, S isn't the standard Pauli matrix. Wait, the Pauli matrices usually are σx, σy, σz. Let me think. The standard σy matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which matches the given S. So S is σy. 

So, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for the spin. But wait, no, wait: the spin operator is usually written as S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ is the Pauli matrix. So if S is σy, then the operator would be (ħ/2) σy. But in this problem, the matrix S is given as σy, so the operator Ay is c multiplied by S, which is (h/(4π)) * σy.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Let me think about the dimensions. Planck's constant h has units of J·s. The spin angular momentum S has units of ħ (which is h/(2π)) times something dimensionless. Hmm. But perhaps that's not the main point here.

So the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are ±1. So the matrix S has eigenvalues 1 and -1, perhaps? Or wait, wait. No, no, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, and they have eigenvalues
