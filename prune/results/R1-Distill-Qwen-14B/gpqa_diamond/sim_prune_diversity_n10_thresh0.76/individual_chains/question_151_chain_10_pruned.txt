Okay, so I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0 when the system is in the state given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on quantum mechanics, but let me think this through.

Wait, I remember that observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. Oh right, because their eigenvalues are real, which corresponds to possible measurement outcomes. But in this question, the matrix P is given. I should check if it's Hermitian. Let me look at the matrix again.

The matrix P has first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So, the elements are symmetric across the diagonal. Oh, wait, the element at (1,2) is 1/sqrt(2), and (2,1) is also 1/sqrt(2). Same for (2,3) and (3,2). So yes, it's a symmetric matrix, which makes it Hermitian because all elements are real. So P is a valid observable.

The state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). I think I should first normalize it because probabilities are based on normalized states. The state vector's components are [-1, 2, 1]. To normalize, I need to find the norm (or magnitude) of this vector.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state vector is each component divided by sqrt(6): [-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)]. Let me note that down.

Wait, but sometimes in quantum mechanics, the state is assumed to be normalized. Hmm, the question says it's the state at time t, but doesn't specify. I think I should proceed by normalizing it because probabilities have to sum to 1.

Now, the observable P has eigenvalues which are the possible measurement outcomes. I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Because the question is about the probability of getting 0, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 and compute the projection of the state onto that
