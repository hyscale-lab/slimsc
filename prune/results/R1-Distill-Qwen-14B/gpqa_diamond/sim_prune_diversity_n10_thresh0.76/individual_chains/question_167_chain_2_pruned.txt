Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. I remember that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, right? Because coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator, and they're also Gaussian states. So the Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of these coherent states, which makes it a non-Gaussian state because it's a sum of Gaussians but in a way that creates interference.

The normalisation constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). Wait, I think that comes from the overlap between the two coherent states. Because |<alpha| -alpha>|² would involve some exponential terms. Oh right! Since coherent states are not orthogonal; their inner product is exp(-|alpha|² - |-alpha|² + alpha* (-alpha) + c.c.), but wait, alpha and -alpha. Let me see, |alpha> and |-alpha> have inner product exp(-|alpha|^2 - |alpha|^2 + alpha* (-alpha) + (-alpha)* alpha) ). Wait, maybe it's just exp(-2|alpha|^2) because alpha*(-alpha) is negative |alpha| squared. Or maybe I'm getting confused. Anyway, the normalisation N is given, so I don't have to calculate it from scratch.

The non-Gaussianity (nG) is given by the relative entropy measure del_b, which is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Wait, I thought relative entropy usually is S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho - rho ln tau). But here, the formula seems different. Oh wait, the way it's written is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So it's the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and that of tau. Hmm, that's a bit unusual. I think typically non-Gaussianity measures would involve the relative entropy between rho and the most Gaussian state (like the closest Gaussian state to rho), but maybe in this case, the reference tau is the Gaussian state that the cat state
