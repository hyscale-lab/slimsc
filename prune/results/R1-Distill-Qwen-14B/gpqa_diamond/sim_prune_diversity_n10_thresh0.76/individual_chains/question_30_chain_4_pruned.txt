Okay, so I've got this question here about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electrons system. Oh right, conjugated pi systems are common in dyes and they're involved in electronic transitions, like when they absorb or emit light. So the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV, and I need to find out what color it absorbs.

Wait, wait. I remember that the color absorbed is related to the energy gap in the molecule. The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state. Oh right, because when a molecule absorbs a photon, an electron gets excited from a lower energy level to a higher one. And this energy is related to the wavelength of light by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c the speed of light, and λ the wavelength.

But wait, the question says the dye emits light of 2.3393 eV. So emission is when the molecule drops from an excited state back to a lower energy state, releasing energy as light. But absorption is the reverse process—when it absorbs a photon, it gets excited. So the energy of the absorbed photon should be equal to the energy difference between the ground and excited states, right?

So if the emission energy is 2.3393 eV, that would correspond to the energy gap. Because when the molecule drops from the excited state (say, higher energy level) to a lower one, it emits a photon with energy equal to the gap. So absorption would require the same energy because it's the same transition in reverse.

Wait no, no. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when a molecule emits light, it's the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. If it's emitting 2.3393 eV, that's the energy it releases. So the energy of the absorbed photon must have been the same as the energy gap. Because when it absorbs, it uses that energy to jump, and when it emits, it releases it.

So the energy of the absorbed photon is 2.3393 eV. Wait, but the question is about the color of light absorbed. So we need to find the wavelength corresponding to that energy, then determine the color.

I remember the relationship between energy and wavelength. The formula is E (in eV) =
