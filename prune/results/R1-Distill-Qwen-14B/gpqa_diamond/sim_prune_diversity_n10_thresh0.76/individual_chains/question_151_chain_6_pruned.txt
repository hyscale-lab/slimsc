Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see. The question is about calculating the probability of measuring an observable P and getting the value 0. 

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, so that's a 3x1 vector, right? So it's a three-dimensional state vector. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually represented as column vectors in a Hilbert space, each component corresponding to an eigenstate of the observable.

The observable P is represented by a matrix. Let me write down the matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row is (0, 1/√2, 0). So P looks like this:

[ 0       1/√2      0   ]
[1/√2    0         1/√2 ]
[ 0       1/√2      0   ]

Wait, I'm trying to recall, observables correspond to Hermitian operators. Let me check if P is Hermitian. The diagonal elements are 0, which are real. For the off-diagonal elements, the (1,2) element is 1/√2, and the (2,1) is also 1/√2, so that's good. The (1,3) is 0, (3,1) is 0. The (2,3) is 1/√2, and (3,2) is 1/√2. So yeah, P is Hermitian, which makes sense for an observable.

Now, the problem is to find the probability that a measurement of P yields 0. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement of an observable are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which ones are 0.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P, and then find the projection of the state onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0. That would give me the probability.

So first, find the eigenvalues of P. Let's denote P as a matrix and
