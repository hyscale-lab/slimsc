Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), right? Where β is 1/(kT). So I need to figure out all the possible states of the three spins and their corresponding energies.

Each spin has two possible states: +1 or -1. So for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let's list them all.

Let me think about the states as triplets (S1, S2, S3). So the possible combinations are:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (-1, +1, +1)
5. (-1, -1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (+1, -1, -1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now I need to calculate the energy E for each state.

The energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's compute each term.

Let's compute each part step by step.

For each triplet, compute S1S2, S1S3, S2S3, sum them, multiply by -J.

Case 1: (+1, +1, +1)
S1S2 = 1*1=1
S1S3 =1*1=1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum = 3 → E = -J *3 = -3J

Case 2: (+1, +1, -1)
S1S2=1*1=1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
Sum = 1 -1 -1 = -1 → E = -J*(-1) = J

Case3: (+1, -1, +1)
S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=(-1)*1=-1
Sum = -1 +1 -1 = -1 → E= J

Case4: (-1, +1, +1)
S1S2=(-1)*1=-1
S1S3=(-1)*1=-1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum = -1 -1 +1 = -1 → E= J

Case5: (-1,-1,+1)
S1S2= (-1)*(-1)=1
S1S3= (-1)*1=-1
S2S3= (-1)*1=-1
Sum = 1 -1 -1 = -1 → E= J

Case6: (-1, +1, -1)
S1S2= (-1)(1)= -1
S1S3= (-1)(-1)=1
S2S3= (1)(-1)= -1
Sum = -1 +1 -1 = -1 → E= J

Case7: (+1, -1, -1)
S1S2= 1*(-1) = -1
S1S3= 1*(-1)=-1
S2S3= (-1)(-1)=1
Sum= -1 -1 +1= -1 → E= J

Case8: (-1, -1, -1)
S1S2= (-1)*(-1)=1
S1S3= (-1)*(-1)=1
S2S3= (-1)*(-1)=1
Sum= 3 → E = -J *3 = -3J

Wait a second, so looking at all cases:

- Cases 1 and 8 have E = -3J.
- The other 6 cases (2-7) each have E = J.

So the energies are grouped as:

Number of states with E=-3J: 2 (cases 1 and 8)
Number of states with E=J: 6 (cases 2-7)

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. Because in cases 2-7, each has sum -1, so E= J. So yes, 6 states with E=J and 2 with E=-3J.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me see again:

In cases 2-7, the sum is -1, so E = -J*(-1) = J*1 = J. So each of those has energy J.

Case 1 and 8 have sum 3, so E= -3J.

So when calculating the partition function Z, which is the sum over all states of exp( -β E ). But wait, the energy is E, so -β E.

Wait no, Z is the sum of exp( -β E ), correct. Because E is the energy of each state.

So each state contributes exp(-β E).

So for E = -3J: exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3β J).

There are 2 such states, so their contribution is 2 * exp(3β J).

For E=J: exp(-β*J) = exp(-β J). But wait, wait, no! Wait, E is positive J, so -β E is -β J.

So each of the 6 states contributes exp(-β J). So the total contribution is 6 exp( -β J ).

So Z is 2 exp(3β J) +6 exp( -β J).

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^{Jβ} → No, because 2 is multiplied by e^(-3Jβ), but that's when E is positive 3J. Wait no, E is -3J, so exp(-β E) is exp(3Jβ). So option A is 2 e^{-3Jβ} which would be if E was +3J, but our case is E=-3J, so that's exp(3Jβ).

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: Z= 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ}

Option B: Z= 2 e^{3Jβ
