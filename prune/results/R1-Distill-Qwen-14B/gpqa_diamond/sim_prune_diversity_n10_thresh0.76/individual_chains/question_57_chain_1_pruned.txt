Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude plays a big role, especially when it comes to things like the differential cross-section. The question is asking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, the given data are phase shifts for different l values, I think. The measured phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh, and we're told to ignore the rest, so I guess we only consider these up to l=4.

I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I recall that the scattering amplitude f(l,θ) has real and imaginary parts. Oh right, the optical theorem comes into play here. The optical theorem relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (which is when θ=0°, along the incident direction) to the total cross-section. 

The formula, as I remember, is something like 4π/(k) times the imaginary part of f(0), where k is the wave number. And this equals the total cross-section (σ_total). But wait, cross-section is related to the scattering amplitude. Alternatively, I think the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by a sum over all the phase shifts. 

Wait, no, maybe it's more straightforward. Each partial wave contributes to the total cross-section. The total cross-section is the sum over l of (2l+1) times (sin δ_l - δ_l), right? Because for each angular momentum state l, the contribution is (2l+1)(sin δ_l - δ_l). So the total cross-section, σ_total, is the sum from l=0 to some maximum of (2l+1)(sin δ_l - δ_l). 

And the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude, Im f(0), is equal to k/(4π) times σ_total. Oh right, because from the optical theorem: Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) σ_total.

Wait, but what's k here? I think k is
