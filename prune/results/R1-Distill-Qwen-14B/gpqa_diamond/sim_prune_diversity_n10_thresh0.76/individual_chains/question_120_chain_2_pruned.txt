Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm not super confident about this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. I think the formula is something like distance d is equal to 1 over parallax plx, right? Oh wait, yeah, d = 1 / plx, but I think the units are in parsecs. So the larger the parallax, the closer the star is. That makes sense because parallax decreases as distance increases.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. So that probably means that the number density of stars is the same in all directions. Wait, uniform in terms of spatial distribution, so the same number of stars per unit volume everywhere?

Wait, but parallax is not the same as distance. So if I'm looking at a range of parallaxes, I need to relate that to the volume of space they occupy.

Let me think about how parallax and volume relate. Suppose I have a thin shell at a certain distance d. The thickness of the shell would correspond to a small change in parallax, delta_plx. Because as distance increases, parallax decreases, so a small change in distance corresponds to a small change in plx.

The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4π r² dr, where r is the radius (distance), and dr is the thickness. But wait, in terms of parallax, dr is the change in distance, which relates to the change in parallax.

Wait, but I'm looking for the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So for a given range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range?

Wait, maybe I should express the number of stars in a range of parallax as a function of dplx. Let's say there's a uniform density of stars, which I'll call n (number per unit volume). So the number of stars between two distances d1 and d2 would be n * (4π/3) * (d2³ - d1³). 

But how does this translate to parallax? Since plx = 1/d, plx1 = 1/d1 and plx2 = 1/d2. So d1 = 1/plx1
