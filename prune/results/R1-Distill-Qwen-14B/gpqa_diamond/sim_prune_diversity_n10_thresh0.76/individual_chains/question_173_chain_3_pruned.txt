Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the uncertainty principle and estimating the minimum uncertainty in energy for an electron. Hmm, I remember something about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle from my studies. Let me think.

The problem states that an electron is traveling along the x-direction at a speed v = 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I'm supposed to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. The options are all in the order of 10^-16 to 10^-19 J, so it's a very small energy uncertainty.

Wait, I recall that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh right, and since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, we can probably use the equality ΔxΔp ≈ ħ/2. Then, once I find Δp, I can relate that to the uncertainty in energy.

But wait, how does that relate to energy? Oh, because the uncertainty in energy is related to the uncertainty in momentum. Since energy is related to momentum by E = p²/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So, the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be approximately Δp²/(2m). Right?

Let me outline the
