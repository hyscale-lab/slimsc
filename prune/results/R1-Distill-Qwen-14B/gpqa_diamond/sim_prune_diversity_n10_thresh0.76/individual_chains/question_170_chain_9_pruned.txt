Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through.

First, I remember that the spin state is given as (3i, 4). So that's a two-component vector, right? That makes sense because electrons have spin-1/2, so the state is a two-dimensional vector in the Hilbert space.

The question asks for the expectation value of S_y. I think the expectation value is calculated using the formula <ψ| S_y |ψ>, where |ψ> is the spin state. But wait, what's the matrix form of S_y?

Oh right, the Pauli matrices. The σ matrices are the Pauli matrices, and S is ħ/2 times those. So σ_y is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y should be (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So S_y = ħ/2 * σ_y, which would be [[0, -iħ/2], [iħ/2, 0]].

Wait, no, let me correct that. The σ matrices are each 2x2 matrices. So S_x, S_y, S_z are each (ħ/2) times σ_x, σ_y, σ_z respectively. So yeah, S_y is (ħ/2) times the σ_y matrix given.

So the next step is to compute the expectation value. So the state is |ψ> = (3i, 4)^T. Wait, or is it a row vector? Because in expectation value calculations, you usually have a column vector for the state. Let me make sure. The state ψ is written as a column vector, I think. So ψ is:

[ 3i ]
[ 4 ]

Wait, the problem says the spin state is (3i,4), which probably represents a column vector with first component 3i and second 4.

The expectation value <S_y> is ψ† S_y ψ.

So ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ. So ψ† would be [ -3 (since the conjugate of 3i is -3), 4 ].

Let me write out the matrices. So S_y is:

(ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So when I compute ψ† S_y ψ, it's a scalar that comes from the matrix multiplication.

Let's compute this step by step. Let me denote ψ as a column vector:

ψ = [ [3i], [4] ]

ψ† is [ [3i*, 4* ] ] = [ [-3, 4 ] ]

So ψ† S_y is [ [-3, 4 ] ] multiplied by S_y, and then the result is multiplied by ψ.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute it as:

<ψ| S_y |ψ> = ψ† (S_y ψ )

So first compute
