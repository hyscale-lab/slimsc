Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, and I'm a bit rusty on the details, but let's try to think it through. So, the scientist is making a calibration curve for his qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and did serial dilutions. He ran three technical replicates for each concentration. The efficiency is 100%, R2 is 1, and the slope is -3.3. 

Wait, what does that mean again? Oh right, in qPCR, the efficiency usually is around 90-110%, and a 100% efficiency would mean perfect amplification each cycle. But wait, isn't 100% efficiency a bit idealistic? Because in reality, some cycles might have less efficiency due to various factors. But maybe this setup is perfect for the calibration curve.

The R-squared value is 1, which means a perfect correlationâ€”so the data fits the curve perfectly. That's good because it implies the calibration is working well. The slope is -3.3. Hmm, the slope in a qPCR plot (like a standard curve) is related to the efficiency. The formula I remember is that the slope equals log(e) * (1/ efficiency), but wait, actually, the standard curve is usually modeled as Ct = log(target) * slope + intercept, or something like that. Oh wait, the standard curve's slope is usually negative because as the concentration increases, Ct decreases (since you reach the threshold sooner).

Wait, let me think. The standard curve is often a plot of Ct vs. log concentration. The slope is usually around -3.
