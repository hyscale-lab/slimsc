Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll do my best to figure it out.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me visualize that. So, cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH. Position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Or wait, maybe it's CH2-C(CH2)CH2 with a double bond? No, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So it's CH2-C(=CH2)-. Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group CH2-C(=CH2)-? Or maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2, but the substituent is on the second carbon. Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, and the group is attached to C2. So that would be CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond. Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of it as the substituent is isopropenyl. Oh, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as isopropenyl group. So it's CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? No, wait, no. Let me think again. Prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double
