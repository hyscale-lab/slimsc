Okay, so I've got this question about transcription factors and mutations. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

The question talks about a transcription factor subunit. When it's inactive, it's waiting for a signal from a membrane phosphorylation cascade. Once it gets phosphorylated on Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, moves into the nucleus, and helps with gene transcription.

So there are two mutations mentioned here. Mutation X is a missense mutation in the transactivation domain and is a recessive loss-of-function. That means that for the protein to not work, the individual must have two copies of this mutation. Because it's recessive, the wild-type allele would probably still function, but with two X's, it's inactive.

Then there's mutation Y, which is a heterozygous missense in the dimerization domain. And it acts as a dominant-negative. Dominant-negative means that even if you have one copy, it will interfere with the normal allele, causing the function to be lost.

Wait, dominant-negative mutations usually occur when the mutated protein can't function but can interfere with the normal protein. So in this case, Y is in the dimerization domain. Dimerization is when two subunits come together. If Y causes the protein to not dimerize correctly, then when the normal and mutant proteins are present, they might not form proper dimers.

Let me think about how this affects the transcription factor. The normal process is, upon activation, the subunit (let's say it's a single unit called A) gets phosphorylated, dimerizes (maybe pairs with another A), and moves to the nucleus.

But if there's a mutation Y in the dimerization domain (heterozygous), meaning one allele is Y, the other is wild-type. The Y protein would have a faulty dimerization domain. So when the Y protein tries to dimerize, it might not work, but perhaps it can still bind to the wild-type protein.

Wait, but wait. Dimerization usually requires both subunits to have the correct structure. So if one has a mutation in the dimer domain, the dimer formation between two Ys might be impaired, but what about when a Y and a wild-type are together?

In dominant-negative situations, the mutant protein can disrupt the function of the wild-type. So if the Y protein is present, it might interfere with the wild-type's ability to form functional dimers. Because even if one subunit is Y, when they try to pair, the dimer might not function, perhaps because the Y part can't form the necessary interactions.

So in the presence of Y (heterozygous), the wild-type allele is being expressed, but the dimerization is affected. So when the activation signal comes, the phosphorylation occurs, but when they try to dimerize, the Y allele's protein might prevent proper dimer formation. So the transcription factor can't function as a dimer, leading to loss of function.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Change of protein conformation and gain-of-function. Hmm, dominant-negative usually causes loss, not gain. So probably not A.

Option B: Protein degradation and loss of wild-type. I'm not sure about degradation. The mutant Y probably doesn't lead to degradation, but maybe affects the function. So not sure.

Option C: Loss of dimerization and wild-type phenotype. Wait, the wild-type allele is present but the Y allele is dominant-negative. So the presence of Y should cause the phenotype to be negative. So the overall effect would be loss of function, not wild-type. So this option seems incorrect.

Option D: Protein aggregation and loss of function. Aggregation could happen if proteins misfold and form aggregates, which would prevent proper function. If the dimerization is faulty, maybe the proteins can't form proper dimers and aggregate instead. So the function is lost because the proteins are stuck in aggregates and can't do their job.

Wait, but how does the presence of Y cause protein aggregation? Because if the dimer
