Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is sometimes called the non-rigid rotor model. The question is about finding the momentum of a photon needed to switch the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh right, fundamental state usually means the lowest energy state, which for rotation-vibration might be when both rotational and vibrational quantum numbers are at their lowest. So, the fundamental state would be the ground state, so n=0 for vibration and J=0 for rotation, maybe?

But wait, the problem says it's in the fundamental state, and it's absorbing a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would have a higher energy than the fundamental. But what's the order of energy levels here? I think in the rotational-vibrational model, the vibrational energy levels are quantized and each vibrational level has rotational levels associated with it. So the energy levels are quantized in a certain order.

Wait, the energy levels go as (n + J) increasing. The fundamental state is n=0, J=0, so the next possible state would be either J=1 (same n), or n=1 (same J). But the problem says it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the next lowest energy after the fundamental state.

Wait, that's a bit tricky.
