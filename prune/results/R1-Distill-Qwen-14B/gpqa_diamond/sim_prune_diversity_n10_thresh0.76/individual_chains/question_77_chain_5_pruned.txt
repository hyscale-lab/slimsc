Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes and they rearrange when heat or light is applied. But wait, the question has two parts: part A and part B. Let me try to tackle them one by one.

Starting with part A: The reactant is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So, the structure is a benzene ring with an ether group attached. The ether group is connected to a (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl) group. Let me draw that out. The benzene has an OCH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let's see: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, but it's 3-methyl, so the substituent is on C3. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)-H, but wait, the double bond is between C2 and C3. So more accurately, the 1-yl group is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-? Wait, maybe I should write it as CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2- but the double bond is in position 2. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CH2-C6H5? Wait, no. Wait, the molecule is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl benzene. So, the benzene is attached to a CH2-O- group, which is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. But it's 3-methyl, so wait, but but has four carbons. So position 3 is the third carbon from the point of attachment. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-C(CH3)-, but with a double bond between C2 and
