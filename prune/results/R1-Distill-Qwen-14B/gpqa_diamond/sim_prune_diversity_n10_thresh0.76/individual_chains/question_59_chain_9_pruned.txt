Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, especially when mixing different solutions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A) 12.62, B)1.38, C)8.92, D)8.68.

Hmm, right. So, mixing these three solutions. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So first, I should probably figure out how much of each acid and base is present and see if they neutralize each other.

Let me list out each solution's details:

1. CH3COOH: 500 mL, 0.1 M. Acetic acid is a weak acid.
2. HCl: 400 mL, 0.2 M. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid.
3. Ba(OH)2: 300 mL, 0.3 M. Barium hydroxide is a strong base.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH- ions. So that's something to note.

First, I need to calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Let's calculate the moles for each solution.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity is moles per liter. So 0.1 M in 0.5 L (500 mL) is 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

HCl:
0.2 M in 0.4 L is 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, providing 0.08 moles of H+ ions.

Ba(OH)2:
0.3 M in 0.3 L is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-, the total moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, so the total H+ comes from HCl and any that might come from CH3COOH. But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. Hmm, but when you mix acids and bases, the strong acid will contribute H+ ions, and the base will contribute OH- ions.

So, maybe I should first find the net H+ or OH- after mixing all solutions.

But wait, the mixing will change the concentration because the total volume increases. Let me think about the total volume. The total volume is 500 + 400 + 30
