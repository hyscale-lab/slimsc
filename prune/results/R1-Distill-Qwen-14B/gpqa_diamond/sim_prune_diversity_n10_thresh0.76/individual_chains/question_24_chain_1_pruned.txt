Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The problem says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y of two other liquids. Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So, I'm thinking that mixture X probably contains some compound that can undergo addition reactions with bromine, like alkenes or something similar, because those reactions can decolorize bromine water.

When mixture X is hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, it produces only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Also, Z is a solvent and is part of mixture Y. And importantly, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's saturated, no more hydrogenation possible.

The other thing is that mixture X doesn't have any conjugated multiple bonds. So maybe it's something like a diene but not conjugated. Hmm.

Let me think about the hydrogenation part. If X is a mixture of two alkenes or something, and when hydrogenated, it gives Z, which is a single hydrocarbon. That suggests that both components in X, when hydrogenated, lead to the same product Z. So maybe each component in X is an isomer that, when hydrogenated, becomes the same product.

Wait, but wait. Because X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine. So perhaps they are each unsaturated. When hydrogenated, they both become the same saturated hydrocarbon Z.

So, what's the formula of Z? Let's calculate that. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is 1/7. So, 14.28% is approximately 1/7. Let me compute that.

Assume the formula of Z is CnHm. The mass of H is 14.28% of the molar mass. So, (m * 1) / (12n + m) = 1/7. Let's solve for m in terms of n.

So,

(m) / (12n + m) = 1/7
7m = 12n + m
6m = 12n
m = 2n

So, the formula is CnH2n. That's an alkane, since alkenes would have double bonds but Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's saturated. So Z is an alkane where m=2n.

Wait, but wait, that would mean the formula is CnH2n. That's a structure like an alkene? No, no, wait, no. Wait, no, because if it's an alkane, the formula is CnH2n+2. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Wait, the calculation says m = 2n. So for a hydrocarbon, the formula is CnHm. So m = 2n.

So, possible options could be something like ethylene (C2H4) but wait
