Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The pion is at rest, and we have the rest masses given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is... wait, neutrinos are almost massless, right? So I can probably ignore its rest mass for this problem.

Hmm, okay. So when a particle is at rest and decays into two particles, I think conservation of energy and momentum must be applied. Since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum.

Let me jot down the variables:

Rest mass of Pi: m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²
Rest mass of mu: m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
Neutrino mass: m_nu ≈ 0 MeV/c² (since it's negligible)

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c².

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of mu and nu. E_final = E_mu + E_nu.

But energy is conserved, so E_initial = E_final. Also, momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the momentum of the muon (p_mu) must be equal and opposite to that of the neutrino (p_nu). But since the neutrino is massless, its energy E_nu is just p_nu c. Wait, because for a massless particle, E = pc.

So, p_mu = -p_nu, hence p_mu = p_nu because they have same magnitude. So p_mu = p_nu = p.

Let me write the energy for each particle after the decay.

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, units are a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1, so energies are in MeV, masses are in MeV/c², but when c=1, E = sqrt(p² + m²), and momentum p is in MeV/c, so p c would be MeV. Hmm, perhaps I should handle the units carefully.

Wait, maybe it's easier to work in terms of energy in MeV. So, let me denote everything in units where c=1, so E = sqrt(p^2 + m^2), and m is in MeV.

So, for the muon: E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2)
For the neutrino: E_nu = p, since m_nu is negligible.

So the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p.

This must equal the initial energy, which is m_pi.

So m_pi = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p.

Hmm, I can solve for p here. Let me rearrange the equation:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu²) = m_pi - p.

Now square both sides to eliminate the square root.

p² + m_mu² = (m_pi - p)^2
Expand the right side: m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p².

So, p² + m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p².

The p² terms cancel out:

m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p.

Let's solve for p.

2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu².

So p = [m_pi² - m_mu²] / (2 m_pi).

Plugging in the values:

m_pi = 139.6 MeV
m_mu = 105.7 MeV

m_pi squared is (139.6)^2. Let me calculate that.

139.6² = Let's see: 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So 139.6^2 = (140-0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, m_mu squared: 105.7^2. 105 squared is 11025. 0.7^2 is 0.49. 2*105*0.7 is 147. So (105 +0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 +0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So m_pi² = 19488.16
m_mu² = 11172.49

m_pi² - m_mu² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So p = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6) 

Compute denominator: 2*139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315. So let's see:

279.2 * 29.8 = ?

279.2 * 30 = 8376. So 29.8 is 0.2 less than 30. 0.2 * 279.2 = 55.84. So 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16. Hmm, that's close to 8315.67.

So 279.2 * 29.8 ≈ 8320.16, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So perhaps 29.8 is a bit too high.

Alternatively, let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

We can write this as approximately:

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2.

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 =8376 minus 279.2
