Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and they're heated. I need to find the exo product among the given options.

Hmm, first, I remember that [4+2] cycloadditions are Diels-Alder reactions. Oh wait, but wait, the Diels-Alder is a [4+2] between a diene and a dienophile. So I need to figure out which of these molecules is the diene and which is the dienophile.

Looking at 2,5-dimethylthiophene. Thiophene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. So it's an aromatic compound. But when it's a diene, it would have to be in a non-aromatic, conjugated diene form. Wait, no— wait, 2,5-dimethylthiophene has methyl groups at positions 2 and 5. The structure is a thiophene ring with two methyl substituents opposite each other. Thiophene itself is a conjugated system, so maybe it's acting as a diene here.

Wait, but furan-2,5-dione is the other component. Furan is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, and furan-2,5-dione would have ketone groups at positions 2 and 5. So that's like a cyclic diketone. Furan-2,5-dione— wait, that's also known as dioxolane or something else? No, wait, I think it's more accurately called tetraketofuran or maybe just the dione.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: the Diels-Alder reaction requires a conjugated diene and a dienophile. The dienophile is usually a molecule with a strong electron-deficient double bond, like a ketone, or something like that. In this case, furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups, which are electron-withdrawing. So maybe the furan ring is the dienophile.

Wait, but furan-2,5-dione is a cyclic dienophile. The diene would be the 2,5-dim
