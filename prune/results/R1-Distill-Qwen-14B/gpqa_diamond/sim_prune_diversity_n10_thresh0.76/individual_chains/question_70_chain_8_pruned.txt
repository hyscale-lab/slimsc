Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and see what each part tells me.

The question involves a series of reactions, and the goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that's related to the shape of the molecule and the symmetry elements it has, like axes of rotation, planes of symmetry, etc. The options given are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Let me break down the reactions step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, so the stoichiometry is A + 8B → C. What could this be? Bright red product... that makes me think of something like sulfur, maybe? Or perhaps a compound with a lot of symmetry because of the high number of equivalents. Wait, 8 equivalents is a lot, so maybe B is something like oxygen? Because O2 is diatomic, and 8 moles could produce something like a metal oxide. But if A is a solid metal and B is O2, then reaction could be something like forming a metal oxide. For example, maybe A is copper, but copper oxide is usually black. Hmm, or maybe it's another metal. Alternatively, maybe B is something else.

Wait, another thought: if A is sulfur (S), and B is oxygen (O2), the reaction would be S + O2 → SO3? No, wait, sulfur trioxide? But sulfur trioxide is a liquid under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is phosphorus. For example, white phosphorus (P4) reacting with O2 to form P4O10, which is a solid and has a bright color? But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, considering the next reactions: C reacting with D and water. Let's move on.

C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C + 2D → E. Hmm, maybe D is a halogen, like Cl2? Because halogens are diatomic and reactive. If E is something dangerous like phosgene (if C is CO and D is Cl2?), but phosgene is a gas, though.

Wait, another angle: C reacting with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C is probably a compound that, when hydrolyzed, breaks down into a metal (or non-metal) and two acids. For example, maybe C is a sulfide? Wait, no, because if C is a sulfide, reacting with water would produce H2S (a weak acid, maybe) and the metal hydroxide. But the problem says it produces A plus two acids. So maybe C is a metal carbonate? No, because carbonate would react with water to produce CO2 and the metal hydroxide. But that's only one acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfate? No, because sulfate hydrolysis usually doesn't produce two acids. Let me think again. Alternatively, C could be a nitride? Not sure. Wait, another possibility: C could be a compound like (NH4)2SO4, but that's a sulfate. No, because
