Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to identify the final product. The given data includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are A, B, C, D, each a different compound.

First, I think about what reaction conditions are present here. Red phosphorus and HI—oh wait, I remember that's the Hunsdiecker reaction or something similar. Or wait, maybe it's the reaction where a bromide is converted using HI. No, wait, red phosphorus with iodine is for making HI, but in this case, if X is a bromide or another halide, maybe it's undergoing a substitution.

Wait, more accurately, I think the reaction of an alkyl halide with red phosphorus and HI is the HI elimination or perhaps a nucleophilic substitution. Alternatively, I've heard of the Fittig reaction using Na or K, but that's for aryl halides. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation? Or maybe a substitution. Another thought: when an alkyl bromide reacts with HI (a strong acid), it might undergo a substitution, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, if X is an aromatic compound with a leaving group, maybe it's undergoing some kind of coupling or substitution.

Let me look at the IR data first. The IR shows strong peaks: 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak, likely O-H stretch (like an alcohol or carboxylic acid). Then 1720 cm-1—that's a strong carbonyl, maybe a ketone or ester or carboxylic acid. Wait, but the 1720 is a bit low for a carboxylic acid, which is usually higher (like 1700 or 1725). Alternatively, an ester or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Then 1610 and 1450 cm-1—these are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound has aromatic rings. The 1610 is probably the C=C in the ring, and 1450 could be the in-plane bending or another mode.

Now the NMR: Let's parse that.

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 is likely an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But in a carboxylic acid, the OH is usually a broad peak, so that fits. But wait, the IR had a carbonyl around 1720. So if the OH is around 10.5, and a carbonyl at 1720, that would suggest a carboxylic acid. Because an ester's carbonyl is around 1740, so 1720 is a bit low for that. Alternatively, maybe a ketone, but then why the OH?

Wait, but looking again, if the compound has a carbonyl (like a ketone) and an alcohol, but that doesn't explain the IR 3400–2500 which suggests an -OH. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid, but then the 1720 could fit. Hmm. Also, the broad peak (bs) at 10.5 is a singlet, which is typical for a carboxylic acid's -OH.

But wait, another thought: maybe it's an aldehyde, but the NMR doesn't show a peak around 9-10 ppm as a singlet, but in this case, the 10.5 is not an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's an enolic proton, but those are usually downfield but not that far, and they split into more complex patterns.

Wait, let's move on to the other NMR signals. At 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)—those are typical of an aromatic ring with two substituents in the para positions. Like a para-substituted benzene. The 8.0 could be the protons next to an electron-withdrawing group, such as a carbonyl, and the 7.2 could be the ones opposite, which are less deshielded.

So, maybe the compound is a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group, like a benzoic acid or a ketone.

The rest of the NMR:
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a multiplet, possibly a CH adjacent to an oxygen, like a CH next to an ester or a ketone. Or maybe a CH in a branching, like an isopropyl group.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): maybe a CH2 adjacent to a branching point or a carbonyl.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a triplet of doublets? No, wait, a doublet of 3H suggests perhaps a methyl group attached to something else, maybe a CH(CH3) group. Like in an isopropyl or isobutyl group.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a triplet for a terminal CH3, like in an ethyl or propyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group and a chain.

Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

The aromatic ring has two substituents in para positions. Let's think about the substituents. Wait, no—looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are a doublet each, so maybe it's a monosubstituted benzene. Or wait, no: the 8.0 and 7.2 are each doublets of 2H. That would suggest a para-disubstituted benzene. Like two substituents opposite each other.

Wait, no, wait. For a para-disubstituted benzene, the protons adjacent to substituents would each be a doublet. For example, if the substituents are two groups in para positions, then each set of ortho protons would be a doublet. So for example, substituents at positions 1 and 3 (but wait, no, para would be 1 and 4 if it's a benz
