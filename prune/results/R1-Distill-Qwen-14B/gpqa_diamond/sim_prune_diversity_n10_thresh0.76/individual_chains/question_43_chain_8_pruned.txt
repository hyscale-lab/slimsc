Okay, so I've got this IUPAC naming problem in front of me. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct name for this benzene ring structure. Let me try to visualize the molecule based on the description.

Alright, the question says there's a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. So, that means each of these groups is separated by one carbon. Let me draw a benzene ring and label the positions.

Let's say the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, meta to it would be positions 3 and 5. But wait, the other groups are also meta to each other. Hmm, maybe the three substituents (COOH, CHO, CN) are each meta to one another. So, if COOH is at position 1, then the other two would be at 3 and 5. Wait, no, because if they are all meta, each pair would be meta. So COOH at 1, then CHO at 3, and CN at 5? No, because 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta as well, but 1 and 5 would be para. That can't be. Oh wait, in a benzene ring, each substituent's position is relative. Maybe I should imagine the ring with COOH at position 1, then the other two substituents at positions 3 and 5, but they are meta to each other. Wait, no, because 3 and 5 are two positions apart, so that's meta. So COOH (1), CHO (3), CN (5). Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. Each substituent is meta to the others. So, all three substituents are at positions that are meta to each other. But that's only possible if each is two positions apart. Wait, no, in a benzene ring, any two substituents can't all be meta to each other because it's a six-membered ring. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, the problem says they are all meta to one another. So each group is meta to the others. So, if I have three groups A, B, C, each is meta to the other two. Let me imagine benzene positions
