Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm kinda new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

So, the setup is that particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles produce new ones that travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. Now, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls?

Hmm. Wait, wait. So initially, with a Lorentz factor of 20, only one third reach the walls. The aim is to find the Lorentz factor that would make two-thirds reach the walls. I think the key here is the relationship between the speed (or gamma, the Lorentz factor) and how far the particles travel before decaying.

Oh right, the particles are fast-decaying, so the distance they travel is crucial. The ones that reach the detector walls must have a mean lifetime long enough to cover the distance of the detector's radius at their speed.

Wait, so the detector's radius is 30 meters. So the maximum distance a particle can travel before hitting the wall is 30 meters, right? Because the center is where they're produced.

But wait, the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, so their lifetime is time-dilated. The proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is tau, and the observed lifetime is gamma * tau. So the distance they travel is gamma * tau * c, where c is the speed of light.

But wait, the time they have to live to reach the detector is the time it takes light to go from the center to the wall. Oh wait, no. Wait, the particles are moving at speed v, so the time for them to reach the wall is t = R / v, where R is the radius (30 m) and v is their velocity.

In their own rest frame, their lifetime is tau, so in the lab frame, it's gamma * tau. For the particle to reach the wall, we need gamma * tau >= R / v. Or, actually, since the particle's lifetime is tau, the speed determines how much time it has. So, the condition is that the particle's lifetime (gamma tau) must be at least the time it takes to travel R meters at velocity v. So, gamma tau >= R/(v).

But v is related to gamma. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) * c. Or we can write v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Alternatively, v = c * sqrt( (gamma² - 1)/gamma² ) ) = c * sqrt(gamma² -1)/gamma. Hmm.

Alternatively, since gamma is large (like 20 or higher), v is approximately c, but perhaps we can approximate v as c for a first pass.

Wait, the problem says 'ultra-relativistic', which means that v is very close to c. So perhaps v is approximately c, which would make the calculation easier.

So, if the particle is moving at speed v ≈ c, then the time it takes to reach the wall is t = R/(c). The proper lifetime is tau, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So, for the particle to reach the wall, gamma * tau must be greater than or equal to t. So gamma * tau >= R/(c).

But wait, the way the problem is presented is that when gamma is 20, one third of the particles reach the wall. So, perhaps the decay probability is based on the ratio of gamma to some threshold. Or maybe it's about the fraction that have a lifetime longer than the time it takes to reach the wall.

Wait, let's think about it in terms of the particle's lifetime. Each particle has a certain probability of decaying before reaching the wall. So the fraction that reach the wall is the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall.

So, the time to reach the wall is t = R/(v) ≈ R/c (since v ≈ c).

The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau, where tau is the proper lifetime. The probability that a particle lives longer than t is the same as the probability that gamma tau > t. Which would be the case when gamma tau >= t, so gamma >= t/(tau).

Wait, but each particle has a certain probability of decaying. So the fraction that reach the wall is the fraction that have a lifetime longer than t.

Assuming an exponential decay, the probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(tau)). So in the lab frame, since the lifetime is gamma tau, the probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, no. Wait, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, so the mean is gamma tau. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

So the time t is R/v. If v ≈ c, then t ≈ R/(c). So the probability of the particle reaching the wall is P = exp( - R/(gamma c tau) ).

Wait, but wait. If the proper lifetime is tau, then in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So the mean lifetime is gamma tau, so the decay probability after time t is 1 - exp( - t/(gamma tau) ).

Wait, no. The probability that the particle has not decayed by time t is exp( -t/(gamma tau) ). So, the probability that it reaches the wall is P = exp( - R/(gamma v tau) ), since t = R/v.

Wait, but if v is close to c, then P ≈ exp( - R/(gamma c tau) ).

So, the fraction that reach the wall is exp( - R/(gamma c tau) ).

In the original situation, when gamma is 20, the fraction reaching the wall is 1/3.

So,

1/3 = exp( - (30) / (20 c tau) )

Take natural log on both sides:

ln(1/3) = - (30)/(20 c tau)

So,

ln(1/3) = - 30/(20 c tau)

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3) = 30/(20 c tau)

So,

ln(3) = (3)/(2 c tau)

=> (3)/(2 c tau) )= ln(3)

So,

tau = 3/( 2 c ln(3) )

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the value. But maybe I don't need to, as I can just relate the two scenarios.

Because in the second case, we want to have two-thirds of the particles reach the wall. So,

2/3 = exp( -30/(gamma c tau) )

Take natural log:

ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma c tau)

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3/2) = 30/(gamma c tau)

But from the first scenario, we have 30/(20 c tau) = ln(3), because ln(3) = 30/(20 c tau).

Wait, let's see. Let me write the two equations.

Case 1: gamma1 = 20, P1 = 1/3.

Equation 1: P1 = exp( - R/(gamma1 c tau) )

=> 1/3 = exp( -30/(20 c tau) )

Equation 2: For the desired case, P2 = 2/3.

2/3 = exp( -30/(gamma2 c tau) )

So, take the ratio of the two equations.

(2/3)/(1/3) )= [exp( -30/(gamma2 c tau) ) ] / [ exp( -30/(20 c tau) ) ]

Simplify the left side: 2.

Right side: exp( [ -30/(gamma2 c tau) + 30/(20 c tau) ] )

So,

2 = exp( [30/(20 c tau) - 30/(gamma2 c tau) ] )

Take natural log:

ln(2) = 30/(20 c tau) - 30/(gamma2 c tau )

Factor out 30/(c tau):

ln(2) = (30/(c tau)) [1/20 - 1/gamma2 ]

But from Equation 1, we have 30/(20 c tau) = ln(3). Because from equation 1, 30/(20 c tau) = ln(3).

So, substituting that in, since 30/(20 c tau) is ln(3), then:

ln(2) = ln(3) ( (1/20) - (1/gamma2) ) * (20) ) / (20) )? Wait, perhaps I should let x = 30/(c tau), then from equation 1, x/20 = ln(3) => x=20 ln(3).

So, x=20 ln(3), so 30/(c tau) =20 ln(3). So,

ln(2) = (x/20 - x/gamma2 )

= x (1/20 - 1/gamma2 )

Substitute x =20 ln(3):

ln(2) = 20 ln(3) (1/20 - 1/gamma2 )

= ln(3) (1 - 20/gamma2 )

So,

ln(2) = ln(3) (1 - 20/gamma2 )

Divide both sides by ln(3):

ln(2)/ln(3) = 1 - 20/gamma2

So,

20/gamma2 = 1 - ( ln(2)/ln(3) )

Calculate ln(2) ≈0.693, ln(3)≈1.0986.

ln(2)/ln(3) ≈ 0.6309.

So,

20/gamma2 ≈ 1 - 0.6309 = 0.3691.

So,

gamma2 ≈ 20 / 0.3691 ≈ 54.2.

Wait, 20 divided by approximately 0.3691.

Let me compute 20 /0.3691.

0.3691 *50=18.455. 20-18.455=1.545. 1.545/0.3691≈4.18. So 50 +4.18=54.18. So approximately 54.2.

Looking at the options, option A is 54. So gamma2 is approximately 54.

Wait, but let me double-check the equations.

Wait, when gamma increases, the Lorentz factor is higher, so the particles live longer. So, a higher gamma would result in a higher fraction reaching the walls. Because when gamma increases, the term 30/(gamma c tau) decreases, so the exponent becomes less negative, making exp(-value) larger. So, higher gamma should give a higher probability.

So in the first case, gamma1=20 gives 1/3. We need to find gamma2 where it's 2/3. So, since 2/3 >1/3, gamma2 must be higher than 20. So the answer should be higher than 20. Among the options, the options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28. So 54 is higher than 20, so that makes sense.

Wait, but in my calculation, gamma2 ≈54.2. So answer A)54 is the option.

But let's make sure there are no mistakes in the setup.

Alternative approach: perhaps to think in terms of the particle's lifetime compared to the time it takes to reach the wall. The fraction reaching the wall is exp( - t/(gamma tau) ), where t is the time to reach the wall. So if t = R/(v), but v≈c, so t≈R/c.

Alternatively, since v≈c, t = R/(c) = 30/(c).

So the probability is exp( - (R/c) / (gamma tau) ) = exp( - R/(gamma c tau) )

So, in the first case, gamma=20, probability is 1/3.

So, 1/3 = exp( -30/(20 c tau) )

Take natural log: ln(1/3)= -30/(20 c tau )

=> ln(3) = 30/(20 c tau )

So, 30/(20 c tau )= ln(3)

=> 3/(2 c tau )= ln(3)

Now, for the second case, the probability is 2/3:

2/3= exp( -30/(gamma2 c tau) )

Take ln: ln(2/3)= -30/(gamma2 c tau )

=> ln(3/2)=30/(gamma2 c tau )

But from the first equation, 30/(20 c tau )= ln(3). So,

30/(gamma2 c tau )= ln(3/2)= ln(3) - ln(2)

So,

30/(gamma2 c tau )= ln(3) - ln(2)

But from the first equation, 30/(20 c tau )= ln(3)

So, substitute:

30/(gamma2 c tau )= ln(3) - ln(2) 

Divide both sides by 30/(c tau )

[30/(gamma2 c tau )] / [30/(20 c tau )] ] = [ (ln3 - ln2) ] / [ ln3 ]

=> (1/gamma2 ) *20 = ( ln(3/2) ) / ln(3 )

So,

20/gamma2 = ln(3/2)/ln(3)

Compute ln(3/2)=0.4055, ln(3)=1.0986.

0.4055/1.0986 ≈0.369.

So,

20/gamma2 =0.369

gamma2=20 /0.369 ≈54.19. Which is about 54.2.

So the answer is 54, option A.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the particle's lifetime and the time it takes to travel the detector's radius. The particles are ultra-relativistic, meaning their velocity \( v \) is approximately equal to the speed of light \( c \). The time to reach the wall is \( t = R/v \approx R/c \), where \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \).

The probability that a particle reaches the wall is given by:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right),
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle. For the initial case with \( \gamma_1 = 20 \), one-third of the particles reach the wall, so:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{20 c \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{20 c \tau}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\ln(3) = \frac{30}{20 c \tau}.
\]

Thus, \( \frac{30}{20 c \tau} = \ln(3) \), which gives \( \frac{30}{c \tau} = 20 \ln(3) \).

For the second case, where two-thirds of the particles reach the wall, we have:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{\gamma_2 c \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{\gamma_2 c \tau}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{30}{\gamma_2 c \tau}.
\]

Substituting \( \frac{30}{c \tau} = 20 \ln(3) \) from the first case:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\gamma_2}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

Using approximate values \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \) and \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.2.
\]

Thus, the Lorentz factor needed is approximately \( \gamma_2 = 54 \). Among the given options, the closest value is **A) 54**.
