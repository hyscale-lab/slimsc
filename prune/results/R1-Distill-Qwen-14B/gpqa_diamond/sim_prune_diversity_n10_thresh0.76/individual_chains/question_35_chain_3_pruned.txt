Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Let me try to walk through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on angular momentum operators, but I'll do my best.

The problem states that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay, which is equal to c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is given as h/(4π), and the matrix S has the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). So I'll write that down:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay = c * S, so plugging in c:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],
                [i, 0]]

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, among the options provided, I need to choose the correct statement regarding this calculation.

Wait, let me think about how to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvalues are solutions to the equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So, let's set up the matrix (Ay - a I). Since Ay is 2x2, it'll look like:

Ay - a I = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],
                       [i, 0]] - a * [[1, 0],
                                      [0, 1]]

Which simplifies to:

= [[ (h/(4π)) * 0 - a, (h/(4π)) * (-i) ],
   [ (h/(4π)) * i, (h/(4π)) * 0 - a ] ]

So,

= [[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ],
   [ i h/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant of this matrix is ( (-a)(-a) ) - ( (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) )

Determinant = a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2 ]

Wait, (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1. So:

Determinant = a² - (1) * (h^2/(16 π²)) )

Setting determinant to zero for eigenvalues:

a² - (h²/(16 π²)) ) = 0

So, a² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots: a = ± h/(4π)

Wait, wait. Let me check the calculation again. Because h/(4π) is the constant c, so Ay is c*S, and S is the Pauli Y matrix. Oh wait, Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but when multiplied by c, the eigenvalues would be ±c.

Wait, the Pauli matrices, like S_y, have eigen
