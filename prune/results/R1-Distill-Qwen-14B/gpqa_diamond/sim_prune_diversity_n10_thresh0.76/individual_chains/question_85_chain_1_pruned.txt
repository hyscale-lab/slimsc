Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies about planetary equilibrium temperatures.

First, the question gives me data about the star and the two planets. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Both planets have their own masses and radii, but I think for equilibrium temperature, the planet's mass might not matter. Wait, equilibrium temperature is more about how much energy a planet absorbs and radiates, right? So it's probably about the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo.

The question says both planets are detected via transit and radial velocity methods. The transit method would help find the radius of the planet, since it affects the depth of the transit. Radial velocity is about the mass of the planet because it causes the star to wobble, detected by Doppler shifts.

The question asks about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. The options are A to D, with numbers around 0.5, 0.98, 1.05, 1.3.

I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature. It's something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )^(1/4). Wait, no, let me get the formula right. The equilibrium temperature equation is:

T_planet = T_star * ( (L_star) / (16 * π^2 * sigma * a^2) )^(1/4) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4)

Wait, no, maybe another way. Oh, right! The star's luminosity is L = 4πR_star² σ T_star⁴. So substituting that into the planet's temperature equation.

The equilibrium temperature equation can be written as:

T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(
