Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

So the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like position, momentum, and spin are represented by matrices. Spin operators, especially for spin-1/2 particles like electrons or muons, are represented by 2x2 Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So each component P_x, P_y, P_z must be related to the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z scaled by ħ/2.

Let me write down the given matrices:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Right, these are the standard Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P in the direction n is given by the vector dot product: P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Wait, but the direction n is in the x-z plane, so its y-component is zero. So n_y = 0. So the operator simplifies to P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Hmm, but wait, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so n can be expressed in spherical coordinates with θ being the angle from the z-axis, I think. So n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_z = cosθ. But since it's in x-z, φ is zero? Or maybe the direction is arbitrary, so it's better to represent it in terms of θ and φ, but φ can be any angle. Wait, no, the problem says arbitrary direction in x-z plane. Wait, the x-z plane means that y-component is zero, but direction can be any angle in that plane, so φ is fixed? Or not? Wait, the x-z plane is defined by y=0, so any vector in x-z can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ), but wait, no. Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane would have φ = 0 or some other angle? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. So it can be represented as (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a direction, n_x² + n_z² = 1. So n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, typically, in the standard spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So if n is in the x-z plane, then φ is 0 (if along x) or π/2 (along z?), wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's better to model n as a unit vector (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ) but since it's in x-z plane, φ can be 0. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ? Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is measured from the z-axis. So for example, θ=0 is along z, θ=90 degrees is along x. That makes sense. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So the operator P is then (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) = sinθ * (ħ/2) σ_x + cosθ * (ħ/2) σ_z.

But wait, the operator for spin in an arbitrary direction is usually written as P = n · σ * ħ/2. So yeah, that's correct.

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) (n · σ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) (+1) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Wait, no, the operator P has eigenvalues ±ħ/2, right? Because for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenvalues of S·n are ± ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is supposed to be the spin operator. So the eigenvalue equation is (P) |ψ> = (ħ/2) (+1) |ψ>.

So, (n · P) |ψ> = (ħ/2)(+1)|ψ>.

Wait, but the operator P is n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). Wait, no, the operator P as a whole is n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Oh wait, no, because in the question, P is the vector operator, and the components are given as P_x, P_y, P_z. So the operator along direction n is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

So in our case, since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So the matrix for P would be:

P = (n_x)(ħ/2 [[0 1],[1 0]]) + (n_z)(ħ/2 [[1 0],[0 -1]]).

Let me compute that matrix.

So P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Wait, because when you add the two matrices:

n_x P_x gives:

[[0, n_x*(ħ/2)], [n_x*(ħ/2), 0]]

n_z P_z gives:

[[n_z*(ħ/2), 0], [0, -n_z*(ħ/2)]]

Adding them together, the (1,1) element is n_z*(ħ/2).

The (1,2) element is n_x*(ħ/2).

The (2,1) element is n_x*(ħ/2).

The (2,2) element is -n_z*(ħ/2).

So the matrix is:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]] multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check.

n_x P_x = n_x * (ħ/2) [ [0 1], [1 0] ].

n_z P_z = n_z * (ħ/2) [ [1 0], [0 -1] ].

Summing these:

[ [n_z*(ħ/2), n_x*(ħ/2) ],
  [n_x*(ħ/2), (-n_z)*(ħ/2) ] ]

Yes, correct.

So the matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
           [n_x, -n_z] ]

But wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² =1.

So the problem is to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2, and then normalize it.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenstates for the spin in the direction n, which are the eigenstates of the operator S·n.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of S·n are |+> and |->, where |+> has eigenvalue +ħ/2 and |-> has -ħ/2.

The eigenvectors can be found using the properties of spin or by solving the eigenvalue equation.

But perhaps it's better to proceed with the matrix.

So the matrix for P is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
           [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, wait, no. Because n is a unit vector. So n_x² + n_z² =1.

So the matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by a matrix M where M is:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]]

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because n_x and n_z are real numbers, given that n is in x-z plane. So the matrix M = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

Wait, but let me think of this as a general case, without plugging in n_x and n_z in terms of θ and φ.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to denote the direction vector as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since n is in x-z plane and y=0. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting, the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ],
          [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the matrix is:

(ħ/2) [ cosθ   sinθ
        sinθ  -cosθ ]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So, substituting the matrix:

(ħ/2) [ cosθ   sinθ ] [a]   = (ħ/2) [a]
         [ sinθ  -cosθ ] [b]     [b]

Dividing both sides by (ħ/2):

[ cosθ   sinθ ] [a] = [a]
[ sinθ  -cosθ ] [b]   [b]

So the equations are:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a
sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me write these equations:

Equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

Equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Wait, wait, let me re-express the equations.

From equation 1: cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0.

From equation 2: sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0.

So we have two equations:

1. (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

2. sinθ a + (- cosθ -1) b = 0

We can write this as a homogeneous system:

[ (cosθ -1)   sinθ       ] [a]   = 0
[ sinθ        (-cosθ -1) ] [b]

For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

So determinant D = (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ) = 0.

Let me compute this:

D = [ (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) ] - [ sin²θ ]

Multiply out (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1):

= (cosθ)(-cosθ) + (cosθ)(-1) + (-1)(-cosθ) + (-1)(-1)

= -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ + 1

Simplify:

- cos²θ + 1 → because -cosθ + cosθ cancels.

So D = (-cos²θ +1) - sin²θ.

But 1 - cos²θ is sin²θ, so D = sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

Which makes sense because we're looking for eigenvalues, so determinant is zero, which is consistent.

So now, to find the eigenvector, we can take one of the equations and express a in terms of b, or vice versa.

Let me take equation 1:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 ⇒ a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

Because (cosθ -1) = -(1 - cosθ), so equation becomes:

- (1 - cosθ) a + sinθ b = 0 → (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

Hmm, that looks a bit messy. Maybe I can simplify it.

Note that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So sinθ / (1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [2 sin²(θ/2)] ] → [ cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ] → cot(θ/2).

So a = cot(θ/2) b.

So the ratio a/b is cot(θ/2).

So the eigenvector can be written as (a, b) where a = cot(θ/2) b.

Let me choose b = sin(θ/2), then a = cos(θ/2), because cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2).

So a = cos(θ/2), b = sin(θ/2).

Wait, let me see:

If a = cos(θ/2) and b = sin(θ/2), then their ratio is cot(θ/2), which matches.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, I should check if this satisfies the equation.

Let me plug into equation 1:

( cosθ -1 ) a + sinθ b = 0.

Substitute a = cos(θ/2), b = sin(θ/2):

( cosθ -1 ) cos(θ/2) + sinθ sin(θ/2) = ?

Let's compute each term:

cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2) - 1.

So cosθ - 1 = 2 cos²(θ/2) - 2 = 2 (cos²(θ/2) -1 ) = -2 sin²(θ/2).

So (cosθ -1) cos(theta/2) = -2 sin^2(theta/2) * cos(theta/2).

Now, sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So sin(theta) sin(theta/2) = 2 sin^2(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

Putting together:

-2 sin^2(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + 2 sin^2(theta/2) cos(theta/2) = 0.

Yes, it works. So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, wait. Let me think about the direction of the vector. The state we've found is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2, which is the spin-up state along direction n.

So the normalized eigenvector would be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but what about the phase? Because in quantum mechanics, the global phase doesn't matter, but the relative phase could. In this case, since we have only real components, perhaps it's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but let's look at the options.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D: sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2).

Wait, but I'm getting a vector that's already normalized, because cos^2 + sin^2 =1.

Wait, but the question asks for the normalized eigenvector. So our vector is [ a, b ] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the normalized eigenvector is just that, since it's already a unit vector.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D: sqrt(2/3) ħ ... etc.

Wait, but the options have some factors with ħ. That's confusing because the eigenvector should be a dimensionless vector, as it's a state in Hilbert space. So the components shouldn't have units of ħ.

Wait, in the question, the Px, Py, Pz are given as ħ/2 multiplied by matrices. So perhaps the eigenvectors are written in terms of these, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the calculation. Let me re-express the eigenvalue equation.

Wait, the operator P is (n · P) = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is (n · P)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

Wait, but when I write the matrix form, the matrix is (n_z (ħ/2) ) in (1,1), (n_x (ħ/2)) in (1,2) and (2,1), and (-n_z (ħ/2)) in (2,2). So when I multiply that by |ψ> = [a, b], I get (n · P)|ψ> = [ (n_z a + n_x b) (ħ/2), (n_x a - n_z b) (ħ/2) ].

But for the eigenvalue equation, this must equal (ħ/2) [a, b]. So:

n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a + ( -n_z -1 ) b = 0.

Wait, that's the same as earlier. So the solution is a = [ (n_x)/(1 - n_z) ] b.

Wait, earlier I substituted n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So:

a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

Wait, another way to write this is a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] b.

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) = cot(theta/2).

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

Taking b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ a, b ] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which matches option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, looking at the options, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what we have.

But wait, the options also include options with ħ factors. Why are options A, D involving ħ? Because in the question, the operator has factors of ħ/2, but the eigenvectors are just vectors in Hilbert space and should be dimensionless.

Wait, that's a good point. So the eigenvectors should have dimensionless components. So options A and D include ħ, which doesn't make sense. So they must be wrong.

So the correct answer must be option C.

But let me check the other options.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

That looks like spherical coordinates, but it's unclear how it relates to our problem. Our problem is for a specific direction n in the x-z plane, so phi would be zero or something. But our solution doesn't involve phi, since n is in x-z, so phi is zero. So option B might be for a general direction, but in our case, phi is zero. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem states that the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero. So in that case, option B would become (cos(theta), sin(theta)), but our solution is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), so option B doesn't match.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors with ħ, which again, the eigenvector shouldn't have ħ since it's a dimensionless vector. So D is probably incorrect.

So the only option that makes sense is option C, which has the correct form.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero, and the operator simplifies to:

\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]

Here, $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator $\vec{P}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]

Substituting the matrix for $\vec{P}$, the equations become:

\[
\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a, \quad \sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b
\]

From the first equation, we find:

\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b
\]

Using the trigonometric identities $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, this simplifies to:

\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) \, b
\]

Choosing $b = \sin(\theta/2)$, we get $a = \cos(\theta/2)$. Thus, the eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

This vector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This includes factors of $\hbar$, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.

- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$  
  This represents a general direction in spherical coordinates but does not match the derived eigenvector for the specific case of $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This matches the derived eigenvector exactly and is dimensionless, making it the correct choice.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This includes unnecessary factors of $\hbar$, which are not part of the eigenvector.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.

Answer: C
