Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer because of time dilation. So I remember that the formula for the observed lifetime τ is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But wait, how do I find γ? Oh right, γ is equal to E/(m c²), but since we're dealing in energy terms where E is given, and m is the rest mass, I can calculate it. But wait, the units here are GeV. So let's see, E is 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV. So E is much larger than m, which makes sense for high-energy particles.

Wait, but wait, the rest mass energy is m c², so if E is given as 27 GeV, which is much larger than m c² (3.41 GeV), then the particle is moving at a speed very close to c. So γ would be E/(m c²) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918. Let me compute that: 27 divided by 3.41. Let me do the math—27 ÷ 3.41. 3.41 times 7 is 23.87. 3.41 times 7.9 is 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41*0.9=3.069. So 23.87+3.069=26.939, which is almost 27. So γ is approximately 7.9. Cool.

So the lifetime in the lab frame τ is γ * τ₀. So
