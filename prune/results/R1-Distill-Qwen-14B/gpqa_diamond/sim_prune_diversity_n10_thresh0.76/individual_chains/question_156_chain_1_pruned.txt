Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) and a chiral one. The options are about how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation typically involves adding an oxygen across a double bond, forming an epoxide. But wait, the reaction here is followed by aqueous acid. Oh right, when epoxides are treated with acid, they undergo ring-opening reactions, usually via a protonation followed by nucleophilic attack.

Wait, wait, but in this case, the starting material is an alkene, and mCPBA is used. So the first step is epoxidation. Then, the acid work-up would lead to the ring-opening of the epoxide. I think that for cyclic ethers like epoxides, acid can protonate the oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the ring opens with water or another nucleophile. But since it's aqueous acid, maybe it's just water acting as the nucleophile.

But wait, the initial reaction after mCPBA would give an epoxide. Then, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide hydrolyzes. So what's the product in each case?

Let's think about the structure. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle, but with substituents on each end. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. So, structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH3 on each end but opposite.

When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry. For (E)-alkene, the epoxide would form with the oxygen atoms in a trans configuration because the original double bond was trans.

Wait, no, actually, the epoxidation of a trans
