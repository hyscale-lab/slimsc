Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Zeeman effect term) with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The setup is that the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. Also, they mention small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I recognize as the Balmer series in hydrogen, probably the H-alpha line, which corresponds to a transition from n=3 to n=2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Balmer series is when electrons transition to n=2 from higher energy levels. The H-alpha line is from n=3 to n=2, and its wavelength is about 656 nm. But the given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. That sounds familiar. Oh right, that's the Balmer's beta line, which is the transition from n=4 to n=2. So the energy difference ΔE is that transition energy.

I remember that the transition energy can be found using the Rydberg formula. The Rydberg constant, R, is about 1.097e7 m⁻¹. The formula is 1/λ = R (1/(n_lower²) - 1/(n_upper²)), where n_upper is higher than n_lower. So in this case, since it's the transition from n=4 to n=2, n_lower is 2, and n_upper is 4. So plugging in the numbers.

Let me calculate that. So 1/λ = R*(1/2² - 1/4²) = R*(1/4 - 1/16) = R*(3/16). So 1/λ = (1.097e7) * (3/16) ≈ 1.097e7 * 0.1875 ≈ 2.046e6 m⁻¹. Then λ is 1/(2.046e6) ≈ 4.887e-7 meters, which is 488.7 nm. That matches the given 0.4861 micrometers (which is 486.1 nm), considering possible rounding. So that's the ΔE for the transition.

Wait, but how do I find ΔE from that? Oh right, because the energy levels are given by E_n = - (R * h * c) / n², or more accurately, the energy difference between two levels is ΔE = E_upper - E_lower. But since E_n is negative, the transition from a higher n to a lower n (emission) would result in a positive ΔE, which is the energy of the emitted photon.

Alternatively, the energy can be found using the formula ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. So with λ given, let's compute that.

h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3.0e8 m/s. So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3.0e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m). Let me compute that.

Wait, 486.1 micrometers is 486.1e-6 m? No wait, no. Wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm, which is 486.1e-9 meters. Correct. So substituting:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) 

First, compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 486.1e-9 m is 4.861e-7 m.

So ΔE = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18 ≈ approximately 0.4089e-18 J. So 4.089e-19 J.

But wait, let me double-check the exponents. 1e-25 divided by 1e-7 is 1e-18. Yes. So ΔE ≈ 4.09
