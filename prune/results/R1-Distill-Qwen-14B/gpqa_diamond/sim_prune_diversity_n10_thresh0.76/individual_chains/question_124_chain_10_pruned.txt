Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. Hmm, so the question is about particles moving at ultra-relativistic speeds in a detector. The setup is that when particles are collided in the center of a spherical detector, new particles are produced. These particles are fast-decaying and travel at a certain Lorentz factor. 

The given scenario says that on average, one third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But how does that relate to the particles reaching the detector's walls?

I think the key here is the time it takes for the particles to reach the walls. Because if they decay before they can reach the walls, they won't be detected. So, the particles that reach the walls must have a lifetime long enough to travel the radius of the detector at their velocity.

Wait, but when considering particle decay, the proper time (the particle's own time) is shorter than the lab frame time due to time dilation. Oh right, so from our perspective (lab frame), the particles' lifetimes are longer by a factor of gamma. So the lifetime tau in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime tau_0.

The particles need to travel a distance R (30 meters) before decaying. So the time they have is their lifetime in the lab frame, so t = tau = gamma * tau_0.

The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = R / v. Because distance equals velocity multiplied by time.

So setting t equal to tau: R / v = gamma * tau_0. 

But wait, the particle's speed v is related to gamma. Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), we can express v in terms of gamma. Hmm, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a relation between gamma and the distance they can travel.

Wait, but if the particle's speed is v = beta c, where beta is v/c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

But maybe another approach: the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is L = gamma * beta c * tau_0.

Wait, let me think again. The lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau_0. So the distance the particle can move is v * gamma tau_0.

So L = v * gamma tau_0.

But L is the detector radius, 30 meters. So 30 = v * gamma tau_0.

But another way: when a particle is created, it's moving at speed v. The time it has to reach the wall is t = R / v. The distance it can travel before decaying is L = v * t, which should equal R if it just reaches the wall. But that's not considering decay. Wait, no, the decay probability is a Poisson process. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/tau_0), because tau
