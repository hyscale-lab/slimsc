Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are on product 4. Let me start by breaking down each step because I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone with a six-membered ring. The first step is treating it with bromine. Hmm, bromine in such cases usually leads to some kind of addition or substitution. Oh wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When ketones react with bromine, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. Or wait, no, wait. Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, and in the presence of bromine (Br2), I believe it undergoes a ring-opening addition. Oh wait, no, wait. Another possibility is that bromine adds to the carbonyl group as an electrophilic addition. So, the carbonyl oxygen is electron-deficient, so Br2 could add across the carbonyl. So the ketone would add bromine, leading to the formation of a dibromide.

Wait, but wait another possibility: maybe it's a ketone undergoing bromination via enolate formation? No, I don't think that's the case here. Enolate formation usually requires a base, and Br2 is just a dienophile in some cases. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldol addition, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, I think for cyclohexanone and Br2 under certain conditions, like in a ring-opening. Wait, no, the ring is more stable. Another thought: perhaps this is a diels-alder reaction? No, that's with dienes and dienophiles. Wait, no, cyclohexanone isn't a diene. Maybe I should think about the reaction again.

Wait, another possibility: when a ketone reacts with bromine, perhaps it's a bromination via the enol ether mechanism. Or maybe it's a halohydrin formation. Wait, no, halohydrins form when a dihalide and water are present. Alternatively, perhaps it's the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group. So the ketone (cyclohexanone) would react with Br2 to form a bromo derivative. So cyclohexanone plus Br2 would form something like
