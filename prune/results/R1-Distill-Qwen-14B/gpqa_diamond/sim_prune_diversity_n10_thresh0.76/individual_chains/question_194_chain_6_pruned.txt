Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Hmm, I need to find the partition function Z. The options are A to D, each with different expressions involving exponential terms.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? So first I need to figure out all the possible states of the system and calculate their energies.

Each spin has two possible states: +1 and -1. So for three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. Let me list all possible combinations.

I can represent each state as a triplet (S1, S2, S3). So the states are:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, I need to compute the energy E. Let's compute each one.

The energy formula is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So let's compute each term S1S2, etc.

1. State (+1, +1, +1):
Each pair product is (+1)(+1) = +1. So sum is 3. E = -J*(3) = -3J.

2. State (+1, +1, -1):
S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate. Wait, S1S2 is +1, S1S3 is (+1)*(-1) = -1, and S2S3 is (+1)*(-1) = -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. State (+1, -1, +1):
S1S2 = (-1), S1S3 = (+1), S2S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.

4. State (+1, -1, -1):
S1S2 = (-1), S1S3 = (-1), S2S3 = (+1). Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. E = J.

Wait, let me check that. S1 is +1, S2 is -1, S3 is -1.
S1S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1.
S1S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.
S2S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1.
Sum: (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1. So E = J.

5. State (-1, +1, +1):
S1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.
S1S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.
S2S3 = (+1)(+1) = +1.
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E = J.

6. State (-1, +1, -1):
S1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.
S1S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1.
S2S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.

7. State (-1, -1, +1):
S1S2 = (+1).
S1S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.
S2S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.
Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1. E = J.

8. State (-1, -1, -1):
Each pair product is (+1). So sum is 3. E = -J*(3) = -3J.

Wait, I think I messed up one of the states. Let me check state 7 again. S1 is -1, S2 is -1, S3 is +1.

S1S2: (-1)(-1)=1.

S1S3: (-1)(+1) = -1.

S2S3: (-1)(+1) = -1.

Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = J.

So now, looking at all 8 states, two of them have E=-3J, and the other six have E=J.

Wait that can't be right. Wait, no, looking at the states:

Wait in state 1 (all +1), sum is 3, so E=-3J.

State 8 (all -1), sum is 3, E=-3J.

So that's two states with E=-3J.

The other six states have E=J.

So the energies are:

-3J (two states), J (six states).

Now, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E). So for each state, compute exp(-β E) and sum.

So the terms are:

For the two states with E=-3J: exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3
