Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. I'm a bit rusty on IUPAC nomenclature, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, let me parse the question. The molecule has a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which I think is an aldehyde group), and a cyano group, all meta to one another. So, each of these groups is separated by two carbons, meaning they are at positions 1, 3, 5 or something like that.

Wait, no. Wait, when substituents are meta to each other, they're three positions apart. So if one is in position 1, the others would be in 3 and 5? Hmm, but wait, the question says all meta to each other. So all three substituents are each meta to the others. So perhaps they are placed on positions 1, 3, and 5 of the benzene ring.

Wait, no. Let me think. If I have three substituents on a benzene ring, and each is meta to the others, that's only possible if they're at positions 1, 3, and 5. Because each is two positions apart from the next. Like, position 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta, and 5 and 1 wrap around but are also meta (since 1 and 5 are two positions apart if you go the other way). So that makes sense.

So the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. Now, the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta. So I need to figure out where each is.

But wait, the question also says that ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Oh, right, so the carboxylic acid has substituents on the adjacent positions, which are ortho to it.

And para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. So if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the para would be position 4. So the methoxy is at position 4.

Wait, let me try to draw this out mentally.

Let me number the benzene ring positions as
