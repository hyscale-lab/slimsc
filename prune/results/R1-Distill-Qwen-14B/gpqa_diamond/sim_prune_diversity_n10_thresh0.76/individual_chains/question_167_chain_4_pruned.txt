Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because they can't be described by Gaussian statistics, which are easier to handle. Gaussian states include things like coherent states, squeezed states, and thermal states. Non-Gaussian states are more complex, like the Schrödinger cat state mentioned here.

The problem gives me a specific state: |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. I remember that |alpha> is a coherent state, and |-alpha> is another coherent state with amplitude -alpha. The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). Wait, because when you have a superposition of two coherent states, the normalization depends on their overlap, which is determined by sin(2phi) and the exponential term related to alpha squared. Oh right, because the inner product of |alpha> and |-alpha> depends on exp(-|alpha|^2 - | -alpha |^2) times some other terms, but I think the exact expression is handled by that N formula.

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure, which is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, relative entropy of non-Gaussianity... I think the idea is that you compare the given state's entropy to the entropy of the best Gaussian approximation. So del_b should be the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of the Gaussian state that's closest to it in some sense. Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian is a specific one, like the one with the same first and second moments as the state, but I'm not entirely sure.

But wait, the problem says that tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps the relative entropy is comparing the given state to that particular Gaussian. But I'm not entirely clear on which Gaussian state is the reference here.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is computed using the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reference is the thermal state or something else. Hmm.

But regardless, the formula given is del_b as the difference between the two entropies.

So I need to compute rho and tau, their respective density matrices, then compute the two traces and subtract.

Wait, but for a given state, calculating the entropy can be tricky. For a pure state, the von Neumann entropy is -Tr(rho ln rho), but wait, if the state is a pure state, then rho is a pure state, so its entropy is zero. But wait, in this case, |psi> is a pure state, so rho is a pure state, so Tr(rho ln rho) would be zero. But wait, that can't be right because del_b would then be -Tr(tau ln tau), which is the entropy of the Gaussian state. But that would imply that the non-Gaussianity is negative, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Wait, the relative entropy is defined as S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). Oh wait, no, the problem says it's defined as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. That's different. So it's the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau, not the relative entropy which is entropy of rho minus the entropy of rho in tau's basis.

Wait, that's an unusual way to compute non-Gaussianity. Because usually, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity might be the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state. But here, the problem defines it as the difference between the entropy of the non-Gaussian state and the entropy of a reference Gaussian state.

But regardless, I need to compute this del_b.

Wait, rho is the density matrix of |psi>, which is a pure state. So rho is |psi><psi|. Therefore, rho is a pure state, so the von Neumann entropy S(rho) = 0. But in the formula given, del_b is S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - S(tau). So that would make del_b negative, which doesn't make sense because non-Gaussianity is a positive measure. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the formula. Let me check the problem again. It says, "relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]". So, that would be S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. But since rho is a pure state, S(rho) is zero
