Okay, so I've got this problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass, 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. But wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. Oh right, photospheric composition is what's measured in their atmospheres, right?

The given data includes some abundance ratios. Let me jot that down.

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5

I remember that these abundance notations like [X/Y] represent the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun, which is the same as log(nX/nY / (nX/nY)_sun).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how to relate these. Let me take it step by step.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, (nSi_1 / nSi_2) ?

But wait, no, the question says the ratio of silicon atoms in each star's photosphere. I think the ratio is nSi1 / nSi2. So I need to find the abundance of Si in each star
