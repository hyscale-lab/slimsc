Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, right? And I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think out loud.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options given are four different chemical formulas. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let me break down each piece of data and see what they tell me.

First, the FTIR spectrum. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is very broad. Carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch because the -OH group is more acidic and can form hydrogen bonds, making the peak broader. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol, but the broadness might lean towards a carboxylic acid. 

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which suggests a carbonyl group. A carbonyl could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might correspond to a conjugated carbonyl group or maybe an aromatic ring. Wait, wait. Another possibility: the 1700 is the carbonyl, and the 1650 could be an aromatic C=C stretch. Or if it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone where there's some conjugation, maybe with an adjacent double bond.

Looking at the NMR data: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond somewhere, maybe adjacent to a carbonyl group. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests an alkene, perhaps in a conjugated system.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm. Let me think about what fragments would give m/z 45. The 45 could be a common fragment. For example, maybe a (CH3)2CO+ ion, which would be acetone, but that's m/z 58. Wait, no. Alternatively, the fragment could be from something like an acetyl group. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of something. Let's see, 45 is C3H7O? Or maybe (CH2)2O? Let me calculate: 45 is 12a + 1b + 16c =45. Let me think of possible combinations. If a=3, 12*3=36, then 16* something. 36 + 9 = 45. 9 would be O (16) is too big. Alternatively, maybe H2O is 18, but no, that's 18. Alternatively, maybe CH3CO+ (acetate ion
