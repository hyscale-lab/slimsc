Okay, so I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step. 

The question is about an electron described by a state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I think that means they are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis. 

The problem asks me to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a given operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Oh wait, the matrix is 2x2 because the electron's spin is 1/2, so only two states. 

First, let me think about the state |alpha>. It's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So I need to normalize this state because probabilities depend on the square of the amplitudes. 

Wait, normalization. The state must satisfy <alpha|alpha> =1. So, let's compute the norm of |alpha>. 

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So the coefficients are c_up = 1+i and c_down=2-i. The inner product <alpha|alpha> is |c_up|^2 + |c_down|^2. 

Calculating |c_up|^2: (1+i)(1-i)/1 = (1 +1) = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 -i +i -i² = 1 +1 =2. So |1+i|² is 2.

Similarly, |2−i|² is (2)^2 + (1)^2 =4+1=5. Because (2−i)(2+i)=4 +2i −2i −i²=4 +1=5.

So the total is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So, the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the operator
