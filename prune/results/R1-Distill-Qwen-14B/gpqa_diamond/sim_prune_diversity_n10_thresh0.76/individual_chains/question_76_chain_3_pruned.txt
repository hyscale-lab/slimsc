Alright, I'm trying to tackle this science question about creating a mouse embryonic chimera using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). So let me break this down step by step.

Okay, the setup: They're using iPSCs from various somatic tissues. Each cell type has its own mRaspberry fusion under a lineage-specific promoter. So mRaspberry is a red fluorescent protein, I think, used as a label. They inject these dedifferentiated cells into a 32-cell blastocyst. Then they track them over 48 hours, taking samples every 12 hours for TUNEL-FITC staining and confocal microscopy.

The question is, what's the first thing they notice when they look at the embryos under the microscope.

Hmm, let me think about each part. So, TUNEL assay is used to detect apoptosis.FITC is a green fluorescent dye. So when a cell undergoes apoptosis, the TUNEL assay would show a green signal in or around the cell.

The iPSCs are labeled with red signals specific to each lineage. So each cell type (like maybe liver, heart, etc.) is labeled with a different red color. When they're injected into the blastocyst, the iPSCs should integrate into the embryo and start differentiating into various cell types.

Wait, but the question is after 48 hours. But the first observation would be after the first 12 hours, right? Or maybe the question is about the immediate observation upon injection, but I think it's about tracking over time.

Wait, the setup says they prepare embryos every 12 hours. So the first observation after 12 hours, then again after 24, 36, 48.

But what's the scenario? They're looking for the iPSCs fate in the embryo and their co-localization with apoptotic events. So the idea is to see if the iPSCs are integrating into the embryo and perhaps if they're undergoing apoptosis themselves or if the surrounding cells are.

Wait, when you inject cells into a blastocyst, the blastocyst is at the 32-cell stage. The inner cell mass is there, and the trophectoderm. The injected cells would likely integrate into the inner cell mass,
