Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I remember that when charges oscillate, they can radiate energy, and this has something to do with antenna radiation or something like that.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroidal, so like a sphere but maybe elongated along the z-axis. The symmetry axis is along z, so the oscillations are probably along that axis, I guess. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength lambda.

In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of that maximum radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and also determine the form of f, like what power of lambda it depends on.

I think I remember something about dipole radiation. For a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is not isotropic. The power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle theta. The formula I vaguely recall is that the power pattern (which is the power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (sin^2 theta)/(something). Wait, maybe it's proportional to sin^2(theta), but wait, no, for a dipole, the radiation is maximum at theta = 90 degrees, and zero along the axis (theta=0 and 180). But wait, that might be the radiation pattern for a dipole. So the power per unit solid angle (directivity) would have a maximum at 90 degrees.

Wait, but in the problem, the maximum power is A. So the fraction of A at theta=30 degrees is what we're looking for.

Wait, let me think. For a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field (which is the radiation zone) is given by the formula for the electric field. The electric field in the far zone for a dipole is proportional to sin(theta) e^{i(k r - \omega t)} and so on. But the power is proportional to the square of the electric field, so the power would be proportional to sin^2(theta).

Wait, but wait, the power in a particular direction is the square of the electric field, which for a dipole is (sin(theta))^2. So the maximum would be when sin(theta) is 1, so theta=
