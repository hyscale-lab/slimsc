Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the mechanisms and major products for two reactions. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The first reaction is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH, and then H+. I remember that THF is a common solvent, especially in Grignard reactions. KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base, often used for deprotonating things. Oh wait, and then H+ is added later. So what's happening here?

The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, right? So the structure is like two cyclohexane rings connected at one carbon, but wait, the formula is spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Let me draw this out. The main chain is nine carbons, with a three-membered ring and a five-membered ring connected at the first carbon. There's a double bond at position 5, and an alcohol group at position 1.

When a strong base like KH is added, I think it's going to deprotonate the alcohol. So the -OH becomes an O- and then maybe abstracts a proton somewhere else. But wait, the solvent is THF, which is good for such reactions. What's the next step? Maybe a ring-forming reaction.

Wait, the structure has a vinyl group (the 1-vinyl part). So the molecule has a CH₂-CH₂ group attached to the spiro center. When the hydroxyl is deprotonated, perhaps it can act as a base and abstract a proton beta to the oxygen. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, in the presence of a base like LDA, which is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, the alcohol would probably get deprotonated. But in this case, it's KH, which is a strong base. So maybe the mechanism involves forming an enolate. But wait, the starting compound is an alcohol, not a ketone or aldehyde. Hmm. Oh wait, but after deprotonation, maybe the oxygen can attack a nearby carbon, leading to a ring formation.

Wait, another thought: The starting material is a spiro alcohol with a double bond. When treated with a strong base, perhaps an elimination occurs, forming a larger ring via cyclization. Deprotonation could lead to a conjugate base, which then forms a double bond, but that might not form a ring. Alternatively, a hydride shift or some kind of carbocation rearrangement?

Wait, another approach: The compound has a spiro structure with a vinyl group (1-vinyl). The hydroxyl is at position 1, so adjacent to the spiro junction. If the base deprotonates the hydroxyl, making it O-, then perhaps it can attack a neighboring carbon, leading to a ring formation. But how?

Wait, the starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the structure is a spiro compound where one ring is three-membered (maybe cyclopropane) and the other is five-membered. The 1-vinyl group is attached to the spiro carbon, and there's a double bond in the five-membered ring (at position 5). 

When the OH is deprotonated, the O- might attack a carbon that's a few positions away. Let's see: The spiro carbon is attached to the vinyl group (CH₂-CH₂), and the five-membered ring has a double bond. So if the O- attacks a carbon in the five-membered ring, perhaps forming a bridge and a larger ring. 

Wait, after deprotonation, the O- could attack a carbon that's several bonds away, leading to a cyclization. Maybe a six-membered transition state, which is favorable. So if the O- attacks a carbon that's three or four away, forming a new ring. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate addition or elimination. Wait, but the reaction conditions are THF, then H+. So after
