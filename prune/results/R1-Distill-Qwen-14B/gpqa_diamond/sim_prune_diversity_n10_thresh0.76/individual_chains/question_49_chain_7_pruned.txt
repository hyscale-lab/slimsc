Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Okay, the question has three parts, and each involves a reaction that's a sigmatropic rearrangement. Let's tackle them one by one.

First, the question is about completing three different reactions, and we have four options to choose from. The options each give possible products A, B, and C. The problem mentions that Cope and Claisen rearrangements are sigma-tropic, so I should remember what those look like.

Let me start with the first reaction:

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A

Hmm. I'm trying to think about what kind of reaction this is. Sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond into a sigma bond. One common type is the Claisen rearrangement, which involves allyl vinyl ethers rearranging to gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. But wait, the starting material here is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. That's like an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. Oh wait, maybe it's an enamine? Because enamines can undergo various pericyclic reactions.

Wait, but the other reactant is but-3-en-2-ol. Let me draw the structures. 

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine: The structure would be (CH3O)2CH-NH2. Wait, no, because ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. But 1,1-dimethoxy would mean the amine is on the first carbon, which has two methoxy groups. So it's (CH2OCH3)2NH.

But wait, maybe it's N,N-dimethoxyethanamine? Or maybe it's more accurately (HOCH2CH2O)2NH? No, wait, I think the structure is (CH2OCH3)2NH. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2OCH3)2CH2NH2? No, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (OCH3)2C-NH2. So the carbon attached to NH2 has two OCH3 groups and two CH2 groups? Or wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be replacing two H's on the same carbon (the first carbon). So the structure would be (OCH3)2C-NH2. So, OCH3 attached to the same carbon as the amine.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's more like (CH2OCH3)CH2NH2? No, that would be 2-dimethoxyethanamine. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what the product A could be.

The product options for A are 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine or (Z)-
