Okay, let's try to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Hmm, so the scenario is about a chemically synthesized small peptidic compound. The 1H NMR shows some unexpected peaks, and the LC-MS data also shows two peaks. Let me break this down step by step.

So, the NMR part: the 1H NMR has two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. Wait, so each peak would be about 0.5H each. And they ruled out spin-spin coupling because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that. Hmm, so what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

I remember that sometimes in NMR, especially when the compound isn't completely pure, you might see impurities. But the question says the NMR is otherwise consistent, so maybe it's not impurities. Alternatively, maybe it's something about the structure itself.

The LC-MS part: the LC-MS at elevated temperature shows two peaks with same mass. Oh, same mass means same molecular weight. But when you run LC-MS, each peak probably corresponds to a different compound. But the same mass would imply the same molecular formula. So, what structures have the same molecular formula but different properties?

Wait, same mass but different structures? That sounds like isomers. Enantiomers are a type of isomer, but they have the same physical properties except for optical activity. But wait, in LC-MS, they're separated because the column might separate enantiomers if it's a chiral column. But if it's a regular column, enantiomers might come out as one peak because the column isn't chiral. Hmm. But in this case, the LC-MS shows two peaks. So maybe the column is chiral, so it's separating enantiomers. But if the compound is a mixture of enantiomers, that's possible. But the question says the MS is consistent, so maybe they have the same mass.

Wait, but wait. The NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. What could cause that? If the compound is a racemic mixture, then each enantiomer would have the same NMR spectrum because the protons are in equivalent environments. Wait, but in that case, you wouldn't see two separate peaks for the same proton. Because each enantiomer's pro
