Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. The decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm. I think I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. The resolution probably refers to the spatial resolution needed in the Bubble Chamber to detect the decay products. So the minimum resolution is the smallest distance that the decay products can travel before the chamber can't distinguish them anymore.

Wait, but how does the lifetime relate to the distance? Oh right, the distance a particle travels before decaying depends on its speed and lifetime. The formula I think is L = v * t, where v is the velocity and t is the lifetime. But since the particle is moving at relativistic speeds, we have to consider time dilation.

So the lifetime observed in the lab frame (τ) is γ times the proper lifetime τ₀. And γ is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²). Wait, no, γ is E/(m c²) only when the particle is moving at a high speed and relativistic effects are significant. But wait, E is the total energy, which is gamma times m c². So yes, gamma = E/(m c²). But wait, units might complicate things. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1. But in any case, I should probably calculate gamma first.

Given that the energy E is 27 GeV and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = E/(m c²) → since we're in GeV units, and c is 1 in these units, gamma is 27 / 3.41 ≈ let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.
