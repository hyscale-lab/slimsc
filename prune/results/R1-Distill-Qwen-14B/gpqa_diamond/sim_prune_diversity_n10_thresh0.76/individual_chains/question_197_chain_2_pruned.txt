Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find out what the final product is. The options are A, B, C, D, each a different organic compound.

First, let's look at the given data: the IR and NMR spectra of compound X.

IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720, 1610, 1450, 1450. Hmm, wait, I think I misread that. Looking again: 3400–2500 cm-1 is a broad range, which might indicate an O-H stretch or an N-H stretch. But since there's no mention of amines, maybe it's an O-H group from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

But wait, the peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300 (broad) and a strong carbonyl around 1700. So maybe compound X has a carboxylic acid group.

Then the other IR peaks: 1610 and 1450. Those are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretching. So there's an aromatic ring in the molecule.

Now the NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – That's a broad singlet. High chemical shift like that is probably a carboxylic acid proton. The broadness suggests it's not exchanging quickly, but wait, carboxylic acids usually have broad signals. But wait, wait—maybe it's an aldehyde? No, aldehydes are around 9-10, but they are usually sharp. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like a phenolic OH, but the IR has a carbonyl. So it's more likely a carboxylic acid.

Then 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, if it's a meta-substituted, the splitting would be more complex. So the aromatic protons are two sets of doublets, each 2H, so it's a para substituent. So the aromatic ring has two substituents opposite each other. One substituent is at position 4 (if we number the ring), so maybe the substituents are at positions 1 and 4? Or perhaps it's a single substituent that causes two sets of equivalent protons, like a substituent in the para position.

Wait, but if it's a para-substituted benzene ring, then the two H's ortho to substituent would be one set, and the meta would be another? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. For a para-substituted benzene, like p-xylene, the protons are all equivalent, so we'd see a singlet. But in this case, the NMR shows two doublets. Oh, perhaps the substituent isn't just a single group but maybe a substituent that's more complex, like a ketone or another group that causes splitting.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is another group, making the ring have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a benzene ring with a carbonyl attached. Wait, but benzene rings with substituents that are deactivating (like carbonyl) can cause the ring protons to split into specific patterns.

Wait, let me think. If the substituent is a COOH group, for example, attached to the benzene ring, then the ring would have substituent(s) that cause the protons to split into two doublets. Let's say the COOH is at position 1, then the ring would have protons at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. But wait, no, the substituent is at one position. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 4, but there's another substituent. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is in position 1, and there's another group in position 3?

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the ring has a substituent in one position, and another group that's causing the splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl, and the ring has another substituent. Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a benzoyl group.

Wait, but let's look at the other NMR signals. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe a CH near an oxygen or something. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be two CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet? No, wait, a doublet with 3H, so maybe a CH(CH3) group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, like a methyl group attached to a CH2.

Putting this together: perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group (from the IR at 1720) and another substituent that's an alkyl chain. Wait, but the IR shows a peak around 1720, which is consistent with a carbonyl, possibly a ketone or a carboxylic acid. But the strong O-H stretch in the IR would suggest a carboxylic acid. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the structure is something like a substituted benzoic acid.

Let me think: the aromatic region has two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests that the substituent on the benzene ring is in a position that creates two sets of equivalent protons. Like, if the substituent is at position 1, then the ring would have two sets of doublets, each 2H. For example, if the substituent is a group that causes the ring to have ortho and para protons, but in a way that they split into two doublets. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is part of an ester or another group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2-COOH, but no, that would probably cause more splitting. Alternatively, the substituent on the benzene is a carbonyl, and the other substituent is an alkyl group. Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a carbonyl group attached, and an alkyl chain somewhere else.

Looking at the NMR shifts:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a multiplet, probably a CH group. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – maybe two CH2 groups adjacent to something. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – that's a CH3 group attached to a CH2,
