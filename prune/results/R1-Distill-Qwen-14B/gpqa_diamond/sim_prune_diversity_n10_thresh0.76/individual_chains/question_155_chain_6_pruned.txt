Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Hmm.

First, let me parse the information given. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is represented as a 3x3 matrix. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, that means the eigenstates of P_z are our basis here, right? So any state can be expressed in terms of these basis vectors.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Wait, so that's the state vector in the P_z basis. Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so any state is expressed as a combination of those.

Now, the question is about the uncertainty in P_z, which is ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for the given state.

Wait, wait a second, but the given state is an eigenstate of P_x. So if the state is an eigenstate of P_x, then it's not an eigenstate of P_z. Because P_x and P_z don't commute, right? Since in angular momentum operators, Lx and Lz don't commute, same here for P. So the expectation value of P_z is something we'll have to compute.

But how? The state is given in the P_z basis, so the components are already in terms of the eigenstates of P_z. So each component corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. Wait, what are the eigenvalues of P_z?

Looking back, the matrix for P_z is:
First row: (ħ, 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -ħ)

So P_z is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ.
