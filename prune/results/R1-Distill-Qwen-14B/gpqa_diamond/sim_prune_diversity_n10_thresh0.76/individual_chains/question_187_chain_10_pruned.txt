Okay, I need to figure out how many of these stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph when coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at Paranal. The question is about the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The requirement is at least 10.

First, I should understand what factors affect the S/N ratio in a spectrograph. From what I remember, the S/N mainly depends on the brightness of the star, the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, and the instrument's efficiency. Also, the star's distance plays a role because farther stars are fainter.

Let me start by recalling what ESPRESSO is capable of. ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph on the VLT. It's designed for spectroscopy across a wide wavelength range. Its performance is influenced by the telescope's light-gathering power, which is related to the telescope's diameter.

Signal-to-noise ratio in an astronomical observation is calculated using the formula:

S/N = (flux) / (noise)

Flux is the amount of light received per unit time, and noise is typically the square root of the total counts, which depends on the flux and the exposure time.

But perhaps a more straightforward approach is to use the concept of magnitude. The S/N depends on the star's apparent brightness. The apparent magnitude of a star is given by:

m = M + 5 + 5 log₁₀(d)

Where M is the absolute magnitude, and d is the distance in parsecs.

Wait, no, the correct formula is m = M + 5 log₁₀(d/10). Because the formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log₁₀ (d) - 5, right? Because when d is 10 pc, the apparent magnitude equals the absolute magnitude.

So for each star, I can compute their apparent magnitude and then estimate whether the S/N would be at least 10.

But I also need to know what ESPRESSO's sensitivity is—what is the faintest star it can achieve a certain S/N on in a given exposure time.

I remember that the VLT has a large collecting area. Each 8m telescope has a diameter of 8 meters. The collecting area A is π*(D/2)^2, so for D=8m, A is π*(4)^2 = 64π m² ≈ 201 m².

But I'm not exactly sure about the exact sensitivity of ESPRESSO. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to compare the brightness of each star to the minimum brightness required for S/N ≥10.

I think the key is to figure out the minimum apparent magnitude that ESPRESSO can reach in 1 hour with an 8m telescope. Let's suppose that the formula for S/N is proportional to the square root of the exposure time, the telescope's area, and the flux from the star.

The flux from a star is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m), where m is the apparent magnitude. So S/N would increase with higher flux (brighter star) and with longer exposure time.

ESPRESSO's S/N per pixel depends on the star's brightness and the exposure time. So, for a 1-hour exposure, we can calculate the S/N for each star.

But perhaps there's a more direct approach. I remember that ESPRESSO can reach certain magnitudes for S/N ratios. Let me think: I think ESPRESSO is designed to reach very faint stars, but I need to find the limit for S/N=10 per binned pixel.

Wait, from what I recall, ESPRESSO's sensitivity for a 1-hour exposure on a star with a certain magnitude can be estimated. Let me see if I can find an approximate value.

Alternatively, I can think about the formula for the S/N ratio in an spectrograph observation as:

S/N = (A * t) / sqrt(N_pix) ) *
