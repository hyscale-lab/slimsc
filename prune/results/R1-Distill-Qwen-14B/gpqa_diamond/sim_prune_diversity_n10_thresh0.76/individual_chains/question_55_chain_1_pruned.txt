Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, let's see. The compound is an organic one, and the options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates. I remember that the structure of these esters typically involves an acetyl group attached to a propenyl or butenyl chain. The substituents on the double bond (since these are enol esters or similar) would determine whether it's cis or trans.

Looking at the 1H NMR data provided:

1. 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16 Hz) â€“ That's probably a vinyl proton. The coupling constant of 16 Hz is quite large, which suggests a trans coupling. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the coupling in alkenes can be either geminal or vicinal. Oh wait, in an ester with a double bond adjacent, like in propenyl acetate, the protons on the double bond would split each other. So if it's a doublet with J=16, that means each proton is coupled to one other. So maybe it's a double bond with two protons, each next to each other. Like in CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2... or something like that.

Wait, the integration is 1H. Wait, that's only one proton. Hmm, that's confusing. Because in a simple double bond like CH2=CH, each CH would have two protons. Oh, wait, maybe it's a substituted double bond. Maybe it's something like CH2=CH- but attached in a way that only one proton is on the neighboring carbon. No, wait, maybe the double bond is between carbons that have substituents besides H.

Wait, the other peak at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets (dq). Hmm, that's a bit more complicated. So maybe that's another proton, perhaps on the same carbon as the 7.0 ppm peak. Let me think about how the splitting works.

So, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That could be a vinyl proton next to another, so each is coupled to one other. So maybe in a structure where one end of the double bond has a CH2 group and the other has a CH. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to draw possible structures.

The options are between propenyl and butenyl acetates, and whether they're cis or trans. Let's think about each option:

Option C is Cis-propenyl acetate. So the structure would be CH2=C(OAc)-CH3. Wait, no. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. Wait, no. Let's see, propenyl acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? No, wait. Wait, propenyl is the substituent on the ester. So for propenyl acetate, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond in the propenyl group.

Wait, actually, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So propenyl acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH2CH2 with a double bond in the propenyl. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So if it's propenyl acetate, the structure is CH3COO-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no. Wait, propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so the acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH2CH2, but where's the double bond? Oh wait, it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3.

In that case, the double bond is between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Now, the
