Okay, so I have this question about a genetics experiment gone wrong. Let me try to break it down. The researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They added a sequence for an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. Then they transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells using Lipofectamine, selected for antibiotic resistance, but couldn't overexpress the protein. The problem must be in the construct's sequence.

The construct's plus strand is provided. Let me look at it. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. That's good. Then I see some codons. Wait, after a while, there's a TGA at the end. Let me check that. Let me find where the sequence ends. Looking through the sequence, I see the last part is ... GAGTGA. Oh, wait, the last part before the end is TGA. Let me count the letters to see where exactly.

Wait, the sequence ends with ...GAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA. TGA is a stop codon. Oh, that's a problem. Because the construct is supposed to be the coding sequence for the protein, but if there's a stop codon in the middle, translation would terminate early.

Wait, but waitâ€”the plasmid is being used to express the protein, so the presence of a stop codon in the middle would cause the ribosome to stop before the protein is fully made. So the protein might be truncated or not expressed at all.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That makes sense if there's a stop codon in the coding sequence.

Option D says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist. But wait, TGA is a stop codon, which is recognized by the release factor, not tRNA. So D is about UAA, which is another stop codon, but the problem here is TGA, and anyway, in the context of the plasmid, the presence of TGA as a stop would prevent the full-length protein.

Option C mentions proteolysis due to a missing linker. The construct has the HA tag at the N-terminus. If the linker is missing, maybe the protein is processed, but I'm not sure. But the main issue here seems to be a premature stop codon.

Option A is a missense mutation in the HA sequence. But in the given sequence, the HA would be at the N-terminus. Let me see: the first part is ATG TAC (which is Tyr), then CCC (Pro), ATC (Ile), GAT (Asp), etc. Wait, the HA tag is a specific sequence. The HA epitope is usually YPYDVPDYA or something similar. But in the given sequence, the start is ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCA... which translates to:

ATG = Met
TAC = Tyr
CC = Pro
ATA
