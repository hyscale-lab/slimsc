Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. It's a chemistry question about salts decomposing when heated and then reacting with various substances. Hmm, I remember that when salts are heated, they can decompose into gases and other products. Let's break down the problem step by step.

So, the problem says we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Their total weight is 7.20 grams. When heated to 200°C without air, they form a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through several tubes.

First tube: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I think Mg(ClO4)2 is a deliquescent substance, meaning it absorbs water from the air. Wait, but here the setup is that the gas is passed through it. Oh right, maybe the gas contains water vapor? Because Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb moisture. So any water vapor in the gas would be absorbed here, increasing the weight of tube 1 by 3.60 grams. So the mass gain here is the mass of water absorbed. So 3.60 grams of water must have been present in the gas.

Then, the gas goes to the second tube, which is Ca(OH)2 solution. The mass of tube 2 didn't change, so that suggests that no gas reacted here. What gases react with Ca(OH)2 solution? Well, CO2 would react to form CaCO3 and water. If there was CO2 in the gas, it would be absorbed here, but since the weight didn't change, maybe there was no CO2. Or perhaps the amount of CO2 was negligible or not present. Alternatively, maybe another gas is present that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2 solution. Hmm, I'm not sure yet.

Next, the gas goes through red-hot copper in tube 3. The weight of tube 3 increased by 0.80 grams, and CuO was formed. So when red-hot copper is exposed to certain gases, it can react. For example, CO would react with Cu to form CuO and CO2. Or perhaps H2 (hydrogen) reacts with Cu to form Cu and water, but I think that requires higher temperatures. So the reaction here is likely CO reacting with Cu. The mass increase is due to the oxygen in CO combining with copper. Let's calculate: The increase is 0.80 grams. Since CuO is formed, let's think about how much CO would that correspond to.

The molar mass of CuO is 64 + 16 = 80 g/mol. The increase in mass is 0.80 g. But wait, the reaction is: 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. So for every 2 moles of CO, you get 1 mole of CuO. The molar mass of CO is 28 g/mol, and CuO is 80 g/mol. Let's think about the mass difference. For every 2*28 =56 g of CO consumed, 80 g of CuO is formed. So the increase in mass is (80 -56) = 24 g for 56 g of CO. But wait, in our case, the increase is 0.80 g. So let me compute the moles here.

Let me denote the mass of CO as m. The reaction produces CuO, and the mass increase is m(CuO) - m(CO) = 0.80 g.

So, m(CuO) = m(CO) + 0.80 g.

But moles of CuO = m(CuO) / 80 = moles of CO / 28 * (1/2) ?

Wait no, the stoichiometry is 2CO → 1 CuO. So moles of CO is 2 times moles of CuO.

Let me let n be the moles of CuO. Then, moles of CO is 2n.

Mass of CO: 2n * 28 = 56n grams.
Mass of CuO:
