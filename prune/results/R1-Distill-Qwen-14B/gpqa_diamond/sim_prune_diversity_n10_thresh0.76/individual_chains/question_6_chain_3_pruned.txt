Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that in two dimensions, especially when dealing with polar coordinates, often the potential can be expressed in terms of r and θ, and maybe we can separate the variables.

Wait, separation of variables is a key technique in solving the Schrödinger equation for such potentials. So, the approach would probably involve writing the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates and then separating it into radial and angular parts.

Let me think about the form of the potential. The given V(r,θ) has two terms: one that's just dependent on r² and another that's r² cos²θ. So V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let's factor out kr²/2: that gives V = (kr²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Hmm, interesting. So the potential depends on cos²θ. 

Wait, cos²θ can be written using the double-angle identity. Since cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes V = (kr²/2) [1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 ] = (kr²/2) [1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ] = (kr²/2)(5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Interesting. So the potential has a term that's a function of cos2θ.

But I'm trying to think about how this affects the Schrödinger equation. In polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian is H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + V(r,θ). So when you plug in V, you get H = [p_r²/(2m) + (1/2)kr²] + [p_θ²/(2m r²) + (3/2) kr² cos²θ ].

Wait, perhaps I should write the entire Hamiltonian then separate the variables. Let me write it out:

H = [p_r²/(2m) + (1/2)m ω₁² r² ] + [ p_θ²/(2m r²) + (3/2)m ω₂² r² cos²θ ]

Where ω₁ and ω₂ are sqrt(k/m), because (1/2) m ω² r² = (1/2) kr² → ω² = k/m.

But wait, actually, the potential terms are (1/2) kr² and (3/2) kr² cos²θ. So that's V(r) = (1/2) kr² and V(θ) = (3/2) kr² cos²θ.

Wait, no, because V(r,θ) is a sum of two terms, each involving r
