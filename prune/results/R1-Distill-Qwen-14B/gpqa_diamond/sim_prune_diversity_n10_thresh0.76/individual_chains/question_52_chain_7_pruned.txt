Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, there's a star with certain characteristics: 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So I think this has to do with the Saha equation, which relates the ionization states of atoms in a stellar atmosphere under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Saha equation also involves the Boltzmann equation for the distribution of atoms in different energy levels.

Wait, wait. The problem is about the ratio of neutral atoms in two energy levels, not about ionization. So maybe it's about the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution tells us that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is proportional to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by kT.

The ratio N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) )

Where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E2 > E1, so the exponent is negative.

In the problem, the transition between these two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. I guess that's in the ultraviolet or maybe near UV range. Wait, 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, which is in the extreme ultraviolet. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

So when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature decreases. The photospheric temperature must be lower, which would affect the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in these two levels.

Wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the photospheric Teff is 5500 K. But wait, spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when spots are present, part of the surface is cooler, but the rest remains at 6000 K? Or does the overall photosphere lower its temperature? Hmm, the question says that the effective temperature when 40% is covered is 5500 K. So I think the effective temperature is the average, considering the spots.

Wait, but wait a minute. The effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity. The star's luminosity is the sum of the contributions from the spotted and unspotted regions. So when 40% is covered by spots, the total Teff is lower because spots are darker and cooler.

But in this problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere is now at 5500
