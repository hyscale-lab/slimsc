Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine, and I need to figure out the order of the weight fraction of the para-isomer for each compound. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can activate or deactivate the ring towards electrophilic substitution and also direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions—ortho, meta, or para.

Each of the given substances has a different substituent attached to the benzene ring. Let me list them out:

1) С6H5-CH3: That's toluene, with a methyl group.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's ethyl benzoate, so a carbonyl group attached.
3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorobenzene.
4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene.
5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethylbenzene, an ethyl group.
6) C6H5-COOH: Benzoic acid, with a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, so the substituents are: methyl, ethyl ester, Cl, NO2, ethyl, and COOH.

Now, each substituent is either activating or deactivating. Strong activating groups are like -NH2, -OH, etc., which are strongly para-directing. Deactivating groups are like -NO2, -COOH, which are meta-directing. The rest are either ortho/para or meta directors.

Let me think about each substituent:

1) CH3 (methyl): This is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. So it's ortho/para-directing. Since it's activating, the ring is more reactive. But wait, in the context of substitution, the activating groups make the ring more reactive, so the reaction occurs more readily. But for the position, since it's o/p directing, the major product would be para for para-substituted, but wait, in the case of mono-substituted benzene, when you add another substituent, where does it go?

Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are already on benzene, and when we add bromine via electrophilic substitution, where does the Br add?

Wait, bromine in excess would probably add multiple times, but the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps they are considering the regiochemistry, the position where Br adds.

Wait, no, if it's an electrophilic substitution, each substituent directs the incoming electrophile (Br+) to specific positions. So the question is about the ratio of para isomer in each case. So for each compound, when bromine is added in excess, the major product would be the para isomer only if the substituent is a strong para director and the ring is activated.

Wait, but some substituents may direct to ortho, para, but the actual position depends on the substituent's directing effect.

Wait, the question says "monobromo derivative"—so each starting compound has a substituent, and when bromine adds, it's a mono-brominated
