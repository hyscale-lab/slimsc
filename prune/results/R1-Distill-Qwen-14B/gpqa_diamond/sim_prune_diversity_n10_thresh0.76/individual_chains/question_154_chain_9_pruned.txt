Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which option is the correct structure based on the spectral data provided. Let me start by breaking down each piece of information and see how they all fit together.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. Then there's another peak at m/z 158 at 32%. I remember that molecular ion peaks can sometimes indicate the molecular formula, but I'm not exactly sure how to approach the mass spec here. The 32% suggests maybe a fragment or isotope? Wait, chlorine has an isotope with about 35Cl and 37Cl. So the molecular ion peak at 156 could be the major one, and the 158 could be the chlorine isotope. Let me check: the molecular weight would be around 156. If it's Cl in there, 35Cl would make the main peak, and 37Cl would shift it by 2, so that fits. So the formula probably includes a Cl.

Next, the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That's a key point. Where do I see that? Carboxylic acids have a strong carbonyl around 1700, but sometimes it can be a bit higher. Also, maybe an ester or a ketone? Or perhaps an aldehyde? But aldehydes usually have lower carbonyl peaks, around 1710-1740, but let me think. Wait, benzoic acid has a carbonyl around 1680-1720, right? Also, the broad peak could be due to an -OH group, which is present in carboxylic acids. So maybe it's a chlorobenzoic acid.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there's a singlet at 11.0 ppm. That's a very downfield shift. In proton NMR, a singlet around 11 could be an aldehyde proton (but that's usually around 9-10), or more likely, an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acid protons are usually broader and can appear as singlets, but 11 seems a bit high. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenolic OH? But phenolic OHs are usually around 5-7 ppm, unless they're exchanged. Wait no, in D2O they might exchange, but if it's not exchanged, maybe it's a proton like in a benzoic acid. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl oxygen with adjacent protons? Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde, but the other options don't seem to fit.

Wait, looking again. The NMR has a singlet (so no neighboring H), 1H. So maybe it's an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid. The other peaks are at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Those are in the aromatic region. The doublets suggest coupling between two protons each. That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, if thereâ€™s a substituent on the benzene ring, say, in the para position, then the neighboring protons would couple, giving two doublets. So the structure has a benzene ring with substituents that create two sets of doublets. Let me think: in para-substituted benzene, the Hs across from each other (ortho and para to substituent) would have certain shifts. 

Looking at the options:

Option A:
