Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup is that there are two planets in a system. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and it's transiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and the planet's orbital period is 3 days. Now, the question is about a second planet with a radius 2.5 times Earth's. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still exhibiting both transit and occultation events.

Hmm, wait. So both transit and occultation events. Transit is when the planet passes in front of the star, blocking some light. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we lose the planet's reflected light (or maybe its emitted light, but I think in this context it's about being hidden by the star). So both events require that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that we see both events. But wait, the problem says both planets share the same orbital plane, so that's already satisfied.

But wait, the problem is about the maximum period. So what's the condition for both events to happen? The second planet must be in an orbit that sometimes brings it in front and behind the star from our point of view. But wait, occultation occurs when the planet is behind the star, so the star could block our view. For that to happen, the planet's orbit must be such that it can pass behind the star. But for that, the planet's orbital distance must be such that the star's position can block it.

Wait, another thought. The star's position and the planet's orbit need to be such that the planet can pass in front (transit) and behind (occultation) the star. So both must be within the star's apparent disk from the planet's perspective. But wait, no, the transit requires the planet to pass in front of the star, but occultation is when the planet goes behind the star as seen from Earth. So for occultation, the planet must be in a position where, from our perspective, the star is behind the planet, but the planet is in the line of sight. Wait, no, occultation is when the planet is behind the star relative to us. So the star would block the planet's light, but we can't see the planet during that time.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the orbital periods. Both planets must have orbital periods that allow their transits to be observed. Since they're in the same system, their orbits are likely in the same plane, but their periods can be different.

But the question is about the maximum possible period for the second planet such that both transit and occultation happen. So what determines whether a planet can transit and be occulted?

I think the key here is the concept of mutual visibility. For a planet to transit, its orbital radius must be such that it can pass in front of the star. For it to be occulted, the star must be able to block it from our view. That probably relates to the orbital separation and the size of the star.

Wait, but the problem is about the maximum period. So perhaps the second planet must be in an orbit
