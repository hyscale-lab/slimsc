Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm, let me think about how I would approach this.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Ethan-1-one is acetone, so the structure would be a ketone where the carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring. The substituents on the benzene ring are a bromo group and a nitro group. The positions are 3 and 5 respectively. So the benzene ring has substituents at the meta positions relative to each other.

Wait, but the numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me visualize the benzene ring. Let's say the carbonyl group is attached to the benzene at position 1. Then, the bromo is at position 3, and nitro at position 5. So positions 1, 3, and 5 would have substituents. Wait, but if the ring is numbered such that the carbonyl is position 1, then the bromo and nitro would be at positions 3 and 5. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to each other, regardless of the attachment point.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the substituents are meta and ortho to each other. Or maybe it's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene? No, wait, the formula is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is substituted at positions 3 and 5 with bromo and nitro, respectively. So the benzene ring attached to the acetone has a bromo and nitro group at positions 3 and 5, relative to the point of attachment (position 1).

So the structure would look like:

O
||
C connected to the benzene ring at position 1. Then, on the benzene, position 3 is Br, position 5 is NO2. So the substituents are meta to each other on the benzene ring.

Now, how to synthesize this. Benzene is our starting material. We need to introduce the substituents in a way that allows us to get the correct positions.

But, the substituents are a nitro group and a bromo group, and then a ketone group (from acetone). Wait, the ketone is part of the acetone, so the benzene is attached to a ketone. So the main chain is (ethan-1-one), which is (CH3)CO- attached to the benzene.

Wait, no. Wait, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one would have the structure (Ph)C(O)CH3, where Ph is the 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl group. So the benzene ring is attached to a ketone (C=O) which is attached to a methyl group.

So the synthesis needs to form this structure. So benzene needs to gain a ketone group (probably via some acylation), along with a bromo and a nitro group in the correct positions.

I need to think about the order of functional group introduction. Nitro groups are usually introduced via nitration, which is typically done under strong acidic conditions with HNO3 and H2SO4 as a catalyst. Bromine can be introduced via electrophilic substitution, perhaps using Br2 with FeBr3 as a catalyst.

But the challenge here is getting the substituents into the correct positions relative to each other. Since the benzene ring has three substituents—the ketone, bromo, and nitro—the order in which they are added will affect the positions of the substituents.

Wait, but no, the substituents are on the benzene ring attached to the ketone. So the ket
