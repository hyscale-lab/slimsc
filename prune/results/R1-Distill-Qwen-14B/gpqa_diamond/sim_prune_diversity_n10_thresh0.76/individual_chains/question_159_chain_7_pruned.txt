Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about a quasar and its spectrum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that in quasars, emission lines can be broad and sometimes have specific features. Oh wait, the Lyman-alpha emission line is a prominent one for high-redshift objects. Lyman-alpha is usually around 121.6 nm in the ultraviolet range. But if the observed wavelength is much longer, that suggests redshift.

So if the observed peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near infrared, that's way longer than the rest wavelength. Let me calculate the redshift. The formula for redshift z is (observed wavelength)/(rest wavelength) - 1. So rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is about 121.6 nm. Observed is 790 nm. So 790 / 121.6 is approximately 6.5. Subtract 1, so z is about 5.5. Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately: 790 divided by ~122. Let me do 790 / 121.6. Let's see, 121.6 *6 is 729.6. 121.6*6.5 is 790.4. Oh wait, exactly! So 790 is 6.5 times 121.6 nm. So z = 6.5 -1 = 5.5. So z is approximately 5.5.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance of this quasar. The comoving distance D_C is a function of the redshift and the cosmological parameters. The parameters given are Hubble constant H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m=0.3, dark energy density Omega_lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat (Omega_total =1). 

I need to find the comoving distance at a=1, which is our current time, but wait, no—comoving distance is for the scale factor a=1, so that would be the distance when the universe was at a=1, but wait, no— wait, when a=1, it's the present time. Wait, no—comoving distance is a way to measure distances in an expanding universe. The comoving distance from us to a distant object is given by integrating the inverse Hubble parameter over redshift. 

But wait, the formula for comoving distance D_C is the integral from 0 to z of c/(a H) da, but I think it's better to express it in terms of redshift. Let me recall that the comoving distance is given by (c/H0) multiplied by the integral from 0 to z of [1/sqrt(Omega_m(1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda)] dz'. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me think. The comoving distance is given by:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫ (from 0 to z) [1 / E(z')] dz'

where E(z') = sqrt(Omega_m (1 + z')^3 + Omega_lambda (1 + z')^0) ) 

Wait, no, because for a flat universe, Omega_total = 1, so Omega_k=0. So the general form is E(z) = sqrt( Omega_r (1+z)^4 + Omega_m (1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda (1+z)^0 )

But in this problem, since the matter density is 0.3 and dark energy is 0.7, I can assume that Omega_r (radiation) is negligible at z=5.5. So E(z) = sqrt(0.3(1+z)^3 + 0.7). 

So for each z', the integrand is 1/sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7).

I need to compute the integral from z=0 to z=5.5 of 1/sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 +0.7) dz', then multiply by c/H0.

Wait, but what is c in km/s? The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. H0 is given as 70 km/s/Mpc.

So c/H0 = (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ) = (3e5 /70) Mpc. Let me compute that: 3e5 is 300,000. Divided by 70 is approximately 4285.7 Mpc. So c/H0 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc.

So D_C = 4285.7 * ∫ (from 0 to 5.5) [1 / sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 +0.7) ] dz'

Now, I need to compute this integral. Hmm. That's a bit tricky, but perhaps I can approximate it. Alternatively, I might remember that for high redshifts, when z is large, the integral can be approximated using certain methods.

Alternatively, maybe use an online calculator or approximation formula. But since I don't have that, perhaps I can recall that for z=1, the comoving distance is about 1.6 billion parsecs, but wait, wait—my numbers might be off. Let me think.

Alternatively, I can use a simple approximation for the integral when dark energy dominates. Since at high z, matter density is more important, but for z=5.5, the matter density is 0.3*(1+5.5)^3 = 0.3*(6.5)^3= 0.3*274.625= 82.3875. Dark energy term is 0.7, so E(z)=sqrt(82.3875 +0.7)=sqrt(83.0875)=~9.115. So at z=5.5, the integrand is 1/9.115 ≈ 0.1097.

But wait, no, because the integrand is 1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7). So at each z', the denominator is sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7). So I can't just take it as a single value, because it's a function of z'.

Hmm. Maybe it's better to break the integral into parts.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an approximation for the comoving distance. I remember that for z <<1, the comoving distance is approximately cz/H0, but that's only good for small z. For higher z, we need to account for the curvature and the matter/dark energy content.

Alternatively, I can look up standard values. Let me see: For H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7, the comoving distance for z=5 would be around 19.3 billion light-years, but wait, no, that's a different unit. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think about the comoving distance in terms of Gpc (gigaparsecs). Let's see, 1 Gpc is about 3.26 billion light-years. So, for a given redshift, the comoving distance is D_C in Mpc, which can be converted to Gpc by dividing by 1000.

I think I've read that at z=5, the comoving distance is approximately 15 Gpc. But wait, that might be for a different cosmology. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator or approximation formula. There's an online tool called the Cosmology Calculator, but I can't use that right now. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for z=5.5, the comoving distance is approximately 16 Gpc.

Wait, let me approach this more
