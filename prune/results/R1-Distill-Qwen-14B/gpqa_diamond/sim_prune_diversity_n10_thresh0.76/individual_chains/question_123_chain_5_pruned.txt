Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that a supernova occurred in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, wait. So, the key here is probably dealing with relative velocities and time dilation or something related to special relativity because we're dealing with high speeds and different reference frames. Oh right, because at such high speeds, classical mechanics might not apply, and we have to consider relativistic effects.

Let me think. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at some velocity, say v. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy (or the center) is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. But wait, in relativity, the velocity observed in one frame is different from another. So how do these velocities relate?

In special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The velocity u observed in one frame from another frame's velocity u' is given by the velocity addition formula. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me recall the formula. The formula is u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' * v)/cÂ²), where v is the relative velocity between the frames.

Wait, but in this case, from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s in the opposite direction. Because velocities would be opposite in each other's frames. Oh wait, no, because the formula would give a different result. Because if in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving at v_e =60,000 km/s, then in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's velocity v_g would be -v_e, but only if v_e is much less than c. Wait, no, that's only true in classical mechanics.

Wait, no, in
