Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about predicting the major products of two different reactions. The problem gives me two separate reactions, each of which produces one product (A and B), and then I have to choose the correct pair from the options provided. Hmm, okay, let me take this step by step.

First, I'll look at reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so this probably involves some kind of elimination or maybe an addition reaction. Wait, the starting material is a ketone, and ethyl acrylate is an acrylate ester. Oh, right! This sounds like a Claisen condensation or maybe a conjugate addition. Wait, Claisen is between esters, but also, when a ketone is involved, maybe it's a crossed aldol addition? Or perhaps a Michael addition?

Wait, but Claisen condensation usually involves esters reacting with each other. The crossed aldol addition is when a carbonyl compound (like a ketone) reacts with another carbonyl compound (like an aldehyde or another ketone). But ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So the ketone might undergo a conjugate addition (Michael addition) to the acrylate.

Wait, but wait, the starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that structure. The cyclohexanone ring has substituents on carbons 2 and 6. Carbon 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group, and carbon 6 has a methyl group. Wait, no: the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So the ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. Position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group (so it's 2-ethyl meaning a CH2CH2 group, and 2,6-dimethyl meaning methyl groups at 2 and 6. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me think: cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 1. So numbering the ring: position 1 is the carbonyl, then positions 2,3,4,5,6 around. So 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl would have position 2 with an ethyl and a methyl group, and position 6 with a methyl group. So the structure would have a bulky substituent at position 2, and another at 6.

Now, when this reacts with ethyl acrylate (which is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, CH2=CHCOOEt), with a strong base like t-BuOK. The base would deprotonate the alpha position of the ketone or the alpha position of the acrylate. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition. Wait, but the ketone is a good electrophile, and the acrylate can act as a nucleophile in a
