Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still a bit new to this.

The question is about isomers, specifically tautomerism and optical isomerism. The question has two parts, A and B, and I need to find out which one is which from the given options.

First, let me read the problem again carefully. It says that compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures are isomers, divided into constitutional and stereoisomers. Stereoisomers have the same connectivity but differ in spatial arrangement. Constitutional isomers have different structures.

Then, the question is about two compounds: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to determine which doesn't show tautomerism. Then, for part B, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Let me tackle part A first. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, resulting in a different structure. Common examples are between keto and enol forms. For tautomerism to occur, the compound must have adjacent carbonyl groups or at least a hydrogen that can move.

Looking at the two compounds:

1. Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms, right? So it's O=C6H4=O. So, it's a di-ketone, but in a benzene ring. Now, can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? I'm not so sure. Tautomerism usually requires adjacent H and carbonyl groups. Benzoquinone, if it's para-quinone, the two ketone groups are opposite each other. Are there any adjacent H's? Well, in the ring, each carbon is connected to one O. Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, so it's a six-membered ring with two double bonds, each connected to O. Wait no, quinone is a cyclic diketone. So the structure is like O=C-C-C-C-C-O. No, more accurately, it's two ketones on adjacent carbons, but wait, no, depends on the type
