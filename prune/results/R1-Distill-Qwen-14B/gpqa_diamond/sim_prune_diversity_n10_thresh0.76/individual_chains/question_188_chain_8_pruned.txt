Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Let me try to recall.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? Oh, right, so in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a, a, a, and the angles α, β, γ are all the same. So in this case, each interatomic distance a is 10 Angstroms, and all angles are 30 degrees. 

The interplanar distance formula for a crystal plane (hkl) in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is given by the Bragg's law formula, but wait, no, the interplanar distance (d) is calculated using the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (h²(1 - cos α) + k²(1 - cos β) + l²(1 - cos γ))/(a²) ) 

Wait, no, I think that's for more general cases. Alternatively, for a rhombohedral system, maybe there's a simpler formula since a = b = c and α = β = γ.

I think the formula when the crystal is rhombohedral (so a = b = c and α=β=γ) is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) ) )

But since all angles are α, so cos α = cos β = cos γ. So simplifying, the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α )

Wait, but for a rhombohedral system, the structure factor might have some symmetries, but the formula for interplanar distance would still depend on the hkl indices.

The problem here is for the (111) plane, so h=1, k=1, l=1. Let's plug these into the formula.

So d = a / sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 - 2*(1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30) )

Wait, let me compute the denominator step by step.

The numerator of the denominator's square root part is h² +k² +l² = 3.

The second part is 2*(hk + hl + kl) * cos α.

Wait, wait, let me recompute the formula correctly. The general formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system might be:

d² = a² [ 1/(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α) ]

So, yes, the denominator inside the square root is:

(3) - 2[ (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) ] cos 30°

Because each term is hk, hl, kl. So for (111), each product is 1*1, so the sum is 3. So 2 * 3 * cos α.

So, the denominator inside the square is 3 - 6 cos 30°.

Wait, cos 30° is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660.

So let me compute this:

3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) 

Simplify that: 3 - 3*sqrt(3). Let me compute that numerically.

sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 3*1.732 = 5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 -5.196 = -2.196?

Wait
