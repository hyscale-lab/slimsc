Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of buffer solution calculations. But let's take it step by step. 

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in this solution. 

First, I remember that KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. These two salts are probably reacting in solution to form a buffer. Because phosphate buffers are common, right? They involve H3PO4 and its conjugate bases. 

So the plan is to figure out the moles of each salt, then maybe use some buffer equation to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The given Ka values are for H3PO4:
Ka1 = 7.5e-3,
Ka2 = 6.2e-8,
Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

I think when dealing with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the relevant K values would be Ka2 and Ka3. Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-.

Wait, but in this case, the two salts we have are KH2PO4 (which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O (which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus some water... but in solution, the HPO4^2- is the main species).

So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These two can react with each other via the second dissociation of H3PO4. So the buffer system here is H2PO4^- / HPO4^2- with Ka2 being 6.2e-8.

But wait, the problem asks
