Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of an operator. Hmm, let's see what the problem says again.

The particle is a spin-half, so it's a two-level system. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, wait a second. The coefficients must satisfy normalization, right? Let me check that. The square of 0.5 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. 0.25 + 0.75 is 1. So yeah, that's a valid state.

The operator is 10σz + 5σx. I remember that σz and σx are the Pauli matrices. Oh right, σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. And σx is a bit trickier because it's the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the states.

The expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I'll need to compute the expectation of 10σz and 5σx separately and then add them together.

Let me write down the state as a vector. |↑⟩ is usually represented as [1; 0], and |↓⟩ as [0;1]. So the given state is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) in a column vector form. Let's confirm that: 0.5^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 equals 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Yep, that's correct.

So the state ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Now, let's compute the expectation of σz first. Since σz is diagonal, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

σz matrix is [[1, 0],[0, -1]]. So when you compute ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩, it's |a|^2 * 1 + |b|^2 * (-1), where a and b are the coefficients of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

Wait, wait. The state ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)^2 * 1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1) = 0.25 *1 + (3/4)*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, but wait: the expectation value for σz is -0.5. But the operator we're considering is 10σz, so the expectation of that part would be 10 * (-0.5) = -5. Okay, I'll note that.

Next, the σx part. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me write ψ as a column
