Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Wait, p orbitals have angular momentum quantum number l = 1, right? Because s is l=0, p is l=1, d is l=2, and so on. So each electron has l1 and l2, both equal to 1.

The state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1. The problem asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that L_z measures the z-component of angular momentum. For a single particle, the eigenvalue of L_z is mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So, for each electron, if we measure L1z, the possible results are m1 times ħ, where m1 can be -1, 0, or +1. Same for L2z.

So, if we're looking for both measurements to be -ħ, that means m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because each L_z eigenvalue is mħ, so for -ħ, m must be -1. So, the question is, what's the probability that in the given state, both m1 and m2 are -1?

Wait, but the state is a coupled angular momentum state. Coupled states are usually expressed in terms of total angular momentum. So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a coupled state, meaning it's expressed in terms of the total l and m, not individual m1 and m2. To find the probabilities of individual m1 and m2, I think we need to expand this state in terms of the uncoupled basis states, which are |l1,m1> |l2,m2>.

So, the given state is a total angular momentum state, and we need to express it as a linear combination of the product states of individual m's. The expansion coefficients would give the amplitudes, and the probabilities would be the squares of the absolute values of these coefficients.

The expansion is done using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, right? Because that's how you combine two angular momenta into a total. So, the state |l=2, m=-1> is a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = m_total, which is -1 in this case.

Wait, but the initial state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, it's a specific state in the coupled basis. So, when we express this in the uncoupled basis, we'll have terms where m1 + m2 = -1, right? Because m_total is the sum of m1 and m2.

So, the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1 are:
- (-1, 0)
- (0, -1)
- (-2, 1) --> but wait, l1 and l2 are 1 each, so m1 and m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So, m1 can't be -2, since that's outside the possible m values for l=1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are only where m1 is -1, 0, +1 and m2 is -1, 0, +1, and their sum is -1.

So, possible pairs are:
m1 = -1, m2=0 → sum is -1
m1=0, m2=-1 → sum is -1
m1=-1, m2=-1 → sum is -2 → no, that's not -1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because m1 + m2 has to equal m_total, which is -1.

Wait, wait, if m1 is -1 and m2 is 0 → sum is -1. Another possibility is m1=0 and m2=-1. That's it? Because m1 can't be lower than -1 (since l=1), and similarly for m2. So the only possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1), right?

Wait, but wait, another possibility: m1 = -1 and m2 = 0, sum -1. Or m1= 0 and m2=-1. Are there any others? Let me check. For l1=1, m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Same for m2. So combinations where m1 + m2 = -1 are:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → yes.

m1=0, m2=-1 → yes.

What about m1=1, m2=-2? No, m2 can't be -2. So, no. So only two possible terms.

Wait, but wait, when I think about the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, the state |l=2, m=-1> is a combination of these two product states.

So, the expansion would be:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( (some coefficient) ) [ |m1=-1> |m2=0> + |m1=0> |m2=-1> ] 

But I need to find the exact coefficients. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states into l=2.

I remember the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta. Let me think about the general formula.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining |l1, m1> and |l2, m2> into |L, M> is given by:

< l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M > 

In our case, l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

So, the possible terms are when m1 + m2 = M = -1. So the possible (m1, m2) are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

The coefficient for |m1=-1, m2=0> is sqrt( ( (2+1)(-1 +1) )/( (2 * 1 + 1) * ( ... )) )) Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look up the exact formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for adding two p orbitals (each l=1), the possible total L are 2, 1, 0. For L=2, the coefficients can be found.

Wait, I think that for L=2, the state |2, m=-1> is a combination of |1,-1> |1,0> and |1,0> |1,-1>.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1,m1> |1,m2> into |2, M> where M = m1 + m2.

So, for M= -1, the possible m1 and m2 are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

The coefficients for these two terms are each sqrt(1/3), I think. Let me think: the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 to get L=2.

Wait, another approach: for |L=2, M=2>, the state is just |1,1> |1,1>, with coefficient 1.

For M=1, it's a symmetric combination of |1,1> |1,0> and |1,0> |1,1>, with coefficients sqrt(2/3) each.

For M=0, it's a combination of |1,1> |1,-1>, |1,-1> |1,1>, and |1,0> |1,0>, but I'm not sure about the signs and coefficients.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look up the actual Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=l2=1, L=2.

From what I remember, the coefficients for L=2, M=2 is just 1 for (m1=1, m2=1).

For M=1, it's (sqrt(2)/sqrt(3)) [ |1,1> |1,0> + |1,0> |1,1> ].

For M=0, it's (1/sqrt(3)) [ |1,1> |1,-1> + |1,-1> |1,1> ] + something else? Wait, no, M=0 for L=2 would include terms where m1 + m2 = 0. So possible pairs
