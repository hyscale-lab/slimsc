Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through step by step. The question is about binary star systems and figuring out the mass ratio between two systems based on some given data.

Hmm, so the problem says there are two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. Wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses. I remember that in binary stars, the orbital period is the time they take to orbit each other.

Then, there's some spectroscopic data. In system_1, the radial velocities (RV) of the two stars show sinusoidal variations with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. I think the RV amplitude is related to the mass of the stars because the more massive star would cause the smaller star to move more, but wait, no, actually, the more massive star might have a smaller velocity because it's less affected by the gravitational pull of the other. Oh right, in a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star is closer to the center, so it moves less, and the less massive star moves more. So that means the RV amplitude of each star is inversely proportional to its mass.

Wait, so if one star has a higher RV amplitude, it must be less massive. Because it's moving more in response to the gravitational pull. So the star with lower RV is more massive. So for system_1, the two amplitudes are 10 and 5. So the star with 10 must be less massive than the one with 5. Wait, wait, no. Because the more massive star would have a smaller velocity. So if star A has velocity v_A and star B has v_B, then m_A * v_A = m_B * v_B because they have to balance each other around the center of mass. So m_A/m_B = v_B / v_A.

Wait, yeah, the masses are inversely proportional to their velocities. So, m1/m2 = v2 / v1.

So for system_1: The two RV amplitudes are 10 and 5. Let's say star A has 10, star B has 5. So m_A / m_B = v_B / v_A = 5 / 10 = 0.5. So m_A = 0.5 * m_B. Then the total mass of system_1 is m_A + m_B = 0.5 m_B + m_B = 1.5 m_B. So m_system1 = 1.5 m_B.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should think about it another way. Let's let m1 and m2 be the masses of the two stars in system_1. Then, because m1 * v1 = m2 * v2 (since they orbit the same center of mass), m1/m2 = v2 / v1.

In system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5. Let me take m1
