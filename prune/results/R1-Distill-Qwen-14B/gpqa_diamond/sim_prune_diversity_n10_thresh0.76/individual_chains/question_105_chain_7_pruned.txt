Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a star with some spots on it and how that affects the observed brightness variations. The setup is that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is only spotted on one hemisphere, when it rotates, the spots come into and go out of view, causing brightness changes that look like an exoplanet transiting the star.

The problem is asking: If the star wasn't spotty, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet needed to produce the same amplitude in the light curve?

Hmm. So the key is to find Rpl (exoplanet radius) divided by Rstar (host star radius) such that the change in brightness when the planet transits is the same as the change caused by the spots.

Wait, but wait a second. The spots are causing brightness variations as the star rotates, but without the spots, we're considering how a planet's transit would cause a similar dip in brightness.

I think the approach is to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots and then set that equal to the variation caused by the planet transit, and solve for Rpl/Rstar.

First, let's think about each effect.

When a planet transits a star, the observed brightness drops by an amount proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula I remember is:

ΔF_planet = (Rpl^2) / (Rstar^2) * (Lstar / (4πRstar^2)) * something? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of flux.

Wait, no. Think about the change in flux when a planet transits. The star emits a certain amount of flux F. When the planet blocks part of the star, the total flux received decreases. The flux from the star is F = σTeff^4 * (Rstar^2) / (4π D^2) ), but when the planet is blocking a part, the blocked flux is the area of the planet over the area of the star multiplied by the star's flux per unit
