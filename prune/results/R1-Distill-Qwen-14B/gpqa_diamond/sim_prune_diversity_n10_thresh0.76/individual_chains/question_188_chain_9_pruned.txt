Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, which I'm a bit rusty on, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance of a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, what do I remember about rhombohedral structures?

Rhombohedral crystals are part of the cubic crystal system, right? Or wait, no—rhombohedral is a separate system. Oh right, they have all sides equal but the angles are not 90 degrees. In this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance—does that mean the lattice parameter 'a' is 10? I think so. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice constant is the same for all edges, even if the angles are different.

The question asks for the interplanar distance, which is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal. The formula I remember for interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is based on the Miller indices (hkl) and the lattice constants. Oh right, it's given by the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) ) * something related to the angles. Wait, no—wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with non-orthogonal axes involves the unit cell parameters and the angles between them.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance formula for
