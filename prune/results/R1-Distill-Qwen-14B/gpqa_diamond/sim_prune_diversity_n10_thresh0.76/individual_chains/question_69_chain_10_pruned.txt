Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the problem again.

The question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and the decay of a particle X⁰ into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8e-16 seconds. The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be affected by their speed and the observer's frame of reference. Because from the lab frame, the lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. 

The formula I think I need is the time dilation formula: τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. But wait, how does that relate to the resolution needed? Because to observe a decay, the particle must travel a certain distance before decaying, and the resolution is about detecting that.

So the distance a particle travels before decaying is L = v * τ, where v is the velocity. The minimum resolution required would be the distance that allows us to detect at least 30% of the decays. That probably relates to the average distance the particle travels, or maybe the mean lifetime.

Wait, another approach: The decay probability is related to the proper lifetime and the time the particle spends in the lab frame. The number of decays detected would depend on the speed (so the time experienced in the lab) and the resolution of the detector.

I think the key here is to find the average path length the particle travels before decaying, then relate that to the detector's resolution. Because if the detector's resolution is such that it can't distinguish distances smaller than a certain value, it won't detect all the decays.

But wait, the problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So I think that's the fraction of particles where the decay path is longer than the resolution. Or perhaps the other way around: the resolution should be such that 30% of the particles decay within a length that the detector can resolve.

Wait, maybe it's about the mean lifetime and the observed lifetime. Let me think about the steps.

First, I need to find
