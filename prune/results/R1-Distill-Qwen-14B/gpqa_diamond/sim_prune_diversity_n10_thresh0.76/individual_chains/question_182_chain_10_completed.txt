Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation. Hmm, I remember that equation is related to the current-voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices. Let me try to think through this.

The question is about the validity conditions of the Mott-Gurney equation. The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V^2 / L^3). I think this applies to a specific regime of current transport. Oh right, it's for the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. So SCLC means that the charge in the semiconductor is so high that it creates a space charge which limits the current. That happens when the injected carriers are enough to establish a significant electric field, which then affects the current.

Now, the question is about the validity statement. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, trap-free means no traps, so no recombination issues. Single-carrier suggests it's either electron or hole only, no both. Ohmic contact implies that the contacts are ideal, no barrier for carriers. Negligible drift current. Wait, but in SCLC, the current is due to injection and drift. Oh wait, the Mott-Gurney equation is for when the space charge dominates, so drift is the main thing. But negligible drift current would imply something else. Maybe I'm mixing terms. Oh wait, maybe the equation applies when the current is limited by the space charge, which would mean that the space charge creates a potential barrier, so drift is the main mechanism. Hmm, but the option says negligible drift current. That doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe the equation assumes that the current is dominated by drift, not diffusion. Or perhaps the opposite? I'm a bit confused.

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. No injection barrier would mean that it's easy for carriers to enter from the contacts. So the contacts are ohmic, as in option A. And negligible diffusion current. Wait, SCLC is when the current is limited by the space charge, which involves drift. So if the diffusion is negligible, that makes sense because in SCLC, drift dominates over diffusion. So in the Mott-Gurney equation, the current is proportional to V squared, which suggests that it's drift-limited. So if diffusion is negligible, that fits. So this option might be correct.

Option C: Single-carrier device with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. Schottky contact implies a barrier for carriers. But Mott-Gurney, I think, is for when the injection is the rate-limiting step. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Oh wait, Mott-Gurney is typically for devices where the injection is not the limiting factor. Because if the injection is the problem, you get a different current dependence, like V^something else. No, wait, the Mott-Gurney equation applies when the space charge is the limiting factor. So the device would have to have conditions where the space charge is dominant. So if you have a Schottky contact, which is a barrier, the injection is not ohmic. Wait, but the Mott-Gurney equation is usually derived for devices with ohmic contacts because the derivation assumes that the current is limited by the space charge, not by the injection from the contacts. So if the contacts are Schottky (like in a diode with a barrier), the current might be limited by injection, leading to a different dependence, like exponential in voltage. So option C probably isn't correct because it's a Schottky contact, which would affect the voltage dependence.

Option D: Two-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. Hmm, Mott-Gurney is for single-carrier devices, I believe. Because if you have both electrons and holes, the space charge effects would be more complicated. The equation as given is for J, which is a single-carrier current. So option D is probably wrong.

So narrowing down, the correct option is either A or B. Let me think about the other conditions.

In the Mott-Gurney equation, the derivation assumes that the current is limited by the space charge, so it's in the SCLC region. The derivation also assumes that the device is single-carrier, so that's a must. So options A, B, C are possible because D is two-carrier.

So for the contacts, Mott-Gurney equation applies to devices with Ohmic contacts because if the contacts are not Ohmic, the injection would be the limiting factor, leading to different current behavior. So the correct model would have Ohmic contacts so that the current is limited by the space charge, not by injection. So option A says Ohmic contact. Option B says no carrier injection barrier, which is similar to Ohmic contact.

Wait, the option B says "no carrier injection barrier", that would imply that carriers can be injected without any barrier, so Ohmic contact. So both A and B are considering Ohmic contacts.

Now, the other condition. Option A says 'negligible drift current.' Wait, in Mott-Gurney, the current is due to drift, right? Because it's space-charge-limited, so the current is determined by the drift velocity. So if the current is dominated by drift, then drift isn't negligible. So option A can't be correct because it says negligible drift.

Alternatively, option B says 'negligible diffusion current.' In the SCLC, the current is limited by drift, so diffusion is less important. So the equation assumes that diffusion can be neglected, only drift matters. So option B's condition is correct.

So putting it together, the correct statement is option B: The equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (so Ohmic contacts) and negligible diffusion current (so drift dominates). So the correct answer is B.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current-voltage behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation assumes that the current is dominated by drift mechanisms due to the space charge, and it is typically valid under specific conditions. Let us analyze the options:

- **Option A**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. However, in the SCLC regime, drift current is the dominant mechanism, not negligible. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (implying Ohmic contacts) and negligible diffusion current. In the SCLC regime, diffusion is indeed negligible, and drift dominates the current. This aligns with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation, making this option correct.

- **Option C**: This states that the equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. A Schottky contact introduces a barrier to carrier injection, which would limit the current to injection-limited behavior, not the SCLC regime described by the Mott-Gurney equation. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option D**: This states that the equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation is derived for single-carrier devices, as the inclusion of both electrons and holes complicates the space-charge dynamics. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it accurately describes the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid: a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contacts) and negligible diffusion current.

Answer: B
