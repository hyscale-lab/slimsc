Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, both cis and trans. The NMR data provided is:

1H NMR (ppm):
7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
5.5 (1H, dq)
2.1 (3H, s)
1.6 (3H, d)

Hmm. I remember that in NMR, the splitting patterns and integration can give a lot of structural information. Let me think about each part.

First, the 2.1 ppm singlet integrating to 3H. That's likely a methyl group attached to something deshielded, maybe an oxygen. So maybe an acetate group, because acetate esters have a OAc group. So the structure is probably something like R-OAc, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group.

The 1.6 ppm d (doublet) integrating to 3H suggests another methyl group, probably next to a CH2 or maybe a CH with some coupling. Wait, but 1.6 is a bit upfield; maybe a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen or something else.

Then the 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets? Wait, no, it's a dq, which is a doublet of quartets? Or maybe a doublet with some coupling from two different sources. Alternatively, it's a doublet that's further split into a quartet, but I'm not sure. I should think about the possible structures.

Looking at the options, we have propenyl and butenyl acetates. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but wait, propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2? No, wait, propenyl is CH2CHCH2, but the exact structure depends on the substitution. Trans or cis refers to the configuration of the double bond.

Wait, the options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl, Trans-butenyl. So propenyl is a three-carbon chain with a double bond, and butenyl is four carbons.

Let me consider each structure.

For propenyl acetate: the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc, but the configuration (cis or trans) relates to the substituents on the double bond. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2-OAc? Or is it CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2? Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Then, the substituents are the CH2OAc group and a CH2 group, perhaps.

Wait, no, maybe propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2-OAc, but that would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and the substituents would be a CH2 group on either side. Wait, actually, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's think in terms of the structures.

Let me sketch out the possible structures for each option.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but I'm not sure about the substituents. Wait, no. Propenyl is CH2CH=CH2, but wait, that's allyl. No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So when it's an ester, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but the double bond position matters. So in propenyl acetate, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? No, that can't be right. Wait, acetate is OAc-O-R, where R is the propen
