Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in the electromagnetic field due to a moving charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain time t, given that the charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from the point where the field was generated at time tr (which is earlier than t) to the observation point r. The velocity of the charge at time tr is v.

I remember that when charges are moving, you have to consider not just the electric field but also the magnetic field, which comes from the vector potential. So the potentials are going to be related to the charge's position and velocity.

Wait, the scalar potential for a static charge is straightforward. It's given by Coulomb's law: V = q/(4πε₀ r), right? But in this case, the charge is moving, so maybe there's a correction due to its velocity. Or does the scalar potential stay the same?

Oh, wait, no. Because when a charge moves, it affects both the electric and magnetic fields. The scalar potential might still be based on the charge's position at the retarded time. Retarded time... I think that's the time it would take for the field to propagate from the charge's position to the observation point.

So, the scalar potential V would be something like q divided by (4πε₀) times the distance from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point. But wait, the distance here is d, right? Because d is the vector from the field generating point (at tr) to r. So the magnitude would be |d|.

But wait, let me think again. The usual expression for the scalar potential due to a moving charge is V = q / (4πε₀) * [1/(r - (v t)/c²)], but that's for the static case. Wait, no, that's more like the Liénard potentials. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The scalar potential is indeed V = q/(4πε₀) * 1/(r'), where r' is the separation at the retarded time. But since d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, then |d| would be the distance. But wait, if the charge is at position s(tr) at time tr, and the observation point is at r, then the vector from the charge to the observation point is r - s(tr) = d. So d is the displacement vector between the charge and the observer at time tr.

So the magnitude of d is the distance, which I can write as r' = |d|. So the scalar potential would be V = q/(4πε₀ r'). But wait, is there any time dependence? Because the charge is moving, but the potential is evaluated at the retarded time. So I think the scalar potential is indeed V = q/(4πε₀ |d|) multiplied by some factor. Wait, but in the options, some have terms involving c, which is the speed of light.
