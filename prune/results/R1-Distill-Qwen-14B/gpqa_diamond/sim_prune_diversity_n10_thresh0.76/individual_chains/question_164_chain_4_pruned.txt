Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary starsâ€”right, they orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about figuring out the mass ratio between two systems, system_1 and system_2. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Wait, the period here is the time between two primary eclipses. Oh right, in binary systems, the orbital period is the time they take to orbit each other. So the period is the same as the orbital period for both stars in a system.

Then it mentions spectroscopic observations of radial velocities. The radial velocity method is used to detect exoplanets, but here it's used for binary stars. The stars in a binary system will exhibit Doppler shifts as they move towards and away from us, creating sinusoidal variations in their radial velocities.

The amplitudes given are for the velocity variations. For system_1, the stars have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 and 10 km/s. I think the radial velocity amplitude depends on the mass of the companion and the inclination of the orbit, but maybe since both are binary stars, we can assume similar inclinations or that the amplitude ratio can be used directly.

Wait, the mass ratio might relate to the velocity amplitudes. Because in a binary system, the more massive star will have a smaller orbit, so lower velocity? Or higher? Wait, no, Kepler's third law comes into play here. Let me think.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. Their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So if star A has mass M1 and star B has mass M2, then M1/M2 = v2/v1, where v1 and v2 are their velocities. Because the momentum has to be conserved; M1*v1 = M2*v2. So the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses.

So for system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. Let me call them v1 and v2. So the mass ratio M1/M2 is v2/v1. So 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is 0.5 times M2 in
