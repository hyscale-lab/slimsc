Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem has two reactions, A and B, and I need to pick the correct major products from the given options. The options are A, B, C, D. Each option gives possible products for both A and B.

First, let's break down Reaction A:
The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The reagents are THF, KH, and H+. So, what's happening here?

I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. In such conditions, especially with alcohols, I think about elimination reactions, like E2 mechanisms. But wait, the compound is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, usually an oxygen or a carbon.

The structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol... I imagine it's a spiro compound where each ring has different substituents. The 1-vinyl group is an ethenyl group attached to the spiro carbon. The alcohol is also on that same carbon, I think. So, when KH is used, it's a strong base, which would deprotonate the alcohol.

But wait, after deprotonation, what happens? If there's a good leaving group, like if the oxygen is converted into a better leaving group, but in this case, the starting material is an alcohol. Oh, wait, maybe the conditions are for an elimination reaction. Because in THF and with a strong base like KH, perhaps the alcohol is deprotonated, and then undergoes elimination.

Wait, but the OH is on the same carbon as the vinyl group. That could mean that when deprotonated, it can form an alkoxide, which is a good leaving group? Hmm, not quite. Wait, in some cases, the base can abstract a proton, leading to an elimination, forming a double bond or a ring structure.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the mechanism here. When an alcohol is treated with a strong base like KH, perhaps it abstracts a proton beta to the hydroxyl group, leading to the formation of an alkene via an E2 mechanism. But the structure here might lead to a ring formation due to the spiro structure.

Alternatively, considering that the starting material is a spiro compound with a vinyl group, when the base abstracts a proton, maybe it leads to a ring-opening or ring-forming reaction. Wait, I'm not too sure. Another possibility is that the reaction is a conjugate addition or some sort of cyclization.

Wait, another angle: when the alcohol is deprotonated by KH, it forms an alkoxide. Then, perhaps under acidic work-up (H+), some kind of rearrangement happens. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, let's think about the product options for Reaction A. The options mention bicyclo structures and benzoannulenes. For example, option A says (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]und
