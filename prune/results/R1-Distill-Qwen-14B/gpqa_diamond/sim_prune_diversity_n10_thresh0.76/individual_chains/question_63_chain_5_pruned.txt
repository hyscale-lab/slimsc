Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and its energy states. Hmm, I remember from my classes that molecules can be modeled using different quantum models, like the rigid rotor and the non-rigid one. The question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. 

The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state, and it's supposed to absorb a photon to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon. The options are all in terms of p, which is momentum in N*s.

Wait, the molecule is diatomic, so it's made up of two atoms, X and Y. The given masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

I remember that in the quantum mechanical model, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. The next state would involve the molecule moving to a higher energy level, but I'm a bit confused about whether it's a rotational or vibrational transition.

Wait, the question says it's the quantum rotation-vibration model, so maybe it's considering both aspects together. But I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. Oh right, the rotational and vibrational energies are quantized, and the energy levels are a combination of both.

The fundamental state is the state where both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers are at their lowest. So, the vibrational state is n=0 (ground state), and the rotational state is l=0 (lowest rotational state).

When the molecule absorbs a photon, it must go to the next higher energy state. But which transition is the lowest possible energy? I think it would be the smallest increment in energy. So, the next state could be either a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, but in the quantum rotation-vibration model, transitions can be either vibrational, rotational, or a combination (like in the rigid rotor-vibration coupling). But I'm not sure. Maybe the next state is a vibrational transition, moving from n=0 to n=1. Because in a purely vibrational model (like the harmonic oscillator), the energy levels are equally spaced. The photon energy needed would be the energy difference between n=0 and n=1.

Alternatively,
