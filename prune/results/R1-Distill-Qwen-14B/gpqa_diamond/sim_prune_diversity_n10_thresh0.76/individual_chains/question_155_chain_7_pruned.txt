Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, for a system that's in an eigenstate of P_x. The system's state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared, then compute this uncertainty.

Wait, but wait a second. Since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, I know that the expectation value of P_x is just its corresponding eigenvalue. But the question is about P_z. So I can't directly say anything about ⟨P_z⟩ from that. I'll have to compute it manually.

First, I should probably write down the matrix form of P_z. The problem states that P_z has the matrix with components in the first row as (ℏ, 0, 0), second as (0, 0, 0), and third as (0,0,-ℏ). So the matrix looks like:

[ ℏ   0       0     ]
[ 0   0       0     ]
[ 0   0     -ℏ ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. Oh, the matrix is 3x3. So P_z is a diagonal matrix with elements ℏ, 0, -ℏ along the diagonal.

So the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. I think I should compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ to find ⟨P_z⟩, and ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩ for ⟨P_z²⟩.

Wait, but P_z is diagonal, so P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared, right? So P_z^2 would have elements (ℏ)^2, 0, (-ℏ)^2 → which is ℏ², 0, ℏ².

Let me compute ⟨P_z⟩ first.
