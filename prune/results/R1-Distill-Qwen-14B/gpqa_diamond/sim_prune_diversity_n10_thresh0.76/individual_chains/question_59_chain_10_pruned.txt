Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, with some pH values ranging from acidic to basic.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you need to consider the neutralization reactions. So maybe I should calculate the moles of each acid and base and see what's left after they react.

Let me break it down. I'll start by calculating the moles of each component in each solution.

For CH3COOH (acetic acid), the molarity is 0.1 M, and the volume is 0.5 L (since 500 mL is 0.5 L). Moles = Molarity × Volume. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

Next, HCl. The concentration is 0.2 M, volume is 0.4 L. So moles are 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl.

Then Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? It dissociates completely. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions. So the concentration is 0.3 M, volume is 0.3 L. Moles of Ba(OH)2 are 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each gives 2 OH-, the moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but I should be careful with the neutralization. Strong acids react with strong bases, but acetic acid is a weak acid. So maybe HCl and Ba(OH)2 will react first because HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Then the leftover acid or base will determine the pH.

So, let's think about the neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)2. The reaction is HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O, but more accurately, each H+ from HCl reacts with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. So the reaction between H+ and OH- is 1:1.

So moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

So when these react, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. Let's see how much of each is left.

H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So H+ will be completely neutralized, and OH- will have 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles remaining.

Wait, but wait a second. Also, the acetic acid is present. Acetic acid is CH3COOH, which is a weak acid that doesn't dissociate completely. But when you mix it with a strong base, the OH- from the base can react with the acetic acid. Oh, right! Because OH- is a strong base and can deprotonate the weak acid.

So maybe I should consider all the reactions together.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to first calculate all the H+ and OH- contributions and see if there's excess.

Let me list all the H+ and OH- sources.

From HCl (strong acid): 0.08 moles H+.

From CH3COOH: since it's a weak acid, it doesn't contribute much H+ initially, but when mixed with OH-, it can react.

From Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles OH-.

Now, when you mix them, the OH- will react with H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.

I think the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, and then any remaining OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

So first, the 0.08 moles H+ from HCl reacts with 0.08 moles OH- from Ba(OH)2. That leaves 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH-.

Now, the CH3COOH is a weak acid, and OH- can react with it. The reaction would be: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO- + H2O.

So the moles of CH3COOH are 0.05, and the moles of OH- left after HCl reaction is 0.10.

So which is in excess? The OH- (0.10) is more than the CH3COOH (0.05). So all the CH3COOH will react, and there will be leftover OH-.

So the OH- that reacts with CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. So the remaining OH- after that is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. So after HCl's H+ is neutralized, the OH- is 0.10. Then, the OH- will react with the CH3COOH. Since CH3COOH has 0.05 moles, it can neutralize 0.05 moles of OH-.

So the remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles. So now, in the entire solution, I have 0.05 moles of OH-.

But wait, the total volume of the solution is important. Because when you mix all the solutions, the total volume is 500 + 400 +
