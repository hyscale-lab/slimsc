Okay, so I've got a question here about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it has a carbon with four different substituents. Wait, but also, sometimes meso compounds might not be chiral because of a plane of symmetry, even if individual centers are chiral. Let me go through each compound one by one.

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, but wait, but-1-ene is a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. The substituents on the double bond are Cl and CH2CH(CH3) or something? Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, right? So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but let's think. The structure is (Z) configuration. Let me draw it: the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has a Cl and a CH2CH3? Or wait, no. Wait, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, and 2-methyl is a CH(CH3) on C2? So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So it's ClCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-1-ene is between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. 2-methyl would be a methyl group on C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, a methyl on C2, and a double bond between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, no, wait, no, because the double bond is between C1 and C2, so I think the structure is Cl-C(R)=CH-CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the structure again.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So if it's 1-chloro, the Cl is on the first carbon. So the first carbon has Cl and the double bond. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't sound right because the double bond is between
