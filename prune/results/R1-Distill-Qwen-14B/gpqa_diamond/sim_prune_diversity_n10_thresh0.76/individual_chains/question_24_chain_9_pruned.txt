Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The problem is about some mixtures of liquids that undergo certain reactions. Let me try to outline what's happening.

First, there's mixture X, which is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. These liquids decolorize bromine water. Wait, decolorizing bromine usually means they have double bonds, right? Because alkenes (with double bonds) can react with bromine, causing it to decolorize. So the two liquids in X probably have double bonds.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it forms mixture Y, which is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. This Y mixture doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hmm, so Y's components don't have double bonds anymore? Or maybe they're saturated in some way.

The problem also mentions that the formation of Y is a result of a disproportionation reaction. Oh wait, wait. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So one molecule of a species gets oxidized, another gets reduced. Like, for example, in some redox reactions. So perhaps the starting material in X is undergoing a disproportionation when it's hydrogenated or something.

Wait, no. Wait, X is treated with platinum when heated. Platinum is a catalyst, often used in hydrogenation reactions. But hydrogenation usually adds hydrogen across double bonds. So if X decolorizes bromine, it has double bonds, and when hydrogenated, those double bonds would be saturated. But the result is Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y must be without double bondsâ€”so the starting materials in X were alkenes, and Y is their hydrogenation product, which are alkanes.

But wait, if X is an equimolar mixture of two alkenes, and after hydrogenation, they become alkanes, but the mixture Y is a result of a disproportionation. Hmm, that's confusing. Because hydrogenation typically would just add H2 across the double bond. But if it's a disproportionation, perhaps the starting material is something else. Oh, wait, maybe the starting material is an alkyne? Because hydrogenation of an alkyne can lead to different products depending on the conditions.

Wait
