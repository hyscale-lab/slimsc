Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed. Oh right, in relativity, you can't just subtract velocities like you would in Newtonian mechanics. I remember the formula for adding velocities relativistically is different. The formula is something like (v1 - v2) divided by (1 minus the product of their velocities over c squared). Or was it (v1 + v2) if they're moving in opposite directions? No, wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction, right? So I think I need to subtract the smaller speed from the larger one, but with the relativistic addition formula.

So the astronauts are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed shouldn't be as high as just subtracting, because relativity limits speeds to c. Let me jot down the formula for relative velocity. Oh right, when adding velocities, the formula is (u + v) / (1 + uv/c²), but wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, no, that's when they're moving towards each other. No, wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. If I'm in a frame moving at velocity u, and another object is moving at velocity v in the same direction as u, then the relative speed from my perspective is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Or is it the other way around? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the problem says the two astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction. So astronaut A is at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what is B's speed?

Wait, maybe I should think about it as, what's the relative speed of B with respect to A. Because the question says 'relative speed', and since both are moving in the same direction, one is faster than the other. So the relative speed would be the difference, but with relativistic correction.

So the formula for velocity addition in relativity is: u' = (u - v)/(1
