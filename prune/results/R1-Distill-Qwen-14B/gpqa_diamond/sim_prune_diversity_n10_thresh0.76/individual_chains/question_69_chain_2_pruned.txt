Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, the question is about the decay of a particle X⁰ into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime is given as τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.

Wait, what do I remember about particle decay and proper lifetime? Oh right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, we have to consider time dilation. So the lifetime observed in the lab frame (τ) would be longer than τ₀. The formula for time dilation is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But the problem is about the resolution needed, which I think relates to how far the decay particles travel before we can detect them. Because if the decay products move a certain distance before the chamber can register them, those decays might not be observed. So the minimum resolution is the distance that the decay products travel during their lifetime in the lab frame.

Wait, but the question says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." Oh, I see. So, we need the number of decays observed to be at least 30% of the total. So, the number detected N is 0.3 times the initial number N₀.

I remember that the number of particles remaining undecayed at time t is N = N₀ * e^(-t/τ). So the number that have decayed is N_decayed = N₀ (1 - e^(-t/τ)). Wait, but the question is about how much of the decay is observed, which depends on the detection resolution. So perhaps it's the fraction of decays that are detected within a certain time.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things. The problem says that the decay occurs, and the chamber's resolution determines whether we can observe it. So, particles that decay within a certain length can be observed. So the fraction of decays observed is the fraction that have decayed before moving a distance beyond the resolution.

Wait, perhaps the proper approach is to calculate the average decay length and then determine what fraction of the decays occur within a certain distance so that at least 30% are observed.

Alternatively, maybe the 30% refers to the probability that the decay is detected, which depends on the time the decay products are in the chamber. Hmm, perhaps I need to calculate the decay length and then find the minimum resolution that captures 30% of the decay events.

So let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the velocity of the particle X⁰. Since the energy is given as 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV, I can find the gamma factor γ.

The energy of a particle is E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). But since m is given in GeV/c² and E is in GeV, the c² cancels out. So γ = E / m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918.

Wait, let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41. 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41*7.9=27. So 27/3.41 is approximately 7.918. So γ ≈ 7.918.

Next, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. So τ = 7.918 * 8e-16 ≈ 6.334e-15 seconds.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. The proper lifetime is τ₀, and τ is longer. So τ = gamma * tau_0.

Then, the decay length L is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The average decay length would be L = v * τ_avg, where tau_avg is the mean lifetime, which is tau. But let's think about it. The average lifetime is tau, so the average decay length is the average velocity multiplied by tau. But since the particle is moving at a high speed, close to c, so v ≈ c.

So, L ≈ c * tau = c * gamma * tau_0.

Wait, but that's the average decay length. So if the detection needs to capture at least 30% of the decays, then perhaps the resolution should be such that the probability of the decay occurring within that distance is at least 30%.

Hmm, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the decay occurs within a distance L is P = 1 - e^(-L/(v gamma tau_0)).

Wait, alternatively, since L = v t, and t is the time when the decay happens. The probability that t is less than tau is P = 1 - e^(-tau/tau_avg). Wait, no, tau_avg is the mean lifetime, which is gamma tau_0. So the probability that the decay occurs before time t is P = 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau_0)).

But in this case, the decay length L is v t. Since v is approximately c for high energy particles, L ≈ c t.

So, the probability that the decay has occurred by distance L is P = 1 - e^(-L/(c gamma tau_0)).

We want P >= 0.3 (30%).

So, set 1 - e^(-L/(c gamma tau_0)) >= 0.3 → e^(-x) <=0.7 → -x <= ln(0.7) → x >= ln(1/0.7) ≈ 0.3567.

Where x = L/(c gamma tau_0).

So, L >= 0.3567 * c gamma tau_0.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the fraction could be expressed using the mean decay length. The average decay length is c gamma tau_0. So to capture 30% of the decays, we need a certain fraction of the mean decay length.

But perhaps a better approach is to find the resolution such that the probability that the decay occurs within that resolution is 30%. So, we can model it as the cumulative distribution function of the exponential decay.

The formula for the probability is P = 1 - e^(-L/(c tau)), where tau is the mean lifetime (gamma tau
