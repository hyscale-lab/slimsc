Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there's this star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Oh wait, actually, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered, right? So if it's 20%, then 20% of the star's surface is spots. But wait, the question says only one hemisphere is spotty, so does that mean the spots are spread over one hemisphere, like half the star? Hmm, maybe I need to think about that.

The star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, I suppose, because they are dark. The temperature difference is 1000 K. So the spots must be at 5000 K, right? Because 6000 minus 1000 is 5000.

The question says that when you observe this star, the brightness variations due to rotation (like spots moving in and out of view) could look like an exoplanet transiting the star. So the idea is that the change in brightness caused by the spots is similar to what you'd get from a planet blocking some light.

The question is asking: What would be the radius of a planet (Rpl) relative to the star (Rstar) to produce the same amplitude in the light curve? So if there were a planet transiting, what size would it need to be to cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do?

Alright, let's break this down. The star's light curve variation from the spots would be due to the spots blocking some of the star's light as the star rotates. The planet would cause a dip when it transits in front of the star.

The key here is to compute the fractional change in brightness (the amplitude of the light curve) in both cases (spots and planet) and set them equal to find the required Rpl/Rstar ratio.

First, let's think about the star with spots. The star is rotating, and when a spot comes into view, it blocks some light. But since the spots are cooler, the total brightness also
