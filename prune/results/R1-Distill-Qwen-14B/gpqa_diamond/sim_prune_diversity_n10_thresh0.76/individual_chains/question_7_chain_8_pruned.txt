Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gamma rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. Hmm, I remember that the CMB has a certain average photon energy, which is given as 10^-3 eV. The question is asking at what gamma-ray energy their lifetimes in the universe are limited by this annihilation process. The options are all in the GeV range, so it's definitely high-energy physics.

Wait, I think this has to do with the photon's lifetime and how their energy affects the interaction probability. Oh right, the process is gamma plus gamma from CMB producing electron-positron. So, the gamma-ray photon would annihilate with a CMB photon. The lifetime is related to the mean free path, which depends on the cross-section and the photon density.

So, the mean lifetime τ is the inverse of the reaction rate. The reaction rate Γ is the product of the cross-section σ, the velocity v, and the number density n of the target photons (CMB). So Γ = σ * v * n. Then τ = 1/Γ.

But wait, the cross-section for this process, I think, depends on the energy of the gamma-ray. What's the formula for the cross-section for gamma-gamma annihilation into e+ e-? I think it's proportional to some power of the photon energy. Let me recall... I think the cross-section σ is proportional to (E^2), or maybe (E)^4? Wait, for high-energy photons, the cross-section for pair production (like gamma + gamma → e+ e-) scales as σ ∝ (E^2)/(m_e^2), where m_e is the electron mass. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the cross-section for this process increases with the square of the photon energy, but perhaps it's more precise to say σ ∝ E^2.

Wait, another thought. The photon-photon cross-section for pair production has a threshold. The minimum energy needed for each photon is when their combined energy is at least twice the electron rest mass (2*m_e*c²). But since the CMB photon is at low energy (1e-3 eV), the gamma-ray photon must have enough energy so that the sum of their energies is above 2*m_e*c².

Wait, the problem says the gamma-ray is high energy, so maybe the CMB photon is the low-energy one. So, the condition is that when the gamma-ray photon (E) interacts with a CMB photon (E_cm=1e-3 eV), their combined energy must be sufficient to create the electron-positron pair.

The reaction can only proceed if the center-of-mass energy is above 2m_e c², which is about 1.02 MeV. So the condition is sqrt(s) ≥ 2m_e c², where s = (E_γ + E_cmb)² - (p_γ c + p_cmb c)^2 (assuming photons are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta subtract). Wait, but because photons are massless, their energy equals their momentum times c. So, if the gamma and CMB photons are moving in opposite directions (the most probable scenario), then the invariant s is (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (E_γ - E_cmb)^2, since their momenta are opposite. Let me compute that.

s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (E_γ - E_cmb)^2 = [E_γ² + 2 E_γ E_cmb + E_cmb²] - [E_γ² - 2 E_γ E_cmb + E_cmb²] 
= 4 E_γ E_cmb.

So sqrt(s) = 2 sqrt(E_γ E_cmb) ≥ 2 m_e c².

Divide both sides by 2:

sqrt(E_γ E_cmb) ≥ m_e c².

Squaring both sides:

E_γ E_cmb ≥ (m_e c²)^2.

So E_γ ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / E_cmb.

Given that E_cmb is 1e-3 eV, and m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV.

So m_e c² squared is (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 (eV)^2.

Divide that by E_cmb (1e-3 eV):

E_γ ≥ (0.511^2 * 1e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 0.511^2 * 1e15 eV.

Compute 0.511 squared: 0.511 * 0.511 ≈ 0.261121. So 0.261121e15 eV = 2.61121e14 eV. Wait, but that's 2.61e14 eV. Hmm, but the options are in the 1e5 GeV range. Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 2.61e14 eV is 261,000 GeV, which is 2.61e5 GeV. Oh wait, that's option C: 2.6e5 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second! Because maybe I forgot a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me double-check the invariant s calculation.

Wait, earlier I said s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (E_γ - E_cmb)^2. Let me re-calculate that:

(E_γ + E_cmb)^2 = E_γ² + 2 E_γ E_cmb + E_cmb².

(E_γ - E_cmb)^2 = E_γ² - 2 E_γ E_cmb + E_cmb².

Subtracting the two: [E_γ² + 2 E_γ E_cmb + E_cmb²] - [E_γ² - 2 E_γ E_cmb + E_cmb²] = 4 E_γ E_cmb.

So sqrt(s) = sqrt(4 E_γ E_cmb) = 2 sqrt(E_γ E_cmb). So the condition is 2 sqrt(E_γ E_cmb) ≥ 2 m_e c² → sqrt(E_γ E_c
