Okay, so I have this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). 

Wait, but each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3. I need to calculate the energy for each state and then sum the Boltzmann factors.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8 states. Because each term in the energy involves pairs, perhaps we can find a way to compute the sum without enumerating all possibilities. Hmm.

Let me think about the energy expression. E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So each pair contributes a term. So E is a sum of three terms, each of which can be +1 or -1, right? Because each S_i is ±1, so S_i S_j is also ±1.

Wait, no, the product of two spins is 1 if they're the same and -1 if different. So each S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. So each term S1S2, etc., can be either +1 or -1. So E will be -J multiplied by the sum of these
