Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this. Okay, the problem says that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The masses given are Pi(+) at 139.6 MeV and mu(+) at 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energy of each product.

Wait, right, when a particle is at rest and decays, the total momentum should be conserved. But since the Pi is stationary, the initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the mu and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. That means they have the same magnitude of momentum, but the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, right? Or wait, neutrinos are leptons, but their mass is very tiny. I think in this problem, the neutrino's mass can be considered zero for simplicity. So the muon and neutrino will share the momentum such that their momenta are equal and opposite.

But wait, the neutrino's mass is almost zero, so its energy would be approximately equal to its momentum. Hmm, but for the muon, which has a significant mass, its energy and momentum are related via E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Since the units here are in MeV and masses are given in MeV/c², maybe I can work in units where c=1 to simplify calculations.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote the momentum of the muon as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is also p, but in the opposite direction. So the total momentum is zero, which satisfies conservation.

Now, the total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the Pi(+) since it's at rest. So the energy of the Pi is 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the energies of the muon and neutrino must add up to 139.6 MeV. The muon's energy is sqrt(p² + m_mu²), where m_mu is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's energy is approximately p, since its mass is negligible.

So, sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, that's an equation in p. Let me denote m = 105.7, and M = 139.6. So the equation becomes sqrt(p² + m²) + p = M.

I need to solve for p. Let's subtract p from both sides: sqrt(p² + m²) = M - p. Then square both sides: p² + m² = (M - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: M² - 2 M p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides: m² = M² - 2 M p.

Rearranging: 2 M p = M² - m².

So p = (M² - m²)/(2 M).

Wait, that's a formula I remember. That's
