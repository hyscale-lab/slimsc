Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, it's like N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Now, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So if parallax increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. That might be useful here.

The given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me substitute plx with something involving distance. Since plx = 1/d (where d is distance in parsecs), then 1/plx would be d. So plx^5 is (1/d)^5, which is 1/d^5. So 1/(plx)^5 would be d^5.

Wait, so substituting, N is proportional to d^5. Because 1/(plx^5) is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, no, that's substitution for plx. Let me get that straight.

If N varies as 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. That's the relation between N and d.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So I think it's asking about the number of stars per unit distance, like dN/dr. Because if N increases with d^5, then the rate of change would be dN/dr proportional to 5d^4.

Wait, let me think again. If N = k * d^5, where k is a constant, then taking the derivative of N with respect to d would give dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) would go as r^4. Because r is the distance here.

But wait, the question says 'per unit range of distance, r.' So for a small change in r, how much does N change? So if you have a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr, the number of stars in that shell would be approximately dN = (dN/dr) dr. So the number per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4.

So looking at the options, option C is r^4. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in substitution. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/d. So 1/(plx^5) = d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Then dN/dr is 5d^4. So yeah, the number per unit distance increases with r^4. So the answer should be C.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we can write \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relation, \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} = d^5 \), so \( N \propto d^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This corresponds to finding \( \frac{dN}{dr} \), the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto d^5 \), we get \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance increases with \( r^4 \).

Among the options provided, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
