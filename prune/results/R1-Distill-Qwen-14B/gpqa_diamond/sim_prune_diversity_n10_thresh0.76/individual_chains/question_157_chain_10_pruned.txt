Okay, so I've got this question about designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a viral outbreak. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question is about a retrovirus. Wait, retroviruses are RNA viruses, right? So their genetic material is RNA. When designing a diagnostic test, what's the typical approach for RNA viruses?

The options are A, B, C, D. Let's look at each.

Option A: Use symptoms to identify the virus and design nested PCR. Wait, symptoms might not be specific enough. Plus, nested PCR is a method used when you need to amplify a specific region, usually for very small targets or when you need high specificity. But how would you know the virus from symptoms alone? Maybe that's not the best first step. Also, if it's a retrovirus, the PCR would target RNA, but nested PCR is more for DNA, I think. Or wait, maybe they can do RT-PCR for RNA. But the option says nested PCR, which might not involve reverse transcription first. So maybe A isn't the best choice.

Option B: Perform cDNA sequencing first. cDNA is made from RNA, so that makes sense for a retrovirus. Then develop a real-time PCR. Oh, real-time PCR is efficient for quantification and quick results. So if you first confirm the virus via sequencing, then create primers for a PCR-based test. That sounds solid. Because real-time PCR can give quick and accurate results once the primers are designed.

Option C: DNA sequencing. Wait, the virus is RNA-based, so DNA sequencing
