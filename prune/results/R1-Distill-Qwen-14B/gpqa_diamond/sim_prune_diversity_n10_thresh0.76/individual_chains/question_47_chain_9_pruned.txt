Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm. Let me think about this step by step.

First, the IR data. The strong bands at around 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretches, right? Like in amines or amides. But wait, amines have broader peaks, while amides might show something else. Oh, wait, amides have a strong N-H stretch around 3300-3500 cm^-1. Also, there's a strong band at 1720 cm^-1. That's a carbonyl group, probably an ester or a ketone. But since we have O2 in the formula, ester makes more sense because an ester has a carbonyl.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That sounds like a methyl group attached to something, maybe an ethyl group. Like -OCH2CH3 or something similar. Because a triplet at around 1.2 usually is a CH3 next to a CH2.

Then, 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Hmm. Broad singlet suggests maybe an NH group. Or perhaps an OCH2 group in an ester. But wait, the broadness could be due to exchange with the solvent, like an amide NH. Alternatively, maybe it's part of an ethyl group attached to an electronegative atom.

At 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet with 2H. So each proton is split into 4, which usually means it's next to a CH2 group. Like an ethyl group. So maybe a structure where an OCH2CH2 group is attached. Wait, but 4.5 is higher upfield than a typical OCH2. Or perhaps a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom, like in an ester. Oh wait, in an ester, the adjacent CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH3. Wait, for ethyl esters, the OCH2 is around 4.1-4.3, I think, and the CH3 is around 1.2-1.4. So maybe that's the case here. So the quartet at 4.5 might be a OCH2 attached to something else, perhaps.

Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the two doublets each integrate for 2H, which could be two sets of protons in a para arrangement. So the substituent is attached at the para position. So, for example, something like -OCH2CH3 attached to benzene in the para position, leading to two doublets in the NMR.

Putting this together: the molecule probably has a benzene ring with substituents in the para position. The substituent could be an ester group or an amide. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Wait, 3-ethoxy would be meta, but the NMR shows a para substitution, so maybe that's not it. Also, benzamide would have an amide group, which has N-H, which would show in the IR as a broad peak. The IR here shows multiple peaks, but maybe that's because of the amide. The 1H NMR would probably show an NH peak, but in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Benzamide structure? Wait, 3-ethoxy would be meta, but the problem states the aromatic protons are two doublets, suggesting para substitution. So maybe option A is out.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So this would be a formamide group attached to a para-ethoxy benzene. The substituents would be at para position, so the aromatic protons would split into two doublets, which matches the NMR. The formamide group has NH, which would show up in the IR as N-H. The 1720 cm^-1 might be the carbonyl of the formamide. Wait, formamide carbonyls are around 1680-something, but maybe if it's an ester, the carbonyl is higher. Hmm. Not sure. Also, the ethoxy group would show up as a quartet for the OCH2CH3. Wait, but the triplet at 1.20 is the CH3, and the quartet at
