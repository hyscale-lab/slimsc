Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let's see. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Because β is 1/(kT), so each state contributes exp(-E/(kT)) to Z.

But wait, each spin has two possible states, so the total number of possible states for three spins is 2^3 = 8. But calculating all 8 might be tedious, but maybe manageable.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. The energy expression is symmetric with respect to the spins. Let me think about the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Wait, each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. But wait, because each S is either +1 or -1. So S_i S_j is +1 if S_i and S_j are the same, and -1 otherwise.

So each pair S_i S_j can be +1 or -1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 could be... Well, let's compute all possible cases.

But maybe it's easier to group the states based on the number of parallel spins, but wait, no. Alternatively, let me think about how the sum can add up.

Wait, the maximum value of the sum would be when all three pairs are +1. That would happen when all three spins are the same. Because if all S1, S2, S3 are +1, then each product is +1. Similarly, if all are -1, each product is +1. So in those cases, the sum is 3.

What about when two are the same and one different? Let's say S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1. Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So the sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Similarly, if two are -1 and one is +1, same thing. The sum would be -1.

What if all three spins are different? Wait, but each spin can only be +1 or -1, so three spins can't all be different. Because with three spins, you have either two +1 and one -1, or two -1 and one +1, but not all three different. So the sum can be 3 when all same, or -1 when two same and one different.

Wait, let me count the number of states for each case.

Case 1: All spins the same. There are 2 possibilities: all +1 or all -1. So number of states is 2.

In this case, the sum H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = 3.

So the energy E = -J*(3) = -3J. So the contribution to Z from these states is 2 * exp(β*3J), because E=-3J, so exp(-β E) is exp(3Jβ).

Case 2: Two spins same, one different. How many such states are there?

Let's see. For each spin, it can be the odd one out. For three spins, there are 3 choices for which spin is different. For each, the majority can be +1 or -1.

Wait, for example, if S1 is different from S2 and S3, which are same. So S1 can be +1 and S2=S3=-1, or S1=-1 and S2=S3=+1. So for each choice of which spin is different, there are 2 possibilities. So total number is 3 * 2 =6 states.

In each of these states, the sum H = (+1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait, no. Wait E is -J multiplied by the sum. So if the sum is -1, E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait no, let me re-express. H is S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3. So in the state where two are same and one different, H would be 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J*(H) = -J*(-1) = J.

So each of these 6 states contributes exp(-β E) = exp(-β J * ( -1 ))? Wait, no, wait. Wait, E is equal to -J * H. So E = -J * H.

So when H is -1, E = -J*(-1) = J.

So the energy is J, and the contribution to Z is exp(-β E) = exp( -β J )? Wait, no: the formula is exp(-β E). Wait, no, wait. Z is sum over states of exp(-β E). So if E is J, then the exponent is -β*J.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The energy for a state is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So E = -J H, where H is the sum.

So, for the states where H=3, E = -3J, so each of these states contributes exp(3 J β) because exp(-β E) = exp(3 J β).

For states where H=-1, E = J, so each of these contributes exp(-J β) because -β E = -β J.

Wait, no. Let me compute:

E = -J H.

So for H=3, E = -3J.

So exp( -β E ) = exp( -β*(-3J) ) = exp(3 J β).

For H=-1, E = J.

So exp( -β E ) = exp( -β J ).

So in case 1: 2 states each contribute exp(3 J β), so total contribution is 2 e^{3 J β}.

Case 2: 6 states each contribute exp( - J β ), so total is 6 e^{- J β}.

So the partition function Z is the sum of these contributions:

Z = 2 e^{3 J β} + 6 e^{- J β}.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is Z=2 e^{-3 J β} +6 e^{J β}.

Option B is 2 e^{3 J β} +6 e^{-J β}.

Which matches what I have. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, let me double-check. So in the case of all same spins, E is -3J, so the exponential is e^{3 J β}.

In the case of two same, one different: H is -1, E is J, so exponential is e^{- J β}.

So the contributions are 2 e^{3 J β} from case 1, and 6 e^{- J β} from case 2. So Z = 2 e^{3 J β} + 6 e^{- J β}, which is option B.


To calculate the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Analyze the energy expression
The energy depends on the sum \( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \). Each term \( S_iS_j \) is \( +1 \) if \( S_i = S_j \) and \( -1 \) otherwise. Thus, \( H \) can take specific values based on the relative orientations of the spins.

### Step 2: Determine possible values of \( H \)
- **Case 1: All spins are the same**  
  If \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 \), all three terms \( S_1S_2, S_1S_3, S_2S_3 \) are \( +1 \), so \( H = 3 \).  
  There are 2 such states: all spins \( +1 \) or all spins \( -1 \).  

- **Case 2: Two spins are the same, one is different**  
  For example, if \( S_1 = S_2 \neq S_3 \), two terms \( S_1S_2, S_2S_3 \) are \( +1 \) and one term \( S_1S_3 \) is \( -1 \), so \( H = -1 \).  
  There are \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) such states: each spin can be the odd one out, and the majority can be either \( +1 \) or \( -1 \).

### Step 3: Calculate contributions to \( Z \)
The partition function is the sum over all states of \( \exp(-\beta E) \), where \( E = -JH \). Substituting \( E = -JH \), we have \( \exp(-\beta E) = \exp(\beta JH) \).

- **Case 1: \( H = 3 \)**  
  There are 2 states, each contributing \( \exp(\beta J \cdot 3) = \exp(3J\beta) \).  
  Total contribution: \( 2e^{3J\beta} \).

- **Case 2: \( H = -1 \)**  
  There are 6 states, each contributing \( \exp(\beta J \cdot (-1)) = \exp(-J\beta) \).  
  Total contribution: \( 6e^{-J\beta} \).

### Step 4: Combine contributions
The total partition function is the sum of contributions from all states:
\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
Comparing with the given options, the correct answer is:
\[
\text{B) } Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

Answer: B
