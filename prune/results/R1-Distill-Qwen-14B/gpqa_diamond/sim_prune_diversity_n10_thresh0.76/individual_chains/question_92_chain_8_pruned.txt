Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. So, it's a molecule with two double bonds, maybe? Because I see C=C and another C=C. Let me count the carbons. Each (CH3)2 part is a substituent. So perhaps it's a symmetrical molecule with two double bonds. I'll need to count all the bonds and the elements involved.

The problem gives me some bond energies. Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, I think atomization energy is the energy required to break a molecule into its constituent atoms. So for carbon, it's the energy to break a C-C bond into two C atoms.

Wait, no, wait. Enthalpy of atomization is the enthalpy change when one mole of a substance is completely atomized. For an element in its standard state, like carbon in graphite, it's the energy needed to break all bonds in the solid structure. But maybe in this problem, it's given as 1000 kJ per mole for carbon. I'll have to think about how that's used.

The other bond energies given are H-H as 100 kJ/mol, C-C as 200, C=C as 300, and C-H as 400 kJ/mol. So, I guess I need to calculate the enthalpy of formation using bond energies.

Wait, the enthalpy of formation is the change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for an organic compound like this, the elements are H2 and C (as graphite or whatever the standard state is).

So, the general formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of reactant bonds] - [sum of bond energies of product bonds]

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, the formation enthalpy is calculated by considering the bonds broken in the reactants and the bonds formed in the products. So the formula is:
