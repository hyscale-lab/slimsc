Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it slow and try to remember what I learned in class.

So, the problem starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, what's that? Well, C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane, but more likely propene because it's a common starting material. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3, I think.

Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh right, that's a typical bromination condition. Since propene is an alkene, the bromine (Br2) would add across the double bond. So, the reaction would be an addition reaction. Propene adding bromine would give 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, or is it 1,1? Oh no, wait, when Br2 adds to an alkene, it's a diaddition across the double bond, so 1,2-dibromopropane. So Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add Br across the double bond, so the structure becomes CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? Or maybe CH2BrCHBrCH3. Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH2CH3. So, adding Br across the double bond, each Br attaches to adjacent carbons. So the structure would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So yes, that's correct.

Then, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Oh, that's a dehydrohalogenation condition, which is an elimination reaction. So, the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons. So when KOH (alcoholic) is used, it should eliminate HBr and form a double bond. Since the Brs are on carbons 1 and 2, eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond between C1 and C2, resulting in propene again. Wait, but wait. Wait, if you have 1,2-dibromopropane, and you eliminate two HBr molecules, you would get back propene. So Compound C is propene again. Oh, but wait, propene
