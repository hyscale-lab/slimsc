Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see what the question says.

Okay, the problem is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I'm not sure if that's important here. The key point is that they're in orbital resonance. The orbital periods have ratios of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, then Planet_2 is twice that, and so on up to Planet_5 with a period five times Planet_1's.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. They have the same albedo, which probably simplifies things because albedo affects how much light they reflect, but if it's the same, it won't change the calculation. So I guess I can ignore albedo for this part.

I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula I think is:

Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)

Where:
- Te is the equilibrium temperature of the planet
- T_star is the star's effective temperature
- R_star is the star's radius
- a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis
- A is the albedo

Since all the planets are orbiting the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for each. So the ratio of their temperatures will depend on a and (1 - A), but since A is the same for all, that factor will cancel out in the ratio.

So the ratio Te4/Te2 will be sqrt( (a2)/(a4) ), because the other terms are constants and (1-A) is the same. Wait, wait, no: let me think again. The formula is Te proportional to sqrt( (R_star/(2a)) ) because the formula is sqrt(R/(2a)) multiplied by other constants.

Wait, let me get this right. The equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square root of the distance. Because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, and the planet emits as a blackbody (or with albedo considered), so the flux received is L/(4πa²), and the planet's emission is σTe^4. So setting them equal (since energy in equals energy out at equilibrium), we get:

(L/(4πa²)) * (1 - A) = σ Te^4

Which rearranges to:

Te = [ (L/(4πσ)) * (1 - A) ]^(1/4) / a^(1/2)

So Te is proportional to sqrt( (L)^(1/2) / (a)^(1/2) ) * (1-A)^(1/4) )

But since all planets orbit the same star, L, (1-A), and σ are the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. So Te ∝ 1/sqrt(a)

Wait, no. Wait, Te is proportional to sqrt( (L(1-A))/(4πσ) ) * (1/(sqrt(a)) )

So, more accurately, Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So the ratio of Te4 to Te2 would be sqrt(a2/a4).

Because if Te ∝ 1/sqrt(a), then Te4/Te2 = sqrt(a2/a4)

Wait, because Te4 = k / sqrt(a4), Te2 = k / sqrt(a2). So Te4/Te2 = (k/sqrt(a4)) / (k/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a4)

Yes, correct.

So I need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet 2 and Planet 4. Because their orbital periods are in a ratio.

But wait, I don't have the actual periods, just their ratios. So the key is to relate the orbital periods to the semi-major axes.

I remember Kepler's third law: the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis, for a given star. So (P^2) ∝ a^3.

Since all planets orbit the same star, their periods and semi-major axes follow P² ∝ a³ → a ∝ P^(2/3)

So, if P2 is the period of Planet 2, and P4 is that of Planet 4, then a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3)

Wait, wait, let's see: a is proportional to P^(2/3). So for each planet, a_i = k * P_i^(2/3), where k is a constant for the system (same for all planets).

So a2 = k * P2^(2/3)
a4 = k * P4^(2/3)

So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3)

So the ratio a2/a4 is (P2/P4) raised to the 2/3 power.

Now, from the problem, the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for planets 1 to 5.

So P1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 :5.

So P2 is 2 units, P4 is 3.5 units.

So the ratio P2/P4 is 2 / 3.5.

Simplify that: 2 divided by 3.5 is the same as 2/(7/2) )= 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (P2/P4) = 4/7.

Therefore, a2/a4 = (4/7)^(2/3).

Wait, because a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) → (4/7)^(2/3)

So the ratio Te4/Te2 is sqrt( a2/a4 )

Wait, earlier, I thought Te4/Te2 = sqrt(a2/a4). Because Te is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So the ratio of Te4 to Te2 is (sqrt(a2)) / (sqrt(a4)) ) = sqrt(a2/a4) )

Wait, or is it the reciprocal?

Wait, Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So Te4 = k / sqrt(a4), Te2 = k / sqrt(a2).

So Te4/Te2 = (k/sqrt(a4)) / (k/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a4)

Yes, correct.

So Te4/Te2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) )

Wait, because a2/a4 = (4/7)^(2/3)

So sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) equals (4/7)^( (2/3) * (1/2) ) = (4/7)^(1/3)

So Te4/Te2 = (4/7)^(1/3)

Hmm, wait, let's compute that.

4/7 is approximately 0.5714. The cube root of 0.5714.

I know that 0.5714 is about 4/7 ≈ 0.571.

What's 0.571^1/3. Let's think: cube of 0.8 is 0.512 (0.8^3=0.512), cube of 0.83 is 0.83^3 ≈ 0.571.

Wait, wait, 0.83^3 = (0.8 + 0.03)^3. Let me compute 0.83^3.

0.8^3 = 0.512. 0.03^3 is negligible, but cross terms: 3*(0.8)^2*0.03 = 3 *
