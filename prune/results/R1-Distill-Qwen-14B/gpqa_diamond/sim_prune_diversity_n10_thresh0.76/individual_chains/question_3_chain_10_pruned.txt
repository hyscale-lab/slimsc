Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-half particle. Hmm, let me try to think through this. Alright, the problem says the particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And the question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx.

Wait, σz and σx are the Pauli matrices, right? So I need to calculate the expectation value of each term and sum them up. Because expectation is linear, I can do each separately and add the results.

First, let's recall what the expectation value is. For an operator A, the expectation value ⟨A⟩ is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩. So I'll need to compute this for each part of the operator.

The given state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let me write these coefficients as a and b. So a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2. Wait, does that make sense? Let me check: 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, which adds up to 1, so it's normalized. Great.

Now, the operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value will be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

I remember that σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively. So let's compute ⟨σz⟩.

⟨σz⟩ = ⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should simplify.

In matrix form, σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Alternatively, for the eigenstates, applying σz to |↑⟩ gives +1 times |↑⟩, and to |↓⟩ gives -1 times |↓⟩.

So let's compute ⟨σz⟩.

ψ is a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩. So ψ† is a*⟨↑| + b*⟨↓|.

So ψ† σz ψ = a* a (σz acting on |↑⟩ is +1|↑⟩) + a* b (σz acting on |↓⟩ is -1|
