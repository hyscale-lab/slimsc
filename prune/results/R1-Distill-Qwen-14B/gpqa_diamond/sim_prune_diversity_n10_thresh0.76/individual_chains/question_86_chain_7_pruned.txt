Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions. Each reaction used a different reducing agent. The first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+ (probably an acid workup), and the second uses BH3 and H+. Both reactions start from different compounds (A and B) and produce the same product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively.

Wait, no, actually, looking again, the products are (R) and (S) respectively. So reaction A gives the R enantiomer, and reaction B gives the S enantiomer.

Wait, no, the products are each with R and S. Let me reread that. Oh, no: the first reaction's product is (R)-4-ethyl..., and the second is (S)-4-ethyl... So each reaction gives a different enantiomer of the same compound. So the starting materials A and B must have been different in a way that when each is reduced, they produce opposite configurations.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about what kind of reaction this is.

LiBH4 and BH3 are both borohydride reducing agents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce carbonyl groups like ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. Wait, but wait, BH3 is typically used for hydroboration reactions, which follow anti-Markovnikov addition. Oh wait, but when used as a reducing agent, perhaps in the presence of other conditions?

Wait, no. Let's think. For carbonyl reductions, LiBH4 is commonly used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols.
