Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, SMEFT is an effective theory framework that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. I remember that these operators are classified based on their dimension, and they're organized in terms of the energy scale they become relevant at.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these, and I need to select the correct ones.

Wait, first, let me think about each symmetry.

Lorentz symmetry: This is the symmetry of spacetime under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. In the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry, so the SMEFT should also respect this because it's an effective theory built on top of the SM. So all operators must be Lorentz invariant. That makes sense.

Poincare symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz transformations plus translations (like shifting the position in space). So Poincare includes the idea of momentum conservation, right? But wait, the SMEFT is an effective theory at low energies compared to some cutoff. Do the SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? I think they do. Because the SM itself respects Poincare symmetry, so any effective theory derived from it should as well. So operators must be Poincare invariant.

Wait, but wait. SMEFT includes higher-dimensional operators. Are these operators Poincare invariant? Because the action in the SM is Poincare invariant. The SMEFT action is the same as the SM action plus these higher-dimensional terms. So the SMEFT action must maintain the same symmetries as the SM, which includes Poincare. So yes, all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

But wait, is Poincare symmetry a separate symmetry or is it automatically included when you have Lorentz symmetry? Because Poincare is the combination of Lorentz and translations. So if the theory respects Lorentz, and the terms are constructed covariantly (like using covariant derivatives), then translation invariance (momentum conservation) is preserved. I think in SMEFT, the operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars, so they automatically respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So both 1 and 2 are required.

Next, CP symmetry. CP is charge conjugation plus parity. The Standard Model has some CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So the SMEFT operators can have CP violation, right? Because the SM already has it. But wait, are all operators in SMEFT required to respect CP symmetry? Or can some operators violate it?

Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The effective theory can include operators that violate CP if the new physics that's being modeled introduces CP violation. The SMEFT is a framework that includes all possible operators, so some operators could violate CP. Therefore, the operators don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So point 3 might not be a must.

But wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if some operators can violate CP, then CP symmetry isn't necessarily a symmetry that all operators must respect. So option 3 is not a required symmetry for all operators. Therefore, 3 is not a must.

Then, CPT symmetry. CPT is charge-parity-time reversal. The Standard Model is CPT symmetric. Effective theories derived from the SM should also respect CPT symmetry. Because any fundamental theory must respect CPT (assuming it's a quantum field theory), the SMEFT, being an effective theory of the SM,
