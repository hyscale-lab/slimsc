Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a reaction. Let me first write down what I know.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I need to visualize its structure. Let me sketch it out quickly.

So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with a double bond. The numbering is such that the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene). Then, the substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

At position 2, there's a formyl group (-CHO). And at position 5, a vinyl group (-CH2CH2?), wait no, vinyl is -CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So, the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the cyclohexene ring. So, it's 5-vinyl.

Wait, so the structure is a cyclohexene ring (double bond between C3 and C4), with a formyl group on C2 and a vinyl group on C5.

So, the structure would be like:

- The ring has six carbons. At C2, there's a -CHO group attached. At C5, there's a -CH2-CH2 group, but wait, no, vinyl is -CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So, the group is -CH2CH2? No, I think I'm confused. Oh no, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is a CH2-CH2 with a double bond? No, wait, the vinyl group is a CH2=CH- attached. So, the substituent is a vinyl group, meaning a CH2-CH2 where the CH2 is connected to the ring, and the CH2 has a double bond to another CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- as a substituent. So, the substituent is CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two carbons. So, the substituent on C5 is a vinyl group, making it a CH2=CH group attached to the ring.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the substituents. So, the cyclohexene has a double bond at 3-ene, so that's C3 and C4. Then, the substituents are:

- 2-formyl: So, a formyl (CHO) group on C2.

- 5-vinyl: So, a vinyl (CH2=CH-) group on C5.

So, the structure would have a six-membered ring with double bond between C3 and C4. C2 has a CHO group, and C5 has a CH2-CH2 group with a double bond (CH2=CH- attached to C5).

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Wait, what reaction uses red phosphorus and HI? I remember that's
