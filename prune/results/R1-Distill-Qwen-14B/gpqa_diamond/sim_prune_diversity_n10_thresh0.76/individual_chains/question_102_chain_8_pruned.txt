Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down and figure out what's going on.

The question starts with a new ligand-receptor pair found in neural crest cells. The researcher wants to understand their developmental roles. So, the setup involves creating a bicistronic vector, which means it has two genes (ligand and receptor) under a single promoter but in different reading frames, I think.

The vector is a lox-Cre construct. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. Wait, I remember that IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so maybe the receptor is expressed as a separate transcript after the ligand?

There are stop cassettes in between. The ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between it and mCherry. The receptor has lox2272-stop-lox2272 between it and eGFP. Oh, right, these are different loxP sites, so Cre will only excise one of them depending on the site.

Then, the researcher made antibodies against these overexpressed proteins and tested expression via Western blot. The blot uses total proteins and actin as a loading control. So they're checking if the proteins are expressed.

Then, they breed mice homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. They cross these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So SOX10-Cre is probably driving recombination in neural crest cells since SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development.

After the offspring are born, they look under a confocal microscope for fluorescence. But they don't see a green signal. The green would come from eGFP, which is on the receptor construct. So the question is why isn't eGFP showing up.

The options are A to D. Let's think through each.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on neighboring cells. But in this setup, they're using Cre to knock out the stop cassettes, so both ligand and receptor should be co-expressed in the same cells. If they were paracrine, maybe they're secreted and act on other cells, but the question is about expression in the same cell for the fluorescent markers.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean the eGFP isn't secreted or expressed on the cell surface. But the reporter is eGFP fused to the receptor, which is a transmembrane protein. So if the construct is properly processed, eGFP should be on the cell surface. If it's stuck in the Golgi, maybe because of a processing issue, like a stop-transfer signal, but I don't see any info about that. Plus, the question says the vector was designed, but maybe the design messed up the signal.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The vector has the CBA promoter for the ligand, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor is after an IRES, which doesn't require a promoter. Wait, no: IRES allows for translation without a promoter. Or maybe the CBA promoter drives both? Hmm, no, the ligand is under CBA, and the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So the CBA promoter should drive the ligand, and the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed from the same transcript, but as a separate ORF. So perhaps the enhancer is not present, but the promoters are there. Or maybe the loxP sites cause the promoters to not function correctly after recombination.

Wait, the loxP sites are used for Cre-mediated recombination. The ligand has a stop cassette with loxP, and the receptor has a different lox site. So when Cre is present, it will excise the stop cassette. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand and receptor should be expressed.

But in the mouse model, the Cre is SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the construct would be recombined, allowing expression of the ligand (mCherry) and receptor (eGFP).

But in the experiment, when they look for eGFP, which is on the receptor, they don't see it. So why is eGFP not expressed?

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, the vector is bicistronic. So the two OR
