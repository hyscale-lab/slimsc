Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B, and I need to figure out the major products for each. The options are given for each product, so I'll tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong base, so I'm thinking this might be an aldol addition or some kind of enolate formation reaction.

Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let's draw its structure. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1, so positions are numbered such that the carbonyl is carbon 1. Then, positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups, and position 2 also has an ethyl group because it's 2-ethyl. Wait, no: the substituents are 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl. Wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the substituents are on carbon 2: an ethyl and a methyl group. And another methyl on carbon 6. So, carbon 2 is substituted with ethyl and methyl, and carbon 6 has a methyl.

So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1. Carbon 2 has two substituents—ethyl and methyl—making it a quaternary carbon. Carbon 6 has a methyl. So, the ring is probably not too symmetric, but there's some branching.

Now, when a ketone like this reacts with ethyl acrylate under basic conditions, I think it's an example of a Michael addition or perhaps a Claisen-like condensation. Alternatively, could it be a crossed aldol reaction? Since ethyl acrylate is an enolate donor, but wait, no, ethyl acrylate is an ester with an alpha, beta-unsaturated group. So the base (t-BuOK) would deproton
