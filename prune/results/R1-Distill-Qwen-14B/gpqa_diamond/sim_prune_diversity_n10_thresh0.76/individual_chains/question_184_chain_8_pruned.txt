Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The structure has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are 1, 2, and 3 on the benzene ring. Wait, actually, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering might be a bit different. Let me think, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3? Or is it positions 1, 2, and 3 in a specific order? Oh right, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the numbering starts with the ethoxy group at position 1, then the tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So, the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions, each adjacent to each other. That's meta positions for the nitro and ethoxy groups? Wait, no. Let me count: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So, the benzene ring would have substituents at 1, 2, and 3, which are adjacent. So that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. So, their positions are all adjacent. Hmm. For the synthesis, I need to introduce these groups in the right order.

Now, benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions. The order in which substituents are added can impact the positions where subsequent groups attach. For example, activating groups direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions, while deactivating groups direct them to others.

Let's think about
