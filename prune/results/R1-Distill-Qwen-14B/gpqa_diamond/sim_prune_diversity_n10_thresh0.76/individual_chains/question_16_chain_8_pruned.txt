Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many of these compounds are optically active. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I remember that optical activity has to do with the presence of chiral centers, which are atoms (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups. So, each compound's structure needs to be checked for that.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

Hmm, the structure here is a double bond between C1 and C2. The configuration is Z. Wait, so the double bond is between 1 and 2. The groups on C1 are Cl, the double bond, and two CH2 groups? Or wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw the structure.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2. Wait, but 1-chloro-2-methyl... So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So it's Cl-C double bond CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me think. Structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH2? No, wait, but the butenyl is four carbons, so perhaps it's Cl-CH₂-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH₂Cl-C(CH3)=CH₂?

Wait, maybe the structure is CHCl=CH(CH3)-
