Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, which probably means we don't have to consider gravitational potential energy, just electric potential energy. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm. So, I'm thinking about potential energy in electrostatics. When you have multiple charges, the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to their positions. But since all the charges are identical and the same sign, they would repel each other, so the potential energy should be positive. But wait, the question is asking for the minimum energy. So maybe the system is in a configuration where the potential is minimized, which for repelling charges would be when they're as far apart as possible. But in this case, 12 are fixed at 2m, and the 13th is at the center.

Wait, so the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are at 2m from P. So each of these 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P, which is where the 13th charge is. So the setup is like a central charge with 12 others arranged around it, each at 2m away.

But wait, no, the problem doesn't specify how the 12 are arranged. It just says they're constrained to stay at 2m from point P. So perhaps they form a spherical shell around P, each at a radius of 2m. Alternatively, they could be arranged in some other configuration, but since they are identical and the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the configuration that minimizes the potential energy is when all the 12 are placed as far apart as possible, but given they are at a fixed distance from P, maybe their arrangement doesn't affect the potential energy calculation. Or perhaps the potential energy only depends on their distances from each other.

Wait, but waitâ€”wait, potential energy for a system of
