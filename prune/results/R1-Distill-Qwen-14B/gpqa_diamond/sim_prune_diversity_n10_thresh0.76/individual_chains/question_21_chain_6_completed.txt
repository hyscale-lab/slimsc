Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the answers. Let me take it step by step. 

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the actual problem has two parts: A and B. Let me read them again.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism. Hmm, I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and a shift of electrons, like in keto-enol tautomerism. So, which of these compounds can't undergo that?

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone has a structure similar to benzene with two ketone groups. Wait, wait, no, benzoquinone is actually a benzene ring with two ketone oxygens. Oh wait, no, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. So it's a cyclic diketone. But wait, for tautomerism, you need a keto group adjacent to an enolizable proton. Alternatively, maybe it's about whether the groups are conjugated.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can't tautomerize because the structure is such that the enol form is not possible. Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. So, if we try to remove a proton from one of the adjacent carbons, but wait, all the carbons are part of the ring. Wait, the structure is similar to 1,4-benzoquinone, which has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring.

Wait, but the benzene ring in benzoquinone is conjugated with the two ketones. So, could it undergo tautomerism? Or maybe not, because the structure is too rigid, or because the necessary H isn't present.

Wait, another thought: Tautomerism usually requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, if a compound has adjacent H and carbonyl, it can tautomerize. Benzoquinone has each ketone group attached directly to the ring, but the adjacent carbons are each attached to another part of the ring. So maybe those aren't enolizable. Alternatively, perhaps the ring structure makes tautomerism impossible because the necessary H isn't available.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each on alternate carbons. So the structure would be O=C-(CH2)-O=C-(CH2)-O=C-(CH2), but in a ring because it's cyclohexane. Wait, no, it's 1,3,5-trione, which would have three ketones at positions 1,3,5, so each of those carbons is a carbonyl. So the structure is O=C-O-C-O-C-O-C-O? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again: cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So each ketone is on every other carbon.

Wait, but the molecule is O=C-(CH2)-O=C-(CH2)-O=C- etc., but all in a ring. So the structure is actually a cyclic triketone. Now, for tautomerism, each of these ketone groups would need an adjacent H to form an enol. Let's see: Each ketone is in a position where the adjacent carbons are CH2 groups, right? So for each carbonyl, there should be a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon. So, perhaps each of those carbons (the ones next to the ketone) has two hydrogens available.

Wait, but in a cyclic structure like 1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is flanked by two CH2 groups. So each of those CH2 groups is adjacent to a carbonyl, so each CH2 has two H's that could potentially be involved in tautomerism.

Wait, but for a tautomerism to occur, you need a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group. So in the case of 1,3,5-trione, each of those CH2 groups is alpha to a carbonyl. So each CH2 can lose a hydrogen, leading to an enol form. So, the molecule can tautomerize. But wait, is that possible in a ring system?

Alternatively, maybe the ring's conjugated system is such that it's impossible. Or perhaps the ring strain makes tautomerism difficult. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, benzoquinone is a flat, conjugated system. So if it's 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O. Now, each of the carbons next to the carbonyl groups is part of the benzene ring, so they have no hydrogens. Because benzene is a ring of CH groups, but in benzoquinone, the carbons where the O is attached are like C=O, so the adjacent carbons are CH (since it's benzene). So, wait, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are each attached to one hydrogen. Because in benzene, each C has one H. Wait, no, benzoquinone would have two ketone groups, each attached to a carbon in the benzene ring. So each ketone is at, say, position 1 and 4. Then, the adjacent carbons (position 2 and 6 for the first ketone, and 3 and 5 for the second) each have one H. But each of those would be attached to a benzene ring, so perhaps they can't tautomerize because the H is not in a position to form an enol.

Wait, but the structure of benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. The structure is similar to benzene but with two ketones. So each carbonyl is at opposite positions. So the adjacent carbons have only one H each. So, could those Hs participate in tautomerism?

Wait, tautomerism involves the shift of a hydrogen and the electrons, so the H needs to be alpha to a carbonyl. But in benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons have only one H each. So, is it possible for tautomerism to occur? Or is there no possibility because perhaps the structure is too rigid or the necessary H isn't present?

Alternatively, maybe both benzoquinone and the trione can or cannot tautomerize. Hmm.

Wait, I think that 1,4-benzoquinone does not show tautomerism because the adjacent positions are all part of the aromatic ring, so the H is not in a position to allow for the enol form. Because in the aromatic ring, the adjacent carbons are each only attached to one H, making it impossible for the conjugation necessary for tautomerism.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Another approach: which of these compounds have enolizable hydrogens? Enolizable Hs are on the alpha carbons (next to carbonyl groups). So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups, each with two alpha CH2 groups. Each of those CH2 has two H's, so they can lose a H to form an enol. So, yes, it can tautomerize.

Benzoquinone, on the other hand, each carbonyl group is attached to a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are each part of the ring, so they are CH groups (each has only one H). But wait, for enol formation, you need a H on the alpha position. So, each ketone in benzoquinone has adjacent CH groups, which have Hs. So, can they tautomerize?

Wait, perhaps not, because in the aromatic ring, the structure is rigid. The enol form would require the H to shift, but the ring's conjugation might make it impossible. Alternatively, maybe the H is not in a position to allow for the necessary conjugation for tautomerism.

Wait, another thought: in tautomerism, the keto and enol forms are in equilibrium. For benzoquinone, if the enol form would require a six-membered ring with conjugated double bonds, but the molecule is already aromatic, perhaps the enol form isn't possible because it would disrupt the aromaticity. Alternatively, perhaps the enol form isn't conjugated enough or isn't possible.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize, but I'm not sure. Wait, I'm a bit rusty here. Let me think of examples. For example, cyclohexanone can tautomerize to its enol form, right? So, if a compound has alpha hydrogens adjacent to a carbonyl, it can tautomerize.

In benzoquinone, each ketone is attached to a benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the ketones are CH groups in the ring. So each has one H, which is alpha. So, perhaps benzoquinone can tautomerize, because each ketone has an alpha H.

Wait, but wait, the structure of benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. Each of the two carbonyl groups is at positions 1 and 4 of the benzene ring. So, the adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6 for the first ketone, and positions 3 and 5 for the second) are CH groups. Each of these CH groups has one H. So, each of those Hs is alpha to a carbonyl. So in theory, each would be able to lose a H to form an enol.

Wait, but would that disrupt the aromaticity? Let me think. If one of the Hs is removed, the adjacent C would form a double bond. But the benzene ring is already conjugated. Let me imagine the structure: if one of the CH groups (say, position 2) loses a H, forming a double bond between C1 (carbonyl) and C2, but C1 is already double-bonded to O. So forming another double bond would create a conjugated diene in the ring.

Wait, but the ring might not be able to accommodate that without breaking the aromatic system. Hmm, maybe in that case, the enol form isn't possible because the molecule would lose aromaticity, which isn't favorable. So, tautomerism isn't possible for benzoquinone. That would mean that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does tautomerize, and benzoquinone doesn't.

So, for part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So A would be benzoquinone, which is option D or B for part A.

Wait, looking back at the options, let me see:

The options are:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

So, if A is benzoquinone, then options B and D are possibilities for part A.

Now, moving on to part B: among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center. Alternatively, it can arise from other forms of asymmetry, like in allenes or certain rings, but let's focus on chiral centers.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Let me draw its structure. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no: the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3CH(OH)COOH. The ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is propanoic acid with an OH on the second carbon. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH; no, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would have OH on the middle CH2. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no: position 2 is the middle carbon. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CHOHCOOH? Wait, no, the formula for propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxy would be the middle CH2 group having an OH. So, structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, that's not possible because that would make it HOCH2CH2COOH. So, the ester would be methyl ester: the acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, so the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, does this have a chiral center? Let's see: the central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- One CH2COOCH3 group (the two carbons on either side?)

Wait, let me think, structure is:

COOCH3 is the ester group. So the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3?

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write the structure more clearly.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester derived from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid would be HOOC-CH2-OH? No, wait, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH? Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, maybe I should count the carbons.

Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The carboxylic acid is on the third carbon. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester form would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Looking at the central carbon (the one with the OH), what are its substituents?

The carbon with OH is attached to:

- One CH2 group (from the CH2COOCH3 side),
- One CH2 group (from the CH2OH side),
- Two hydrogens? Wait, no, wait, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, that would make the central carbon attached to two CH2 groups, which may not have enough substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Propanoic acid has three carbons: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH3 (but wait, that's butanoic acid. Oh wait, no, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on the middle carbon. So, structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. 

In this structure, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- One methyl group (from the adjacent CH2),
- One OH group,
- One COOCH3 group,
- And another CH2 group (wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong).

Wait, no. Let's correct that. The molecule is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the chain is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: CH2(OH)

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3? No, because that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, let me number the carbons. The carboxylic acid is on carbon 1, then carbon 2, and then the methyl group on carbon 3. So, 2-hydroxy would be on carbon 2.

So, the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3 (carboxylic ester group) attached to carbon 1.

Carbon 2: has CH(OH) group.

Carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, no, that's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOH. Its ester is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (carbon 2) has the substituents:

- CH3 (carbon 1: no, wait, carbon 2 is attached to carbon 1 (COOCH3) and carbon 3 (CH3)), and the OH.

So substituents on carbon 2 are: COOCH3, CH3, OH, and another CH2? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Structure is:

CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So carbon 2 is attached to:

- CH3 (carbon 3)
- OH
- COOCH3 (carbon 1)
- And a hydrogen? Wait, no. Because it's CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, so carbon 2 has four bonds: one to CH3, one to OH, one to COOCH3, and one to the adjacent carbon (carbon 1 is COOCH3). Wait, no, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3 is on carbon 1. Carbon 2 is CH(OH), and carbon 3 is CH3.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- COOCH3 group (carbon 1),
- CH3 group (carbon 3),
- OH group,
- And a hydrogen.

So, four substituents. So, is carbon 2 a chiral center? Because it's connected to four different groups.

COOCH3 is one substituent, CH3 is another, OH is another, and H is the fourth. So yes, carbon 2 is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound in part B is dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is a diacid: it has two carboxylic acid groups on adjacent carbons with a double bond between them. So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOH)2. The dimethyl ester would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    |
CH2-C=C-CH2
    |
    O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, more accurately, it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 is on one end, and the same on the other end, connected by a double bond.

So, structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

So, each of the COOCH3 groups is on adjacent carbons of a double bond.

Now, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Let's see.

Each of the two carbons in the double bond (the C=C) has substituents. The left carbon has two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups? No, wait, no. Structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two carbons in the double bond has one CH2 group (on the left carbon) and two COOCH3 groups (on the right carbon). Wait, no.

Wait, the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, the left carbon of the double bond is CH2, and the right carbon is C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, the right carbon has two COOCH3 groups attached, right? So, let me think about the substituents on each carbon of the double bond.

Left carbon: CH2- is attached to the double bond. So, structure is CH2-.

Wait, the actual structure is:

The molecule is (Z)- or (E)- but as fumarate is the trans isomer. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer. Because maleic acid is cis, while fumaric acid is trans. So, the di-ester would have the substituents on opposite sides.

But for the question of optical isomerism, we need to look for chirality.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the double bond carbons is connected to two ester groups and the other carbon.

Wait, let me think. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2.

C2 is attached to two O-C-OCH3 groups.

Wait, no, more accurately, the structure is:

C1: CH2-C(=O)OCH3

Double bonded to C2: C(=O)OCH3)2.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write it as:

CH2-CH(COOCH3)2, but with a double bond between the two CH groups.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

The structure of fumarate is:

HO2C-CH2-CH(COOH)-CO2H? No, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me get this right.

Maleic acid is HO2C-CH2-CH(COOH)-CO2H? No, wait, no. Maleic acid is a cis-dicarboxylic acid: it has two COOH groups on adjacent carbons, with the double bond in between. So structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but the two COOH groups are on the same side (cis). Fumaric acid is the trans version.

So, the dimethyl ester of maleic acid is the cis isomer, and the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid is the trans isomer. Wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid, which has the trans configuration.

So, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Each of the double bond carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two other substituents.

Wait, no. Let's check for each carbon:

C1 (left side of double bond): CH2- group. So it's connected to:

- Two H's (since it's CH2),
- One double bond to C2,
- One CH3 from COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Let's look at each carbon in the double bond.

C1: CH2=, so two H's, one double bond to C2, and two single bonds to other groups? No, wait, in the structure of dimethyl fumarate, the left side is CH2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

So, the double bond is between C1 (CH2) and C2 (C connected to two COOCH3 groups and one CH2).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm not visualizing it correctly. Let me think of it as:

The molecule is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, C1 is CH2, connected to a double bond to C2, which is connected to two COOCH3 groups.

So, the substituents on C1 are: two H's, one CH2, and one double bond to C2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each carbon in the double bond.

C1: Structure is CH2-.

Wait, CH2 is connected to C2 via a double bond. So, C1 has two H's, and is connected via double bond to C2.

C2: connected to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group via the double bond.

Wait, so for each carbon, the substituents are:

C1: two H's, one double bond to C2.

C2: two COOCH3 groups, one double bond to C1, and what else? Wait, maybe CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let's imagine the structure again.

Dimethyl fumarate is formed from fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2, which has another O-C-OCH3.

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3? No, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no. The correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, meaning the double bond is between two carbons, where one is CH2 and the other is C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, so C1 is CH2 connected via double bond to C2, which has two COOCH3 groups attached. So, for C2, its substituents are:

- Two COOCH3 groups,
- One double bond to C1 (which is CH2),
- And one single bond to another group?

No, perhaps not. Let me think, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

So, C1 is CH2, double-bonded to C2, which is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So, the substituents on C2 are:

- Two COOCH3 groups,
- One double bond to C1 (CH2),
- And a single bond to what? Another group?

Wait, no, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has two substituent groups.

Wait, in the structure CH2=C(COOCH3)2, each of the two carbons in the double bond has two substituents. C1: CH2 (so one substituent, CH3?), no, wait, no.

Wait, I think it's better to draw it mentally as:

C1: CH2- connected to a double bond.

C2: connected to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond to C1.

So, for each carbon:

C1: substituents are two H's, one CH2, and a double bond to C2.

Wait, but that's not possible because each carbon can only have four bonds. So, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3, but that would be a single bond, not a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should look for whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers.

Wait, the molecule is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Each of the carbons in the double bond (C1 and C2) has two substituents.

C1: CH2 group.

Wait, but in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other substituents besides the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The correct structure is:

The dimethyl ester of fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3. No, that's not right because that would be a single bond. Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, so C1 is CH2, C2 is CH connected to two COOCH3 groups. So, the structure is:

C1: CH2-

Double bond: = 

C2: C(COOCH3)2.

So, C2 is connected to two COOCH3 groups, and the double bond to C1 (which is CH2).

Now, looking at C2: substituents are two COOCH3 groups, the double bond to C1 (CH2), and perhaps another substituent.

Wait, no, wait. Each carbon in a double bond has two substituents. So, for C2, it's connected to two COOCH3 groups and the double bond to C1.

But wait, that's three substituents. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps each of the double bond carbons has two substituents besides the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, which is attached to two COOCH3 groups.

So, C2 has substituents: two COOCH3 groups, a double bond to C1 (CH2), and perhaps a hydrogen. Because each carbon must have four bonds.

So, substituents on C2: COOCH3, COOCH3, double bond to C1, and a hydrogen.

If that's the case, then C2 has three different substituents: two COOCH3, a double bond (which is same on both sides?), and a H. Wait, but for a chiral center, the substituents must be four different groups.

In this case, C2 is attached to:

- Two COOCH3 groups (same),
- A double bond (which is similar on both sides),
- A H.

So, substituents are COOCH3 (twice), H, and the double bond. That's only three different substituents. So, C2 is not a chiral center.

Similarly, C1 is CH2 connected to a double bond and two Hs. So, it has two Hs, a double bond, and a CH2 group (but wait, what is attached to the CH2? Do I have another group? Maybe not, so C1 is CH2 with two Hs and the double bond. So, no chiral center there.

So, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? It seems not. Because each carbon in the double bond has two identical substituents (two COOCH3 on C2) and the others have insufficient different groups.

Wait, but wait another thought. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not have a chiral center. In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is symmetric if the substituents are arranged symmetrically. So, for example, if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans configuration), then the molecule might be symmetrical, leading to no chiral centers.

Wait, but even if there's a double bond with substituents on both sides, whether it's a chiral center depends on the substituents. But in this case, each double bond carbon has two identical substituents.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Earlier, I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center because the central carbon is attached to four different groups: COOCH3, CH3, OH, and H. So, it has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

So, part B is asking which of the two (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate) shows optical isomerism. From the above, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does, and dimethyl fumarate doesn't.

Therefore, the correct answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it would show optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate doesn't. So, the correct option for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Now, looking back at the options, let's see which option has A as benzoquinone and B as methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So, since part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the correct option would be option B for part B, but looking at the options, option B has B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, and A = benzoquinone.

So, the correct overall answer would be option B, which has A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait another thing: Did I get the structures right? Because sometimes, I might mix up the ester structures.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (CHOH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the CH3- group),
- COOCH3 (from the carboxylic ester),
- OH,
- And another CH3? No, wait, no. The structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

- CH2OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- Two H's?

Wait, wait, that can't be. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH2COOCH3,
- CH2OH,
- And two H's?

Wait, that can't be right because if the central carbon is CH2, then it's connected to two CH2 groups and two H's, which would make it CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, but then the central carbon would have two CH2 groups and two H's, making it a CH2 group, not a chiral center.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me count again.

Propanoic acid is:

Carboxylic acid group (COOH) on carbon 1.

Carbon 2: CH2 group.

Carbon 3: CH3.

So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have OH on carbon 2.

So, structure is:

COOH (C1) - CH(OH) (C2) - CH3 (C3).

So, the ester would be:

COOCH3 (C1) - CH(OH) (C2) - CH3 (C3).

So, the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- COOCH3 (C1),
- OH,
- CH3 (C3),
- And another CH group (since it's a CH(OH) group, which would have two CH3 groups? No, wait, no. The C2 is CH(OH), so the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH(OH)
|
CH3

Wait, no, wait, the structure is:

COOCH3 is on C1, connected to C2 which is CH(OH), connected to C3 which is CH3.

So, C2 is CH(OH), meaning it has single bonds to C1 (COOCH3), C3 (CH3), and an OH group. So, the substituents on C2 are:

- COOCH3,
- CH3,
- OH,
- and a hydrogen.

Because, otherwise, the structure wouldn't be correct. So, C2 is connected to four different groups: COOCH3, CH3, OH, and H.

Therefore, C2 is a chiral center, making the molecule capable of optical isomerism.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can show optical isomerism.

So, part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is option B.

Putting it all together:

A is benzoquinone (doesn't tautomerize), B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism).

Looking at the options, option B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, the correct answer is option B.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and a shift of electrons between a carbonyl group and an adjacent carbon. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has a benzene ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring and have only one hydrogen each. These hydrogens are not enolizable due to the rigidity of the aromatic system, making tautomerism impossible.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each ketone is flanked by two CH₂ groups, which have enolizable hydrogens. Therefore, it can undergo tautomerism.

Thus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CHOH-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂. The carbons in the double bond are not chiral centers because they are bonded to identical groups (two COOCH₃ groups or two hydrogens). Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

### Final Answer
From the analysis:
- **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism).
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).

The correct option is **B**.

**Answer: B**
