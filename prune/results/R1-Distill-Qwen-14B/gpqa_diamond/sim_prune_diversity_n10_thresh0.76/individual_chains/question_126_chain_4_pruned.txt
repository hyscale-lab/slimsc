Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's break it down step by step.

The question involves two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II, each starting with a different compound. After both reactions are done, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. The question is about how many peaks we'd see in each case.

First, I'll need to figure out what each reaction does.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce carbonyl groups. Hexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. When reduced, that ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. So, the product from Reaction I should be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait—what about the stereochemistry? The starting material was an S configuration. LAH is a strong reducing agent, but does it affect the stereochemistry? I think LAH typically gives a syn addition in the case of ketones. Wait, no, ketones are reduced to secondary alcohols, and since the starting ketone is a single chiral center, the reduction shouldn't change the configuration because the ketone isn't a stereocenter. Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the 5-methoxy is a substituent on the carbon adjacent to the ketone. Wait, the structure is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2OCH3? Wait, maybe not. Let me visualize the structure. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2COCH2CH2CH3. But in this case, the 5 position is substituted with a methoxy group. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3. Wait, no, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. But in this case, the 5 position has a methoxy group. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3. Wait, that can't be right. Let me count the carbons. Hexan-3-one is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH2-OCH3
Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, maybe the structure is more like:

(CH2)2-C(O)-(CH2)2-OCH3? Because hexan-3-one is (S)-5-methoxy.

So the molecule is CH2CH2-C(O)-(CH2)2-OCH3, and the configuration is S. When reduced with LAH, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. LAH is a strong enough reducing agent to break the C=O, adding two hydrogens across the double bond. The hydrogen adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the hydride (from the LAH) adds to the oxygen? Or wait, no—LAH (LiAlH4) typically reduces ketones to secondary
