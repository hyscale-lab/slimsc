Okay, so I need to figure out how many distinct hydrogen signals are in the NMR spectrum of product 4. Let's walk through each step of the reaction.

First, acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Oh right, bromine with pyridine is a typical bromination using the Hinsberg reaction? Or wait, acetic anhydride is present. Oh, wait, I think when acetic acid is treated with bromine in presence of pyridine and acetic anhydride, it's a substitution reaction. Acetic acid has an -OH group. The bromine probably replaces the OH with a Br, so product 1 would be acetyl bromide. Wait, acetic acid is CH3COOH. Replacing the OH with Br would give CH3COBr. So product 1 is acetyl bromide.

Next, product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is a catalyst. Heating an acyl bromide with ethanol in acid conditions—it's an acid-catalyzed nucleophilic acyl substitution. So the Br is replaced by an ethoxide group. So product 2 would be ethyl acetate. Because when acetyl bromide reacts with ethanol, it forms ethyl acetate, CH3COOEt.

Then, product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide. Sodium cyanide is a nucleophile. Ethyl acetate has an ester group. The reaction of esters with CN- typically leads to substitution. But wait, esters can undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution. So the CN would attack the carbonyl, replacing the OR group. So product 3 would be CH3COCN (acyl cyanide) and ethanol? Or wait, what's the exact reaction? Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution, replacing the ester oxygen with CN. So the product is CH3CO-N≡C? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The ester is CH3CO-OEt. When treated with CN-, it would substitute the OEt group with CN. So the product is CH3CO-CN, which is acyl cyanide.

Now, product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane. Sodium hydride is a strong base. So first, perhaps the cyanide is deprotonated? Wait, the structure of product 3 is CH3CO-CN. The alpha hydrogens (the CH3 part) would be acidic because the adjacent carbonyl groups stabilize the deprotonated form. So sodium hydride would deprotonate the alpha hydrogens, making a strong base. Then, 1,5-dibromopentane is present. Dibromopentane has two Br atoms on a five-carbon chain. So when the enolate is formed, it could attack the dibromopentane. Hmm, but wait, dibromopentane can act as an alkylating agent. So the enolate has negative charge on the alpha carbon, which would attack the dibromopentane. Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane is BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So when the enolate attacks, which end does it attack?

Wait, the enolate is from CH3CO-CN. So the enolate would have the structure -CH2-CO-CN, with a negative charge on the CH2. So when it attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, perhaps a double alkylation occurs. Because sodium hydride is in excess, so maybe two equivalents of the alkylating agent are used. So each alpha carbon (the CH3 in acetyl cyanide) would get two alkyl groups added.

Wait, let's think again. The initial structure is CH3-CO-CN. The alpha position is the methyl group attached to the carbonyl. When deprotonated, the enolate would be [CH2-]-CO-CN. Then, when 1,5-dibromopentane is present, which has Br on each end of a five-carbon chain. So the enolate could attack one of the Br atoms. Then, after the first alkylation, we have CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- attached. Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane is Br(CH2)4CH2Br. So each Br is on a CH2 group.

Wait, but when the enolate attacks, it would substitute one Br. Then, after the first substitution, the enolate would still have a negative charge, and may attack another molecule of dibromopentane.

Wait, but the starting enolate is CH2- CO-CN. The first alkylation would add a pentyl group (from the dibromopentane) to the alpha position. So perhaps after two alkylations, the structure becomes CH2-(CH2)4CH2-CO-CN? Or wait, maybe each Br is replaced, but that's not possible because the dibromopentane has two
