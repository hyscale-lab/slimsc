Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, first, I should recall what Grubbs catalyst does. Grubbs is a type of transition metal catalyst used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. Specifically, I think it's a ring-closing metathesis or maybe a ring-opening, but wait, wait. Grubbs is mainly used for ring-closing metathesis. Oh right, but sometimes it can also do other things like cross metathesis.

Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent means five carbons. 1-ene is a double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH₂CH3? Wait no, wait. Let's count. 3-methylpent-1-ene: The main chain is five carbons with a double bond starting at C1. So positions are 1,2,3,4,5. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But with a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, no, perhaps it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but wait, that makes sense. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH₂CH3? Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 3-methylpent-1-ene: The main chain is five carbons, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. There's a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. So that's the structure.

But wait, the compound is racemic, meaning it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. But since
