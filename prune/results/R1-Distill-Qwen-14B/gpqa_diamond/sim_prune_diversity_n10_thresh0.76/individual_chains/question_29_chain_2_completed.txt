Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate this compound by using EMS mutagenesis. They sequenced the target gene in the mutants and found some changes in the first exon.

The intact gene sequence is provided, along with four mutants (1-4). I need to determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, so the gene's structure is important here. Since the gene has exons and introns, the exons are the coding regions, right? So mutations in exons can affect the protein product, while intron mutations usually don't unless it's in a splice site.

The question says the changes are in the first exon area. So the mutations are likely in exons, possibly leading to a change in the amino acid sequence, which could disrupt the function of the compound.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different alteration. Let's break down each one.

The intact gene sequence is:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Compare to the intact gene, let's see where it changes. Looking at the first few nucleotides:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG C (Wait, maybe I should look more carefully.)

Wait, perhaps aligning the sequences would help. Let's write out a small part.

Intact: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, so from the start, the intact has TTTCTCGCT, and mutant1 has TCTACGCT. Let me count the letters.

Intact: positions 7-14: C T C G C T G G
Mutant1: T A C G C T G G ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each nucleotide.

Alternatively, maybe the change is a substitution. Let's look at the exact point where the change occurs.

Wait, the intact sequence is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC... 

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

Looking at the start: Intact has TTTCTCGCT, and Mutant1 has TTCTACGCT.

Wait, let's count the letters:

Intact: 1 ATG 2 TTT 3 CTC 4 GCT 5 GGT... 

Wait maybe the change is in the first exon, so perhaps it's an early substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about how each mutation affects the amino acid sequence. Because if a mutation causes a frameshift or a stop codon, it could disrupt the protein.

Wait, but the question says the gene consists of five exons and four introns, so the introns would have been spliced out. So the exons are in order, but perhaps the mutations are in the coding regions.

But the changes in the mutants are in the first exon. So any mutation in the first exon could affect the beginning of the protein.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
Compared to intact, let's see. The first part: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

So in the first part, the intact has TTCTCGC, and mutant1 has TTCTACG.

Wait, perhaps I should write out the nucleotides one by one.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Wait, that's the first part broken down into triplets (codons), but wait, the gene is in the 5' to 3' direction, so the first codon is ATG, then TTT, etc.

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA ... TGA

Wait, let me write out the first few codons for each mutant.

Intact gene:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant1:
ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So the third codon in mutant1 is CTA instead of CTC. Let's see what each codon codes for.

In the intact gene, the third codon is CTC, which is Leucine (CTC is Leu). In mutant1, it's CTA, which is also Leucine (CTA is also Leu). So that's a silent mutation—no change in amino acid.

Next codon: GCT in intact is Ala, and in mutant1 it's CGC. GCT is Ala (64), CGC is Arginine (63). So that's a change from Ala to Arg.

So in the mutant1, the fourth codon changes from GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg). So the amino acid changes from Ala to Arg. That's a substitution, but not a frameshift.

Mutant2:

ATG TTT CT AAG C TGG TAC TTCT ... etc. Wait, let me see:

Mutant2's sequence: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

Wait, perhaps the codons are:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TTCT ...

So the third codon is CTA (Leu, same as mutant1), fourth is AGC (Ser), whereas in the intact gene, the fourth codon was GCT (Ala). So in mutant2, the fourth codon changes from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser). So that's a substitution from Ala to Ser.

Mutant3:

Looking at the sequence:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the first few codons: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC T...

Wait, let's break it into triplets.

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), etc.

In the intact gene, after ATG TTT, the next codon was CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), etc.

So in mutant3, the third codon is TTA (Leu), which is a substitution from CTC (Leu) in the intact gene. So same amino acid, no change. But the fourth codon is CGC (Arg) instead of GCT (Ala). So similar to Mutant1, but then the fifth codon: the fifth in intact is GGT (Gly), in mutant3 it's GGT (same), but next codon is TGT (Cys) versus the intact's ACT (Thr). Because in intact, the fifth is GGT, then ACT, then TCT.

Wait, no. Let me check:

The intact gene after the first few codons is: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So the fifth codon is GGT (Gly), sixth is ACT (Thr), seventh is TCT (Ser), etc.

Mutant3's sequence: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC T...

So the fifth codon is TGG (Trp), sixth is TGT (Cys), which is a change from ACT (Thr) to CAC (His?) Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the sixth codon in mutant3 is CAC. Because after TGG comes TGT, then CAC?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to write out more of the sequence.

Intact gene:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant3:
ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Wait, so the third codon in mutant3 is TTA (Leu), same as third codon in intact (CTC is Leu). So same amino acid.

Fourth codon in mutant3 is CGC (Arg) instead of GCT (Ala). So that's a substitution.

Fifth codon is TGG (Trp) instead of GGT (Gly). So Gly becomes Trp. That's a big change.

Sixth codon in mutant3 is CAC (His) instead of ACT (Thr). So Thr to His.

So this introduces multiple changes. But wait, the question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. So perhaps a mutation causing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) would eliminate the protein, so the compound won't be made.

Alternatively, perhaps a missense mutation inactivates the enzyme that produces the compound.

Looking at the options, I need to see which mutation leads to a change that disrupts the gene function.

Mutant4:

Sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking it down:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

So the codons are:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TAC ( Tyr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

Comparing to the intact gene:

After ATG TTT, the next codon in intact was CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), etc.

In mutant4, the third codon is TTA (Leu), same as in mutant3. So same third amino acid.

Fourth codon is CGC (Arg), as in mutant3. So change from GCT (Ala) to Arg.

Fifth codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of GGT (Gly). So Gly becomes Tyr.

Sixth codon is TCT (Ser), which in the intact gene is ACT (Thr) at that position. So Thr to Ser.

Hmm, but how do these mutations affect the protein?

The question is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So perhaps a frameshift would cause a premature stop codon, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking at the mutations, I need to see if any cause a frameshift. Frameshifts occur due to insertions or deletions of nucleotides that aren't multiples of three. Let's check each mutant.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant1: The length seems the same as the intact gene. No insertions or deletions. It's a substitution.

Same for Mutant2: same length.

Mutant3: The sequence I see is a bit different. Let me look.

Intact: ... TACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant3: ... TGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Wait, wait, the intact has TACTTCT, and mutant3 has TGTCACT.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the lengths. Let me count the number of nucleotides.

Intact gene: The exact length isn't given, but let's assume each line is same length.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact: ...GGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant3: ...GGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Wait, perhaps the number of nucleotides is the same because the changes are substitutions, not insertions or deletions. So all the mutations are substitution mutations, no frameshift.

So, none of them cause a frameshift. Therefore, the possible outcome is missense mutations, which change the amino acids.

Now, looking for a mutation that creates a premature stop codon (nonsense), which would truncate the protein. That could inactivate the gene product, thus eliminating the compound.

Looking at the sequences, I need to see if any of the mutant sequences introduce a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) earlier in the sequence.

The original gene ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So in the given sequences, the end is the same.

But let's look for any occurrence of a stop codon earlier.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: The first few codons are ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC etc. No obvious stop codons in the beginning. The sequence continues.

Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC ... Again, no early stop codons.

Mutant3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TCT ... No stop codons.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT ... Hmm, let me check each codon.

Mutant4's fifth codon is TAC (Tyr). The sixth is TCT (Ser). Then GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc. No stops in the beginning.

Wait, but perhaps one of the mutations leads to a stop codon in an earlier exon.

Wait, looking at the first part:

Mutant4's sequence is:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Intact has:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

So in mutant4, the fifth codon is TAC (Tyr) where the intact has ACT (Thr). So A becomes T (assuming the original is ACT). Hmm, wait, perhaps not. Wait, in the intact, the fifth codon after ATG TTT is CTC. Let me get this right.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a nonsense mutation after the first few codons.

Wait, another approach: in the given sequences, the reading frame continues beyond the given part. So perhaps a stop codon occurs somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps a mutation creates a stop codon in the first exon.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAACAT...

Wait, the sixth codon in Mutant4 is TCT (Ser), seventh is GTG (Val), eighth is GAT (Asp), ninth is GAA (Glu), etc.

Wait, but let me look at each codon in Mutant4:

1. ATG (start)
2. TTT (Phe)
3. TTA (Leu)
4. CGC (Arg)
5. TAC (Tyr)
6. TCT (Ser)
7. GTG (Val)
8. GAT (Asp)
9. GAA (Glu)
10. CAT (His)
11. ATT (Ile)
12. TAT (Tyr)
13. TGT (Cys)
14. CGT (Arg)
... and so on.

No stop codons in the first 14 codons. So it's unlikely that any of these mutations have introduced a premature stop codon in the initial part.

But wait, perhaps in Exon 1, the length is such that a mutation leads to a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutations cause a frameshift, but earlier I thought all are substitutions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking for indels. Let me check each mutant's sequence length.

The intact sequence is:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Same length as the intact? Let's see.

Each line has the same number of characters, so no insertions or deletions. So no frameshifts.

So all mutations are point mutations, leading to substitutions.

Now, the question is, which substitution leads to the elimination of the anti-nutritional compound. For that, the gene product (protein) needs to be nonfunctional.

One way is if the mutation changes an amino acid in a critical region, leading to loss of function.

But without knowing the exact function of the gene product, it's hard to say which substitution is critical.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations leads to a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) in the first exon, so the protein is truncated early.

Wait, let's check each mutant for any occurrence of a stop codon in the initial part.

Looking at Mutant1's sequence:

ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA ...

The first few codons: no stops.

Mutant2:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA ...

No stops.

Mutant3:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

No stops.

Mutant4:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, the fifth codon is TAC (Tyr). Next codon is TCT (Ser), then GTG (Val), then GAT (Asp). No stops yet.

Wait, looking further into the sequences. The question says the changes are in the first exon area. So perhaps the mutation is in a region that, when altered, either disrupts the enzyme's active site or causes a premature stop.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the best bet is to look for a mutation that changes a codon to a stop.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation creates a stop codon in the first exon.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1:
The sequence continues, no stop codon in the initial part.

Mutant2: same as above.

Mutant3: same.

Mutant4: Let me check again. The fifth codon is TAC (Tyr), sixth is TCT (Ser), seventh is GTG (Val), etc. No stops.

Wait, maybe in the original question, it's not the entire sequence, and perhaps the first exon ends before some point where a stop codon could be introduced.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is a mutation that leads to a nonfunctional protein by changing a critical amino acid.

But without knowing which amino acid is critical, it's hard to choose.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about disrupting a splice site, but the mutations are in the exons.

Wait, but the question says the changes are in the first exon area, which suggests exons, so splicing shouldn't be an issue for these mutations.

Wait, another approach: look for a mutation that creates or removes a restriction site, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation causes a loss of function by disrupting the reading frame, but earlier analysis suggests no frameshifts.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the exons. Since it's a gene with five exons, the first exon is perhaps the beginning of the coding sequence.

If a mutation in the first exon introduces a premature stop codon, the protein would be shorter, possibly nonfunctional.

Wait, looking again at Mutant4:

The sequence is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking into codons:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, the fifth codon is TAC (Tyr), sixth is TCT (Ser), seventh is GTG (Val), etc.

No stop codons in the first part. But wait, the eighth codon is GAT (Asp), ninth is GAA (Glu), tenth is CAT (His), eleventh is ATT (Ile), twelfth is TAT (Tyr), thirteenth is TGT (Cys), fourteenth is CGT (Arg), and so on. So no stop codon until the end.

But wait, perhaps in the first exon, the mutation introduces a stop codon. Let me count the number of nucleotides in the first exon.

Assuming that the first exon is the beginning part, including up to a certain point. For example, the first exon might end after the 15th codon or something. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about which mutation would most likely disrupt the gene's function.

Another approach: the anti-nutritional compound is synthesized by the gene's product. So if the gene is nonfunctional, the compound won't be made.

The most effective way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene's function. That could be done by a frameshift leading to a premature stop, or by a missense mutation in a critical region.

But since all the mutations are substitutions, perhaps the best bet is to look for a mutation that changes a critical amino acid.

But without knowing the gene's function, perhaps the best way is to look for a mutation that changes a codon to a stop.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence again:

Mutant4: ...TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, the 5th codon is TAC (Tyr), 6th is TCT (Ser), 7th is GTG (Val), 8th is GAT (Asp), 9th is GAA (Glu). So all are standard amino acids.

Mutant3's sequence:

...CGC TGG TGT CAC TCT...

So after CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), TCT (Ser).

No stop codons.

Mutant1 and 2: same.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the sequences.

Looking at the given sequences, perhaps one of the mutants introduces a stop codon in the first exon.

Wait, let me see: the stop codon is TGA in the original sequence, which is at the end. So all the given sequences end with TGA. So any stop codon would have to occur before that.

Looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA in the middle.

Looking at Mutant4:

The sequence after the initial part: ...TAC TCT GTG GAT GAACAT...

So after TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu)...

Wait, GAA is Glu, next codon is CAT (His), then ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), etc.

No TGA or other stops in the middle.

Hmm, perhaps none of the mutations create an early stop codon. So the only way is to have a missense mutation that disrupts the function.

In that case, which mutation is more likely to cause a significant change?

Mutant3 changes several codons:

Fourth codon: CGC (Arg) instead of GCT (Ala)
Fifth codon: TGG (Trp) instead of GGT (Gly)
Sixth codon: CAC (His) instead of ACT (Thr)

These are multiple changes. Perhaps a Gly to Trp substitution is significant.

But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps a mutation leading to a premature stop is better. But I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Mutant4's sequence.

Mutant4's sequence after ATG is:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, the fifth codon is TAC (Tyr), sixth is TCT (Ser), seventh is GTG (Val), eighth is GAT (Asp), ninth is GAA (Glu), tenth is CAT (His), eleventh is ATT (Ile), twelfth is TAT (Tyr), thirteenth is TGT (Cys), fourteenth is CGT (Arg), fifteenth is TAA (stop codon?).

Wait, no, the sequence ends with TGA. Let me check the end.

Wait, in all the given sequences, the last part is ...TGA. So the stop codon is at the end.

So in Mutant4, the sequence ends with TGA, which is the same as the original. So the stop codon is at the same place.

So, back to the initial question. Without any premature stop codons, the mutations are missense. So which mutation is likely to cause a loss of function?

Perhaps a nonsense mutation would be the best, but none of the mutants have that. So perhaps the best option is to have a frameshift, but since none have that, perhaps the correct answer is a mutation that disrupts the reading frame in another way, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the mutation is in a splice site. But the question says the change is in the first exon, which is part of the coding region, so splicing wouldn't be affected.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's look for a mutation that changes a start codon.

Wait, all the mutants start with ATG, so the start codon is intact. So methionine is still the first amino acid.

Wait, perhaps a mutation in the first codon, but in all cases, the first codon is ATG.

Wait, wait, let me look at each mutant's first part again.

Mutant1's sequence:

ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG...

So no change in the start.

Mutant2: same start.

Mutant3: same.

Mutant4: same.

So all have ATG as the start.

Another idea: perhaps the mutation disrupts the promoter region. But the question says the mutations are in the target gene's exon, so the promoter is upstream and probably not affected.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a new splice site, but again, the question says the mutations are in the exons.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that leads to a nonfunctional protein by disrupting the structure.

But without knowing which amino acids are critical, it's hard to choose. But perhaps the correct answer is the one that introduces a stop codon, but I don't see any.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look at the sequences again.

Mutant4:

The sequence is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at the fifth codon, which is TAC (Tyr). The next codon is TCT (Ser). Then GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc.

Wait, perhaps in the mutant4, there's a change that causes a frameshift. Wait, no, the length is same.

Another thought: perhaps the mutation in mutant4 leads to a stop codon in the first exon. Let's count the codons in the first exon.

Suppose the first exon ends after, say, 10 codons. Then, any stop within that would be early.

But without knowing the exon boundaries, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D) Mutant4 because it has the most changes, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

But I'm not fully confident. Let me think again.

Option D is Mutant4. Looking at its sequence:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

The fifth codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of ACT (Thr). So a change from Thr to Tyr in the fifth position. Then, sixth codon is TCT (Ser) instead of ACT (Thr) in the original. So at position six, another substitution.

Wait, but in the original, the fifth codon is ACT, sixth is TCT.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me compare the intact and Mutant4.

Intact: After ATG TTT, the next codons are CTC, GCT, GGT, ACT, TCT, GTG...

Mutant4: After ATG TTT, the next codons are TTA, CGC, TAC, TCT, GTG...

So, the third codon in mutant4 is TTA (Leu) instead of CTC (Leu). So same amino acid.

Fourth codon: CGC (Arg) instead of GCT (Ala). Change.

Fifth codon: TAC (Tyr) instead of GGT (Gly). Big change.

Sixth codon: TCT (Ser) instead of ACT (Thr). Change.

So, two changes: Ala to Arg, Gly to Tyr, Thr to Ser.

But how does that affect the protein? Without knowing, it's hard to say which is more disruptive.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to choose the mutant that has a deletion or insertion causing a frameshift, but I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the exons and introns. Since the gene has five exons, and the mutation is in the first exon, perhaps the mutation is in a region that, when altered, disrupts the protein structure more severely.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is the one where a crucial part of the gene is altered, such as the start codon or the beginning of the coding region.

But all the mutations retain the start codon.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the mutation introduces a stop codon due to a change in the reading frame. But that would require a frameshift, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 leads to a change in a critical region, such as the active site of the enzyme.

But without knowing the specific function, perhaps the best way is to look for the mutation that changes the most nucleotides or creates the most drastic amino acid changes.

Mutant3 has two changes in the early part: CGC (Arg) instead of GCT (Ala), and TGG (Trp) instead of GGT (Gly). That's a big change.

Mutant4 has changes to Arg, Tyr, and Ser.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a deletion or insertion, but earlier analysis shows all are substitutions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to think of what each mutation does.

The question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. So the gene product must be nonfunctional.

Mutant2 has a substitution from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser), which is a less drastic change compared to others.

Mutant1: Ala to Arg.

Mutant3: Gly to Trp, Thr to His.

Mutant4: Gly to Tyr, Thr to Ser.

Which of these changes is more likely to disrupt function? Well, Gly to Trp is a big change. Gly is a small, non-reactive residue, while Trp is a large, aromatic residue. That could disrupt the structure.

Similarly, His is a charged residue, which could change the protein's properties significantly.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is the one that introduces a premature stop codon, but I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of codons.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, a codon is changed to TAA, which is a stop.

Looking again at Mutant4:

The sequence is ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So at the fifth codon, TAC is Tyr.

No, TAC isn't a stop. The next codon is TCT (Ser). Then GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc.

No stop codons early on.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it's the only one that has a change in both the fourth and fifth codons, leading to a significant alteration in the protein structure early on.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the fifth codon becomes TAC (Tyr) from the original GGT (Gly). That might disrupt a critical region.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, looking back, the question says the anti-nutritional compound makes it impossible to use the cultivar for food. So the goal is to disrupt the gene so the compound isn't made.

So, if the gene product is nonfunctional, the compound isn't produced.

The most straightforward way is a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon. But none of the mutations cause a frameshift.

Alternatively, a nonsense mutation within the first exon would do that. But again, I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the sequences. Let me look again.

Mutant4's sequence is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at the first few nucleotides after the start:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG...

So, the third codon is TTA (Leu) instead of CTC (Leu). So same amino acid.

Fourth codon: CGC (Arg) instead of GCT (Ala). So a change from Ala to Arg.

Fifth codon: TAC (Tyr) instead of GGT (Gly). So Gly to Tyr.

Sixth codon: TCT (Ser) instead of ACT (Thr). So Thr to Ser.

So, the fourth, fifth, and sixth codons are altered. This could lead to significant changes in the protein structure early on, potentially disrupting its function.

In contrast, Mutant3 changes the fifth codon from GGT (Gly) to TGG (Trp), which is a larger residue, and the sixth codon from ACT (Thr) to CAC (His), which is a charged residue. That could also disrupt function.

But without knowing which is more critical, it's hard to choose between Mutant3 and Mutant4.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant2. Let's look.

Mutant2's sequence: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TTCT ...

So, third codon is CTA (Leu), same as the original CTC (Leu).

Fourth codon is AGC (Ser) instead of GCT (Ala). So Ala to Ser.

That's a substitution, but perhaps less drastic than others.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is Mutant1 because it changes the fourth codon from GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg), which is a significant change.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D) Mutant4 because it has the most changes in the early codons, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Alternatively, perhaps it's Mutant3 because it has a Trp in place of Gly, which could disrupt the structure.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct answer is the one that introduces a stop codon in the first exon.

Wait, looking again at Mutant4's sequence.

After the start: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So, the fifth codon is TAC (Tyr), sixth is TCT (Ser), seventh is GTG (Val), eighth is GAT (Asp), ninth is GAA (Glu), etc.

No stop codons in the initial part. Only the last is TGA.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it causes a frameshift, but earlier analysis suggests no frameshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it's the only one where the fifth codon is changed to TAC (Tyr) from GGT (Gly), which is a significant change.

I think I've spent a lot of time trying to figure this out. Based on the given options, the most likely correct answer is either Mutant1 or Mutant4. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the question says the changes are in the first exon area. So perhaps the mutation is in a region that, when altered, disrupts the gene's function.

Mutant4 changes the fifth codon from GGT (Gly) to TAC (Tyr). Gly is a small, non-reactive residue, and Tyr is a bulky, hydroxyl-containing residue. This substitution could disrupt the protein structure.

Additionally, the sixth codon changes from ACT (Thr) to TCT (Ser). Both are similar, but Thr is a bit bulkier. So less drastic.

But the fifth codon change is more significant.

So, perhaps Mutant4 is the best option.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or by altering critical amino acids in a way that renders the protein nonfunctional.

### Key Observations:
1. **Gene Structure**: The gene consists of five exons and four introns. The mutations are located in the first exon, which is part of the coding region.
2. **Sequence Comparison**: Each mutant sequence is compared to the intact gene to identify nucleotide changes and their corresponding amino acid alterations.

### Analysis of Each Mutant:
#### **Mutant 1**:
- Codon changes:  
  - CTC (Leu) → CTA (Leu) (silent mutation)  
  - GCT (Ala) → CGC (Arg) (change from Ala to Arg)  
- No premature stop codons introduced. The mutation causes a substitution but does not likely result in a nonfunctional protein.

#### **Mutant 2**:
- Codon changes:  
  - CTC (Leu) → CTA (Leu) (silent mutation)  
  - GCT (Ala) → AGC (Ser) (change from Ala to Ser)  
- No premature stop codons introduced. The substitution is less drastic compared to other mutants.

#### **Mutant 3**:
- Codon changes:  
  - CTC (Leu) → TTA (Leu) (silent mutation)  
  - GCT (Ala) → CGC (Arg) (change from Ala to Arg)  
  - GGT (Gly) → TGG (Trp) (change from Gly to Trp)  
  - ACT (Thr) → CAC (His) (change from Thr to His)  
- Multiple substitutions occur, including a significant change from Gly (small, non-reactive) to Trp (large, aromatic). This could disrupt the protein structure and function.

#### **Mutant 4**:
- Codon changes:  
  - CTC (Leu) → TTA (Leu) (silent mutation)  
  - GCT (Ala) → CGC (Arg) (change from Ala to Arg)  
  - GGT (Gly) → TAC (Tyr) (change from Gly to Tyr)  
  - ACT (Thr) → TCT (Ser) (change from Thr to Ser)  
- The mutation introduces significant changes: Gly → Tyr (a small, non-reactive residue replaced by a bulky, hydroxyl-containing residue) and Thr → Ser (a less drastic change). These alterations could disrupt the protein's structure and function.

### Conclusion:
None of the mutants introduce a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation). However, Mutant 4 introduces the most significant changes in the early codons, which are likely to disrupt the protein's structure and function. These changes make Mutant 4 the most probable candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.
