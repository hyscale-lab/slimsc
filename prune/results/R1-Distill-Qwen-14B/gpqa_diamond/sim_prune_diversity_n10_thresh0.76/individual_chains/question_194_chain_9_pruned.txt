Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

The spins are S1, S2, S3, and each can be +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to calculate Z by considering all possible states and their corresponding energies.

Wait, each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. Right, but maybe there's a smarter way to calculate this without enumerating all 8 possibilities. Alternatively, perhaps I can group the states based on their energies.

Let me think about the energy expression. E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's denote each term as S_i S_j. Each S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. Because S_i is ±1 and S_j is ±1, their product is 1 if they're the same, and -1 if different.

So the sum inside the brackets is the sum of three terms, each ±1. The total sum can vary depending on how many of the S_i S_j terms are +1 or -1.

Let me find the possible values of the sum (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each term can be +1 or -1, the sum can range from -3 to +3. But I need to find how many combinations give each possible sum.

Wait, another approach: perhaps instead of considering all possible S1, S2, S3, I can find the possible values of the energy and then count the number of states for each energy.

Because E is proportional to the sum of S_i S_j terms, the energies will be multiples of J. Let's compute all possible values of (sum S_i S_j) and how many states give each sum.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to realize that for three spins, the system's Hamiltonian is similar to the Ising model for a triangle. The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is the sum of all pairs
