Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on immunology, but I'll think through it.

The setup: They tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. So, the mice swallowed these proteins. Then, they used in vivo imaging and saw that some GFP fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Others got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. So, not all of them made it to where the immune response happens.

Wait, secondary lymphoid organs include things like Peyer's patches, which are in the intestines. So, the ones that did make it probably ended up in these patches. Then they isolated the proliferating cell population from the fluorescent Peyer patches. They sequenced the variable heavy chain gene and found high variability. So, what's happening here?

The question is asking which process is taking place. The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Hmm. Let's think about each option.

VDJ recombination is part of the immune system's way of generating diversity in T-cell receptors. It's during the development of T cells in the thymus, right? So that's probably not the case here because we're dealing with B cells, perhaps, since they're talking about variable heavy chains.

Class switching recombination is when B cells change the class of antibody they produce (like from IgM to IgG), and it involves recombination at the heavy chain locus. But this process doesn't create new variable regions, just changes the class. So if the variable heavy chains are showing high variability, that's more about the variable regions, not the class. So maybe not C.

Complement activation is about the complement system's role in immune response, like opsonizing pathogens or causing lysis. But I don't think that directly leads to variability in the variable regions of antibodies. So probably not B.

That leaves A) somatic hypermutation. Somatic hypermutation occurs in B cells during the immune response, especially in secondary lymphoid tissues like Peyer's patches. This process introduces mutations in the variable regions of the B cell receptors, leading to increased diversity among the antibodies produced. The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene they observed in the sequencing makes me think this is happening.

Wait, but why are the GFP-tagged proteins present in the Peyer's patches? Oh, because Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. So when the mice were given the rotavirus via oral gavage, some of the proteins probably got taken up by the immune cells in these patches.

The fact that some GFP was destroyed by stomach acid and some by mucus suggests that not all proteins made it into the Peyer's patches. But those that did would have been processed by antigen-presenting cells, perhaps. Then, the B cells in the patches would have been activated by these antigens.

When B cells are activated, they start dividing, and during this proliferation, they undergo somatic hypermutation. This process is a mechanism to increase the diversity of the antibodies, allowing for a more effective immune response. So the high variability in the variable regions supports this.

So the process taking place is somatic hypermutation, which is option A.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Some GFP fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, and some proteins are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Fluorescent Peyer's patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene reveals high variability. The question asks which process is responsible for this variability.

- **Option A: Somatic hypermutation**  
  This process occurs in B cells during the immune response, particularly in secondary lymphoid tissues like Peyer's patches. It introduces mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors, increasing antibody diversity. The observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene aligns with this mechanism.

- **Option B: Complement activation**  
  Complement activation involves the complement system's role in immune response, such as opsonization or pathogen lysis. However, it does not directly contribute to variability in the variable regions of antibodies, making this option unlikely.

- **Option C: Class switching recombination**  
  Class switching recombination changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions of the heavy chain. Since the question focuses on variability in the variable heavy chain gene, this option is not relevant.

- **Option D: VDJ recombination**  
  VDJ recombination generates diversity in T-cell receptors during T-cell development in the thymus. This process is unrelated to B cells or the variable heavy chain gene, making it an incorrect choice.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene observed in the experiment is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, a process that occurs in B cells during the immune response to increase antibody diversity. This aligns with the experimental setup and observations.

Answer: A
