Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectral data and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, sounds a bit challenging, but I'll take it slow.

First, let's look at the spectral data given. The compound has IR and 1H NMR data. Let's analyze each part.

Starting with the IR data: strong absorption bands between 3400â€“2500 cm-1. I remember that this region usually indicates the presence of X-H bonds. The strong absorption around 3400 could be from an -OH group, maybe in a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be due to an alkyne or an amine, but since there's also a peak at 1720 cm-1, which I think is characteristic of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester or acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have strong O-H stretches around 2500-3300 cm-1 as broad peaks. Oh, but the IR here says 3400-2500, which is a broader range. So maybe it's an -OH stretch. Also, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which makes me think of a carbonyl group. So, maybe a carboxylic acid. Because the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is around 1700 cm-1, or maybe a bit higher. Alternatively, it could be an ester, which also has a carbonyl around 1720.

Wait, but 1720 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids are usually lower, like 1700-1725. Hmm. So maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Wait, but the NMR data might help here.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: the signals are at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is probably an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. That would fit with the IR data. So, it's likely a carboxylic acid. So the compound is a benzoic acid derivative or something along those lines.

Looking at the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). A doublet for each suggests a para-substituted benzene ring, because the two protons each are split into doublets,
