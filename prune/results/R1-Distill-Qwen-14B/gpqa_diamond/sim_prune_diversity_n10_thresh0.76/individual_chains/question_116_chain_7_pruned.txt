Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's start by breaking down the question step by step.

Alright, the first part is about Compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the integration tells me the number of protons, and the splitting tells me about neighboring protons. So for the triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H, that's probably a (CH3)2 group since 6 hydrogens mean two CH3 groups. And since it's a triplet, each of those CH3s must be adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, or maybe it's that each CH3 is next to a CH2, so the splitting is due to two neighboring protons.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H must be a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Because a quartet (which is n+1 where n=3) would imply they're next to a CH with three protons. Wait, no, quartet suggests each proton is next to a group with three equivalent protons. So, if it's a CH2, and the neighboring group is a CH2CH3, that would make sense. Wait, maybe it's a -CH2CH(CH3)2 structure or something else.

Wait, wait. Let's think about possible structures. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H is likely two equivalent CH3 groups. The quartet for 4H might be a CH2 group next to another CH2 group. For example, if I have a structure like CH2CH2CH3, no, wait that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group. Wait, diethyl groups could fit because each CH2CH3 would have a triplet, but wait, in that case, the ethyl groups would split into each other. Wait, no, if it's a diethyl ether, for example, the CH2CH3 groups would show up as triplets. But in this case, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet for 6H, which is two CH3 groups, so maybe the structure is something like (CH2CH3)2O or similar? Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group attached to something else.

Wait, another approach. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is 6H, so that's two CH3 groups. The quartet at 1.3 ppm is 4H, which is a CH2 group. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH2 attached to another CH2? Wait, maybe it's a neopentyl group or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, wait. Another thought: if the quartet is at 1.3 ppm, that's a bit upfield for a CH2 next to an electronegative group. Or maybe it's a geminal di-substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diethyl group attached to an oxygen or something else, but then the splitting could be due
