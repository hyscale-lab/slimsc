Okay, I'm trying to solve this statistical mechanics problem about the partition function for three spins. Hmm, let's see. So the system has three spins S1, S2, S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). But wait, each spin can be +1 or -1, so each spin has two states. For three spins, how many total states are there? Each spin is independent, so 2^3 = 8 possible states.

But maybe it's easier to approach this by considering the possible values of the energy E for each state. Because calculating each state's contribution individually might take a long time, especially since there are 8 states. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, because E depends on that.

Let me denote the sum as H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J H. Then, the Boltzmann factor becomes exp(β J H), because E = -J H → -β E = β J H.

Wait, no: Wait, E = -J H → exp(-β E) = exp(β J H). So each state contributes exp(β J H) to the partition function.

So I need to find all possible values of H and how many states give each H.

So what are the possible values of H? Let's think. H is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. Wait, no: If S_i and S_j are the same, S_i S_j = +1, else -1. So each product term is ±1.

But the sum H can vary. Let's think about possible H values. Let me consider all possible combinations.

Wait, for three spins, each being ±1, how can the sum H vary?

Let me think about each spin configuration and compute H.

Wait, maybe instead of enumerating all 8 possibilities, I can find a pattern or find the number of states leading to each H.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for three spins, the maximum and minimum possible H could be found.

Wait, each S_i is either +1 or -1. So each product S_i S_j is 1 if they're the same, -1 otherwise.

So H is the sum of three such terms.

What is the maximum possible value of H? Each term contributes 1, so H can be 3. The minimum would be if all terms are -1, so H = -3.

Wait no, wait. Let's see: Let's suppose all three spins are the same. For example, S1 = S2 = S3 = +1.

Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. So H=3.

Similarly, if all are -1, same thing. So H=3.

What about if two are +1 and one is -1?

Let’s say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So H = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Wait, that's H = -1.

Wait, another example: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. So H = (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1.

Hmm. Another case: two +1 and one -1.

Wait, but let's consider all possible cases. Alternatively, maybe it's better to find how many states lead to H=3, H=1, H=-1, H=-3.

Wait, that's possible?

Wait, when all spins are the same (all +1 or all -1), H=3. So number of states with H=3 is 2: all up or all down.

What about H=1? Let's see.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the sum H is equal to (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) all over 2. Because (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3), so S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1² + S2² + S3²) ] / 2.

Since each S_i is either +1 or -1, S_i²=1. So sum S1² + S2² + S3² =3. So H = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 -3 ] / 2.

So (S1 + S2 + S3) can take values like 3, 1, -1, -3. Because each S_i is ±1. So the sum S1 + S2 + S3 can be 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), or -3 (all -1).

Wait, let me compute that. So for S1 + S2 + S3:

- All +
