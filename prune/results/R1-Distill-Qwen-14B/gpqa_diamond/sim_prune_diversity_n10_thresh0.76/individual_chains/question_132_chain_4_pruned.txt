Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that a solution has a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. Their 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals (singlets) around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three signals around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

Hmm, let's break this down. The molecular formula is C10H14. Each compound in the mixture must have that formula. Let's check the options.

Looking at the options, each is a tetramethylbenzene except option C, which is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, wait. 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups attached to benzene. Let's calculate the molecular formula. Benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl is C2H5, so two ethyls would add 2*2=4 carbons and 2*(5) H's. Wait, but wait, each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl adds 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens, but since benzene already has 6 H, adding two ethyl groups would make the formula C8H10. Because benzene (6 C, 6 H) + 2*(2 C, 5 H) = 6+4=10 C, 6 + 10 H. Wait, 6 H from benzene, each ethyl has 5 H, so 2*5=10 H, but when attached, maybe some H's are lost? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Benzene has 6 H. Each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl has 2+3=5 H, but when attached to the ring, maybe the H on the benzene is replaced by the ethyl. So benzene has 6 H, but when substituting two H's with ethyl groups, the H count would be 6 -2 (since two H's are replaced) + 2*(2+3) = 6-2 + 10 = 14 H. So the formula is C8H10? Wait, no. Let me calculate it properly.

Each ethyl group is C2H5, but when attached as a substituent, it's -CH2CH3. So each ethyl adds two C and five H. So benzene is C6H6. Adding two ethyl groups gives C6 + 2*(C2) = C10? Wait no, wait. Wait, 6 C (benzene) plus two ethyl groups, each with 2 C: 6 + 2*2=10 C. Hydrogen: benzene has 6 H. Each ethyl is CH2CH3, which has 2+3=5 H.
