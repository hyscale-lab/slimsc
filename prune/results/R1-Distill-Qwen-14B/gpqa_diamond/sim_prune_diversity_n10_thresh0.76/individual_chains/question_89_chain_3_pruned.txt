Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step.

First, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). There's also an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Hmm. So, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, probably a ketone (since aldehydes usually have higher wavenumbers around 2800, but wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Aldehydes have strong absorption around 2820 and 2720 cm⁻¹ for the C-H stretch, and the carbonyl around 1710-1740. But in this case, the IR is at 1720, which aligns with a ketone, maybe.

So, KOH heated with a dibromide might lead to an elimination reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons of the adamantane structure. Heating with a strong base like KOH could cause dehydrohalogenation, eliminating HBr twice to form an alkene.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons? No, wait, 1,3-dibromo would be on non-adjacent carbons of the adamantane. Oh wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure. So, 1 and 3 positions are on opposite faces, I think. So when KOH is used with a dibromide, it could lead to a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene? Or maybe a ring-opening?

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could produce an epoxide. No, wait,
