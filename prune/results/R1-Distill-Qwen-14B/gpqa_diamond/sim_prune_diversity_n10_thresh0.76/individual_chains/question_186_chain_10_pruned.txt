Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, right? It typically involves 1,5-dienes. Let me think about the reaction mechanism. When a 1,5-diene undergoes Cope rearrangement, it forms another 1,5-diene but in a different structure.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. So the molecule has a bicyclic framework with a nitrogen atom. The substituents are a vinyl group at position 2 and a double bond at position 5. Let me draw this structure.

Norbornane has two rings: a five-membered and a six-membered ring? No, wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two bridgeheads. So the structure is like a norbornene with a double bond. Now, the double bond is at position 5, which is one of the bridge positions. The vinyl group is at position 2, so that's another bridgehead.

Since it's a bicyclic compound, the Cope rearrangement would involve the conjugated diene. Wait, the structure has a vinyl group (CHâ‚‚=CH-) attached to the bridgehead. So maybe the molecule has a conjugated diene
