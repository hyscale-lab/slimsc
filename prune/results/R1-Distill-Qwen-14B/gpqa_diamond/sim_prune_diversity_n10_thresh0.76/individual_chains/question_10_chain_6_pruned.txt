Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let's see what the options are.

The question lists four exoplanets, a, b, c, d. Each has different masses and radii or densities given. The options are A to D, each corresponding to one of these exoplanets. So I need to compare their densities and see which is the highest.

First, I should probably remember that density is mass divided by volume. So density = mass/volume. But for planets, the volume depends on the radius cubed because volume scales with radius^3. Oh wait, but if I know the mass and radius, I can compute density. Alternatively, sometimes the question gives the density directly.

Looking at the options:

a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius. So same as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So this planet's density is 5.5.

b) 2 Earth masses and density about 5.5. So wait, the question says the density is approximately 5.5, so that's straightforward. So this planet's density is 5.5, same as Earth.

c) Same composition as Earth, but 5 times more massive. Hmm, same composition usually implies same density. Because composition determines density. So if it's 5 times Earth's mass, but same density, that would mean the radius is larger. Because mass is density times volume, M = density * (4/3 π R³). So if M increases, R must increase if density is same.

d) Same composition as Earth, half the mass. Again, same as c but less mass. So same density as Earth, 5.5.

Wait, but the question is asking which has the highest density. So let's compare all options:

Option a: 5.5
Option b: 5.5
Option c: 5.5
Option d: 5.5

Wait, that can't be. Then all have same density except maybe for b, which is given.

Wait, no: Looking back, option a is Earth. So same as b's density. Option c says same composition, so same density as Earth. So all a, b, c, d have the same density as Earth except for maybe option b. Wait no, option b's density is given as 5.5, same as Earth.

Wait, but option b is a planet with 2 Earth masses and
