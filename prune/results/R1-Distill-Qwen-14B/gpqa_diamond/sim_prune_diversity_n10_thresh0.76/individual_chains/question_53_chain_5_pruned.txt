Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra.

First, the FTIR shows peaks for an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1740-1710 cm⁻¹, so that's a key point. So the compound must have an ester functional group.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals in total. Let's break down what each part means.

The aromatic-H signals: Two signals. So in the benzene ring, there are two different types of protons. Di-substituted rings can have two substituents, which can be either ortho, meta, or para. If it's para, the aromatic protons would be symmetrical, leading to fewer signals. Wait, but two signals for aromatic-H. So if the substituents are in the para positions, each substituent would have equivalent aromatic protons. For example, if it's para-substituted, the two substituents would each have equivalent H across the ring, leading to two sets of aromatic protons. So that makes sense.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are on a double bond, so maybe it's part of an ester group, like in an allyl ester or something? Or perhaps it's part of a substituent attached to the aromatic ring, like an ethyl group adjacent to a substituent.

Wait, the ester group is probably part of a substituent on the benzene ring. So maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with an ester substituent and another substituent. But wait, the question says it's di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring.

Wait, the ester group could be a side chain attached to one of the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a substituent that's attached to the ring. For example, maybe a methoxycarbonyl group or something like that.

So the other substituent might be an ethyl group or something else. Let's think about the NMR signals. The vinyl-H, which are probably on a double bond adjacent to an ester group. So perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester or something similar.

Looking at the NMR details: two vinyl-H signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. So maybe each vinyl proton is coupled with others. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, while a doublet of quartets suggests coupling with two sets of protons.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, something like OCH₂CH₂COO- or similar. Or maybe the substituent is an ethyl group with a double bond adjacent, leading to the vinyl protons.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a group like CH₂CH₂ group with a double bond, but I'm not sure. Let's
