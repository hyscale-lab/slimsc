Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking. It says, which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies? The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, regularization. That term sounds familiar from what I've studied about quantum field theory. Regularization is a technique used to deal with divergences, right? Divergences are those situations where the calculations give you infinite results, which don't make physical sense. So regularization is a way to handle these infinities, making the theory more manageable.

Wait, but not all theories need regularization. Let me think about each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's the theory of electricity and magnetism as described by Maxwell's equations, without quantum mechanics. Classical theories don't typically have the same issues with divergences that quantum theories do because they don't involve the same kind of infinities. But wait, do they have any divergences? Like in the case of point charges, the electric field becomes infinite at the charge's location. But in classical physics, do we need to regularize that?

Oh wait, in classical electrodynamics, those infinities are handled by the concept of charge density and maybe by considering distributions rather than point charges. Or perhaps by using renormalization techniques? No, wait, renormalization is a quantum field theory concept. So maybe in classical theories, these issues are handled differently, perhaps by considering the physical model more carefully, like using smoothed charge distributions instead of point charges.

But I'm a bit fuzzy on whether classical theories require regularization. Let me think about other options.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). I know that QED definitely requires regularization because it's a quantum field theory and it has loop diagrams that lead to divergent integrals. These divergences are handled through renormalization, which is closely related to regularization. So QED needs regularization, so option C is not the answer.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD deals with the strong force and has issues with things like the running coupling and confinement. I'm pretty sure that QCD calculations can also lead to divergences, so regularization is necessary here as well. So option B isn't the answer.

Option A is Superstring Theory. String theory is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity, and it's supposed to be a theory that doesn't have the same kind of divergences as traditional quantum field theories because it's a theory of strings instead of point particles. Strings have a different structure, so maybe the divergences are tamed. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Do string theories require regularization? Or do they handle things differently because of the higher-dimensional aspects or the way they quantize gravity?

Wait, I remember that in perturbative string theory, when you calculate loop diagrams, they actually don't have the same kind of divergences because the theory is background-dependent and perhaps the way the integrals are set up avoids certain infinities. Or maybe it's because the string theory has a higher number of
