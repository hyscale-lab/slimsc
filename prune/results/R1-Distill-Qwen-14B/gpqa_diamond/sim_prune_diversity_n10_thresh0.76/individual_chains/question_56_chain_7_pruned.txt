Okay, so I have this question about hydrogen atom transitions, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I remember that dipole transitions involve changes in the orbital angular momentum, and certain selection rules apply. The options are given with different transition routes and probabilities.

First, I need to recall the selection rules for dipole transitions. I think the main ones are: delta l = ±1, and delta m = 0, ±1. Oh wait, and for electrons in hydrogen, the principal quantum number n can change by ±1, but since we're going from n=3 to n=1, that's a change of 2. So it's a two-step process because each dipole transition can only change n by 1.

So the decay must occur in two steps. The first step would be from n=3 to n=2, and the second from n=2 to n=1. But wait, the question says two dipole transitions, which makes sense because each transition only allows a change of Δn = ±1.

Now, looking at the possible transitions in each step. Starting from |3,0,0>, which has n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. The first transition can go to a state with l=1 because Δl must be ±1. So from l=0 to l=1.

So the possible states after the first transition would be |2,1,m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1. Because m can change by 0, ±1. So possible m values are -1, 0, +1 for the first step.

Then, the second transition goes from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>. Let's think about the selection rules again. The second transition must go from l=1 to l=0, so that's a Δl = -1, which is allowed. The m value must go from whatever it was to 0. So for each possible m from the first step, can it transition to m=0 in the second step?

Yes, because in the second transition, Δm can change by 0, ±1. So for example, if the first step gives m=1, then in the second step, m can go to 0 or 2? Wait no, wait. No, because the initial state is |2,1,m>, and the final state is |1,0,0>. So m must change from whatever to 0. So during each transition, m can change by 0, ±1.

So for the first step, possible m's are -1, 0, +1.

Now in the second step, from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>.

Let me consider each case.

Case 1: First transition to |2,1,1>. Then, in second transition, m can go down by 1 to 0. Because from m=1 to m=0 is Δm = -1, which is allowed.

Case 2: First
