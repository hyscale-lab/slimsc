Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. So, it's like two double bonds maybe? Because I see two C=C groups. Oh, wait, the formula has two = signs, so yes, two double bonds. So it's a diene or something more complex.

The question gives me some bond energies. Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, that's the energy needed to break a carbon atom into its constituent parts, so like the energy to form gaseous atoms from solid carbon. Then the bond energies: H-H is 100, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, C-H is 400.

Wait, but wait. Enthalpy of formation is usually calculated using bond energies. The formula I remember is: the enthalpy of formation of a molecule is equal to the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (elements in their standard states) minus the bond energies of the products. Or is it the other way around? I think it's the sum of the energies of the bonds broken minus the bonds formed. Oh wait, no, the enthalpy of formation is
