Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5. I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are from A to D, with various powers of r.

Hmm, parallax and distance are related. I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So plx is in arcseconds. So if the distance r increases, parallax decreases.

The problem gives N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, substituting that in, it would be N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that: (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh wait, no, wait. So the number of stars as a function of r is proportional to r^5. But when we talk about how it changes with distance, that's the derivative of N with respect to r, right? Because per unit distance—so the rate of change.

Wait, no. Let me think. The number of stars in a region might be a function of r, but the question is phrased a bit ambiguously. Hmm. Let me re-read the question.

The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, N ∝ r^5.

But the way the question is phrased, it's about how the number changes with distance per unit range of distance. Hmm. So maybe they're asking for the density of stars at a given distance, or the number per unit volume, or perhaps the change in number per unit distance.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me approach this methodically.

First
