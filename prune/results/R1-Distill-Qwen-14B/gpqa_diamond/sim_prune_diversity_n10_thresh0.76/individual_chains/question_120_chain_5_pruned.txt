Okay, I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and we need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. So plx = 1/distance (in parsecs, I think). 

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So I need to think about the distribution in terms of parallax. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means their actual number density in space is uniform. But how does that translate into the number of stars we observe with a certain parallax?

Let me think about the volume. For a given parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance? Parallax is 1/d, so if plx increases, the distance decreases. So a small change in parallax corresponds to a certain change in distance.

Wait, the number of stars should depend on the volume they occupy. But since stars are in a uniform density, the number in a volume is proportional to the volume. 

But wait, in terms of parallax, how does volume change? Let's model this. The volume element in spherical coordinates might help, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of distance.

The parallax plx is 1/d. So if I have a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx, that corresponds to a change in distance from d to d - dd, where dd = d * dplx? Wait, plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So a change in plx dplx would correspond to a change in distance dd. Let me compute that.

dd = d * dplx? Let's see: plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. Taking the derivative, dd = -d * dplx / (plx^2). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think differently.

The number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd * n, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume). Since the distribution is uniform, n is constant.

But in terms of parallax, what's the thickness in parallax terms? Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So for a small change in d, say from d to d + dd, the corresponding change in plx is dplx = (d plx)/dd. Wait, let's compute dplx in terms of dd.

Wait, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So, differentiating both sides: dd = -1/(plx²) dplx → dplx = -plx² dd.

The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're considering a small range, the sign doesn't matter for the magnitude. So dplx = plx² dd → dd = dplx / plx².

So the thickness in distance terms, dd, is dplx divided by plx squared.

Now, the volume of the spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd.
