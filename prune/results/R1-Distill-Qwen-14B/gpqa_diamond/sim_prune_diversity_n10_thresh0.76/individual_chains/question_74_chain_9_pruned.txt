Okay, so I have this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that we have an atom whose decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. So the decay probability isn't just a simple percentage over time. It's more like each atom has a certain probability of decaying in a given time, and the probability decreases exponentially with time.

The formula I recall is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where N(t) is the number remaining after time t, N0 is the initial amount, λ is the decay constant, and t is time. But wait, this is for the number of atoms. Since the question is about probability, maybe I should think in terms of the decay probability itself.

Hmm, the decay probability for a single atom is given as 32% over 100 minutes. So the probability that it decays within 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32. That means the probability that it hasn't decayed by 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

Wait, but 50 minutes have already passed, and it hasn't decayed. So the initial
