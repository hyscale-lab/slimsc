Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts.

The question is about three exoplanets and their orbital periods. The problem gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and their albedos, which are all the same. I need to find by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1.

Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star. The formula I think is something like Te = T_star * ( (L/L_sun) / (a * sqrt(1 - albedo)) )^0.5. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature formula is Te = T_star * ( ( (1 - a) / ( (1 + e)^(0.5) ) ) ) * ( ( R_star / (2a) ) )^0.5 ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero. So it simplifies. Wait, no, I think the formula is more like Te = T_star * ( ( (1 - a) / ( sqrt(1 + e) ) ) )^0.5 / ( (1 + (R_planet/R_star)^2 )^0.5 ) ), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should recall the inverse square law and the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance, and the planet's albedo. The formula is Te = T_star * sqrt( ( (1 - a) ) / (4 * (1 + (R_p / R_s)^2) ) ) ) * (1 / a^0.5 ), but wait, I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, another approach is that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. Because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, and the planet emits as a blackbody, so equilibrium occurs when the absorbed energy equals the emitted energy. So, the formula is:

Te = T_star * sqrt( ( (1 - a) ) / (4) ) ) / a^0.5.

Wait, maybe a better way is to say that the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L/(16πσ a² (1 - a)))^0.25, but perhaps that's not the simplest approach here.

Alternatively, since all three planets are around the same star (I assume), then the star's luminosity (L) and radius (R) are the same for all. So, the equilibrium temperature of each planet depends only on their distance (a), their albedo (a), and other factors that are the same for all (like star's T and R).

But the problem says albedos are all 0.3, so that's the same for all. So, the equilibrium temperature ratio between any two planets should be inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances. More specifically, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because if a planet is farther, its equilibrium temperature is lower.

Wait, let me get this right. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

Te = T_s * sqrt( (1 - a) / (4) ) * (R_s / (2 a))^0.5

Wait, but R_s is the star's radius and R_p is the planet's radius. But since R_p is not given, perhaps it's negligible, or perhaps the problem doesn't consider it because they’re using ratios. Hmm, but in any case, let's think of the ratio between two planets. Let's say planet 1 and planet 2.

Te1 / Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) * ( (1 - a1) / (1 - a2) )^0.5 / ( (R_s/(2 a1))^0.5 / (R_s/(2 a2))^0.5 )) 

Wait, no. Because R_s is the same for all, so when taking the ratio, R_s/(2 a) would be (1/a), so that term would be (sqrt(a2/a1)) for the ratio.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the formula like this:

Te ∝ sqrt( (1 - a) / a )

Because all other factors (like star's properties) are the same for each planet, so when taking the ratio between two planets, the constants cancel.

So, Te1 / Te2 = sqrt( ( (1 - a1) / a1 ) / ( (1 - a2) / a2 ) )

Wait, no. Let me re-derive it. The equilibrium temperature equation is:

Te = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π² a² σ) ) ]^0.25

Wait, that's from the formula where the planet is a blackbody in thermal equilibrium. L is the star's luminosity. The incoming flux is L/(4π a²), but the planet's cross-section is π R_p². So the absorbed power is (L/(4π a²)) * π R_p² (1 - a). The planet emits as a blackbody with surface area 4 π R_p² and temperature Te, so the emitted power is 4 π R_p² σ Te^4. Setting them equal:

(L/(4π a²)) * π R_p² (1 - a) = 4 π R_p² σ Te^4

Simplify:

(L (1 - a)) / (4 a²) ) = 4 σ Te^4

Solving for Te:

Te^4 = L (1 - a) / (16 σ a² )

So Te = [ L (1 - a) / (16 σ a² ) ]^0.25

So since all planets are around the same star, L is the same for all, and σ is a constant, so:

Te ∝ sqrt( sqrt( (1 - a) / a² ) ) → Te ∝ ( (1 - a) / a² )^0.25

Wait, that's the same as ( (1 - a) )^0.25 * a^(-0.5)

Alternatively, Te ∝ sqrt( (1 - a) )^(1/2) ) / a.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write it as:

Te ∝ sqrt( (1 - a) ) / a^{1/2} }

So, Te ∝ sqrt( (1 - a) ) / a^{1/2} = sqrt( (1 - a)/(a) )

Wait, because sqrt( (1 - a) ) is (1 - a)^0.5, and a^{1/2} is a^0.5, so when you divide, it's (1 - a)^0.5 / a^0.5 = sqrt( (1 - a)/a )

So, Te is proportional to sqrt( (1 - a)/a )

Thus, the ratio Te1/Te2 = sqrt( (1 - a1)/a1 ) / sqrt( (1 - a2)/a2 ) )

Which simplifies to sqrt( ( (1 - a1) a2 ) / ( (1 - a2) a1 ) )

Wait, perhaps I should just consider that if the albedo (a) is the same for all planets, which it is (0.3), then the ratio simplifies further. Because (1 - a) is the same for all.

Oh, right! Because all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), so (1 - a) is 0.7 for each planet. So the ratio between Te1 and Te2 only depends on their distances.

In that case, Te1 / Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because when (1 - a) is the same, the (1 - a) terms cancel.

So, Te1 / Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because when (1 - a) is same, the ratio becomes sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, let me see. The formula is Te ∝ sqrt( (1 - a)/a )

So Te1 = k * sqrt( (1 - a)/a1 ), Te2 = k * sqrt( (1 - a)/a2 )

So T_e1 / T_e2 = sqrt( ( (1 - a)/a1 ) / ( (1 - a)/a2 ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Yes, that's correct. So for the same albedo, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is sqrt( a2 / a1 ), where a2 is the distance of planet 2 and a1 is the distance of planet 1.

The problem states that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So:

Te1/Te2 = 1.4 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So squaring both sides, (a2/a1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96

So a2 = a1 * 1.96 → So Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1. Wait, but wait, wait. Because if Te1 is higher than Te2, that would mean Planet1 is closer because the closer planet would have a higher equilibrium temperature. So in this ratio, Te1 is Planet1's temperature, and if that's higher than Planet2, then a2 > a1.

Wait, but the ratio is Te1/Te2 =1.4. So if Planet1 is closer, Te1 should be higher, so yes, that makes sense.

So a2 = a1 * 1.96.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is approximately 2.3.

So Te2/Te3 = 2.3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

Again, squaring, (a3/a2 ) = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 → a3 = a2 * 5.29.

But a2 is a1 * 1.96, so a3 = a1 * 1.96 * 5.29.

Let me calculate that: 1.96 *5.29.

Hmm, 2 *5.29 is 10.58, but 1.96 is 0.04 less than 2, so 5.29 *1.96 = 5.29*(2 - 0.04)= 10.58 - (5.29*0.04) = 10.58 - 0.2116 = approx 10.3684.

So a3 = a1 * 10.3684.

So the orbital distances are in the ratio a1 : a2 : a3 = 1 : 1.96 : 10.3684.

But the question is about the orbital periods. Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius. So P^2 ∝ a^3.

So P1^2 / P3^2 = (a1^3) / (a3^3) ) → (P3/P1)^2 = (a3/a1)^3 → P3/P1 = sqrt( (a3/a1)^3 )

We have a3/a1 = approx 10.3684.

So (a3/a1)^3 = (10.3684)^3.

Let me compute that:

10^3 is 1000. 0.3684 is about 0.368. Let me compute 10.3684^3.

Alternatively, 10.3684^3 = (10 + 0.3684)^3. Let me approximate:

(10 + 0.3684)^3 = 10^3 + 3*(10)^2 *0.3684 + 3*(10)*(0.3684)^2 + (0.3684)^3.

10^3 = 1000.

3*(100)*0.3684 = 3*100*0.3684 = 3*36.84 = 110.52.

3*10*(0.3684)^2 → 3*10*(0.1357) ≈ 3*10 *0.136 ≈ 4.08.

(0.3684)^3 ≈ 0.0503.

Adding all together: 1000 + 110.52 = 1110.52 +4.08=1114.6 +0.0503= approx 1114.65.

So (a3/a1)^3 ≈ 1114.65.

So (P3/P1)^2 = 1114.65 → P3/P1 = sqrt(1114.65).

What's sqrt(1114)? Let's see. 33^2=1089, 34^2=1156. So sqrt(1114) is between 33 and 34.

Compute 33.4^2 = (33 + 0.4)^2 = 33^2 + 2*33*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 1089 + 26.4 + 0.16 = 1115.56.

But our a3/a1^3 is 1114.65, which is just a bit less than 1115.56. So sqrt(1114.65) is slightly less than 33.4.

Let me compute (33.4)^2 = 1115.56, as above. So 33.38^2 = ?

Let me compute 33.38^2:

33.38 *33.38 = (33 + 0.38)^2 = 33^2 + 2*33*0.38 +0.38^2 = 1089 + 25.08 + 0.1444 = 1089+25.08=1114.08 +0.1444=1114.2244.

But our value is 1114.65. Hmm, so 33.38^2=1114.2244. The difference between 1114.2244 and 1114.65 is ~0.4256. Each additional 0.01 in x adds about 2*33.38 *0.01 + (0.01)^2 = 0.6676 +0.0001 ≈0.6677 per 0.01 increase in x.

So to get from 33.38^2=1114.2244 to 1114.65, we need an additional (1114.65 -1114.2244)=0.4256.

Since each 0.01 increase in x adds about 0.6677 to x², the needed delta is 0.4256 /0.6677 ≈ 0.637 of 0.01, which is about 0.00637.

So the sqrt is approximately 33.38 + 0.00637 = 33.38637.

So about 33.39.

Wait, but wait, the problem is to find by what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than Planet1. So P3/P1 ≈ 33.39.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4, which matches this.

But wait, let me double-check the steps. Did I make any miscalculations?

Wait, Te1/Te2 is 1.4. So using Te1/Te2 = sqrt(a2/a1) → 1.4 = sqrt(a2/a1) → a2/a1 = 1.96.

Te2/Te3 is 2.3 → sqrt(a3/a2) = 2.3 → a3/a2 = (2.3)^2=5.29.

So a3 = a2 *5.29 = a1 *1.96 *5.29 = a1 * (1.96 *5.29).

Wait, 1.96 *5.29. Let me compute that precisely.

1.96 *5 =9.8, 1.96*0.29=0.5684. So total is 9.8 +0.5684=10.3684.

So a3/a1=10.3684.

Then, P^2 is proportional to a^3. So (P3/P1)^2 = (a3/a1)^3 = (10.3684)^3.

Earlier, I estimated that as about 1114.65.

So sqrt(1114.65) is P3/P1.

Earlier calculation gives that around 33.39.

Looking at the options, D is ~33.4, which is the correct option.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem statement tells us the mass ratios: Planet1/Planet2 is 1.15, Planet2/Planet3 is 1.35.

But in the calculation above, I only used the equilibrium temperature ratios to find the orbital distances. The mass ratios are given, but I don't think they affect the equilibrium temperature or the orbital period. Because Kepler's third law depends only on the mass of the star (assuming the planet masses are negligible), and the orbital radius.

So the masses of the planets don't directly influence their orbital periods in this context. So the mass ratios probably are a distraction, or perhaps they're included to test if the student ignores them when they aren't relevant.

So the correct answer should be option D, ~33.4.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance, as well as Kepler's third law.

### Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

\[
T_e \propto \sqrt{\frac{1 - a}{a}}
\]

where \(a\) is the orbital distance and \(a\) is the albedo. Since the albedo is the same for all three planets (\(a = 0.3\)), the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets depends only on their orbital distances:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

#### Between Planet1 and Planet2:
The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is given as \(T_{e1}/T_{e2} = 1.4\). Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
\]

Thus, \(a_2 = 1.96 \cdot a_1\).

#### Between Planet2 and Planet3:
The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is given as \(T_{e2}/T_{e3} = 2.3\). Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
\]

Thus, \(a_3 = 5.29 \cdot a_2\).

Combining these results, the orbital distance of Planet3 relative to Planet1 is:

\[
a_3 = 5.29 \cdot a_2 = 5.29 \cdot (1.96 \cdot a_1) = 10.3684 \cdot a_1
\]

### Step 2: Orbital Periods and Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance:

\[
\frac{P_3^2}{P_1^2} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^3
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^3}
\]

Substituting \(a_3/a_1 = 10.3684\):

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \sqrt{(10.3684)^3}
\]

First, calculate \(10.3684^3\):

\[
10.3684^3 \approx 1114.65
\]

Then, take the square root:

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \sqrt{1114.65} \approx 33.4
\]

### Conclusion
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. The mass ratios provided in the problem do not affect the orbital periods, as Kepler's third law depends only on the orbital distance and the mass of the star.
