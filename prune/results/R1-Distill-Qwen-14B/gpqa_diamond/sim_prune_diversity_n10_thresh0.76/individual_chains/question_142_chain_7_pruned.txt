Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (like a statistical mixture of states) rather than being in a pure state.

So, first, I think I should write out what this matrix looks like. The |0⟩⟨0| is the outer product of |0⟩ with itself, which would be a diagonal matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| would have 1 in the (1,1) position. So when we add them together, each diagonal element becomes 1, and the off-diagonal elements are zero. Then, multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2.

So ρ would look like this in matrix form:
[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Now, I'm trying to recall how density matrices relate to the Bloch sphere. Oh right, pure states are on the surface of the Bloch sphere, and mixed states are inside it. The density matrix for a pure state would have a trace of 1 and a rank of 1. This matrix ρ has a trace of 1 (1/2 + 1/2 =1), which is correct, but what about its rank?

The matrix [[1/2, 0],[0,1/2]] has two non-zero eigenvalues (1/2 and 1/2), so the rank is 2. Since a single qubit density matrix can have rank 1 (pure) or 2 (mixed), this must be a mixed state, specifically a completely mixed state. Because the diagonal elements are equal, it's maximally mixed.

Wait, the question is about its geometrical position. So the Bloch sphere represents all possible states of a qubit. For a density matrix, the state can be represented as a vector r = (x, y, z) such that ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix.

Let me break this down. The Pauli matrices are:
σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, the general form of the density matrix for a state r is (I + (r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)) / 2. Expanding this, we get:

ρ = (1/2) [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y],
             [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z] ]

Wait, but our given ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. Let's compare this to the general form.

So, the diagonal elements of ρ should be (1 + r_z)/2 and (1 - r_z)/2. But in our case, both are 1/2. So (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 implies that 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0. Similarly, (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 also holds if r_z =0.

Then the off-diagonal terms are r_x - i r_y, and their complex conjugates. In our ρ, the
