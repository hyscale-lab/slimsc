Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that for a single particle in such a well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And in the problem, E is defined as π² ħ²/(2mL²), so each particle's energy would be n² times E. So E_n = n² E, where n is the quantum number.

But wait, in this case, there are four particles, and they're spin-1/2. Oh right, that means each particle has a spin of 1/2, so each can have spin up or down. But wait, in a one-dimensional box, the particles are fermions, so their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. Since they're spin-1/2, which is a fermion, the Pauli exclusion principle applies. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, considering both spatial and spin parts.

Wait, but in a 1D box, the spatial part is described by the quantum number n, and the spin part can be up or down. So for each n, you can have two particles with opposite spins. Because for spin-1/2, each state can hold two particles—like one spin up and one spin down.

So if we have four particles, how does that fill up the energy levels? Let's think. The first energy level, n=1, can hold two particles (since spin up and down). Then n=2 can hold two more. But wait, with four particles, that's two from n=1 and two from n=2. So each has their own spin.

But wait, no. Wait, for each n, you can have two particles with opposite spins. So for n=1, two particles; n=2, another two. But wait, four particles would mean n=1 and n=2 each filled with two. But wait, the problem is asking about the ground state, first excited, and second excited states of the system. So I need to find the energies for these four particles in these states.

Wait, but the question is about the system's energy—so the total energy would be the sum of the individual particles' energies.

So for the ground state of the system, the particles would fill up the lowest possible energy levels with their spins. So the ground state would have the first two particles in n=1 (with opposite spins), and the next two in n=2 (again, opposite spins). So each particle in n=1 has energy E (n=1: 1²E=E), and n=2: 2²E=4E.

Wait, but no—wait, the individual energies are n² E. So for each particle in n=1, E_1 = 1² E = E. For n=2, E_2 =4E, n=3 is 9E, n=4 is 16E, etc.

Since each n can hold two particles (due to spin), the four particles would fill n=1 and n=2. So two particles in n=1 (each E) and two in n=2 (each 4E). So the total energy for the ground state would be (2 * 1E) + (2 *4E) = 2E +8E=10E? Wait, no, wait. Wait 2*(E) + 2*(4E) is 2E + 8E = 10E? That can't be right because some of the options have 4E as an option.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. Each particle in n=1 is 1E, so two particles give 2E. Each in n=2 is 4E, two particles give 8E. So total is 10E. Oh, but that would be the ground state. Wait, but wait—that can't be because the ground state is the lowest possible, and if all four particles are in the lowest possible states, which would be n=1 and n=2.

Wait, but wait—no, wait. No, because for four particles with spin-1/2, each n can hold two particles. So n=1 holds 2, n=2 holds 2. So that's four. So the total energy would be 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E=10E. So the ground state's total energy is 10E? But wait, wait—am I missing something here? Because another possibility is that each particle could have the same n if their spins are different. Hmm, no, because four particles would require n=1 (two), n=2 (two) since each n can take two particles.

Wait, but wait—no, wait a second. Because in a 1D box, each n is a separate state. So for four spin-1/2 particles, each can have a unique state, but since spin is part of the state, each spatial state can have two particles with opposite spins. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1, one spin up, the other spin down. The next two go into n=2, each with spin up and down. So yes, each n=1 and n=2 has two particles. So the total energy would be 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 10E. So the ground state's energy is 10E? But wait, wait, looking at the options, that's option B and C have 10E as the ground state.

Wait, but wait—no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Actually, the ground state would be the state where all four particles are in the lowest possible spatial orbitals with their spins. So for four particles, you have to fill up n=1 with two particles (spin up and down), then n=2 with two (again, spin up and down). So each n can hold two particles. So yes, the total energy is 2E + 8E =10E. So the ground state energy is 10E. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, option C says ground state is 4E, first excited 10E, etc. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the system's energy for the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So maybe I'm thinking about it wrong. Let me think about the possible states.

Wait, wait—am I mixing up the concept? Oh wait, no, the ground state for the system is when the particles are in the lowest possible energy configuration. So for four particles, it's n=1 and n=2 filled, each with two particles. So the total energy is 2*1²E + 2*2²E = 2E +8E=10E.

Wait, but that seems high. Let me check the options. Option B: 4E, 10E,50E. Option C:4E,10E,15E.

Wait, but perhaps I'm miscalculating. Another approach: For four particles, the first four states would be n=1 (two particles), n=2 (two particles), giving total energy 2E + 8E =10E.

So ground state is 10E. Then first excited state would be when one of the particles moves to a higher state. So perhaps the first excited state would have three particles in n=1 and one in n=2. But wait, no, because each n can hold only two particles. So you can't have three in n=1 since spin can only take two. So perhaps the first excited state would have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, how many particles can n=3 hold? Two, because of spin. So the configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=2, but that's the ground state. So perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles from n=2 jumps to n=3, but that would require one less in n=2 and one in n=3. Wait, but each n can hold two. So perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, but n=2 can take two particles, so perhaps it's two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So total energy would be 2*E +1*4E +1*9E = 2E +4E +9E =15E. So the first excited state energy is 15E.

Wait, but then the next state would be when another particle moves up. So perhaps the second excited state would have two in n=1, two in n=3, so 2*E +2*9E= 2E +18E=20E. Alternatively, maybe another configuration, like two in n=2 and two in n=3. So 2*4E +2*9E=8E+18E=26E. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible ways to arrange four particles in the energy levels, considering that each can hold two per n.

So the possible configurations (in terms of occupation of n levels) are:

Ground state: n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). Total energy: 2E +8E=10E.

First excited state: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. But wait, each n can hold two, so how does that work? Wait, perhaps each n can hold two, so the first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, making the configuration 2 in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, no, because each n can take two particles, so n=2 can have two, n=3 can have two, etc. So perhaps the first excited state would be when a particle from n=2 moves to n=3, but then how does that affect the filling?

Wait, maybe I should think of the particles' quantum numbers and their arrangement. Since each n can have two particles (spin up and down), the ground state is filled with n=1 (two) and n=2 (two). The first excited state would be when one particle jumps from n=2 to n=3, so the configuration is n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=3 (one). But each n can hold two, so perhaps that's allowed.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: the first excited state could be when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So, the total energy would be 2E (n=1) + 1*4E (n=2) +1*9E (n=3) = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then the second excited state could be when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So now, n=1 has two, n=2 has zero (since both moved), n=3 has two. So the total energy is 2E +0 + 2*9E= 2E + 18E=20E. Or perhaps the second excited state is when one particle moves from n=2 to n=4, leading to a different energy configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. Let's calculate that: 2E +4E + 16E= 22E. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe for the first and second excited states, the particles are arranged such that the energies are the next possible sums. So the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, and the second excited is, say, 18E? Looking at the options, option D has 10E, 15E, 18E. So option D: 10,15,18.

Wait, but earlier I thought the ground state was 10E. Let me think again: for the ground state, two in n=1 and two in n=2, so 2E + 8E=10E. So the ground state is 10E. The first excited state would be the next lowest energy, which would be when one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3. So 2E (n=1) +1*4E (n=2) +1*9E (n=3) =2+4+9=15E. Then the second excited state could be when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, making 2E +0*4E +2*9E=2E +18E=20E. But wait, that's 20E, which I don't see in the options. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the second excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=4, so the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. So the total energy is 2E +4E +16E= 22E. But that's not matching any options.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the possible states. Let me think about the possible total energies for the system.

Another approach: the energies for the system are the sum of individual energies. Each particle's energy is n^2 E. Since each n can hold two particles, the ground state is n=1 and n=2 filled, with two particles each. So 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) =2E + 8E=10E. So ground state is 10E.

The first excited state would be when one particle from n=2 moves to n=3. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. So total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: another particle moves up. Let's say from n=2 to n=4. So two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. So 2E +4E +16E= 22E. But that's not an option.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when a particle moves to n=3 and another to n=4, but that would require a higher energy. Or maybe the first excited state is 10E, but that doesn't make sense because ground state is the lowest.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the order wrong. Maybe the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, but that would require the configuration to have two in n=1, two in n=3. So 2E + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E. So that would be the first excited state. Then the second excited state would be when one particle is in n=2 and one in n=3, making the total 2E +4E +9E=15E. But that's lower than 20E, so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should list the possible total energies in order.

Possible configurations and their energies:

1. All four in n=1 and n=2: 2E +8E=10E (ground state).
2. Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3: 2E +4E +9E=15E.
3. Two in n=1, two in n=3: 2E + 18E=20E.
4. Two in n=2, one in n=3, one in n=4: 8E +9E +16E=33E.
5. Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4: 2E +4E +16E=22E.
6. Two in n=1, one in n=3, one in n=4: 2E +9E +16E=27E.
7. One in each of n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4: E +4E +9E +16E=30E.

Wait, so the possible energies in order would be 10E (ground), 15E, 20E, 22E, 27E, 30E, etc.

So the first excited state would be 15E, the second excited state would be 20E? But looking at the options:

Option A: 30E, 39E, 50E. No.
Option B: 4E,10E,50E. No.
Option C:4E,10E,15E. No, because ground state is 10E, not 4E.
Option D:10E,15E,18E.

Wait, but 18E isn't in the list I made. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing a configuration.

Wait, another possible configuration: one particle in n=2 and one in n=4, along with two in n=1. So 2E +4E +16E=22E. Or, maybe another configuration where two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4: 2*9E + 2*16E= 18E +32E=50E.

Wait, but that's the highest option in option A. So perhaps I'm getting confused about the order of the excited states.

Alternatively, maybe the ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible n. So four particles would require n=1 (two), n=2 (two), giving 10E.

First excited state could be when one particle is promoted to n=3, making the configuration two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. So 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: another promotion, perhaps moving another particle to n=3, so now two in n=1, two in n=3. So 2E + 2*9E= 2E +18E=20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that would be a higher energy than 15E.

Wait, but 15E is lower than 20E, so the order would be ground (10E), first excited (15E), second excited (20E). But in the options, I don't see 20E, but option A has 30E, 39E, 50E. Option D has 10E,15E,18E.

Wait, 18E would require something. Let me see: 18E would be 2*9E, but that would require two particles in n=3, but that's 9E each. Two would make 18E, but then the others would be in lower levels, like n=1 and n=2. So total would be 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) + 18E (n=3) = 24E. That doesn't fit 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps some configuration where two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3: 2*4E +2*9E=8E +18E=26E.

Hmm, none of that seems to match. So perhaps I'm missing the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the system's energy but about each particle's energy. But no, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system", so it's the total energy.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E. So if the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. How could that happen?

Wait, 18E could be 2*9E, but that would require two particles in n=3 and two in n=4. Wait no, because four particles, so 2 in n=3 and 2 in n=4? No, that would be 2*(9E) +2*(16E)=18E +32E=50E, which is option A's third state.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4, giving 2*(9E) +2*(16E)=18E+32E=50E. But that would be the third excited state perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when three particles are in n=1 and one in n=3. But wait, n=1 can hold two particles, so you can't have three. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=2 and another to n=3. Wait, but in the ground state, n=2 is already filled with two particles. So moving one from n=2 to n=3 would create a hole in n=2 and a particle in n=3.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible total energies in order:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state: 15E.

Second excited state: perhaps 18E, which would be when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=4. Wait, no: 2*(4E) + 2*(16E)=8E +32E=40E.

No, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, so the configuration is two in n=1, two in n=4. So 2E + 2*(16E)=2E +32E=34E.

But that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is 4E, not 10E. How is that possible?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about the number of particles and the possible states.

Each n can hold two particles (due to spin). So four particles would require two levels: n=1 and n=2, each holding two. So total energy is 2*1E + 2*4E= 2E +8E=10E.

So ground state is 10E. So why do some options have 4E as the ground state?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the sum of the individual energies, but perhaps I'm considering the particles as bosons. No, they're spin-1/2, so fermions.

Wait, maybe the misunderstanding is about whether the particles are in a symmetric or antisymmetric spatial state. Wait, but for fermions, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. So considering spin and spatial parts, but in this case, since it's a one-dimensional box, the spatial part is determined by n, and the spin part can be either symmetric or antisymmetric, but I'm not sure how that affects the energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the particles as distinguishable. No, no, they're identical fermions, so the Pauli exclusion applies. So each spatial state can hold two particles (spin up and down).

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible total energies for the four particles.

Wait, another approach: The ground state is when the four particles are in the lowest possible n, which would be n=1 and n=2, each filled with two particles. So total energy is 2E +8E=10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, so now we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be when another n=2 particle moves to n=3, so two in n=1, two in n=3. So the total energy is 2E +18E=20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle moves to n=4, so the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. So 2E +4E +16E=22E.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them has 20E or 22E. The options are:

A) 30E,39E,50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

So option D has 10E,15E,18E.

Hmm, so perhaps the second excited state is when a particle jumps to n=3 and another to n=4. So two in n=1, one in n=3, one in n=4. So 2E +9E +16E=27E.

But that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is option D:10E,15E,18E.

But how would 18E be achieved? Let me think: 18E=2*9E, which is two particles in n=3. So the configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=3. So 2E +18E=20E. But that would be 20E, not 18E.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=2 and one in n=4, along with two in n=1. So 2E +4E +16E=22E.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when a particle moves to n=3, so 15E, and the second excited state is when another particle moves to n=4. So now the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, one in n=4. Wait, that's five particles, which isn't the case here. So no.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when a particle moves from n=2 to n=4, so the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. So 2E +4E +16E=22E.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Another approach: maybe the ground state is 4E. How could that be? Well, perhaps if all four particles are in n=1. But wait, no, because each n can hold two particles. So n=1 can hold two, n=2 can hold two. To have four particles, you can't have all four in n=1; you have to spread them out.

Ah, perhaps the problem isn't considering the spin. If the particles were bosons, they could all occupy the same state. But they are fermions, so they can't. So, each spatial state can hold two particles (spin up and down), so four particles would require n=1 (two) and n=2 (two), which gives 10E as the total. So option D's ground state is 10E, which matches.

So according to this, the ground state is 10E, first excited state is 15E, and the second excited state is 18E, but I don't see how that would happen. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4, but that's 2*9E +2*16E=18E +32E=50E, which would be the third excited state perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4, making the total energy 50E. But that would be option A's third state.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again:

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

How can the second excited state be 18E? Perhaps if two particles are in n=3, and the other two in n=1. So 2E +2*9E=2E +18E=20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, giving 9E +16E=25E, but I don't see that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the particles are allowed to have higher spins, but no, they're spin-1/2.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, making the total energy 15E, and the second excited state is when another n=2 particle moves to n=3, making two in n=3 and two in n=1, giving 2E + 18E=20E. So the second excited state is 20E. But again, none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the system's energy isn't just the sum of each particle's energy. But no, I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the energies of individual particles, not the system. But the question clearly says "energies of the ground state", which refers to the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the energy calculation. Let me recheck.

E_n = n² E.

So for four particles:

Ground state: two in n=1 (E each) and two in n=2 (4E each). So sum is 2E + 8E=10E.

First excited state: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Sum is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E.

But 22E isn't an option. So perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4: sum is 2*9E +2*16E= 18E +32E=50E.

So the first three excited states would have energies 10E, 15E, 50E. But option A's first three are 30E,39E,50E.

No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves to n=3 and another to n=4. So configuration: two in n=1, one in n=3, one in n=4. Sum is 2E +9E +16E=27E. So ground:10E, first excited:15E, second excited:27E. But again, no option matches.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm completely wrong about the ground state. Maybe the ground state is 4E. How could that happen?

Wait, perhaps the particles are bosons, so they can all occupy the same state. But no, they're spin-1/2, which are fermions. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the particles as distinguishable. But no, identical particles require antisymmetry.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the sum of the squares of the quantum numbers, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the energy levels without considering spin. But that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the particles as having integer spin, making them bosons. But the question says spin-1/2, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the particles as in a three-dimensional box, but no, it's a one-dimensional box.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to see if any of the options make sense.

Option D:10E,15E,18E. So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

How could 18E happen? Let's think: 18E = 2*9E, which would mean two particles in n=3. So the configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=3. So sum is 2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but 20E isn't 18E. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps one particle is in n=2 and another in n=4: 4E +16E=20E. 

Hmm. I think I'm missing something, but considering the time I've spent, perhaps the correct answer is option D:10E,15E,18E. Because the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, and the second excited is 18E. But I'm not entirely sure how 18E is achieved. Maybe it's when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=4. Wait, n=2 holds two, n=4 holds two. So sum is 2*4E +2*16E=8E +32E=40E. No, that's not 18E.

Wait, perhaps 18E is 2*(3²E)=18E, but that would require two in n=3. So 2*9E=18E. But then where are the other two particles? They have to be in lower levels, like n=1. So the sum would be 2E +18E=20E.

Hmm. So perhaps the second excited state is 20E, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct option isn't present, but since I have to choose from the options given, perhaps option D is the intended answer.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Concepts:
1. **Energy Levels for a Single Particle**:  
   The energy levels in a 1D infinite potential well are given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, each spatial quantum state \( n \) can hold at most two particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).

3. **Filling the Energy Levels**:  
   - The **ground state** corresponds to the lowest energy configuration, where particles fill the lowest available energy levels.
   - The **first excited state** occurs when one particle is promoted to the next available energy level.
   - The **second excited state** occurs when another particle is promoted to a higher energy level.

### Analysis:
#### Ground State:
- The lowest energy levels are \( n = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \), each of which can hold two particles due to spin.  
- Configuration: Two particles in \( n = 1 \) and two particles in \( n = 2 \).  
- Total energy:  
  \[
  E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
  \]

#### First Excited State:
- One particle from \( n = 2 \) is promoted to \( n = 3 \).  
- Configuration: Two particles in \( n = 1 \), one particle in \( n = 2 \), and one particle in \( n = 3 \).  
- Total energy:  
  \[
  E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2(1^2E) + (2^2E) + (3^2E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
  \]

#### Second Excited State:
- Another particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 4 \).  
- Configuration: Two particles in \( n = 1 \), one particle in \( n = 3 \), and one particle in \( n = 4 \).  
- Total energy:  
  \[
  E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + E_3 + E_4 = 2(1^2E) + (3^2E) + (4^2E) = 2E + 9E + 16E = 27E.
  \]

### Matching with Options:
- **Option A**: \( 30E, 39E, 50E \)  
  Does not match the calculated energies.  
- **Option B**: \( 4E, 10E, 50E \)  
  The ground state energy \( 10E \) matches, but \( 4E \) and \( 50E \) do not align with the calculations.  
- **Option C**: \( 4E, 10E, 15E \)  
  The ground state \( 10E \) and first excited state \( 15E \) match, but \( 4E \) does not.  
- **Option D**: \( 10E, 15E, 18E \)  
  The ground state \( 10E \) and first excited state \( 15E \) match, but the second excited state \( 18E \) does not align with the calculated \( 27E \).  

### Conclusion:
While the calculated second excited state energy is \( 27E \), none of the options explicitly match this. However, based on the given options, **Option D** is the closest match, as it correctly identifies the ground state \( 10E \) and first excited state \( 15E \). The discrepancy in the second excited state may stem from a difference in interpretation or simplification in the problem setup.

**Answer: D**
