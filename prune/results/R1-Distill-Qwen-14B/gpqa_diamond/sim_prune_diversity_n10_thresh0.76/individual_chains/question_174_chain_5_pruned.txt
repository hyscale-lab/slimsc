Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativistic mechanics yet. But let's take it step by step. 

The question is about nuclear fission. So, an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The problem states that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. 

We are told to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm, okay. So, I think the key here is to compute the kinetic energies of the two fragments using both relativistic and classical approaches, then find the difference.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Initial nucleus: mass M, rest energy 300 GeV. So, M = 300 GeV / c², but maybe we don't need to worry about c squared since we're dealing with percentages.

- After fission: two fragments, masses m1 and m2. Let's say m1 is more massive, so m1 = 2 * m2. Wait, wait. Or is it m1 = 2 m2? The question says one fragment is twice more massive than the other. So if the more massive is m1, then m1 = 2 m2.

Wait, the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

But since m1 is twice m2, substitute:

2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M. So m1 is 0.66 M. 

Wait, but the initial mass is M. So the total rest mass after is 0.99 M. So the mass difference is 0.01 M, right? Because 0.99 M is less than M, so that mass must have been converted into kinetic energy or other forms.

But since it's fission, the two fragments fly apart with kinetic energy. The problem is about their kinetic energies, specifically the more massive one's.

So, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum must be zero because the fragments move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me think about the relativistic approach first.

In the relativistic case, the total energy is conserved. The initial energy is the rest energy of the nucleus: E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission, each fragment has rest energy plus kinetic energy. So:

E1 = (m1 c²) (1 + γ) where γ is the Lorentz factor for fragment 1.

Wait, no. Wait, kinetic energy is (γ-1) m c². So, the total energy for each fragment is γ m c². So:

E1 = γ1 m1 c² = (m1 c²) γ1

E2 = γ2 m2 c² = (m2 c²) γ2

But since the total energy must equal the initial energy, E1 + E2 = M c² = 300 GeV.

But also, the total momentum must be zero. So, the magnitudes of the momenta are equal. 

Momentum p for each fragment is given by p = γ m v. Since the directions are opposite, their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, so:

γ1 m1 v1 = γ2 m2 v2

But v1 and v2 are in opposite directions, so if we take magnitudes, γ1 m1 v1 = γ2 m2 v2.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe it's easier to consider the system's center of momentum frame, which in this case is the original rest frame because the nucleus is initially at rest.

Wait, maybe we can use energy and momentum conservation. Let me set up the equations.

Let’s denote:

m1 = 0.66 M
m2 = 0.33 M

Because m1 = 2 m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

So, the initial momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments have momenta p1 and p2 in opposite directions. So, p1 = -p2.

So, the magnitudes are |p1| = |p2|.

So, |p1| = |p2| → m1 γ1 v1 = m2 γ2 v2

But because they're moving in opposite directions, v2 = -v1. So, let's take v1 and v2 as magnitudes.

Wait, maybe it's better to write p1 = -p2, so:

γ1 m1 v1 = - γ2 m2 v2

But since v1 and v2 are in opposite directions, let's say v1 is positive and v2 is negative. So v2 = -v1. Then,

γ1 m1 v1 = γ2 m2 (-v1) → γ1 m1 = -γ2 m2

But since γ is always positive, this can't be correct. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of vectors. Let me consider that p1 = -p2.

So, p1 + p2 =
