Okay, so I've got this question about a genetics experiment gone wrong. Let me try to unpack what's happening here. 

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're overexpressing the gene for this protein using an inducible system. To help purify the protein later, they've added a sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. 

They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. They looked at the plasmid's plus strand sequence and found something wrong.

Looking at the options, the possible issues are:

A) Missense mutation in the antigenic determinant.
B) Ribosome terminated early.
C) Lack of linker causing proteolysis.
D) Mouse lacks tRNA for UAA codon.

Hmm. I need to think about each possibility.

First, the construct includes a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. So the sequence starts with ATG (which is methionine, the start codon) followed by the HA tag. The plus strand's sequence starts with 5' ATG TAC ... and so on.

Wait, looking at the start of the provided sequence: 5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

I should look for possible stop codons or issues in the reading frame.

The first codon is ATG, which is methionine (start). Next is TAC, which is tyrosine. Then CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine again), CAT (his), GAT (aspartic acid), GTT (valine), etc. So the starting sequence includes the HA tag's sequence. Wait, HA is a specific peptide, so the sequence after ATG should match the HA epitope. If there's a mutation in the HA sequence, it might affect purification but not necessarily prevent expression. But option A is about a missense mutation in the HA determinant. If the HA is messed up, the purification might not work, but the protein should still be expressed. So maybe not the main issue here.

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would imply a premature stop codon in the reading frame. Let me scan the sequence for in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). 

Looking through the sequence, let's see:

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

The sequence continues, let's look for any such triplets.

Looking at the sequence:

5' ...

Looking for TGA or TAA or TAG.

Hmm. Let's go through the sequence:

Looking at each codon:

After the initial part, I see ...GCAGATCCATTTTACGCTG...

The codon before that was GAG (glu), then AGC (ser), then CAT (his), TTT (Phe), TAC (tyr), GCT (Ala), G...

Wait, wait, maybe looking for triplets. Let me parse the sequence into codons. 

But this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of a stop codon in the sequence would prevent the ribosome from translating the entire protein
