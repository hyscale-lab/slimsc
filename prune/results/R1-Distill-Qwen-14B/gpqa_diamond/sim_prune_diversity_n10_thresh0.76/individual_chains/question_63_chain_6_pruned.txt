Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, let me think through what I know. 

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, no, I think the non-rigid rotor is a different model for rotation, but maybe the question is talking about the rigid rotor and vibration together. Oh wait, the question specifies the rotation-vibration model, so it's considering both rotational and vibrational energy states.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state for a given vibrational level. So, the fundamental state would mean the vibrational quantum number is at its lowest, which is v=0, and the rotational quantum number is also at its lowest, which for rigid rotor is J=0. Or wait, no, for rotation, the ground state is J=0, but in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized with J being integer values starting from 0.

But wait, the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the molecule is in its current state, and when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next higher state. The next state with the lowest energy would be the next higher energy state, so we need to find the energy difference between the current state and the next state, and then find the photon momentum corresponding to that energy.

Wait, but what's the current state? It's the fundamental state. For a diatomic molecule modeled by the rotation-vibration model, the fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state with the lowest energy would be the next rotational state, J=1, since increasing J increases the energy more than increasing v. Or wait, vibrations have higher energy than rotations? Because vibrational energy is higher per quantum level than rotational. So, if the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), the next possible state would be either J=1 (same v) or v=1 (same J). But which requires less energy? Because the photon needs to have the momentum corresponding to the smallest possible energy jump.

Wait, the question says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state should be the one with the minimal energy increment
