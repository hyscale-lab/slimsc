Okay, so I've got this vector field problem here, and I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of the field inside a sphere of radius R. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The question says the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Oh wait, so f is a vector field where every point's direction is radial, and the magnitude depends only on the distance from the origin. 

I remember that in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field that depends only on r (radial) has a specific formula. Let me recall: The divergence of a vector field A in spherical coordinates is given by (1/(r²)) d(r² A_r) / dr + (1/(r sinθ)) d(A_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(r sinθ)) (1/sinθ) d(A_φ)/dφ. 

But wait, in this case, the vector field f has only a radial component, and the other components are zero. So A_θ and A_φ are zero. That simplifies things a lot. So the divergence reduces to just the radial part.

So for f(r), since it's only radial and depends on r, the divergence is (1/(r²)) d(r² f_r) / dr. 

Let me write that down. f_r is the radial component, which is 1/r². So plugging in, f_r = 1/r².

Now compute d(r² f_r)/dr. Let's compute r² f_r first: r² * (1/r²) = 1. So the derivative of that with respect to r is zero. So the whole term becomes (1/r²) * 0, which is zero. Wait, that can't be right because the divergence is zero? But wait, what about the case when r is zero? Because f(r) is 1/r², which would be undefined at the origin. Oh, right, this is similar to an electric field due to a point charge, which is divergenceless except at the origin. But wait, isn't the divergence at r =0 different?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because when r approaches zero, the field becomes stronger, but maybe I
