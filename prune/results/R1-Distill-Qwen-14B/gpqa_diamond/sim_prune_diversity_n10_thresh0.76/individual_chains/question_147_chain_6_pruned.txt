Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, each a fraction of the speed of light.

Hmm, so first, I remember that in particle physics, when particles annihilate, their energy is converted into other particles. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can make some approximations. Also, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps its kinetic energy is not too high, making the problem a bit easier.

Wait, let's think about the conservation laws. Both energy and momentum must be conserved in this process. Since the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton, their total energy and momentum will determine the properties of the resulting particles.

But wait, the proton is moving, but the antiproton is moving slowly. Wait, no, actually, the setup says the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the initial momentum is low. Or perhaps, the system's total momentum is determined by the antiproton's movement since the proton is at rest? Hmm, the question isn't entirely clear on whether the proton is at rest. Oh, wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it. Or maybe both are moving? Hmm, maybe I should assume that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a low velocity, making the problem easier.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps because the antiproton is moving slowly, we can approximate that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. The proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV, right? So each of the particles A is lighter than a proton. So the system is producing four particles, two of each A⁺ and A⁻.

But since the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton, their rest masses are the same. So the total rest mass energy is 2
