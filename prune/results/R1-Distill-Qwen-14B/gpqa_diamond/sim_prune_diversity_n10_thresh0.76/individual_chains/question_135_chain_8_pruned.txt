Okay, let's try to figure out this physics problem. So, the question is about the decay channels of a boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. And the interaction Lagrangian is provided.

Hmm, the Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I need to parse this correctly. Oh, right, the structure might be something like L = -λ f (ψ_f)^dagger (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), where f is a fermion field. So, the boson X couples to fermions through this interaction term.

So, the interaction term would typically look like X ψ_f ψ_f, meaning that the boson X can mediate interactions between two fermions of the same type. Because it's a Yukawa-like interaction, right? So X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

Now, the question is about the kinematically allowed decays. For a decay to be allowed, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair it's decaying into. Because each fermion would need to have energy to have mass m_fermion, so 2m_fermion ≤ m_X.

Wait, m_X is 6 GeV. So I need to find all fermions where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. Let's think about the masses of the known fermions.

The fermion masses I remember are:

- Up quark: around 2 MeV (but actually, the u quark is light, but it's part of the proton, etc.)
- Down quark: about 4-5 MeV.
- Strange quark: about 95-100 MeV.
- Charm quark: about 1.2-1.5 GeV.
- Bottom quark: about 4.5-4.7 GeV.
- Top quark: way too heavy, around 173 GeV.
- Electron: negligible, ~0.0005 GeV.
- Muon: ~0.1 GeV (105.7 MeV).
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV.
- Neutrinos: even lighter, but since their masses are negligible
