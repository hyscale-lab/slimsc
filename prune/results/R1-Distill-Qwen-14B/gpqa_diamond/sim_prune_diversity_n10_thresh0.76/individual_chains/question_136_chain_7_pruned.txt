Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude is given as f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. We need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is probably to compute the divergence of this vector field and then integrate it over the volume of the sphere. I remember from my notes that the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface, but wait, does that help here? Or should I just compute the divergence directly?

Wait, the divergence theorem says that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux of the vector field through the surface enclosing that volume. So if I can find the flux, maybe that's easier than computing the divergence and integrating. But wait, for that, I need to know the vector field's behavior on the surface. The problem doesn't give the flux, so maybe that's not the way to go. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the divergence in spherical coordinates.

Right, the field is radial and its magnitude is 1/r². So in spherical coordinates, the vector field f(r) would have components (f_r, 0, 0), because only the radial component is non-zero. So f = (1/r²) r̂, where r̂ is the radial unit vector.

Now, I need to find the divergence of this field in spherical coordinates. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is:

∇ · f = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(f_θ sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂φ/∂φ

Wait, but in our case, the vector field only has an f_r component, and all other components (fθ and fφ) are zero. So the terms involving θ and φ derivatives will be zero. So:

∇ · f = (1/(r²)) d/dr ( r² f_r )

Because fθ and fφ are zero, their derivatives will be zero. So substituting f_r = 1/r²:

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr ( r² * (1/r²) ) 

Simplify the expression inside the derivative: r² * (1/r²) is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇ · f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0. 

Wait, that's interesting. So the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin where r=0, because 1/r² has a singularity there. But wait, the origin is a point, and in volume integrals, points don't contribute. So the integral over any volume that doesn't include the origin would be zero. But in our case, the sphere is centered at the origin with radius R, so it definitely includes the origin
