Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice science question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let's see. The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium.

Wait, what do I know about LTE and excited energy levels? Oh right, in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy states to the temperature of the system.

The Boltzmann equation is something like the ratio of the populations of two states, say n_upper and n_lower, is equal to (g_upper / g_lower) multiplied by exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the populations (n) are given in terms of being twice as excited. Wait, the problem says atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So for star_1, the population of the excited state is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level? Or is it that the ratio of n_upper to n_lower is twice as much for star_1 compared to star_2?

Wait, I think the question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, n1/n2 = 2, where n is the population of the specific energy level. But wait, no, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Maybe I'm misinterpreting that. Oh, perhaps the number of excited atoms is twice as much as in star_2 for the same level. So the ratio n_upper for star_1 over n_upper for star_2 is 2.

Wait, but wait, the energy levels might have a certain degeneracy. But the problem doesn't mention anything about the degeneracy (g) of the levels, so perhaps we can assume that the ratio of g_upper to g_lower is the same for both stars, so it cancels out in the ratio of their n_upper/n_lower.

So let's model this. Let me denote the ratio of the populations for each star. For star 1, n1_upper / n1_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star 2, n2_upper / n2_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, but I'm not entirely clear on what is meant by 'excited in a specific energy level'. Oh, perhaps it's the ratio of the population of that energy level compared to the ground state?

Wait, maybe the number of atoms in the excited state relative to the ground state for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, (n_upper)/(n_lower) = 2 * [ (n_upper of star_2)/(n_lower of star_
