Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about the stability of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. We have a solution where the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate ion concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, so first, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, the species with the highest β should be the most predominant one.

Wait, but what's the order of the complexes? Let me think. For Co(II) with SCN-, the complexes would form step by step. The first would be Co(SCN)²+, then Co(SCN)₂²+, and so on. Each β represents the formation from the previous complex. So, β1 is for the first SCN- binding, β2 for the second, etc.

So the complexes are probably Co²+ (free ion), Co(SCN)²+, Co(SCN)₂²+, Co(SCN)₃²+, and Co(SCN)₄²+. Each successive β is the formation constant for adding another SCN-.

Wait, but the β values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, that's interesting because β4 is lower than β3. So the fourth complex is less stable than the third. So the most stable complex is Co(SCN)₃²+.

But wait, the question is about the "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, right? So that's the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex. So we're being asked to find the percentage of Co(SCN)₂²+ among all cobalt species.

Wait, but why not the most stable one? Because the problem is specifically about dithiocyanato, which is the second complex.

So I need to find the fraction of Co(SCN)₂²+ compared to all cobalt species (including the free ion and all complexes up to the fourth).

So, to calculate the distribution of each species, I think I need to use the formation constants and calculate the fractions based on the log of the product of βs divided by the appropriate terms.

Alternatively, maybe using the fraction formula for each species. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the free ion, considering the formation constants.

But I remember that when you have multiple formation steps, the fraction of each species can be determined by considering the cumulative effect of all the formation constants up to that point and the subsequent steps.

Wait, let's think about the general approach. The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the species:

Co²+ + Co(SCN)²+ + Co(SCN)₂²+ + Co(SCN)₃²+ + Co(SCN)₄²+.

But each species forms from the previous one by adding another SCN-.

The fraction of each species can be found using the stepwise formation constants. So, the fraction f_n of the complex with n SCN- ligands is given by:

f_n = (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) / (1 + β1 + β1β2 + β1β2β3 + ... + β1β2β3β4)

Wait, is that right? Or maybe I should think in terms of the cumulative product of the β's up to that point, and then divide by the sum of all possible products up to the fourth.

Alternatively, perhaps each species is determined by the product of the β's for each step up to that species, divided by the sum over all possible species of the same product for each.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the logarithms and the distribution based on the relative stabilities.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote the different complexes as:

Species 0: Co²+ (free ion)
Species 1: Co(SCN)²+
Species 2: Co(SCN)₂²+
Species 3: Co(SCN)₃²+
Species 4: Co(SCN)₄²+

Each step, the formation constant is given by βn. So β1 is for the first SCN- addition, β2 for the second, etc.

The fraction of each species can be determined by the relative formation constants. So the fraction f_n for species n is:

f_n = (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) / (1 + β1 + β1β2 + β1β2β3 + β1β2β3β4)

Wait, but in this case, since β4 is the formation constant for the fourth complex, and β3 is for the third.

Wait, but the formation constant for species 4 is β4, but to get species 4, you multiply all the βs up to β4.

No, wait: each β is the stepwise formation constant. So to form species 2, you need β1 and β2. So the fraction f2 would be (β1 * β2) / (sum of all possible products up to β4).

But I need to compute the sum of all possible terms, each term being the product of the βs up to that species.

Wait, the total sum S is:

S = 1 + β1 + β1β2 + β1β2β3 + β1β2β3β4

Each term in the sum represents the contribution of each species. The first term (1) is for the free ion (species 0). The second term (β1) is for species 1, but wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, actually, the formation of species 1 involves the first binding, so the fraction f1 is (β1) / S', where S' is the sum of terms that include all possible species.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look up the formula for the distribution of species with multiple formation constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the fraction of each species using the formula:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) / (1 + β1 + β1 β2 + β1 β2 β3 + β1 β2 β3 β4)

Because each species n requires the product of the first n β's, and the denominator is the sum of all possible products for all species, including the free ion (which is 1, since it's before any β).

So in this case:

f_0 = 1 / S  
f_1 = β1 / S  
f_2 = β1 β2 / S  
f_3 = β1 β2 β3 / S  
f_4 = β1 β2 β3 β4 / S  

Where S is the sum of all terms: 1 + β1 + β1β2 + β1β2β3 + β1β2β3β4.

Wait, no. Because for f_4, you would have the product up to β4, which is β1β2β3β4. And the denominator S includes all terms up to that product.

Yes, that makes sense. So each f_n is the product of the first n βs divided by S, where S is the sum of all products from 0 to 4 ligands.

So first, I need to compute S = 1 + β1 + β1β2 + β1β2β3 + β1β2β3β4.

Let me plug in the given β values:

β1 = 9  
β2 = 40  
β3 = 63  
β4 = 16

So calculating each term:

Term0: 1  
Term1: β1 = 9  
Term2: β1 * β2 = 9 *40= 360  
Term3: β1*β2*β3 = 9*40*63= Let's see: 9*40=360, 360*63=22680  
Term4: β1*β2*β3*β4= 22680 *16= 362880

So S = 1 +9 + 360 + 22680 + 362880.

Let me calculate this:

1 +9 =10  
10+360=370  
370 +22680=23050  
23050 +362880= 385930.

So S = 385930.

Then, the fractions are:

f0=1 / 385930 ≈ 2.592e-6  
f1=9 / 385930 ≈ 2.332e-5  
f2=(9*40)=360 /385930 ≈ 0.0009329  
Wait, wait, 360 divided by 385,930 is approximately 0.0009329.

Wait, no, let's compute 360 / 385930. Let me calculate that.

360 / 385930 ≈ 0.0009329.

Similarly:

f3=9*40*63 =22680 / 385930 ≈ 0.05884.

f4=9*40*63*16=362880 /385930 ≈ 0.9406.

Wait, let me calculate each:

f0 = 1 / 385930 ≈ 2.592e-6  
f1 = 9 / 385930 ≈ 2.332e-5  
f2 = 360 / 385930 ≈ 0.0009329  
f3 = 22680 / 385930 ≈ 0.05884  
f4 =362880 /385930≈ 0.9406.

Wait, but wait, S is 385,930, right? So 362,880 is 94% of that. Hmm.

Wait, but the sum S is 385,930, and the last term is 362,880, which is about 94% of the sum. So the majority of the species would be Co(SCN)₄²+.

But the question is about the percentage of Co(SCN)₂²+ (the dithiocyanato complex), which is species 2.

So f2 is approximately 0.0009329, which is 0.09329%, which is like 0.093%. That can't be right because the options are all higher percentages.

Wait, that can't be correct. I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait a second, perhaps I've confused β4. The problem says β4 is 16. Wait, but the formation of the fourth complex (Co(SCN)₄²+) would require β4. So, the product for species 4 is β1*β2*β3*β4.

Wait, but maybe the stability constants are given as cumulative βs, not stepwise. No, the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So I think they are stepwise, not cumulative.

Wait, maybe I should check that. Stability constants can be either cumulative or stepwise. In this case, the β's given are probably the stepwise formation constants. So each β represents the addition of one SCN- to the previous complex.

Wait, but let's think about that. If β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN)²+ from Co²+ and SCN-, then β1 = [Co(SCN)]+/([Co²+][SCN^-]).

β2 is the formation constant for Co(SCN)₂²+ from Co(SCN)²+ and SCN^-: β2 = [Co(SCN)₂] / ([Co(SCN)] [SCN^-]).

So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)₂²+ is β1 * β2.

Similarly, for Co(SCN)₃²+, it's β1 * β2 * β3, and for Co(SCN)₄²+, it's β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

So the initial approach is correct.

But then the fractions I calculated earlier suggest that species 4 is about 94% of the total. So why are the answer options all much higher?

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the concentration of each species, considering the concentrations of the reactants.

Wait, wait! In the problem, the concentrations are given as [Co] = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. But in the fraction calculation, I assumed that all the Co is distributed among the species, but perhaps I should account for the fact that each complex has a certain number of SCN- ions.

Wait, perhaps the approach isn't just about the distribution based on βs, but also considering the concentrations of free SCN-.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Maybe I should model this using the formation constants and the given concentrations of Co and SCN-.

Let me consider that the total cobalt concentration is [Co_total] = [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃] + [Co(SCN)₄].

Similarly, the thiocyanate concentration is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

But each complex has a certain number of SCN- ions. So for each complex:

[Co(SCN)] = β1 [Co²+] [SCN^-]  
[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 [Co(SCN)] [SCN^-] = β1 β2 [Co²+] [SCN^-]^2  
[Co(SCN)₃] = β3 [Co(SCN)₂] [SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 [Co²+] [SCN^-]^3  
[Co(SCN)₄] = β4 [Co(SCN)₃] [SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co²+] [SCN^-]^4  

So, if I let [Co²+] = x, then:

[Co(SCN)] = β1 x [SCN^-]  
[Co(SCN)₂] = β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2  
[Co(SCN)₃] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3  
[Co(SCN)₄] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4  

The total Co concentration is:

x + β1 x [SCN^-] + β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4 = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

We can factor x from all terms:

x [ 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ] = 1e-2.

So, x = 1e-2 / [1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ].

Let me plug in the numbers.

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. [SCN] =0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term0: 1  
Term1: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9  
Term2: β1β2 [SCN]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 =3.6  
Term3: β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 =9*40*63*(0.1)^3 = (9*40=360)*63=22680; 22680 * (0.001)=22.68  
Term4: β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 =9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4 = (9*40=360)*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880; 362880*(0.0001)=36.288  

Sum all terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9  
1.9 + 3.6=5.5  
5.5 +22.68=28.18  
28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

Thus, x = 1e-2 /64.468 ≈ 1.55e-4 M.

So [Co²+] is approximately 1.55e-4 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex can be found:

[Co(SCN)] = β1 x [SCN] =9 *1.55e-4 *0.1 =9 *1.55e-5 =1.395e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)₂] = β1 β2 x [SCN]^2 =9*40 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^2.

Wait, let me compute that:

9 *40 = 360.

360 * (0.1)^2 =360 * 0.01 =3.6.

3.6 * x (1.55e-4) =3.6 *1.55e-4=5.58e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)₂] is 5.58e-4 M.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)₃] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3.

Compute denominator:

β1 β2 β3 =9*40*63=9*2520=22680.

22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68.

22.68 * x (1.55e-4) =22.68 *1.55e-4 ≈ 3.519e-3 M.

And [Co(SCN)₄] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4.

β1 β2 β3 β4=9*40*63*16= let's compute step by step.

9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880.

362880 * (0.1)^4 =362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

36.288 * x (1.55e-4) =36.288 *1.55e-4 ≈ 5.636e-3 M.

Wait, but let's check each calculation:

Wait, [Co(SCN)₄] = β1β2β3β4 x [SCN]^4.

= (9 *40 *63 *16) * x * (0.1)^4

Compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16=362880.

So 362880 * x * (0.1)^4.

x is 1.55e-4.

So 362880 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^4.

Wait, 1.55e-4 * (0.1)^4=1.55e-4 *1e-4=1.55e-8.

362880 * 1.55e-8 = (362880 *1.55) *1e-8.

362880 *1.55: Let's compute that.

362880 *1.5 = 544,320.

362880 *0.05 =18,144.

Total: 544320 +18144 =562,464.

So 562,464 *1e-8 =5.62464e-3 M ≈5.625e-3 M.

So all concentrations:

[Co²+] ≈1.55e-4 M  
[Co(SCN)] ≈1.395e-4 M  
[Co(SCN)₂] ≈5.58e-4 M  
[Co(SCN)₃] ≈3.519e-3 M  
[Co(SCN)₄] ≈5.625e-3 M  

But wait, let's sum all these to check if they add up to 1e-2 M.

Sum =1.55e-4 +1.395e-4 +5.58e-4 +3.519e-3 +5.625e-3.

Convert all to the same exponent:

1.55e-4 =0.000155  
1.395e-4=0.0001395  
5.58e-4=0.000558  
3.519e-3=0.003519  
5.625e-3=0.005625.

Sum: 0.000155 +0.0001395=0.0002945  
+0.000558=0.0008525  
+0.003519=0.0043715  
+0.005625=0.0099965 M.

Which is approximately 0.01 M, so that checks out.

Now, the question is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. So that's [Co(SCN)₂]²+.

[Co(SCN)₂] is 5.58e-4 M.

The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, so the percentage is (5.58e-4 / 0.01) *100% =5.58%.

Wait, that's about 5.58%, but looking at the options, the closest is D) 16.9%. Hmm, but that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the fractions.

Wait another approach: the fraction is (5.58e-4) / (1e-2) = 0.0558, which is 5.58%.

But none of the options are around 5.58%. The options are 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 16.9%.

Hmm, so I must have messed up something in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms for the denominator.

Let me recheck the denominator calculation.

Denominator terms:

Term0:1  
Term1: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9  
Term2: β1β2 [SCN]^2=9*40 *0.01=360 *0.01=3.6  
Term3: β1β2β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63 *0.001 = (9*40=360) *63=22680 *0.001=22.68  
Term4: β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 *0.0001=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So sum terms:

1 +0.9=1.9  
+3.6=5.5  
+22.68=28.18  
+36.288=64.468.

That's correct.

So x =1e-2 /64.468 = approx 1.55e-4 M.

Then [Co(SCN)₂] is β1 β2 x [SCN]^2.

β1 β2 =9*40=360.

[SCN]^2=0.01.

So 360 *1.55e-4 *0.01 =360 *1.55e-6 =5.58e-4 M.

Which is 0.000558 M.

So the fraction is 0.000558 /0.01 =0.0558, 5.58%.

Wait, but none of the options are close to 5.58%.

Hmm, maybe I've misunderstood the problem. The question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Could the blue complex be Co(SCN)₂ or another species?

Wait, I know that in the case of cobalt complexes, the color can vary with the number of ligands. For instance, [Co(SCN)]^+ is brown, [Co(SCN)₂]^+ is blue, and so on. So the blue complex is Co(SCN)₂²+.

So our calculation is correct; it's approximately 5.58%. But the options don't have this. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the formation constants are given as cumulative βs, not stepwise. Let me think.

Wait, in that case, the formation constants would be such that β1 is for Co(SCN)²+, β2 for Co(SCN)₂²+, β3 for Co(SCN)₃²+, and β4 for Co(SCN)₄²+.

But in that case, the formula would be different. Let me see.

If β1 is the cumulative constant for Co(SCN)²+, then the fraction for each species would be calculated using each β, not the product of all previous βs.

Wait, so if β1 is the overall constant for Co(SCN)²+, β2 for Co(SCN)₂²+, etc., then the fractions would be f_n = βn / (1 + β1 + β2 + β3 + β4).

Wait, but this would be the case only if each β is the cumulative constant, not stepwise.

But the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

If they are cumulative, then the stepwise β's would be different. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach I took earlier was wrong because I didn't account for the fact that each complex requires multiple SCN- ions, and the actual concentration of free SCN- affects the distribution.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is about the fraction of all cobalt species that are in the dithiocyanato form, which is [Co(SCN)₂²+]/[Co_total].

Which is what I calculated as 5.58%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I need to consider the possibility that the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires the use of the stability sequences, but the total concentration is fixed, and the fraction is calculated by log considerations.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the fraction of each species as:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n )

But I think that's what I did earlier.

Wait, but that gives me 5.58% for [Co(SCN)₂], which is not an option.

So perhaps I need to re-express the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as the distribution based on the logarithm of the product of the β's and the [SCN] terms.

Wait, another approach: the fraction of each species can be calculated as:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... β4 [SCN]^4 )

Yes, that's what I did earlier.

Wait, but then the same result of 5.58% holds, which doesn't match any options.

So perhaps I should re-examine the given data.

Wait, the given [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. That's a relatively high concentration, which would favor the formation of complexes with more SCN- ligands. So the higher β's would dominate.

Wait, the β values are as follows:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So β3 is the highest, followed by β2, then β1, and β4 is lower than β3.

So the most stable complex is Co(SCN)₃²+.

But the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is species 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations of the concentrations.

Let me recalculate the terms in the denominator.

Denominator terms:

Term0:1  
Term1: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9  
Term2: β1β2 [SCN]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6  
Term3: β1β2β3 [SCN]^3= 9*40*63*(0.1)^3 =22680 *0.001=22.68  
Term4: β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum:1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

Yes, that's correct.

So x=1e-2/64.468≈1.55e-4.

Then [Co(SCN)₂] is β1β2 x [SCN]^2=9*40 *1.55e-4 *0.01=360 *1.55e-6=5.58e-4.

So 5.58e-4 over 1e-2 is 5.58%.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I forgot to consider that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, but each complex requires multiple SCN- ions, so perhaps the overall [SCN^-] available is less.

Wait, but the problem says [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which includes both free and bound SCN^-.

So, when calculating [Co(SCN)₂], it's β1β2 x [SCN^-]^2, which accounts for the free SCN^-.

I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I have misapplied the formula and should instead compute each species' concentration using the formation constants relative to the free ion.

Wait, another approach is to compute the distribution using the formula for each species.

The fraction of each species can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which is the same as I did earlier.

So, with these calculations, the dithiocyanato complex is about 5.58% of the total cobalt species.

But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I've misunderstood the question.

Wait, the question asks for the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. Perhaps the blue complex is Co(SCN)₃²+, not Co(SCN)₂²+?

But I thought blue was Co(SCN)₂²+. Maybe I'm wrong. Let me think.

Wait, from what I remember, [Co(SCN)]²+ is brown, [Co(SCN)₂]²+ is blue, [Co(SCN)₃]²+ is green, and [Co(SCN)₄]²- is violet or something.

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps the colors are different. If the blue complex is Co(SCN)₃²+, then my calculation for [Co(SCN)₃] is about 3.52 mM, which is 3.52 mM /10 mM = 35.2% of the total cobalt.

Wait, 3.52 mM is 0.00352 M, and 1e-2 M is 0.01 M.

0.00352 /0.01 =0.352, which is 35.2%. But that's not one of the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is Co(SCN)₄²-.

Wait, no, that's usually more violet, I think.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption about the color is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the calculation is correct, but the options are wrong. But I doubt that.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the fraction is given by another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula where the fraction is (βn [SCN]^n) / sum(βk [SCN]^k) for k=0 to 4.

Wait, but β0 is 1 (since [Co²+] is the free ion, so β0 is 1).

But in our case, each β is stepwise, not cumulative. So perhaps the fraction is (β1 β2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which is exactly what I did earlier. So the fraction is 5.58%.

But that's not matching any options. So perhaps I need to re-express the problem.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are given as logβ, and I have to convert them. But the question states that the stability constants are β1=9, etc., which are in terms of K, not log K.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the fractions using the reciprocal of β, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using a different way to compute the fractions, such as considering each complex relative to the total possible, not considering the stepwise formation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the use of the formula where the fraction is (β2) / (1 + β1 + β2 + β3 + β4), but I think that's incorrect because each β is stepwise and depends on the previous steps.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the logarithm of each term and use that to determine the dominant species, but that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]²+ to the total cobalt concentration, which we did as 5.58%.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption that the β's are stepwise.

Wait, what if the β's are the overall formation constants for each complex, meaning that β1 is for Co(SCN)²+, β2 for Co(SCN)₂²+, etc.?

In that case, the formation constants would be:

β1 for Co(SCN)²+ = [Co(SCN)] / ([Co²+][SCN^-])

β2 for Co(SCN)₂²+ = [Co(SCN)₂] / ([Co(SCN)] [SCN^-])

So the stepwise βs would be different.

Wait, but in this case, to find [Co(SCN)₂], we would have to use β1 and β2 as the overall constants for each complex.

Hmm, perhaps this is the correct approach.

So, if each β is the cumulative formation constant up to that complex, then:

[Co(SCN)] = β1 [Co²+][SCN^-]

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2

[Co(SCN)₃] = β3 [Co²+][SCN^-]^3

[Co(SCN)₄] = β4 [Co²+][SCN^-]^4

But that can't be right because in reality, each complex builds on the previous one.

Wait, if β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN)²+, then [Co(SCN)] = β1 [Co²+][SCN^-].

If β2 is the formation constant for Co(SCN)₂²+, then [Co(SCN)₂] = β2 [Co(SCN)] [SCN^-] = β2 β1 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)₃] = β3 [Co(SCN)₂][SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 [Co²+][SCN^-]^3.

So, it's the same as before. So the fractions are as I calculated.

So that's not the issue.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the distribution using the formula:

For each n, f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN]^n / D, where D is the denominator.

Which is what I did.

So, I think my calculation is correct, but the answer is not among the options. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: the concentration of [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, but perhaps the total concentration includes both the free and the complex-bound SCN-.

Wait, but the [SCN^-] given is the total concentration, which includes all forms (free and bound). So when computing [Co(SCN)₂], it's β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of x.

x = [Co²+] = 1e-2 / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which is 1e-2 / (1 + 0.9 + 3.6 +22.68 +36.288) = 1e-2 /64.468 ≈1.55e-4 M.

That's correct.

So [Co(SCN)₂] is 5.58e-4 M, which is 5.58% of the total.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the percentage of all species except the free Co²+.

No, the question says "among all cobalt containing species," which includes all complexes and the free ion.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the β4 value. It's 16, which is lower than β3. So the fourth complex is less stable than the third. That would mean that the most abundant species is Co(SCN)₃²+, not the fourth.

But according to our calculations, [Co(SCN)₄] is about 5.6e-3 M, which is higher than [Co(SCN)₃], which is 3.5e-3 M.

But according to β3=63 (highest), perhaps the third complex should be the most abundant.

Hmm, perhaps the calculation is correct but the higher β4 allows the fourth complex to have a higher concentration.

But according to the denominator, the fourth term is the largest (36.288), so the fourth species is the most abundant.

Hmm.

But according to the fractions:

[Co(SCN)₄] is 5.6e-3, which is about 56% of the total.

[Co(SCN)₃] is 3.5e-3, about 35%.

[Co(SCN)₂] is 5.58e-4, about 5.58%.

[Co(SCN)] is 1.395e-4, about 1.4%.

[Co²+] is 1.55e-4, about 1.55%.

So the major species are the fourth (56%) and third (35%).

So the percentage for the second species is around 5.58%, which is not in the options.

So perhaps I'm missing something. Another possibility is that the [SCN^-] given is 0.1 M, but when considering the complexes, the total [SCN^-] can be calculated as 0.1 M.

Wait, but the [SCN^-] used in the calculations is the total, so it's already 0.1 M.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the problem refers to "the blue dithiocyanato complexes," which are [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ and [Co(SCN)₂]^+, but the charge might not matter here.

Wait, no, in this case, all species are Co²+ complexes.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to [Co(SCN)₂] as a dimer or something else, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage in terms of moles of SCN, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the question asks for the percentage of blue complexes among all species, but the blue species is the one with two SCN- ligands, but perhaps there's another isomer or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the β4 should be β3 * β4, but I think that's not the case.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the simplified assumption that only the first three complexes are formed, ignoring the fourth. But that's not the case because β4 is given.

Alternatively, perhaps the β4 is for the third complex, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the β values are in the order of β1=16, β2=63, β3=40, β4=9. But that would change the entire calculation, but the question gives them as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm a bit stuck. My calculations don't match the options, but I can't find where I went wrong. Maybe I should proceed to the next step and see if the answer is option C) 38.1%, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [Co(SCN)₂]. Let me re-calculate [Co(SCN)₂]:

β1=9, β2=40.

[Co(SCN)₂] = β1 * β2 * x * [SCN^-]^2.

x is 1.55e-4.

[SCN^-]^2= (0.1)^2=0.01.

So 9 *40 =360.

360 * 1.55e-4 = 360 * 1.55e-4 = 0.0558.

Wait, but that's 0.0558 M, but that can't be right because the total cobalt is 0.01 M.

Wait, wait a second! Oh no, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate [Co(SCN)₂].

Wait, the formula is [Co(SCN)₂] = β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2.

Which is (9)(40)(x)(0.1)^2.

x is 1.55e-4.

So:

9 *40=360.

360 *1.55e-4= 360 * 0.000155 = 0.0558.

Wait, that's 0.0558 M? But that's larger than the total of 0.01 M. That can't be right.

Wait, no. Because x is 1.55e-4 M.

So 360 *1.55e-4 = 0.0558 M? That would mean [Co(SCN)₂] is 0.0558 M, which is way beyond the total cobalt concentration of 0.01 M.

That's impossible. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, no, because [Co(SCN)₂] is β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2.

So:

β1 β2 =360.

x=1.55e-4 M.

[SCN^-]^2=0.01.

So,

360 * 1.55e-4 *0.01 =360 * 1.55e-6= 5.58e-4 M.

Ah, I see. So the correct [Co(SCN)₂] is 5.58e-4 M, as I calculated earlier.

So it's 0.000558 M, which is 5.58% of the total.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of all complexes, not including the free ion.

In that case, the total would be:

[Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃] + [Co(SCN)₄] =0.0001395 +0.000558 +0.003519 +0.005625= 0.0098415 M.

So the percentage for [Co(SCN)₂] would be (0.000558 /0.0098415)*100≈5.67%.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the βs are given in different orders. Maybe β1 is for the fourth complex. But that would require a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly written, and the β4 is 63, β3 is 16. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, but each complex requires a certain number of SCN- ions, so the total SCN- used is sum(n * [Co(SCN)n]) = 1* [Co²+] + 1*[Co(SCN)] +2*[Co(SCN)₂] +3*[Co(SCN)₃] +4*[Co(SCN)₄].

But the problem states that the total [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which includes both free and bound.

So,

[SCN^-]total = [SCN^-]free + [Co(SCN)] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] +3[Co(SCN)₃] +4[Co(SCN)₄].

But I don't have [SCN^-]free, so perhaps this complicates things further.

Wait, but in our earlier approach, we treated [SCN^-] as 0.1 M, which includes all species, so the calculations should already account for that.

So, I think the initial approach was correct, but the answer doesn't match the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the β4 as 16. Wait, what if β4 is 160 instead of 16? That would change things, but the question says β4=16.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps I should calculate the fraction of Co(SCN)₂ using the formula:

f2 = (β2) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + ... )

But that doesn't make sense because β2 is a stepwise constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction is calculated as:

f2 = (β1 β2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which is exactly what I did earlier.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think my calculations are correct, but perhaps the intended approach is different. Maybe the answer intended is option C) 38.1%, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fraction differently. Let's try another approach.

The fraction of each species can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) / (beta_total)

where beta_total = 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, which is the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the percentage of all possible dithiocyanato complexes, which includes both Co(SCN)₂²+ and Co(SCN)₂^+, but in this case, all species have a +2 charge.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the percentage of all complexes that have two SCN- ligands, regardless of the charge. But that doesn't change anything.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the denominator should be computed without including the [SCN] terms. Let me think.

No, that doesn't make sense because the [SCN] is part of the formation constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is just the sum of the β products, without the [SCN] terms. Let's see:

Denominator would be 1 +9 + (9*40) + (9*40*63) + (9*40*63*16) =1 +9 +360 +22680 +362880= 385930.

Then, f2= (9*40) /385930=360/385930≈0.0009329, which is 0.09329%, which is even smaller than before.

No, that can't be right.

Hmm.

At this point, I think the correct answer according to my calculations is approximately 5.58%, but since it's not among the options, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C) 38.1%, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using logβ values, and I need to compute using logarithms.

Wait, another approach: compute the log of each term in the denominator and see which term is dominant.

But that's probably not necessary here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the stability sequence to find the dominant species and then find the percentage of the desired species.

But without knowing the exact approach, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the ratio of [Co(SCN)₂] to [Co(SCN)₄], as [Co(SCN)₄] is the most dominant.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 38.1%, but I don't know how to get there.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the ratio of [Co(SCN)₂] to the sum of all species beyond the first.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the answer is option D)16.9%, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the reciprocal of the βs.

Wait, for [Co(SCN)₂], the fraction would be (1/β2) / sum(1/βn + ... ), but that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction is calculated using (βn)^(-1), but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possible approaches, but the correct answer according to my calculations isn't among the options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fraction using the following approach:

The fraction of each species is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n ) / Σ (β1 β2 ... βk [SCN]^k ), where k runs from 0 to 4.

In this case, the denominator is the same as before: 64.468.

So, for n=2, f2= (9*40*(0.1)^2) /64.468 = 360 *0.01 /64.468=3.6 /64.468≈0.0558, which is 5.58%.

Same result.

So I think the correct answer is approximately 5.58%, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 38.1%, which is close to 360/940 (if the denominator were 940 instead of 64.468), but I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be (β2)/(β_total), where β_total is the sum of β's, but that would be 40/(9+40+63+16)=40/(128)=0.3125, 31.25%, which is not an option.

Hmm.

Well, given the options, the closest to my calculation is option D)16.9%, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula where the fraction is (βn)/(β_total), where β_total is the sum of all β's.

But in that case, β2=40, sum=9+40+63+16=128.

40/128=0.3125, 31.25%, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is the sum of all products up to β4, which is 385930, and the fraction is (9*40)=360/385930≈0.093%, which is not an option.

Hmm.

Perhaps the intended approach is to consider only the first three complexes, ignoring the fourth. Let's try that.

So, denominator would be 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3.

Which is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68=28.18.

Then, [Co²+] =1e-2 /28.18 ≈3.55e-4.

Then [Co(SCN)₂]= β1 β2 x [SCN]^2=9*40 *3.55e-4 *0.01=360 *3.55e-6=1.278e-3.

Fraction is 1.278e-3 /1e-2=0.1278, 12.78%, which is close to option D)16.9%, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is up to β3, so the fraction would be 22.68 /28.18≈0.805, 80.5% for [Co(SCN)₃], but that's not the question.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use only the third β, β3=63, and ignore the others. But that doesn't make sense.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the ratio of [Co(SCN)₂] to [Co(SCN)₄], and then finding the percentage.

But [Co(SCN)₂] is 5.58e-4, [Co(SCN)₄] is5.625e-3.

So, (5.58e-4)/(5.625e-3)= approx 0.1, 10%.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Well, at this point, I think I've made all possible attempts, and perhaps the intended answer is option C)38.1%, but I can't see the logic behind it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial denominator calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate the denominator:

Term0:1  
Term1:9 *0.1=0.9  
Term2:9*40 *0.01=3.6  
Term3:9*40*63 *0.001=22.68  
Term4:9*40*63*16 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum:1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

Correct.

So, perhaps the problem is in the way the βs are used. Maybe the βs are the overall constants, not stepwise.

But then, how would that affect the calculation?

Wait, if β1 is the overall constant for Co(SCN)²+, then:

[Co(SCN)] = β1 [Co²+][SCN^-].

Similarly, β2 is the overall constant for Co(SCN)₂²+:

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2.

But that's not correct because each complex builds on the previous.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the βs are given as the overall constants, and the species are:

Co²+, Co(SCN)²+, Co(SCN)₂²+, etc.

In that case, the fraction of each species would be:

f_n = (βn) / (1 + β1 + β2 + β3 + β4).

So, for [Co(SCN)₂], f2=β2 / (sum of all βs).

Sum of βs:9+40+63+16=128.

β2=40.

So f2=40/128=0.3125, 31.25%, which is closest to option C)38.1%, but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is sum of βs multiplied by [SCN] terms.

Wait, but that's unclear.

I think I've tried all possible approaches, and I can't find a way to match the options. Therefore, I'll conclude that the correct answer based on my calculations is approximately 5.58%, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)38.1%.


The problem involves determining the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, specifically Co(SCN)₂²+, among all cobalt-containing species in a solution. The total cobalt concentration is given as \( [\text{Co}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), and the thiocyanate concentration is \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are provided: \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), and \( \beta_4 = 16 \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Understanding Stability Constants**: The stability constants (\( \beta \)) represent the stepwise formation of cobalt thiocyanato complexes. The higher the \( \beta \), the more stable the complex. The complexes form sequentially:
   - Co²+ (free ion),
   - Co(SCN)²+,
   - Co(SCN)₂²+,
   - Co(SCN)₃²+,
   - Co(SCN)₄²+.

2. **Fraction of Each Species**: The fraction of each species is determined using the formula:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 \dots \beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}
   \]
   where \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \).

3. **Denominator Calculation**: The denominator is the sum of terms representing all possible cobalt species:
   \[
   S = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   S = 1 + 9(0.1) + 9(40)(0.1)^2 + 9(40)(63)(0.1)^3 + 9(40)(63)(16)(0.1)^4
   \]
   \[
   S = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468
   \]

4. **Concentration of Co(SCN)₂²+**:
   The concentration of Co(SCN)₂²+ is given by:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2^{2+}] = \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}]^2
   \]
   First, calculate \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \):
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{[\text{Co}_{\text{total}}]}{S} = \frac{10^{-2}}{64.468} \approx 1.55 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}
   \]
   Then:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2^{2+}] = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 1.55 \times 10^{-4} \cdot (0.1)^2 = 5.58 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}
   \]

5. **Percentage of Co(SCN)₂²+**:
   The percentage of Co(SCN)₂²+ is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2^{2+}]}{[\text{Co}_{\text{total}}]} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{5.58 \times 10^{-4}}{10^{-2}} \right) \times 100 \approx 5.58\%
   \]

6. **Mismatch with Options**: The calculated percentage (5.58%) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **C) 38.1%**, which may reflect an alternative interpretation or simplification of the problem.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations, the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is approximately \( 5.58\% \). However, since this value does not match the provided options, the most reasonable choice is **C) 38.1%**, potentially reflecting a different approach or assumption in the problem setup.

Answer: C
