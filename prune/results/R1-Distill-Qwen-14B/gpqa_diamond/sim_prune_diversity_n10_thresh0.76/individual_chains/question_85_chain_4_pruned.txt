Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets orbiting a star. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh wait, the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so that cancels out in the ratio. Good.

First, I need to find the equilibrium temperature formula. I think it's something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). But wait, since albedo is the same for both, (1 - albedo) will cancel when taking the ratio. So for the ratio, I can ignore that part.

Wait, but wait. Another way, the equilibrium temperature formula is T_p = T_s * (R_s/(2d))^0.5 * ( (1 - a) )^0.25. But yeah, since albedo a is same for both, it's a constant factor, so when taking the ratio, it'll cancel. So the ratio T1/T2 depends on (R_s/(2a1))^0.5 / (R_s/(2a2))^0.5 ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 ).

Wait a second, but that's only if the star's temperature is the same. Oh wait, the star's Teff is the same for both planets, right? Because both orbit the same star. So T_s is the same for both. So yes, T_p is proportional to sqrt(R_s/(2a)) ) * ... but R_s is same for both, so the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Because when you take the ratio T1/T2, the R_s and 2 and the star's Teff terms will all cancel out.

So to find the ratio, I need to find the ratio of their distances a1 and a2.

How do I find a1 and a2? The question provides data from the transit and radial velocity methods. I remember that the transit method gives the planet's radius (since it's the size that causes the dip in brightness), and the RV method gives the mass of the planet (since the star's wobble depends on mass and distance).

Wait, but wait. So, for each planet, the RV method gives the mass, which is given as 7 Earth masses and 5 Earth masses. But how do I get the distance from that?

I think the RV method measures the velocity of the star, which relates to the mass of the planet and the distance. The formula is something like M_p sin(i) = ( (K * P) / (2πG) )^(1/3) * (M_star + M_p)^(2/3). Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and orbital distance.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ), but that's really complicated. Perhaps an approximation is possible, given that M_p is much less than M_star. So M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1)/(2π) )^(1/3). But circular orbits have e=0, so sqrt(1-e²)=1. So it simplifies.

Wait, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * P ) / (2π) )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ] / ( (M_star )^(2/3) )

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Maybe I should look for a relation between K, planet mass, orbital period, star mass, and distance.

I recall that K is related
