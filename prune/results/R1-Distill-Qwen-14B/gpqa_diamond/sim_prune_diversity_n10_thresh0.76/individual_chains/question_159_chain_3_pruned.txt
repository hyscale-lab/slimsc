Alright, so I have this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, let's break it down. Okay, the question is about observations of a quasar showing a peak at 790 nm in near-infrared and optical spectra, and the flux drops below that. I remember that flux drop-off at shorter wavelengths could be due to something like the Lyman limit or the Lyman-alpha forest, but wait, the Lyman limit is around 91 nm. 790 nm is in the infrared, so maybe it's related to something else.

Wait, no, maybe it's about the redshift. Oh right! If the peak is at 790 nm but was emitted at a shorter wavelength, that would mean it's redshifted. For example, if the quasar emits light at a certain wavelength, but we observe it longer due to the expansion of the universe. So the emission line we're seeing is redshifted to 790 nm. 

What's a typical emission line that would be in the optical but observed in the infrared? The Lyman-alpha line is about 121 nm, but that's UV. If that's shifted to 790 nm, what's the redshift? Let me calculate that. The observed wavelength λ_obs is 790 nm. The rest wavelength λ_emit for Lyman-alpha is 121.6 nm. So the redshift z is (λ_obs / λ_emit) - 1. 

So z = (790 / 121.6) -1. Let me compute that. 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.499. So z ≈ 5.499. So about z ≈5.5. Wait, but wait. If the peak is at 790 nm, could it be the Lyman series? Alternatively, perhaps it's the Balmer series? The Balmer-alpha is about 656 nm, which is in optical. If observed at 790, that's longer, so redshifted. So that would give z = (790/656) -1 = approx 1.358.

Wait, but the flux drops at shorter wavelengths than 790. So if the emission line is at 790, and flux drops below that, maybe the line
