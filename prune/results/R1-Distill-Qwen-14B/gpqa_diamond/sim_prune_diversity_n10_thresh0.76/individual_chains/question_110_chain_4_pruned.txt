Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO and HIRES. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about determining which stars are observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES, considering their brightness limits. So, each spectrograph has a different magnitude limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, meaning apparent V mag ≤17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so apparent V mag ≤16.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." So, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag ≤17. HIRES can observe stars with V mag ≤16. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's not possible because lower magnitudes are brighter. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The apparent magnitude scale is such that lower numbers mean brighter objects. So, if a star has an apparent magnitude of 16, it's brighter than 17. So, if ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means it can see down to 17 mag. Similarly, HIRES can see down to 16 mag.

Wait, no. The wording says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, wait, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's magnitude less than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V ≤17. Because anything brighter (lower magnitude) is okay. So, any star with V mag up to 17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. HIRES can observe stars with V mag up to 16. Because "brighter than 16 mag" means V ≤16.

So, a star must have apparent magnitude ≤17 to be seen by ESPRESSO, and ≤16 to be seen by HIRES. Therefore, to be detectable by both, the star's apparent magnitude must be ≤16. Because if it's ≤16, both can see it. If it's between 16 and 17, only ESPRESSO can see it. So, any star with V mag ≤16 can be seen by both, and others can't.

Now, the question is, which of the given stars have apparent V mag ≤16? Because that's the condition for being detected by both.

Looking at the stars:

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, located at 10 pc. So, what's the apparent magnitude? The formula is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d) where d is distance in parsecs. So 5 log10(10) is 5*1=5. So m =15.5 +5=20.5. So apparent V mag
