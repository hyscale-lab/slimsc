Okay, so I have this complex question about a genetic construct and why a fluorescent signal isn't showing up. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the setup involves a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. They're looking at their developmental fate by using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Oh right, bicistronic means it has two ORFs in one vector, right? So the vector has two genes: the ligand and the receptor.

The vector details: The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So ligand is first, then receptor downstream. Wait, but how are the promoters and regulatory elements set up?

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember CBA is a strong promoter, often used for expression. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. Oh, IRES allows internal ribosome entry, which can drive the expression of the downstream gene, especially in certain cell types or conditions.

Now, there are stop cassettes in between. Between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So, in the absence of Cre, these stop cassettes block the expression of the downstream fluorescent proteins.

When Cre is introduced, it would recombine the lox sites. LoxP and lox2272 are different recognition sites for Cre. So, in the vector, the ligand is first, then a stop cassette (loxP), which Cre would cut, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the receptor would need the lox2272 site to be cut for eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse model, they're using SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development, so the Cre should be active in neural crest cells, right? So when the Cre is present, it should excise the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed, each with their fluorescent tags.

But in the experiment, when they visualize the mice under the confocal, they don't see a green signal. The eGFP is on the receptor, so they're expecting the receptor to be expressed and show green fluorescence. But there's no green.

Looking at the options:

Option A says ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But why would that cause no fluorescence? The construct should express the proteins regardless of their function. So probably not A.

Option B suggests the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. Maybe because it's not trafficked properly. But I don't see any info pointing to a trafficking issue. The question gives no details about the eGFP's localization; it's more about expression. Plus, the problem is in the Western blot, which would pick up proteins regardless of their location.

Option C says the enhancer for expression is missing. Wait, the construct uses CBA for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. CBA is a strong promoter. But if the enhancer is missing, maybe the expression isn't happening. Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working. But in the setup, the vector is designed so that the ligand is under CBA, so when the stop is removed, it should express. The receptor's expression relies on the IRES, which might work in certain cell types.

But wait, the mice are primary astrocyte cultures. Oh, but the transfection is into primary astrocytes. Wait, the initial experiments were in vitro with astrocytes, then the mouse model. Wait, the mouse model is made by breeding homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background, then crossed to SOX10-Cre. So the Cre is from the SOX10 line, active in neural crest-derived cells, like maybe in the skin or certain neurons.

So when they look for eGFP, they expect it in neural crest cells. But their Western blot showed the proteins were expressed because the signal is proportional to actin loading. Wait, no: the question says they ran a Western blot after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture. So in vitro, the construct is expressed when transfected, and they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, which detected the ligand and receptor. So the construct is working in vitro.

But in the mouse, they don't see the eGFP. So perhaps in the in vivo setup, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Let me think about the vector again. The vector is a bicistronic vector. The ligand is 5', under CBA, with a stop cassette. The receptor is 3', under IRES, with another stop cassette.

Wait, the setup says the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, which is flanked by loxP sites. Similarly, the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272.

When Cre is present, it recombines the loxP sites and the lox2272 sites. So the ligand-mCherry should be expressed, and the receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But in the mouse, which is homozygous for this construct, crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is hemizygous. So the offspring would have the construct and Cre.

Wait, but the construct includes the lox sites. So the Cre would delete the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the Western blot, they used primary astrocytes, which would express Cre if transfected, but in the mouse, the Cre is under SOX10, which is expressed in neural crest derivatives, not astrocytes necessarily.

Wait, but in the Western blot, they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, saw expression, implying that the construct works when Cre is present. So in the mouse, assuming Cre is present in the right tissues, the proteins should be expressed.

But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't showing up. Why?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh wait, the stop cassettes are between the receptor ORF and eGFP. The stop is in a lox2272 cassette. So when Cre deletes the stop, the receptor is in frame with eGFP. So if the ORF wasn't correctly placed, like frame shift, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But the question says the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor upstream of IRES. So the vector is designed such that the receptor is expressed via IRES, which is internal ribosome entry. IRES allows for the expression of the second gene without the need for a separate promoter. So if the eGFP is in frame, it should be expressed.

Wait, but wait. The vector is a bicistronic construct. So the first ORF is ligand (under CBA), and the second is receptor (under IRES). So when the stop cassettes are removed by Cre, the ligand is expressed along with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP.

But perhaps in the mouse, the Cre isn't excising both stops correctly. Or perhaps the IRES isn't working.

Wait, but another thought: the Western blot was done on transfected astrocytes. So in that case, the cells are transfected with the plasmid, which would have both ORFs. But in the mouse, the construct is presumably integrated into the genome, and perhaps in a context where the IRES isn't effective, or the promoter for the receptor isn't strong enough.

Wait, but the question says that after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes, the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin loading. So the proteins were expressed.

So in the mouse, why isn't the eGFP expressed?

Another possibility: maybe the eGFP is not properly tagged. Or perhaps the construct is not correctly designed.

Wait, the vector has the ligand ORF at 5', with a stop in a loxP cassette, followed by mCherry, and then the receptor ORF at 3', with a stop in lox2272, followed by eGFP.

Wait, no, the ligand is fused to mCherry. So the ligand ORF is in the same reading frame as mCherry. Similarly, the receptor is at 3', and the stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP. So when the stop is removed, the receptor is in frame with eGFP.

But perhaps the way the vector is set up, the IRES is after the ligand ORF, which could interfere with the receptor's expression.

Wait, no. The vector is bicistronic, so the first gene is ligand (with CBA promoter), then after a stop, the second gene with IRES.

Wait, perhaps the IRES is for the receptor. So the CBA drives the ligand, then the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed in the same mRNA.

So when the stop is removed, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, and the IRES would drive the receptor and eGFP expression.

But in the mouse, perhaps the IRES isn't functioning, so the receptor isn't being expressed.

But why would the IRES not function? IRES elements are cell-type specific. If the cells in the mouse (like neural crest derivatives) don't support the IRES, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, but in the in vitro case with astrocytes, they transfected the plasmid and saw expression. Astrocytes might support the IRES, whereas in the neural crest-derived cells in the mouse, perhaps the IRES isn't active.

So if the IRES doesn't function in the mouse's target cells, the receptor and eGFP won't be expressed, leading to no green signal.

Alternatively, maybe the vector isn't correctly designed. Maybe the IRES is after the ligand, not after the receptor.

Wait, the question states: the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So the CBA promoter is for the ligand. The receptor is after the IRES, so the IRES is part of the receptor's regulatory region. So the mRNA would be ligand followed by IRES and receptor.

Wait no, that can't be right. The IRES is after the ligand's ORF, so that the same mRNA can produce both ligand and receptor. So the structure would be: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop (loxP) -> IRES -> receptor ORF.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. So the mRNA would have two ORFs: the first is ligand, then after IRES, the receptor.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The vector is bicistronic, so it has two ORFs in the same transcript.

The first ORF is the ligand, under CBA promoter. The second ORF is the receptor, which is under the control of an IRES. So the first ORF is ligand, and the second is receptor.

So when the stop cassettes are removed, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, and the receptor and eGFP are also expressed.

But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed. So maybe the IRES isn't working in the intended cells.

If the IRES isn't functional in the cells where the Cre is active, then the receptor and eGFP won't be expressed. So the expression of the receptor depends on the IRES, which might not be active in the neural crest cells.

But wait, the in vitro experiment was in astrocytes, which might support the IRES. So the construct works in vitro, but not in vivo.

So the problem is that the IRES isn't active in the target cells, so the receptor isn't expressed. But then, why did the question not include an option about IRES functionality? Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options, D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But if the stop is correctly excised, they should be in frame.

Another possibility: perhaps the vector has the ligand and receptor in the same reading frame, but the fusion protein is ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP. So if the stop cassettes are correctly removed, the proteins should be made.

Wait, but the question states that the ligand is fused to mCherry, meaning that the ligand's ORF is in frame with mCherry. Similarly, the receptor's ORF is in frame with eGFP.

But perhaps when the lox sites are cut, the reading frame of the receptor-eGFP is disrupted. Like, perhaps the stop cassette's presence causes a frame shift, but when removed, maybe it's okay.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's design is such that the loxP and lox2272 are in opposite orientations, so when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, but the frame shifts, leading to a nonfunctional eGFP tag.

Wait, but the question states that the stop cassettes are in the correct orientation. So when Cre recombines, the stops are removed, and the ORFs are correctly placed.

Hmm. Maybe the issue is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the IRES isn't functional in the target cells. But none of the options mention IRES issues.

Let me think about the options again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would prevent eGFP from being expressed. But why would that happen?

If the stop cassette is present, the receptor is not expressed. When Cre deletes the stop, the eGFP should be in frame. So unless the vector wasn't correctly designed, like the ORFs are in different frames.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the stop cassettes are in the same frame as the receptor and eGFP, so when the stop is excised, it disrupts the frame, making the eGFP not in frame. But that would require the stop to cause a frameshift.

But the stop is in a lox2272 cassette, which is probably out of frame. Because the stop is just a stop codon, perhaps in a different frame than the receptor and eGFP.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me think about the construct again.

The ligand is at 5', under CBA. Then a stop cassette (loxP) that, when removed, allows the mCherry to be expressed. So in the vector, the ligand is in frame with mCherry.

For the receptor, it's at 3', and its ORF is followed by a stop cassette (lox2272). So when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP should be in frame.

If the stop is in the same frame as the receptor, then removing it might cause a frameshift. But the stop is probably placed out of frame, so that when it's removed, the reading frame continues for eGFP.

Wait, but the way the stop is inserted could affect the frame. Suppose the stop is inserted in frame with the receptor. So when it's removed, the receptor is followed directly by eGFP in the same frame. So that should be fine.

But if the stop is inserted in a different frame, then after removal, the receptor and eGFP would not be in frame, leading to a frame shift and no eGFP expression.

So how are the stops inserted? Typically, when inserting a stop cassette, it's done in a way that the ORF is preserved upon excision. So the stop is placed in frame such that when it's removed, the reading frame continues correctly.

But if the stop is inserted in such a way that it's not in frame, then removing it would cause a frameshift, messing up the eGFP's ORF.

So in this case, perhaps the stop cassette was inserted in a different frame, so when Cre deletes it, the eGFP isn't in frame, so no eGFP is made.

That would explain why the Western blot in vitro worked (they transfected, so maybe in that case, the frame is correct, or perhaps the cells used in vitro handle the frameshift better), but in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the correct option would be D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the IRES isn't working, but that's not one of the options.

So among the options, D seems the most plausible.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is under an IRES element, fused to eGFP. Stop cassettes (loxP and lox2272) block expression of mCherry and eGFP, respectively, until Cre recombination excises them. The experiment shows no green fluorescence (eGFP) in the mouse model, despite successful expression in vitro.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design**:  
   - The ligand is at the 5' end, under the CBA promoter, with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette upstream of mCherry.  
   - The receptor is at the 3' end, under an IRES element, with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette upstream of eGFP.  
   - Cre recombination excises the stop cassettes, allowing expression of the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP fusion proteins.

2. **In Vitro Expression**:  
   - Western blot of transfected astrocytes shows successful expression of both proteins, indicating the construct works in vitro.

3. **In Vivo Failure**:  
   - In the mouse model, no green fluorescence (eGFP) is observed. This suggests that the receptor-eGFP fusion protein is not being expressed in vivo.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **(A) Paracrine Relationship**: This refers to the functional interaction between the ligand and receptor but does not explain the lack of fluorescence.  
   - **(B) Stuck in the Golgi**: There is no evidence of trafficking issues in the question. The problem is more likely related to expression rather than protein localization.  
   - **(C) Missing Enhancer**: The CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, and the IRES is functional in vitro. There is no indication that an enhancer is missing.  
   - **(D) Receptor and eGFP Not in Frame**: The stop cassettes could disrupt the reading frame if inserted improperly. If the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette is not correctly excised or if it causes a frameshift, the receptor and eGFP would not be co-expressed, leading to no fluorescence.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame due to improper insertion or excision of the stop cassette, preventing proper expression of the receptor-eGFP fusion protein.
