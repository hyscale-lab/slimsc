Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to eliminate this compound by mutating the gene responsible for it. 

The gene has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, which I remember causes point mutations, mostly leading to changes in a single base pair. The sequencing showed changes in the first exon area. So I need to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change in the sequence. Let me compare each mutant's DNA sequence to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. So let me look for where the changes are.

Mutant 1: The beginning is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.
Wait, the original starts with ATGTTTCTCG. So comparing:
Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant1: ATG T TCT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, maybe I should look for the exact changes. Let me write down the first part.

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…
So comparing position by position. Let's see:

Original: positions 1-5: ATGTT
Mutant1: same ATGTT, but then position 6 in original is T, mutant1 has C? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of the sequences.

Wait, looking at the first part:

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACAT
