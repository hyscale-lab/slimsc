Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect. Let's break it down step by step.

Compound A is C3H6. Hmm, what's that? Well, C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, but propene is more likely because it's more reactive. Oh wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, and cyclopropane is a ring with three carbons. But usually, when we do bromination, propene would undergo addition, while cyclopropane might do substitution if bromine is present. But wait, the first step is bromination in CCl4. Oh right, bromine in CCl4 is an addition reaction. So Compound A must be an alkene.

So A is propene (C3H6). When it undergoes bromination, what happens? Propene would add bromine across the double bond. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, no, wait. Propene (CH2=CH2CH3) adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is BrCH2CHBrCH3. So structure of B is that.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually is a base that causes elimination reactions, like E2. So if we have 1,2-dibromopropane and treat it with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, we would get an elimination reaction. Each Br is a leaving group. But with two adjacent Brs, maybe it can eliminate both and form a triple bond.

Wait, wait. Let me think. When you have vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) and treat them with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation twice, leading to an alkyne. So from 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating twice would lose two HBr molecules and form acetylene (ethene?), wait: propyne? Wait, propyne is HC≡C-CH3? Or is it CH3-C≡CH? Wait, wait. The starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2BrCHBrCH3. When you eliminate HBr from each end, each Br is on adjacent carbons. So elimination from CH2BrCHBrCH3 would lead to the formation of a triple bond. Starting from the ends: the first elimination would form a double bond, but with two Brs, perhaps two eliminations happen. Oh wait, yeah, vicinal dihalides typically form alkynes when treated with strong bases.

So, the reaction would be: CH2BrCHBrCH3 (B) + alcoholic KOH → CH≡CCH3 (propyne) plus 2 HBr. So compound C is propyne, which is an alkyne. Propyne is also known as methylacetylene.

Next, when compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. I remember that heating a terminal alkyne (like propyne) with iron and sometimes a catalyst can lead to a reduction. Wait, or maybe it's dehydrohalogenation again? Hmm. Alternatively, when an alkyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it might undergo a decomposition reaction or perhaps a rearrangement. Wait, another thought: alkyne to alkene via some reaction. Or maybe it's a dehydrogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: when propyne is heated with iron, it might form benzene. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Oh, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. Propyne is CH3-C≡CH. When heated with a metal like iron, perhaps under certain conditions, it can undergo a decomposition. Alternatively, if it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't think that applies here.

Wait, more accurately, when an alkyne is treated with a metal like sodium or iron in ammonia, it can form a metal acetylide. But that's not what's happening here. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being hydrogenated. Wait, but red-hot iron might not be a catalyst for hydrogenation. Oh wait, another reaction: heating an alkyne with iron can cause it to lose hydrogen and form an alkene. Wait, but with propyne, if it loses a hydrogen, maybe forming something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. Propyne (CH3-C≡CH) when heated with iron could form phenol? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond breaks. Let me think about the reaction conditions. Red-hot iron—could it be a dehydrohalogenation, but there's no halogen here. Wait, perhaps the alkyne undergoes a decomposition reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where the alkyne is converted into an alkene. So propyne could become propene. But how? Maybe an isomerization. Or perhaps the triple bond becomes a double bond. Wait, but that's a hydrogenation, which usually requires a catalyst. Red-hot iron might not be a catalyst for that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is being deprotonated and then undergoing some elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a loss of a molecule such as H2O or CO2, but I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is converting the alkyne into an alkyne oxide, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back. So compound C is propyne. When it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it undergoes a decomposition to form something else. Wait, another thought: maybe it's a [2+2] cycloaddition, but that's more under UV light. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction to form an alkyne with fewer carbons. Wait, propyne is C3H4. If it's heated with iron, maybe it loses a carbon. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the next steps. Compound D is formed, which then reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. What's a reaction where two strong acids are used? Maybe H2SO4 and HNO3? Or perhaps concentrated H2SO4 and something else. Wait, another reaction with strong acids—maybe sulfonation, but that's probably not it. Or perhaps it's a dehydration reaction.

Wait, if D is an alcohol, then reacting with two strong acids might lead to esterification or something else. Alternatively, perhaps D is a benzene ring compound because the next step involves a reaction with Fe and HCl to form F.

Wait, let me think about the overall sequence. Let me try to map each compound.

A: C3H6 → propene (CH2=CHCH3)
B: 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3)
C: propyne (CH3C≡CH)
D: ???

Wait, another possibility for compound D. Maybe after the alkyne is passed through the iron tube, it's being hydrogenated to an alkene. So, propyne (CH3C≡CH) becomes propene (CH2=CHCH3). But then, what would propene reacting with two strong acids do? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diene or something else.

Alternatively, maybe compound D is benzene. How would that happen? Let's think: propyne (CH3-C≡CH) could, under certain conditions, form benzene. But that would require adding a lot of hydrogen, which doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being decomposed into something else.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is reacting with the iron to form something else. Wait, another reaction: perhaps the alkyne is being converted to an alkyne with a triple bond in the middle, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being oxidized. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. What's the product when an alkyne is treated with a red-hot iron? Oh wait! I think I remember that when terminal alkynes are passed over a red-hot iron, they can form acetylene (ethyne) and a smaller alkyne or alkene. Wait, but in this case, propyne is CH3-C≡CH. If it's passed through red-hot iron, perhaps it decomposes into something else, maybe even into a benzene ring? Or perhaps it's creating a ring structure.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being deprotonated and then some elimination occurs, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the alkyne could undergo a hydrogenation to form an alkene, but that usually requires a catalyst like Pd or Pt.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is forming a metal carbonyl, but that's more for transition metals. Hmm, I'm stuck here. Maybe I should think about the subsequent steps.

Compound D reacts with two strong acids to form E. Let's say D is benzene. Then, reacting benzene with a mixture of concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3 would nitrate it. So E would be nitrobenzene. Then, compound E (nitrobenzene) reacts with Fe and HCl (concentrated) to form F. Wait, that's the Bechamp reaction, where nitrobenzene is reduced to azobenzene. But wait, nitrobenzene under certain conditions can be reduced to aniline. Wait, but with Fe and HCl, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation? No, I think the reaction is a reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline. So F would be aniline.

Then, compound F (aniline) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Nitrous acid is used in the diazotization of aromatic amines. At low temperatures, aniline reacts with nitrous acid to form a diazonium salt. So G would be the diazonium chloride, perhaps benzene diazonium chloride.

Then, when G reacts with NaOH, it forms H. Diazonium salts upon treatment with NaOH undergo hydrolysis. If the diazonium salt is aromatic, like benzene diazonium chloride, then hydrolysis gives phenol and a precipitate of sodium chloride. But wait, if the diazonium salt is from aniline, the hydrolysis would give phenol and release amines, but more likely, the product would be phenol. So H would be phenol.

Wait, but let me make sure. Diazonium salts can undergo different reactions. If you have a diazonium salt and you treat it with aqueous NaOH, it typically hydrolyzes to form phenol and a salt (like NaCl). So H is phenol.

Now, let's recap all the compounds:

A: propene → CH2=CHCH3
B: 1,2-dibromopropane → BrCH2CHBrCH3
C: propyne → CH3C≡CH
D: ? Could it be something else. Wait, earlier step: C (propyne) is passed through red-hot iron to form D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's think again about the step where C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but propyne doesn't have halogens. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted to a diene. Or perhaps it's a decomposition reaction.

Wait, another approach: if propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a decomposition to form a benzene ring. Because with three carbons, but that would require a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a benzene ring via some cyclization. Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being hydrogenated to an alkene. So propyne (CH3C≡CH) becomes propene (CH2=CHCH3). Then, compound D is propene.

But then, propene (D) reacting with two strong acids would form something. If the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, perhaps it's a nitration reaction. Propene could get nitrated, but that's not very likely because alkenes are more reactive towards addition rather than electrophilic substitution. So maybe D isn't propene.

Wait, perhaps D is benzene. Then, the next steps fit. Let's try that approach.

If propyne (C) is converted to benzene (D), then:

D is benzene. Reacting benzene with two strong acids (like H2SO4 and HNO3) would nitrate it to form nitrobenzene (E). Then, E (nitrobenzene) is reduced with Fe and HCl to form aniline (F). Aniline (F) reacts with nitrous acid to form benzene diazonium chloride (G). G then reacts with NaOH to form phenol (H).

So, let's see if that makes sense. So when C (propyne) is passed through red-hot iron, it converts to benzene. But how does propyne convert to benzene? That would require a lot of steps. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but we don't have any halogens there. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being heated to form a benzene ring via some cyclization. But that seems unlikely because propyne is a three-carbon alkyne.

Wait, another possibility: if C is propyne, and upon reaction with red-hot iron, it is hydrogenated to form propene. But then D is propene, which would undergo a nitration reaction. But propene is an alkene, which can undergo addition reactions, not substitution. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the earlier steps. Let me think again about the reaction of B with alcoholic KOH. B is 1,2-dibromopropane. So in alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr molecules to form propyne. So C is propyne.

Then, when propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it is converted into benzene via some kind of dehydrogenation. Wait, but that would require adding more rings. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a cyclopropane. No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a decomposition reaction where propyne (CH3C≡CH) breaks down into CH4 and C2H2, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options given.

The options are about the products. So perhaps I can figure out each statement and see which is incorrect.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is aniline, which is used in dye synthesis, then A is correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is phenol, which does form a yellow precipitate with FeCl3, so B is correct.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. If D is benzene, the NMR would show a singlet because all protons are equivalent. But benzene has one signal, a singlet. So if D is benzene, then option C would be incorrect. Alternatively, if D is something else, like propene, then propene's NMR has two triplets (from CH2 groups), so that wouldn't fit either. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, if D is benzene, then its 1H NMR would have a singlet integrating for 6H, but that's a single peak, not two. So option C says two singlets, which would imply two sets of equivalent protons. So if D were something like 1,3-dichlorobenzene or toluene, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propene. Propene's structure is CH2=CH2CH3. The NMR would have a triplet for the CH2 next to the double bond and a triplet for the CH3. Wait, no, in propene, the CH2=CH- group's protons are a triplet (from coupling with the adjacent CH2), and the CH3 is a triplet as well, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group would be a triplet and the CH3 a triplet. But that would give two triplets, not singlets. So option C says two singlets, which wouldn't match.

Alternatively, maybe D is acetone. But how? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps D is something else. Wait, perhaps the red-hot iron step is for forming benzene via some dehydrogenation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I got the initial steps wrong. Let me think again.

Let me try to outline each compound:

1. A is C3H6 → propene (CH2=CHCH3)
2. Bromination in CCl4 → addition across double bond → 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3)
3. B (dibromide) + alcoholic KOH → elimination → propyne (CH3C≡CH)
4. C (propyne) + red-hot iron → D. If D is benzene, maybe the alkyne loses two H's to form a ring, but I don't know the exact reaction.
5. D (benzene) → reacts with two strong acids → nitration → nitrobenzene (E)
6. E (nitrobenzene) + Fe/HCl → reduction → aniline (F)
7. F (aniline) + nitrous acid → diazonium salt (G)
8. G (diazonium salt) + NaOH → phenol (H)

Assuming this sequence, let's check each option.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is benzene, the NMR would show a singlet (all H equivalent), so it's a single peak. So the statement says two singlets, which is incorrect. So option C is incorrect.

But wait, the question is to find the incorrect statement. So if statement C is incorrect, then the answer would be C.

But let's check the other options:

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propyne, which is a flammable gas, so D is correct.

Option A: F is used for dye synthesis. F is aniline, which is a key starting material for many dyes, so A is correct.

Option B: H gives yellow with FeCl3. H is phenol, which does so, so B is correct.

So the incorrect statement is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if D were benzene, then in its 1H NMR, there would be only one singlet. So the statement says two singlets, which would be incorrect. Hence, option C is the incorrect statement.


The reaction sequence begins with compound A (C₃H₆), which is identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH₂CHBrCH₃) as compound B. Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH leads to a double elimination of HBr, resulting in the formation of propyne (CH₃C≡CH) as compound C.

When propyne (C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes a decomposition reaction, forming benzene (C₆H₆) as compound D. Benzene (D) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (likely concentrated H₂SO₄ and HNO₃) to form nitrobenzene (C₆H₅NO₂) as compound E. Reduction of E with Fe and HCl produces aniline (C₆H₅NH₂) as compound F. Reaction of F with nitrous acid (HNO₂) forms benzene diazonium chloride (C₆H₅N₂⁺Cl⁻) as compound G. Finally, treatment of G with NaOH leads to hydrolysis, yielding phenol (C₆H₅OH) as compound H.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: F is aniline, which is indeed used for the synthesis of dyes. This statement is correct.
- **Option B**: H is phenol, which reacts with ferric chloride (FeCl₃) to form a yellow precipitate. This statement is correct.
- **Option C**: D is benzene, and its ¹H NMR spectrum shows a single singlet integrating for six equivalent protons. The statement claims two singlets, which is incorrect.
- **Option D**: C is propyne, a flammable gas. This statement is correct.

The incorrect statement is **Option C**, as benzene produces only one singlet in its ¹H NMR spectrum, not two.

Answer: C
