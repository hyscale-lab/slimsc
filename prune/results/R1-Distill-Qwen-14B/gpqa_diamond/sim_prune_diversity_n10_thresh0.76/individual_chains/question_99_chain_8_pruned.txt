Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different structures, each with some branching and a carboxylic acid group. 

First, the FTIR data: a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. I remember that the broad peak around 3000 is usually due to O-H stretching. But wait, carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches because they can form hydrogen bonds. So that makes sense. The strong peak at 1700 is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which would be present in a carboxylic acid. So that fits with the compound having a COOH group.

Now, looking at the NMR part. The 1H NMR shows several peaks, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. So there are no double bonds, which is consistent with all the options provided since they all seem to be aliphatic compounds with no unsaturation except for the COOH.

The tricky part is the splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, I need to figure out how that splitting might occur.

Splitting in NMR comes from neighboring protons. The number of peaks you see is determined by the formula n+1, where n is the number of neighboring H's. So if a proton is next to two sets of neighboring H's, the splitting can get more complex.

Let me look at the options and try to imagine their structures.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. The structure would have a central carbon attached to two ethyl groups (C2H5), two H's, and a CH2COOH group. Wait, no, the formula is a bit different. Let me parse it again. It's CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the central two carbons each are connected to a C2H5 group and a H, and connected to each other. So, maybe the structure is symmetric around the two middle carbons. Each of those middle carbons has two CH2CH3 groups and a CH2COOH group?

Wait, no. Let me draw the structure.

The molecule is:
