Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, let's see what the question says. The nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the isotope must be Li-6 because lithium typically has 3 protons and 3 neutrons make it Li-6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

The speed of the nucleus is 0.96c, and I need to find the energy. Oh right, in particle physics, the energy of a moving particle is given by the relativistic energy formula. So I remember that the total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Since v is 0.96c, let me calculate beta first. Beta is v over c, which is 0.96.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let's compute that. (0.96)^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Hmm, 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28 times 3.5 is 0.98, which is too much. Wait, 0.28 * 3.5714 is exactly 1 because 1/0.28 is 3.5714... So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. Wait, the nucleus is made of protons and neutrons. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². But wait, I should check the exact mass. Alternatively, maybe I can use the atomic mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, sometimes the mass of a nucleus is approximated by the sum of the masses of its nucleons. So protons and neutrons. Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², each neutron around 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, that's 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So let's calculate the total rest mass: 3*(938) + 3*(939.565). Let's compute that. 3 *
