Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and it's transiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Its orbital period is 3 days. The second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. The question is asking for the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still exhibiting both transit and occultation events. Both planets are in circular orbits with the same orbital plane.

Hmm, I think I need to remember what transit and occultation events mean. A transit is when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so it's not visible from Earth anymore because the star's light blocks it. For both events to happen, the planet must be in a position relative to the star and observer where both can occur. I guess this has to do with the orbital distance and the size of the star compared to the planet.

Wait, but the problem says the second planet has a radius 2.5 times Earthâ€™s. So it's larger. But how does that affect transit and occultation? Maybe it affects the chances of the events occurring because the planet's size relative to the star matters for visibility. But for the events themselves, I think the main factors are the orbital periods and the distances from the star.

Let me think about the transit condition. For a planet to transit the star, its orbital plane must be aligned such that it passes directly in front of the star from our perspective. The impact parameter is the measure of how central the transit is; a smaller impact parameter means a more central transit. But in this problem, the first planet has an impact parameter of 0.2. I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here, but maybe it's just given for context.

I remember that for a planet to transit, the star's size must be larger than the planet's size in terms of apparent size. Wait, no, that's not it. Actually, the planet must be able to move in its orbit so that it can pass in front of and behind the star from our viewpoint.

Wait, but how does the orbital period of the second planet relate to the first? Oh, maybe the question is about the Hill sphere or orbital stability. No, I don't think so because the problem is about the planet being in the same system, which probably implies that one is not affecting the other's orbit much.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is the transit and occultation timing. For the second planet to be both transiting and occulting, its orbital period must be such that its orbital period is a divisor of the first planet's, or something like that? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the main point is about the relative orbital periods. For two planets to both transit and have occultation events, their orbital periods must allow their positions to align in a way that both events can be observed. But I'm not exactly sure how that works. 

Alternatively, maybe the maximum period for the second planet is determined by the condition that
