Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratios. Let me try to think through this step by step. Hmm.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, the Sun's core reactions include several processes, right? The pp chain is a major source of solar energy, and the pp-III branch is probably one of the steps in that chain. So if that branch stops, what happens to the neutrinos?

Neutrinos are produced in various steps of the pp chain. I remember that the dominant neutrino production in the pp chain comes from the decay of beryllium-7, which is part of the so-called "s-process" or the main branch. Oh wait, the pp-III branch is one of the branches in the proton-proton chain. Let me recall: the pp chain has different branches. The main one is the pp-I branch, and then there's pp-II and pp-III. Oh right, the pp-I leads to the most common helium production, while the pp-II and pp-III are alternative paths, maybe under different conditions.

But for neutrino production, I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing a significant fraction of the neutrinos, particularly the 7 Be neutrinos. Wait, the 7Be neutrinos are those that peak around 478 keV, produced when 7Be captures a proton to form 8B, which then decays into 8Be + e+ + ν. So if the pp-III branch stops, that would affect the production of 7Be and thus the 7Be neutrinos.

But the question is about neutrino flux in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). Wait, what neutrinos are in those energy ranges?

Wait, the 7Be neutrinos are around 478 keV. Then there are the pep neutrinos, which are from the proton-electron-proton branch. They have higher energies, about 1.4 MeV. But wait, the other main source is the CNO cycle, but I think the CNO neutrinos are higher energy as well. Oh, but the question is about solar neutrinos—so the main contributors are from the pp chain and the CNO cycle.

Wait, but the pp-III branch stopping would primarily affect the 7Be neutrinos. So if that stops, the flux of 7Be neutrinos would drop. But how does that affect the overall neutrino flux in those two bands?

Hmm, let's think about the energy spectrum of solar neutrinos. The dominant flux comes from the 7Be decay, which gives around 478 keV neutrinos. Then, the pep neutrinos are higher, about 1.4 MeV, so they are in the 1400 keV range, which is above the 900 keV band. The CNO cycle produces neutrinos in the 2-10 MeV range, again higher than 900 keV.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch stops, the 7Be production stops. So the 478 keV neutrinos would drop to zero, but what about the others? Band 1 is 700-800 keV, which is higher than 7Be, and band 2 is 800-900. So within the pp chain, are there other neutrino sources in that range?

Wait, maybe I'm forgetting something. The 7Be neutrinos are about 478 keV. Then, the next significant source is the 8B neutrinos, but I think those are same as 7Be in terms of energy. Or perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe other isotopes contribute.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the decay of other isotopes in the pp chain might have higher energies. Wait, could the neutrinos from the decay of 13N (in the CNO cycle) be around 2.2 MeV? Because 13N decays to 13C and emits a positron and a neutrino. Wait, 13N has a half-life of a couple of minutes, and decays to 13C. The energy of the neutrino from that decay is about 2.2 MeV, so that would be in the 2200 keV range, which is higher than 900. So that's not in band 1 or 2.

Hmm, so if the pp-III branch stops, the only neutrinos affected are the 7Be ones. So the neutrinos in the 478 keV range would drop. But what about the higher energy neutrinos?

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio between two bands: 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So if the pp-III branch stops, the 7Be neutrinos go away, but the other neutrino sources (like the CNO neutrinos and the pep) are still there. So what's the flux in these two bands?

Wait, the CNO neutrinos are much higher energy, so their neutrinos are in the 2-10 MeV range, which is way above 900. The pep neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV, which is 1400 keV. So both of these are above the 900 keV band.

So in the 700-800 keV band, maybe there are other sources. Are there any neutrinos from the pp chain in that energy range besides 7Be?

Wait, I'm not sure. Another thought: perhaps the neutrinos from the decay of 15O in the CNO cycle have lower energies
