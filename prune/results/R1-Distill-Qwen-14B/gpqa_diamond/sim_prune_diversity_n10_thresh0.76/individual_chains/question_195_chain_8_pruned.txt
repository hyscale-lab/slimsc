Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about planets orbiting a star. There's a first planet with Earth's radius, in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star it's orbiting has a radius 1.5 times the Sun's. The orbital period of this planet is 3 days. Now, they want to find the maximum orbital period of a second planet with 2.5 Earth radii, which will also transit and occultate. Both planets share the same orbital plane, and the second planet's orbit is also circular.

Hmm. So, I remember that for a transit to happen, the planet must pass in front of the star from our point of view. The impact parameter is the distance (in terms of stellar radii) that the planet's center is from the star's center during transit. If the impact parameter is zero, it's a central transit.

Wait, the first planet: radius is Earth-sized, star is 1.5 solar radii. So the star is bigger than our Sun. The impact parameter is 0.2. So during transit, the planet's center is 0.2 times the star's radius away from the star's center. So the distance between the planet and the star's center during transit is 0.2 * (1.5 Rsun) = 0.3 Rsun.

But wait, the planet's radius is Earth's, which is much smaller than the star. So the planet's disc must fit within that impact parameter distance.

But maybe the key here is about the Hill sphere or the orbital stability, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about ensuring that the second planet's orbital period is such that they are in a configuration where both planets transit each other, leading to occultations and transits.

Wait, the question says both transit and occultation events would be observed. So, for the second planet, an occultation occurs when the second planet passes behind the star from our perspective. So this would happen when the orbital period of the second planet is such that their orbital periods are synchronized in a way that these events happen.

Wait, but maybe it's about the Roche limit or about the orbital periods such that the planets are in a specific orbital resonance. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the relative sizes of their orbits and the star's gravity causing one planet to block the other.

Wait, but I think the main point is about the transit and occultation events. For the second planet to both transit and be occulted by the star, its orbit must be such that sometimes it's in front of the star (transit) and sometimes behind (occultation). That would mean that the orbital period of the second planet must be longer than the first one, perhaps? Or wait, no—because if it's shorter, it would orbit faster.

Wait, actually, for a planet to both transit and be occulted, it must be in an orbit where, from our line of sight, sometimes it's in front of the star (transit) and sometimes behind (occultation). That suggests that the orbit is such that the planet passes through the same line of sight twice each orbit—once in front (transit) and once behind (occultation). But wait, that sounds a bit counterintuitive. Maybe the key is that when the two planets are in a certain configuration, they can cause each other's transits.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the maximum orbital period such that both planets' orbits are such that the second planet's orbital period is such that they are in a position to cause these mutual events. But I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, maybe the key is about the Doppler shift method or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the transit and occultation in terms of orbital periods and the alignment. Let me try to break it down.

First, the transit of the first planet. Its period is 3 days. So it takes 3 days to orbit the star once. The impact parameter is 0.2, so the planet's path across the star's disk is at a distance of 0.2 times the star's radius.

Now, the second planet is larger, 2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum period for this planet such that both transit and occultation events are observed.

Wait, so for the second planet to transit the star, its orbital period must be such that its orbit crosses the line of sight. But how does the orbital period affect that? Well, a longer orbital period would mean it's farther from the star, as per Kepler's third law. But wait, Kepler's law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So for a longer period, the planet is farther out.

But for the second planet to also be occulted by the star, it must pass behind the star. So that would happen when the planet is on the opposite side of the star relative to us. But for that
