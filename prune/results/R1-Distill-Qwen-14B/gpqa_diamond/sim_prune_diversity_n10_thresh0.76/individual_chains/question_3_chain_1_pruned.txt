Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state given by 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Hmm, okay.

Wait, expectation value... right, the expectation value of an operator is like the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on the system in that state. So, the formula is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

So the operator here is 10σz plus 5σx. That means I can split the expectation value into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx. So, ⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Alright, let me tackle each part separately. First, σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, that should make things easier.

The given state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this as a column vector to make it easier. Since |↑⟩ is usually (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1), ψ would be [0.5, (√3/2)]^T. Let me check: 0.5^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1. Yep, it's normalized.

Now, σz is a Pauli matrix, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. So when we compute ⟨σz⟩, it's the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, how does that work? Oh, right, because the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the probability of being in |↑⟩ times +1 plus the probability of being in |↓⟩ times -1.

So, the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. The probabilities are the squares of the absolute values, right? So for |↑⟩, probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. For |↓⟩, it's (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + (3/4)*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Oh wait, that's -0.5.

Then, 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, the second part: ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Instead, maybe I can compute it directly using the expectation value formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I
