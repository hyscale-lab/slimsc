Okay, let's try to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Hmm, so I remember that each spectrograph has its own brightness limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag in V, and HIRES goes up to 16 mag. So a star must be brighter than 16 mag to be detected by HIRES, but wait, no, is it brighter than or fainter than? Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 V mag, that's better than (lower magnitude number) 17. Oh wait, no wait, I think I got that the other way around. Because brighter objects have lower magnitudes. So, if a telescope can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, that means stars with V <17 can be seen. Because brighter is lower magnitude.

So ESPRESSO sees stars with V <17, and HIRES can see stars with V <16 (since it's brighter than 16). So for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 16.

Wait, but wait another thing: wait the question says for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So that means apparent V magnitude <17. And for HIRES, bright than 16, so apparent V mag <16. So the star must have an apparent V mag less than 16.

So which stars have apparent mag <16?

Let's look at each star:

Star1: Absolute V is 15.5 mag, distance is 10 pc. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + extinction. Wait, but wait, the way it's given in the problem: Star1 has absolute magnitude 15.5 and is at 10 pc. So m = M +5 log(d/10). Since d=10, log(1)=0, so m=15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. Which is less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But what about HIRES? It's 15.5 <16, so yes, HIRES can see it. So Star1 is detectable by both.

Wait, but wait. Wait, Star1's apparent magnitude is 15.5. So both can detect it. Hmm, but let's check all stars.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5. So for HIRES, which can see up to 16, 16.5 is too faint. So HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can, since 16.5 <17. So Star2 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5, but wait, there's extinction (E(B-V) =0.6). The problem says the total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So extinction (A_V
