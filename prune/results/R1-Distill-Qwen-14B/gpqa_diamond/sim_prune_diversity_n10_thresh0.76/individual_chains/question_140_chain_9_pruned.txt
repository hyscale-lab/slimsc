Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully and break it down.

The question talks about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. When X reacts violently with liquid Y, it releases a gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. 

Another part mentions that the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. My goal is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering their isotopes.

Hmm. Let's start by piecing together what each part means.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction usually implies something exothermic, maybe even an explosion. The gas W has equal protons and neutrons in its molecule. So what gases have that? Let's think about possible gases. For example, water is H2O, but that's not a gas here. Wait, H2O is a liquid usually. Maybe CO2? No, that's 22 grams per mole. Wait, but CO2 has 22, but the molecule is CO2, which has 1 C and 2 O. Let's see: carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's the common isotope, but wait, maybe not). Alternatively, maybe it's another gas.

Wait, another approach: the number of protons equals the number of neutrons in the molecule. So, for example, if the molecule has 2 H atoms, each with 1 proton and 1 neutron. But wait, H is 1 proton, and if it's deuterium, it's 1 neutron. So two deuterium atoms would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so 2 each. So gas W might be D2, but wait, that's not a common gas. Alternatively, maybe O or N? Or another molecule.

Wait, another thought: the molecule must have the same number of protons and neutrons in total. So for example, if the molecule is H2O (but that's 2 H and 1 O). Wait, but H is 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium). O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So for H2O, the protons would be 2*(1) + 8 = 10, and the neutrons would be 2*(1) + 8 = 10. Oh! So H2O would have 10 protons and 10 neutrons. Wait, but I thought gas W is released. But under standard conditions, water is a liquid. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another possibility: NH3. Let's see. Nitrogen has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. Hydrogen has 1 each. So NH3 would have 7 + 3*(1) = 10 protons, and 7 + 3*(1) = 10 neutrons. But wait
