Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator involving sigma_z and sigma_x for a spin-half particle. Hmm.

Alright, the state given is a linear combination: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of sigma_z. So sigma_z acting on them just gives their corresponding eigenvalues.

The operator given is 10σ_z +5σ_x. I think the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identical systems in that state. So to find the expectation value of this operator, I can compute the expectation of each part separately and then add them together.

Wait, but wait, expectation values are linear, right? So E[A + B] = E[A] + E[B], and E[cA] = cE[A] where c is a constant. So I can split this into two parts: the expectation of 10σ_z, and the expectation of 5σ_x, then add them.

So first, let's compute the expectation of σ_z. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively, the expectation value should be straightforward.

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So when σ_z acts on |↑⟩, it gives +1 * |↑⟩, and on |↓⟩, -1 * |↓⟩.

The expectation value of σ_z, E[σ_z], is the inner product of ψ with (σ_z ψ). So:

E[σ_z] = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1)
Because the coefficients squared give the probabilities. Let's compute that.

0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So E[σ_z] = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So the expectation value for 10σ_z is 10 * (-0.5) = -5. Okay, got that part.

Now, the next part is the expectation of σ_x. Hmm, σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, which I think has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Wait, but how do I compute the expectation value of σ_x in a given state that's expressed in σ_z eigenstates?

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. So for σ_x, it would be ⟨ψ|σ_x |ψ⟩.

The state ψ is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) if I represent it as a column vector, assuming |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1].
