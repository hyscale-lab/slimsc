Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. 

Alright, first, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the variance. The formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to calculate both the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared.

Wait, but wait. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x. So the state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write that down:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]
    [ 1/√2 ]
    [ -1/2 ]

So this is the state vector. Now, since ψ is an eigenstate of P_x, but we're considering the uncertainty in P_z. Hmm, because P_x and P_z don't commute, right? So the uncertainty might be significant.

The first thing I need to do is compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is ψ† P_z ψ. Then compute ⟨P_z²⟩, which is ψ† (P_z²) ψ. Then take the square root of their difference.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the matrices. The P_z matrix is given as:

P_z = [ [ ħ , 0 , 0 ],
         [ 0 , 0 , 0 ],
         [ 0 , 0, -ħ ] ]

So when you apply P_z to ψ, you get P_z ψ. But since the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, which is a different operator, we have to compute these expectation values directly.

So let's compute ⟨P_z⟩ first. That's the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by P_z multiplied by ψ.

Wait, but ψ is given as a column vector. Let me write ψ* as the row vector with complex conjugate elements, but wait, looking at the state vector, all elements are real. So ψ* is just the transpose.

So ψ† would be [
