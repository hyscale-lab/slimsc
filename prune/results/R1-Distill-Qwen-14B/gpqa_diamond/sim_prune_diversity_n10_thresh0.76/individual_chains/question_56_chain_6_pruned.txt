Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. The options are about the possible transition routes and their probabilities. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

So, selection rules. Right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are usually that delta l is ±1, and delta m is 0, ±1. Also, for hydrogen, the n must change by one (like from 3 to 2 or 2 to 1 here), because the decay is from 3 to 1 via two steps.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. So n=3, l=0, m=0. The first transition would be to a state with l=1 because l can change by ±1. So possible l values after first transition are l=1 (since 0→1). The m can change by 0, ±1, so m could be -1, 0, or +1.

So the first transition could be to states like |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩. Then, the second transition would take it to |1,0,0⟩. Let's think about the second transition.

From |2,1, m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. So for the second transition, l must go from 1 to 0, which fits the delta l=±1 rule. And m must go from whatever m was in the intermediate state to 0. So delta m must be 0, ±1. So let's see the possibilities.

If the intermediate is |2,1,0⟩, then m goes from 0 to 0. That's allowed (delta m=0). So that's a possible path: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0.

Another possibility is if the intermediate is |2,1,1⟩. Then, in the second transition, m must change by -1 to get to 0. So delta m = -1, which is allowed. So that's another possible path: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0.

Similarly, if the intermediate was |2,1,-1⟩, then in the second transition, m would have to jump +1 to get to 0. So delta m of +1 is allowed. So that's another possible path: 3,0,0 → 2,1,-1 → 1,0,0.

But the question says that the decay is via two dipole transitions. So the options are given as routes with two steps.

Now, the probabilities. The options give fractions: 1/3, 1/4, 2/3. I'm trying to remember how transition probabilities are calculated. For each transition, the probability is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment, which is non-zero only if the selection rules are satisfied. Also, for each allowed transition, the probability depends on the number of possible transitions and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the Wigner 3-j symbols, but I'm not too sure about the exact math here.

Wait, maybe it's simpler. Each allowed transition from the initial state to first step, and then from there to the final state, contributes to the total probability. The total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each possible intermediate path.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The possible first steps are to |2,1,m⟩ where m can be -1, 0, +1. Each of these is a possible state, and each is equally likely? Or not? I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I remember that the transition probability can be determined by the number of ways the selection rules are satisfied in each step. The transition amplitude is proportional to the matrix element of the dipole operator between the states.

For the dipole transition from |n, l, m⟩ to |n', l', m'⟩, the matrix element ⟨n'l'm' | e r | n l m⟩ must be non-zero. The selection rules are:

Δl = ±1,

Δm = 0, ±1.

So for the first transition: n=3, l=0 → n'=2, l'=1.

So m can change by 0, ±1. So possible m's are -1, 0, +1.

So the first transition has three possible intermediate states: |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,-1⟩.

Each of these can then transition to |1,0,0⟩ in the second step.

Let's think about each possible intermediate:

1. Intermediate is |2,1,1⟩. Then, in the second transition, m must go from 1 → 0. So Δm = -1, which is allowed. So this is a valid path.

2. Intermediate is |2,1,0⟩. Then, m goes from 0 → 0. Δm=0, allowed.

3. Intermediate is |2,1,-1⟩. Then, m goes from -1 → 0. So Δm=+1, allowed.

So all three intermediates are possible. So the total number of possible paths would be 3, each contributing to the transition probability.

But wait, each path has a certain probability. How much does each contribute?

I think the probability for each transition (
