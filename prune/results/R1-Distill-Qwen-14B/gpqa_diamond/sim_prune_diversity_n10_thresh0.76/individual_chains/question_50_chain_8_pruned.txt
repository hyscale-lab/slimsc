Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Feynman diagrams and loop counts. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum field theory, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says that a colleague has a Feynman diagram with some scribbled notes next to it. The note is a "size estimate" with a formula: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. And the question is how many loops the diagram has, with options A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order of the process in perturbation theory. Each loop typically adds a factor of the coupling constant and also introduces integrals that depend on the energy scales.

Wait, but more specifically, I think the number of loops is linked to the superficial degree of divergence, which relates to the possible divergences in the diagram. But maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, the power of the coupling constants and other factors in the amplitude might give a clue about the number of loops. Let me think about the general structure of Feynman diagrams and their contributions.

In a Feynman diagram, each loop contributes a factor of the coupling constant to some power and introduces integrals over loop momenta. The overall scaling with energy scales is also important. The term (Q/M)² suggests some ratio of scales, perhaps a momentum Q over a mass M, which would come from the propagators or external momenta.

But the main clue is probably in the exponents of the coupling constants. Let's see the factors in the given expression:

The formula is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

Alpha (α) is usually the fine-structure constant, which is related to the electric charge, and in quantum electrodynamics (QED), each photon vertex contributes a factor of e (the charge), and alpha is proportional to e²/(4π). So, for example, a one-loop diagram in QED (like a vacuum polarization) would have terms with alpha, maybe squared or something depending on the process.

Wait, more precisely, the number of vertices and the loops relate to the order. For example, a tree
