Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So, the lifetime τ is approximately ħ/(Γ), where Γ is the width. But wait, is Γ the total decay width? I think so, yes. Because Γ is the total width, which is the sum of all partial widths, so it's inversely proportional to the lifetime.

So first, calculate the lifetime τ. Once I have τ, I can find the mean decay distance by multiplying the lifetime by the velocity of the particle. Because the particle is moving, so the distance it travels before decaying is v * τ.

But wait, how do I find the velocity? Oh, because the particle is moving at relativistic speeds, I should calculate its velocity using its energy and mass. Let's see, the energy E is given, so I can find the gamma factor (Lorentz factor) using E = γ m c². Then, gamma γ = E/(m c²). Once
