Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, I need to figure out which NMR spectrum matches this structure.

Alright, let's break this down. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the benzene ring. The total carbons are 8, so the benzene (which is 6 carbons) plus two substituents. Wait, but the substituents are probably each one carbon each? Because 6 + 2 =8. Or maybe one substituent is two carbons? Let me think. For example, if the substituents are an aldehyde and a halogen, that's two substituents each with one carbon. Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester?) and another is a halogen.

Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl group. So there must be a C=O somewhere. Also, an aromatic-halogen bond, so a halogen attached to the ring, like Cl, Br, etc.

So the structure is benzene with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (maybe an aldehyde, ketone, ester, etc.), and the other is a halogen. But wait, the carbonyl group could be part of a substituent that's larger. Let me think about possible substituents.

Wait, another way: the ring has two substituents, each being a different group. One is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen.

Now, let's think about possible structures. One substituent could be an aldehyde (CHO), that's one carbon attached to the ring. The other substituent could be a halide, like Cl. But wait, benzaldehyde with a Cl substituent. So benzaldehyde would have a CHO group, but that's a mono-substituted. Oh, wait, no, it's di-substituted so two substituents on the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group as part of another group, like an ester. Or a ketone, but that's possible only if the substituent is a larger group, like a carbonyl attached to something else.

Wait, but the ring has two substituents. So, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl and the other is a halogen. Let's say for example, the substituents are a carbonyl group and a Cl.

Wait, but let's think about the molecular formula. The benzene ring has 6 carbons. The substituents would add 2 more carbons in total. So, each substituent must be one carbon each. So substituents like Cl (which is just a substituent without adding a carbon) can't be, because that would only add one substituent with no extra carbon. Wait, wait, no. Wait
