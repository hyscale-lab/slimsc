Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

The problem says the operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like angular momentum are represented by vectors, and their components in different directions can be found using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. So that means the direction is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, which implies the y-component of n is zero. So, the vector n would have components (nx, 0, nz), right? But since it's a direction, it's a unit vector, so nx² + nz² = 1.

The operator P is given in terms of its X, Y, and Z components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down.

Px is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0, 1] and second row [1, 0]. So Px = ħ/2 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. That looks familiar—like the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix scaled by ħ/2.

Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix scaled by ħ/2.

The problem is to find the eigenvector of P in the direction of n, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, wait. Because P is a vector operator, and the direction is arbitrary, I think I need to construct the operator P in that direction first.

Oh right, because when you have a vector operator, the component in any direction is given by the dot product of the operator vector with the direction vector. So P along n is P·n = nx P_x + nz P_z + ny P_y. But since n is in x-z plane, ny=0. So P·n = nx P_x + nz P_z.

Wait, but the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is (P
