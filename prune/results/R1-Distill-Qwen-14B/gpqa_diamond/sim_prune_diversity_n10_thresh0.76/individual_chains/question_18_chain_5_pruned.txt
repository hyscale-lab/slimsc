Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the problem gives me the masses of the stars, but I don't think that matters directly for the elemental ratios. The key data are the abundance ratios provided.

Wait, the elements involved are Si, Fe, Mg, and H. Oh right, because these are the elements they're comparing.

Let me list what I know. For each star, there are certain abundance ratios given, and I also have the solar photospheric composition. So I need to figure out the [Si/H] for each star and then find the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Star_2.

Wait, the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So that's [Si]_1 / [Si]_2, I think.

So, the given data:

Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Solar composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH
