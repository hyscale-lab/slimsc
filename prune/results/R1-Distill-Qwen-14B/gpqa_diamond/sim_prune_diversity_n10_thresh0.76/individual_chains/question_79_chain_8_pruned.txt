Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to find out which option is the starting compound X.

Hmm, wait. Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane sounds familiar. Oh right, that's a common reagent used in the Bürgi-Duneitz dienone-phenol rearrangement or in the formation of epoxides. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base used in the epoxide ring-opening reactions, but sometimes it's also used in other reactions. Or maybe it's involved in some kind of elimination or cyclization.

Wait, the starting compound is an epoxide because the options are all oxirane derivatives. Oh wait, oxirane is another name for epoxide. So, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide. Or perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but wait, the solvent is nonpolar, and the reaction is at 403 K. Hmm.

Wait, but the product's NMR is given. So I need to figure out what the product is, then work backwards to find the starting material.

The product's 1H NMR: Let's look at the signals.

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, two singlets for two methyl groups. Wait, two singlets each integrating to 3H. So two methyl groups that are each not split by neighboring protons. That suggests that each methyl is attached to a carbon with no adjacent Hs. So perhaps they are attached to an aromatic ring or maybe to an electronegative atom.

Looking at the 13C NMR:

21.3 (1C, s) - probably a methyl group attached to something deactivating, like an oxygen or a quaternary carbon.

28.4 (1C, s) - another methyl, maybe attached to something else. Wait, 28 is more like a CH2 or maybe a CH3 attached to an sp3 carbon, not an aromatic ring.

Then, the carbons around 126-130 are likely aromatic carbons. The 141 and 144 are probably carbonyls or carbons attached to an oxygen. Oh wait, the 197.7 is a carbonyl
