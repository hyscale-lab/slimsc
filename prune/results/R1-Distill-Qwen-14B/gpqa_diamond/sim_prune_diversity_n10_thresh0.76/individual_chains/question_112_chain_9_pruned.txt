Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question says: We have an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-component of the spin operator. We need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix is A where Aij is hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the given state. The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I should probably normalize this state because it's given as proportional. The general approach is to compute the norm (the inner product of the state with itself) and then divide by that norm to get a normalized state.

So the state vector can be written as a column vector [1+i; 2-i] (assuming |up> is the first component and |down> the second). The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) because each term is the modulus squared.

Calculating each term: (1+i)(1-i) is 1^2 + 1^2 = 2. Similarly, (2-i)(2+i) is 4 +1 =5. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, 2 squared is 4, and i squared is -1. So (2 - i)(2 + i) is 2² - (i)² = 4 - (-1) =5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7), and the normalized state is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

But wait, wait, when you compute the inner product, each component is a product of the conjugate and the other. So for the first term: (1+i) times (1-i) (since it's the conjugate), which is 1 +1 =2. For the second term, (2-i) times (2+i) which is 4 +1=5. So yeah, the norm squared is 2+5=7. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Okay, now the next part is about the operator whose matrix elements are A_ij = hbar/2 when i != j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because we have two states, up and down.

So the matrix A would look like:
[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Because A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, A_11 and A_22 are 0.

Wait, but operators in quantum mechanics are usually Hermitian if they represent observables, right? Because only Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues, which are the possible
