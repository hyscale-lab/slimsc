Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually a enolate ion, which attacks the beta position. 

The problem has three parts: reactions A, B, and C. I need to figure out the reactants and products for each.

Let's start with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt in EtOH. 

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The carbonyl compound here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=C-(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Wait, no, wait—E-configuration means the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. So it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- something. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)COOCH3? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- group. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Hmm, maybe I should draw this.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CO2Me)-p-tolyl? No, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the acrylate part is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But the 3 position—so the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C3. Wait, that might not make sense because the acrylate is usually CH2=CHCOOR, so if it's 3-substituted, maybe it's CH2=C(COOR)-R'. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think that the substituent is on the beta position. 

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with a substituent on the CH2? No, perhaps it's (E)-configured, meaning the substituents on either side are opposite. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the groups on C2 are a COOCH3 and a p-tolyl group. So the structure is
