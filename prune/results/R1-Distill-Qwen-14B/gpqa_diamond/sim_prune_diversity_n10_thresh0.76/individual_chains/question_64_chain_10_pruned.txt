Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem involves heating an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total weight is 7.20 grams, and it's heated to 200°C without air. This causes a mixture of gases to form. Then, these gases are passed through three tubes: first anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g, tube 2 doesn't change, and 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure.

Hmm. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, it absorbs water. So when gases pass through it, any moisture would be caught, making the tube gain weight. Similarly, Ca(OH)2 solution would react with CO2 to form CaCO3 and water. But if the weight didn't change, maybe no CO2 was present? Or maybe the amount reacted didn't change the solution's mass because it balanced the gas lost. Wait, no, usually when CO2 is absorbed, the solution gains mass. So if tube 2's weight didn't change, maybe there was no CO2 in the gas. But that seems unlikely because other reactions might produce it.

Wait, the problem states that the gas mixture was passed through these tubes without cooling. So maybe the gases are at a higher temperature when they enter the tubes. Oh, but Mg(ClO4)2 is a desiccant—it would absorb water vapor. So the gain in tube 1 is due to water—so the initial gas mixture must have contained water vapor. But wait, when you heat things without air, maybe the salts decompose, producing various gases.

Wait, let's think about the heating. So the salts A and B are heated in an inert atmosphere. They decompose to form a mixture of gases. The gases are passed through the tubes.

Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2): It's anhydrous, so it'll absorb water. The tube's weight increased by 3.60g. So that suggests that the gas mixture had 3.60g of water vapor. Because Mg(ClO4)2 would trap the water, increasing the mass by that amount.

Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution): No change in weight. So maybe there was no CO2 in the gas, or the amount of CO2 was negligible. Or perhaps the solution didn't react because the conditions weren't right. Alternatively, maybe the CO2 was converted into something else before it reached the solution. But I'm not sure yet.

Tube 3: Red-hot copper. Copper at high temperatures can react with certain gases. For example, it can react with CO2 to form CuO and CO, but I'm not certain. Wait, wait. I think when CO2 is passed over hot copper, it's not reactive. But if there's water vapor and CO, perhaps. Wait, no, perhaps the gas that reacted in tube 3 is hydrogen.
