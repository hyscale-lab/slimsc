Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I remember that expectation values are like the average value you'd expect to measure in an experiment. Right, so the formula for the expectation value of an operator is the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, then multiplied by the state vector again.

Wait, the state here is given as (3i, 4). So that's a two-component vector, right? Let me write that down. So the state vector ψ is [3i, 4]^T. But wait, in Dirac notation, that would be |ψ> = 3i |0> + 4 |1>, or something like that. Or maybe in matrix terms, it's a column vector with [3i, 4] as its components.

The operator in question is S_y, the spin along the y-direction. I remember that for spin-½ particles, the spin operators are given by S_x = ħ/2 σ_x, S_y = ħ/2 σ_y, and S_z = ħ/2 σ_z. Oh right, σ_y is the Pauli matrix given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the matrix for S_y would be (ħ/2) times that Pauli matrix.

So the expectation value <S_y> is ψ† S_y ψ. Breaking that down, ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ. So ψ is [3i, 4]^T. The conjugate of each component: the first is 3i, conjugate is -3i; the second is 4, stays 4. So ψ† is [-3i, 4].

So the calculation is ψ† multiplied by S_y matrix multiplied by ψ. Let me compute each part step by step.

First, S_y is (ħ/2) times the σ_y matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So to compute ψ† S_y ψ, I'll first compute S_y ψ, then multiply by ψ†.

Wait, let me write S_y ψ. So S_y ψ is:

First row: 0*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = 0
