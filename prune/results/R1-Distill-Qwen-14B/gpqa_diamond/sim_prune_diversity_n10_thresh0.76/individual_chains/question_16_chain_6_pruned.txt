Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it's not superimposable on its mirror image. So I need to check each compound to see if it has any chiral centers.

Let's go through each one step by step.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But substituting at position 1, so Cl is on the same carbon as the double bond. So it's Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So the structure is Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So the structure is Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? Wait no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2, making the structure as Cl attached to the same carbon as the double bond. So the molecule is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. Since it's a double bond, is there any possibility of geometric isomerism? The (Z) designation is present, so that's about configuration around the double bond. But for chirality, we need a chiral center. Let's see: the Cl is on a carbon attached to the double bond. So the structure is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. The central carbon (the one attached to Cl and the two CH2 groups) would have how many substituents? Wait, the structure is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. So the central carbon (the one next to Cl) is connected to:
