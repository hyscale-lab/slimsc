Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember some concepts from my electromagnetism class.

The problem says a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are A to D, each with different expressions.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics. Right, potential energy is usually associated with the work required to bring charges together. But when you have a conductor involved, things might get a bit more complex.

The sphere is conducting and grounded. Oh right, grounding means that the sphere is connected to the Earth, which is a large conductor at zero potential. So any excess charge on the sphere will reside on the surface, and the potential of the sphere's surface must be the same as the ground, which is zero. But wait, if the sphere is grounded, any induced charges will adjust accordingly.

So when charge q is placed near the sphere, it induces charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges that would cause the potential to be non-zero will be neutralized by the ground. Hmm, wait. Or maybe the sphere's induced charge is such that it's at the same potential as the ground.

Let me think about the method of images. Oh right, for a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge method isn't the same as an ungrounded sphere. Because when it's grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the image charge method might not directly apply here as it does for an ungrounded sphere.

Wait, no. The method of images might still be useful. For a conducting sphere not grounded, the image charge is inside the sphere, right? But when it's grounded, the induced charge is adjusted so that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. That complicates things because the induced charge depends on the distance d and the radius R.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the system as the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. The potential energy would be the work done to bring the charge from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere is conducting and grounded. So any charge on it would rearrange to ensure the surface is an equipotential, and the potential there is zero. Hmm, but when another charge is placed near it, the sphere will have induced charges. But because it's grounded, the net charge on the sphere is determined by the external charge.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down. The conducting sphere, when placed near charge q, will have induced charges. The charge q is positive, so the sphere's near side will have negative charges, and the far side positive. But since the sphere is grounded, electrons can flow in or out to maintain the surface potential at zero.

Wait, but if the sphere is neutral initially, when a positive charge q is placed near it, the sphere's near side will have negative induced charges, and the far side positive. But because it's grounded, the sphere can't have a net charge. So the induced positive charges on the far side will be canceled by electrons coming into the sphere from the ground. So the sphere ends up with an induced negative
