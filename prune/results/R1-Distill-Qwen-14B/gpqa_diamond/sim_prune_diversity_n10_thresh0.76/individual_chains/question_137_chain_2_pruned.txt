Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles, like protons, using magnetic fields and electric fields. But wait, synchrocyclotrons are a bit different. Oh right, they have a varying magnetic field as well, which allows them to handle particles that are moving at speeds close to the speed of light. That makes the equations a bit more complicated than regular cyclotrons.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Or maybe two acceleration cycles? I'm not entirely sure, but maybe it's about the number of times the voltage alternates, which relates to the number of times the proton goes around the cyclotron.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. Oh, wait, the problem gives Phi0 as π/4 and U0 as 190 kV. So U(t) is a cosine function with an initial phase of 45 degrees (since π/4 is 45 degrees). 

I'm trying to recall how the synchrocyclotron works. The key thing is that the proton is accelerated each time it passes through the gap where the electric field is applied. The accelerating voltage is applied at a certain frequency, which is synchronized with the proton's orbit. But because the proton's
