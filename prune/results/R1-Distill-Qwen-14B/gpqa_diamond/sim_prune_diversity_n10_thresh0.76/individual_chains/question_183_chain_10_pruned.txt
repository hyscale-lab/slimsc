Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a reaction. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is related to the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond contributes one to the index.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, cyclohexene means there's a six-membered ring with a double bond. The double bond is at position 3, so that's cyclohex-3-ene. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (which is a CHO group), and at position 5, there's a vinyl group (which is CH2CH2, but wait, I think vinyl is CH2=CH-). Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So the substituents are at carbons 2 and 5 of the cyclohexene ring.

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents: at C2, a CHO (formyl); at C5, a CH2CH2 group? No, wait, wait. Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so the substituent is CH2CH2? No, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So the group attached is a vinyl group, meaning that the substituent is CH2CH2? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, the substituent is actually a CH2CH2 group with a double bond. So the 5-vinyl would be a substituent where the cyclohexene ring is attached to a CH2CH2 group, but wait, that would be a single bond. Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the cyclohexene ring. So the structure would have a double bond in the vinyl group as well.

Wait, let me think again. The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the ring is cyclohexene (so one double bond in the ring), and the substituents are formyl (CHO) at C2 and a vinyl group (CH2CH2 with a double bond) at C5. Wait, no. The vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so the substituent is CH2CH2, but with a double bond between the two carbons, correct. So the substituent is CH2-CH2, but actually, it's CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituent has a double bond.

So the starting molecule has the cyclohexene ring (one double bond), a formyl group (which is a carbonyl, a double bond), and a vinyl group (another double bond). So how many double bonds and rings does the starting molecule have?

The cyclohexene ring contributes one double bond and one ring. The formyl group has a carbonyl group (another double bond). The vinyl group has another double bond. So that's three double bonds and one ring. So the
