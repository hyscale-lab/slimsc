Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and a mass that's also 1.5 times larger. Through spectroscopy, both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. The radial velocities are given: Star_1 is at 0 km/s, and Star_2 is at 700 km/s. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem says both stars have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest. Oh, right, the peak wavelength is determined by Wien's law. Wien's law says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is the same, T must be the same.

Wait, no, wait. Because if λ_max is the same, then T would be the same. Because T = b / λ_max. So if λ_max is same, T is same.

Wait, but then why are their velocities different? Oh, radial velocity might be due to Doppler shift. Oh right! Because the star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength is shifted. So if Star_2 has a high radial velocity, that would affect the observed wavelength, but the actual emission peak would still be at the same rest wavelength.

Wait, the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, perhaps the actual temperatures are different? Because the observed wavelengths might be shifted due to velocity.

Oh, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wien's law says that the peak wavelength emitted by a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature. So if two stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures would be the same. But wait, but if
