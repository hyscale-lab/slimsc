Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down the problem and see what each part tells me.

The problem is about a mixture X that's made of two equimolar liquids. This mixture X can decolorize bromine water. So I know that decolorizing bromine water usually means that there's a reaction happening, like an addition reaction with alkenes or alkynes, or maybe even some aromatic rings undergoing substitution. But since they're talking about two liquids, maybe it's something like two alkenes or something else that can react with Br2.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Disproportionation implies that one species is both oxidized and reduced. So, for example, maybe an alkene is getting split into two different products, like maybe one becomes a carbonyl and the other something else. Wait, but wait, the product Y doesn't react with bromine. So if X had double bonds that reacted, Y might not have those anymore. Hmm.

Next, when both X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions with platinum, they give only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%. So let's calculate what that means. Mass percent H is 14.28%, so that's 1/7 of the molar mass. So if the formula is CnHm, then (m)/(12n + m) = 1/7. Let's solve that. Let's let m = (1/7)(12n + m). Multiply both sides by7: 7m=12n +m → 6m=12n → m=2n. So formula is CnH2n, which is an alkene or alkyne, but wait, hydrogenation would add H2. Wait, but if Z is the product of hydrogenation of both X and Y, and it doesn't react further, maybe Z is a fully saturated compound—like an alkane.

Wait, but let me think about Z. Since X and Y both give Z upon hydrogenation, Z must be the most reduced form. So if X is something that can be hydrogenated, same with Y, giving the same product. So maybe X is an alkene and Y is something else that when hydrogenated gives an alkane.

Wait, but wait, what's the mass fraction. 14.28% is 1/7. So for Z, let's say the molecular formula is CnH2n. Wait no, because for an alkane, it's CnH2n+2. Let me recalculate. Let's use Z's H mass fraction.

Hydrogen's molar mass is 1, carbon is 12. So for Z, the H mass fraction is 14.28% which is 1/7. So (mass H)/(mass Z) = 1/7. So mass H = (number of H atoms) * 1, and mass Z is (n*12 + m*1). So:

(m) / (12
