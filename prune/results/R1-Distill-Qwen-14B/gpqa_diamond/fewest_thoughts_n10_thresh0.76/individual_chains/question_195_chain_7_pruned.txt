Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the setup is that there's a star with a radius 1.5 times the Sun's. There's a planet (let's call it Planet A) with Earth's radius in a circular orbit. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and its orbital period is 3 days. Now, we're supposed to find the maximum orbital period of a second planet (Planet B) with a radius 2.5 Earth radii. This Planet B should also exhibit both transit and occultation events. Both planets share the same orbital plane, and Planet B's orbit is also circular.

Hmm, so I remember that for a planet to transit its star, the orbital plane must be aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. The impact parameter describes how close the planet's path comes to the center of the star. A zero impact parameter means it goes directly in front.

Wait, but both planets are in the same orbital plane, so they must have aligned orbits. But their orbital periods are different. Planet A is much closer because it has a 3-day period, so it's much closer to the star than Planet B would be.

Wait, but we're looking for the maximum orbital period of Planet B such that both transit and occultation happen. Oh right, occultation is when the planet is behind the star from our perspective. So for that to happen, the planet must be larger or at least in a position where it can be eclipsed by the star.

Wait, but the star is 1.5 times the Sun's radius. So it's a bit larger than our Sun. The first planet has Earth's radius, the second 2.5 times Earth's. So both are much smaller than the star.

Wait, but for a planet to transit, it has to pass directly in front of the star. The impact parameter for Planet A is 0.2. Impact parameter (b) is the distance, in units of the star's radius, from the center of the star to the closest point of the planet's path during transit.

So for Planet A, the closest approach is 0.2 times the star's radius. So the path is a bit offset, but still allows a transit. 

Now, for Planet B to also transit, it must have a similar alignment
