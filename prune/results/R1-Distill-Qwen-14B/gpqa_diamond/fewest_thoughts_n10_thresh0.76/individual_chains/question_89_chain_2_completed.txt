Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step.

First, heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably dehydrohalogenation. But wait, what's the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure. Wait, no, 1 and 3 are across a bridge, but in any case, heating with KOH would likely lead to elimination, forming an alkene.

Wait, but since it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe the structure is such that elimination would form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dehydrohalogenation reaction where two adjacent Br atoms are removed, forming a double bond. So, the product would be a diene? Or maybe a single double bond. Wait, the product is a light yellow solid, which makes me think it's an alkene because alkenes can be yellow in color sometimes, and elimination reactions give alkenes.

The NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a high chemical shift, possibly an -OH proton, but wait, the IR shows an absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester). Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the initial reaction.

Wait, if KOH is in excess, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution reaction. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is probably a vicinal dihalide, so perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form an epoxide? No, wait, epoxides are formed from epoxidation, not elimination. Wait, no, wait: Vicinal dihalides can undergo elimination to form alkenes, but sometimes when a strong base is present, like KOH, it could lead to elimination. But wait, the product's IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but perhaps the product is an epoxide? No, wait, epoxide formation usually requires an oxidizing agent like mCPBA, not KOH. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination to form a ketone? Or perhaps elimination gives a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for esters. Alternatively, maybe it's a double substitution. Wait, KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. If it's a vicinal dihalide, perhaps the two Brs are eliminated, and two OH groups are added. But that would give a diol. But then, the IR would show O-H stretches, which would be around 3300 cm-1, but the IR here is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with excess KOH, heated. Another possibility is that each Br is replaced by an OH group, leading to a diol. But then, the IR would have O-H peaks, but the given IR is at 1720. So maybe the product isn't a diol.

Another thought: perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming an alkene, but perhaps it's further reacting. Wait, but then how would that lead to a carbonyl? Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, which would explain the IR peak at 1720.

Wait, maybe the first step is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then in the presence of excess KOH, perhaps it's further oxidized. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or some other reaction that forms an amine, but that doesn't fit here.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, but in such a way that forms a ketone. How? Wait, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that elimination would form a bridgehead double bond, but that's highly strained. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but substitution. Wait, but with two Br atoms, maybe it's a double substitution, but that would give a diol, which doesn't fit the IR.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think about the NMR data. The product 1 has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably an -OH group, but if it's a diol, maybe that's two -OHs. Wait, but 2H as a singlet suggests maybe a methylene adjacent to something. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide, but epoxide protons are usually in the 3-4 ppm range. Wait, maybe it's a ketone with some adjacent protons.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. Let's think: if 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes an epoxidation, but that would require an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but that's not leading to a carbonyl. Hmm, I'm stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is the formation of a carbonyl group. How? Maybe via oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that leads to amines. Alternatively, perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong and the product is an epoxide, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another approach: the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is indicative of a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of rearrangement or oxidation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution leading to a ketone.

Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen atom. Wait, that would give a compound with two O groups. But maybe the structure is such that when two adjacent Brs are replaced by O-, perhaps that leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that upon elimination of HBr twice, it forms a ketone. For example, in a ring structure, the elimination of two HBr molecules could lead to a carbonyl group. Let me imagine the structure: adamantane has a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two adjacent bridgehead carbons. When KOH is added, maybe each of the Brs leaves, and the adjacent C-H bonds break, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, that would form an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is an alcohol that upon further reaction forms a ketone, but that doesn't fit the given steps.

Wait, maybe the first step is a double elimination, forming a ketone. Let me think about the mechanism. Suppose each Br is eliminated, but the resulting structure forms a carbonyl. For example, if two adjacent carbons each lose Br and gain a double bond, but that would form an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: the NMR data. The product 1 has 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a relatively high shift. Maybe that's a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or a carbonyl. Wait, but the IR is at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone.

So, product 1 is a ketone. How did we get there from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form a carbonyl. For example, each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a CH2 group. When both Brs leave, perhaps the two CH2 groups lose H and form a double bond, but that would form an alkene, not a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group through some kind of cyclic transition state. Wait, maybe it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an -OH, but then what leads to the carbonyl? Maybe the diol undergoes further reaction, but the question says that product 1 is formed by heating with KOH, so perhaps it's just the initial product.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible product structures. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent bridgehead carbons. Heating with KOH could lead to elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a double bond. But that would give an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the KOH is not acting as a base but as a nucleophile, leading to substitution. But with two Br atoms, substitution would give a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Hmm. Maybe the product is not a diol but something else. Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination with KOH, leading to a conjugated diene, but how does that produce a carbonyl?

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product is an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonyl formed via an elimination followed by some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Let me think about the possible mechanism. If two adjacent Br atoms are present, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. For example, each Br leaves, and the adjacent carbons form a double bond, but in a way that creates a carbonyl. Wait, but that's not possible because a double bond can't form a carbonyl in that way. Alternatively, perhaps the structure rearranges.

Wait, I'm stuck on this first step. Let me move to the next step and see if that helps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide, Al(OiPr)3, is a Lewis acid catalyst commonly used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, if product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's an acylation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation if product 1 is an alkyl halide, but that doesn't fit with the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes ring-opening. But without knowing product 1, it's hard to say.

Then, product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes. So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments. The work-up with dimethyl sulfide (instead of Zn or other reductants) typically leads to the formation of aldehydes or ketones without further oxidation.

Then, the NMR of product 3 is to be analyzed, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange.

But I'm getting stuck on the initial reaction. Let me try again.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the IR of product 1. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, likely a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone derived from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. How?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where both Br atoms are replaced by hydroxyl groups, leading to a diol, but the IR doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination reaction that creates a ketone.

Wait, maybe the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that when two HBr molecules are eliminated, a carbonyl group is formed. For example, in a structure where two adjacent CH2Br groups lose HBr, leading to a carbonyl. Let me imagine the structure: perhaps the two Brs are on carbons that are each adjacent to two CH2 groups. So, elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps in such a way that a carbonyl is formed. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation leading to a conjugated diene, but again, that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form a carbonyl via a cyclic transition state. For example, in a vicinal dihalide, each X is on a carbon adjacent to another carbon with a leaving group. Eliminating both X groups and forming a double bond between two adjacent carbons, but that's an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a key reaction here. Let me think about other possibilities. Oh! Wait a minute—maybe the reaction is a Dieckmann cyclization. Dieckmann cyclization is an intramolecular ester condensation, but that requires an ester, which we don't have here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol rearrangement, which involves vicinal diols. But again, I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination leading to the formation of a ketone via a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. For example, if the elimination leads to a carbocation rearrangement that forms a more stable carbonyl group. But I'm not sure about the exact mechanism here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Wait, but then the IR wouldn't show a strong carbonyl. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But how? If each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an oxygen, leading to a diol, but then that diol undergoes further oxidation. But the reaction with KOH doesn't seem to involve an oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester, but I don't see how that would form from KOH and a dihalide.

Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination leading to the formation of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So, the elimination of two HBr molecules would form a double bond adjacent to a ketone. But how would that form from a vicinal dihalide?

Ah! Wait, wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism. Alternatively, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that elimination leads to a bridgehead carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bicyclic compound where elimination of two HBr molecules forms a bridgehead double bond, but that's not leading to a carbonyl.

I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the product is a diketone, but I can't see how that would happen from a vicinal dihalide and KOH.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination forming an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. For example, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a simple elimination, forming an alkene, but that doesn't fit the IR. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is an epoxide, which then upon further reaction forms a ketone. But no, the product 1 is formed by KOH and heat, so it's the first step.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol, but the IR doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ether, but that doesn't fit the IR either.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, and the NMR data supports that. Let's look at the NMR again. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or a carbonyl. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be CH2 groups in a ring structure, perhaps adamantane-related. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group, maybe near the carbonyl.

So, product 1 is a ketone. How did we get there?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination leading to the formation of a ketone. Let me think about the structure: If 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br on carbons 1 and 3, perhaps elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. For example, eliminating two HBr molecules and forming a double bond between C1 and C3, but that wouldn't form a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that elimination leads to a bridgehead carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an O- group, leading to a diol, which then undergoes oxidation to a ketone. But the KOH isn't an oxidizing agent, and the reaction conditions are heating, not oxidation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone formed via a double elimination, but I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination. Maybe it's a substitution where each Br is replaced by something else. But with KOH, substitution would give a diol.

Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl. So, diol might not fit. Unless there's some dehydration. But diols typically don't dehydrate under KOH conditions without a strong acid.

I'm really stuck on the first step. Maybe I should move on and see if the later steps can help.

Product 1 is a ketone. Then, it's heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts. So, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or something else. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an aromatic compound with a ketone group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and upon treatment with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes ring-opening. But without knowing product 1, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which then under Lewis acid conditions undergoes some kind of cyclization. But again, not sure.

Then, product 2 is ozonolyzed. Ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, so product 2 must have a double bond. Let me think: Product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide. Maybe product 2 is an alkene formed via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation.

Wait, if product 1 has a ketone group, and Al isopropoxide is used, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or something that can form a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is an alkene formed via ring-opening. But I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an ester. Then, Al isopropoxide could facilitate its decomposition. But I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and under Al isopropoxide, it undergoes elimination to form an alkene. That would fit, because then product 2 would have a double bond, which would explain the ozonolysis step.

So, product 1 is a diol. Then, when heated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it loses water to form an alkene (elimination reaction). So product 2 would be an alkene.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is a simple alkene like 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would break it into two smaller carbonyl compounds.

But in our case, product 3 is formed after ozonolysis. The NMR of product 3 is the focus.

Wait, but the first step's product 1's IR shows a carbonyl, which would not fit if product 1 is a diol. So that's a contradiction. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would give a di-ketone or di-aldehyde, depending on the structure.

But the initial product 1's IR is at 1720, which suggests a ketone. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone formed via some reaction with Al isopropoxide. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the final step.

Ozonolysis of product 2, which has a double bond, forms product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be in an environment that leads to a specific coupling pattern.

In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each carbonyl group is formed. The coupling pattern would depend on the structure of product 3.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, the options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

Wait, maybe the most deshielded proton is adjacent to a carbonyl group, and it's coupled with two neighboring protons.

In ozonolysis, if the original double bond was part of a cyclic structure, the cleavage might lead to a diketone or two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, another thought: If product 2 is a simple alkene, say CH2=CH-..., ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes or ketones.

But perhaps product 2 is a more complex structure. Let me think about the overall structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is adamantane with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond, and the resulting product would have carbonyl groups at the break points.

But adamantane is highly branched, so the ozonolysis product would have multiple carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and it's coupled with two neighboring groups.

Wait, another approach: in the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded proton is likely near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. Protons near carbonyls are usually deshielded and appear downfield.

The coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring protons. For example, a triplet occurs when a proton is split by two neighboring protons. A triplet of triplets is when a proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons, each causing a triplet split.

Wait, but if the proton is next to a CH2 group, it might couple with two protons (as a triplet) and perhaps another set.

Alternatively, if the proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, it might have two neighboring protons on either side.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, the original double bond is cleaved, and the resulting carbonyl groups are formed. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded.

Suppose the original alkene in product 2 is in a structure like CH2-CH2, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like CH2-CH2 with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the double bond in product 2 is between two CH2 groups, each adjacent to a branch. For example, if the structure is CH2-CH2 within a more complex molecule, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

The options are for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in product 3.

Option A: triplet—so two neighboring protons.

Option B: triplet of triplets—two different coupling constants, each causing a triplet.

Option C: doublet of triplets—two couplings, one triplet and one doublet.

Option D: pentet—four neighboring protons, but that's unlikely unless in a highly branched environment.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded proton is adjacent to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2. So, the proton would be split by two protons on one side and perhaps another two on the other, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the proton is adjacent to a CH group with two protons, leading to a triplet.

Wait, another possibility: the proton is next to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2 group. So, the proton has two neighboring protons (from the adjacent CH2), each coupling, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl proton, but that's unlikely after ozonolysis.

Wait, in ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and the adjacent protons become part of the carbonyl groups. So, any protons adjacent to the double bond would be gone, but perhaps other protons further away would remain.

Wait, perhaps the double bond in product 2 is between two CH groups, each with two substituents. So, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, each with adjacent substituents.

In that case, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups would be on a CH2 group, perhaps. So, the NMR would show a triplet for a CH2 group next to another CH2 or a CH group.

Wait, perhaps in product 3, the structure is such that a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl, and each CH2 proton is split by neighboring protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, which is next to a CH2 group. Then, the proton would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the proton is part of a CH2 group next to a CH group, leading to coupling with two protons on one side and perhaps another on the other, resulting in a more complex splitting pattern.

Wait, another thought: Ozonolysis of a cyclic alkene would give a diketone. For example, if product 2 is a cyclopropane derivative with a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into a diketone.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product 3 is a diketone, and the most deshielded proton is on a CH2 group adjacent to a ketone.

In that case, the CH2 would be split by neighboring groups. If the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, perhaps each CH2 proton would be a triplet due to coupling with two protons on either side.

Wait, but if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, each CH2 proton would be next to two others, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, each proton would be split by two protons, giving a triplet.

But perhaps the situation is more complex. For example, if the CH2 group is adjacent to a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH2, the coupling could be more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the most deshielded proton is on a CH group that's adjacent to a CH2 group. So, each H on the CH would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, that's possible. So, each proton on the CH would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if there are other couplings, it could become a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, the proton might be split by two different sets of neighboring protons, each with a different coupling constant, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

From the NMR data of product 3, the most deshielded H would likely be in a position where it's coupled with two or more sets of protons.

If the proton is next to a CH2 group, each of its protons would be split into a triplet. But if there's another adjacent group, like another CH2, the splitting could become more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is next to a CH group which is next to a CH2. So, the H would be split by the two Hs on the CH group and perhaps the two Hs on the next CH2, leading to a more complex pattern.

Wait, but in practice, the most common coupling patterns in such situations are either triplets or doublets, depending on the neighboring groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the proton is in a geminal position to another proton, but that's less likely to cause splitting.

Hmm. Another approach: The most deshielded proton is likely on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So, each H in that CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent group, leading to a triplet.

But if the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each H would be split by two Hs, leading to a triplet.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet (option A).

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group with two Hs, then each H in the CH2 would be split by two Hs (from the CH), leading to a triplet.

So, the answer might be a triplet.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is more complex.

Wait, another possibility: The proton is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is also next to another CH2 group. So, each H in the CH2 would be split by two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. Additionally, if there's another coupling, perhaps from a neighboring CH group, it could lead to a triplet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is a triplet of triplets because the proton is coupled with two different sets of neighboring protons, each causing a triplet split.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded proton is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and the adjacent group is another CH2, leading to a triplet. So, the answer would be triplet (A).

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe it's a triplet of triplets if there are two different coupling partners.

Hmm. I think I'll go with triplet of triplets as the answer, but I'm not entirely sure.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating with excess KOH, which likely results in a double elimination reaction. This forms a product with a carbonyl group, as indicated by the IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. The NMR data for product 1 suggests the presence of a CH₂ group at 4.79 ppm, likely adjacent to the carbonyl group, along with other CH₂ groups in the adamantane framework.

In the second step, product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This likely facilitates further reaction, forming product 2, which contains a double bond (alkene). The presence of a double bond in product 2 is consistent with the subsequent ozonolysis step.

In the third step, ozonolysis is performed on product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group and influenced by neighboring protons.

Analyzing the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, it is reasonable to conclude that this hydrogen is coupled with two sets of neighboring protons, each causing a triplet splitting. This results in a **triplet of triplets** coupling pattern.

Answer: B
