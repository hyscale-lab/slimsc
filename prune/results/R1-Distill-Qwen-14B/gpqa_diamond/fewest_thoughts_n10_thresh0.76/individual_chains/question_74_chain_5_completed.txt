Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let's try to think it through. Alright, the question is about the probability of an atom decaying after a certain time, given that it hasn't decayed for a shorter period. 

Wait, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. So the decay process is memoryless, right? That means the chance of the atom decaying in the next interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed without it decaying. Hmm, so if that's the case, then the probability shouldn't be affected by the fact that 50 minutes have passed.

The question gives some numbers: the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, if I have an atom, there's a 32% chance it will decay in 100 minutes. Now, after 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed, what's the chance it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait, no, the next 150 minutes would take the total time to 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Or does the problem mean the next 150 minutes from the current time, making it 150 minutes in total since the start? Or does it mean the next 150 minutes from now, which would be a 150-minute interval?

Wait, let's read the question again. It says, "the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes." So after the current time, 50 minutes have passed since it was created, and we're looking at the next 150 minutes. So the total time being considered is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

But wait, no, because the decay probability given is for 100 minutes. So perhaps I should model this with the decay constant.

The decay probability over time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.

Wait, but the problem says the probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). So I can solve for λ.

Let me rearrange that. e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides: -λ*100 = ln(0.68). So λ = (-ln(0.68)) / 100.

Calculating ln(0.68): I remember that ln(0.5) is about -0.6931. 0.68 is a bit higher, so ln(0.68) would be about -0.3857. So λ ≈ 0.3857 / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Now, the question is about the next 150 minutes. So I need to find the probability that the atom decays between t=50 and t=50+150=200 minutes. But wait, since the decay is memoryless, the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes is e^(-λ*50). Then, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P(150) multiplied by the probability it hasn't decayed yet. Wait, no, more accurately, it's P(150) from the current time, which is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, regardless of the previous time.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The probability that it decays between t=50 and t=50+150 is the same as the probability that it decays in the 150 minutes starting now. Because the exponential distribution is memoryless, the probability doesn't depend on the previous time. So the chance it decays in the next 150 is the same as if we just started monitoring. But wait, wait no, because the given probability is for 100 minutes. So perhaps we're dealing with a certain time frame, and we need to compute the probability based on the decay constant.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the decay as a Poisson process. The number of decays is Poisson distributed, but maybe that's more complicated.

Wait, another approach: since the decay is memoryless, the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of it decaying within 150 minutes, starting from t=0. Because, regardless of how much time has passed, the chance in the next interval is the same. So the 50 minutes that have passed don't affect this probability. Wait, is that correct?

Wait no, that doesn't make sense. Because if the probability to decay in 100 minutes is 32%, then the decay constant λ must be such that 32% = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). So I can find λ as I did before.

Then, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ * 150). But wait, the problem states that the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes. So the total time is 200 minutes, but in this case, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is equal to the probability that it decays within 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Wait, but since the process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes (starting now) is P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ*150). So perhaps I can compute this using the λ we found.

Wait, but I just found λ using P(100)=0.32.

So let me compute λ again. So from P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). So e^(-100λ)=0.68. Taking ln, -100λ = ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, compute P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ*150). Let's compute λ*150: 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849. So e^(-0.57849) ≈ e^(-0.5785). I know that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let's approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let me think. 0.5785 is approximately 0.58. So e^(-0.58) = 1 / e^(0.58). Let's compute e^0.58.

e^0.5 is about 1.64872. e^0.6 is about 1.82211. e^0.58 = e^(0.5 + 0.08) = e^0.5 * e^0.08. e^0.08 is approximately 1.083287. So e^0.58 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.083287 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08 is about 1.784, but more accurately, 1.64872 * 1.083287. Let's compute:

1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872, 1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976, so total 1.7806176. Now, 0.003287 of 1.64872 is 1.64872 * 0.003287 ≈ 0.005403. So total e^0.58 ≈ 1.7806176 + 0.005403 ≈ 1.786. So e^0.58 ≈ 1.786, so 1/e^0.58 ≈ 1/1.786 ≈ 0.559.

So P(150) = 1 - 0.559 ≈ 0.441, which is about 44.1%. Looking at the options, the closest is option A)44%.

But wait, wait a minute. The given options are 44%, 40%, etc. So is 44% the correct answer? But wait, wait a second. Because the question says that the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes already. So does that affect the probability in the next 150?

Wait, no, because radioactive decay is memoryless. The probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes depends only on the current time, not on how long it's been since it was created. So the 50 minutes already passed don't change the probability for the next 150. So the answer is 44%, which would be option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total time as 200 minutes (50 + 150), and the probability that it hasn't decayed in 200 minutes. But that's not what the question is asking. The question is asking for the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Wait, but in that case, perhaps the approach is different. The probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is equal to the probability that it decays within 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

So, the formula for conditional probability would be:

P(decay between 50 and 200) = [P(decay <=200) - P(decay <=50)] / [1 - P(decay <=50)]

Because P(decay between 50 and 200) is equal to P(decay <=200) minus P(decay <=50), but divided by the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50 (which is 1 - P(decay <=50)).

So let's compute this.

We have P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100) => λ = ln(0.68)/-100 ≈ 0.0038566 min^-1.

Now compute P(50) = 1 - e^(-λ*50) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 *50) → λ*50 = 0.0038566 *50 = 0.19283. So e^(-0.19283) ≈ 0.825, so P(50) ≈ 1 - 0.825 = 0.175.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. e^(-0.19283) → since e^-0.19283. Let's compute 0.19283.

We can use the approximation e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 for small x. x = -0.19283, which is a bit beyond the small x, but perhaps it's close enough.

e^(-0.19283) ≈ 1 - 0.19283 + ( (0.19283)^2 ) / 2.

0.19283^2 ≈ 0.03719. Dividing by 2 → 0.018595.

So 1 - 0.19283 = 0.80717. 0.80717 + 0.018595 = 0.825765. So e^(-0.19283) ≈ 0.825765. So P(50) = 1 - 0.825765 ≈ 0.174235, about 17.4%.

Now, P(200) = 1 - e^(-λ*200). λ=0.0038566, so 200 * λ = 0.77132. e^-0.77132 → e^-0.7 is about 0.4966. e^-0.77 is about 0.4624. Hmm, maybe more accurately.

Wait, perhaps better to compute it using precise calculations. Let me see:

e^(-0.77132) → perhaps using a calculator approach. Natural logs are tricky without a calculator, so perhaps I can approximate it.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the relationship between λ and the half-life. Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the P(200).

Wait, λ is 0.0038566 per minute, so 200 * λ = 0.77132. So e^(-0.77132) → let me think. We know that ln(2) ≈0.6931. So 0.77132 is about 0.6931 + 0.07821. So e^(-0.6931) = 0.5. e^(-0.07821) ≈ 1 - 0.07821 + (0.07821^2)/2 - ... ≈ approx 0.925 (since e^-0.08 is about 0.9231). So e^(-0.77132) = e^(-0.6931) * e^(-0.07821) ≈ 0.5 * 0.925 ≈ 0.4625. So P(200) =1 - 0.4625 = 0.5375, which is about 53.75%.

So, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is P(200) - P(50) = 0.5375 - 0.174235 ≈ 0.363265 (36.33%).

But wait, this is under the condition that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes. So the conditional probability is P(50 < decay ≤200) / (1 - P(decay ≤50)).

So the numerator is 0.363265, and the denominator is 1 - 0.174235 = 0.825765.

So the conditional probability is 0.363265 / 0.825765 ≈ 0.4397, or about 43.97%, which is approximately 44%.

Wait a minute, this brings me back to the same answer as before, 44%, which is option A. So perhaps my initial approach was correct.

But wait, why is the answer different when computed with the conditional approach? Because in the conditional approach, the 50 minutes have passed, so the next 150 is a 150-minute window. But according to the memoryless property, the probability should be the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute period starting now, which would be 1 - e^(-λ *150) ≈ 44%. So both methods give the same result, which makes sense because the memoryless property implies that the conditional probability is the same as the unconditional probability for the next interval.

So the correct answer is 44%, which is option A.


To determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, we use the exponential decay model, which is memoryless. The decay probability over time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so:

\[
P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging for \( \lambda \):

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68 \quad \Rightarrow \quad -\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3857 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3857}{100} \approx 0.003857 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Since the process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on \( \lambda \) and the time interval:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.003857 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003857 \cdot 150 \approx 0.5785
\]

\[
e^{-0.5785} \approx 0.559 \quad \Rightarrow \quad P(150) = 1 - 0.559 \approx 0.441
\]

Thus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%. This result aligns with the memoryless property of radioactive decay, meaning the 50 minutes already passed do not affect the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.

The closest option to this result is:

**A) 44%**
