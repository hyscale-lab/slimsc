Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the diffraction pattern created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup is that the aperture is an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length a. When monochromatic light (wavelength λ) falls vertically on this aperture, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh, and they mention that tan(theta) is approximately theta because the angles are small. 

Wait, so when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So this problem is probably related to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

I remember that for a circular aperture, the first minima occur at an angle given by something like the Rayleigh criterion. But wait, the Rayleigh criterion is about the resolving power of a telescope, and it's related to the first minimum in the diffraction pattern. The formula is θ ≈ 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture.

Wait a second, but in this problem, the apothem is given as 'a'. What's the apothem in a regular polygon? The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem (a) is related to the radius (R) of the circumscribed circle. The formula is a = R * cos(π/N), I think. But when N becomes very large, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so the apothem a becomes approximately equal to R, which is the radius of the polygon. So for a circular aperture, the diameter would be 2a. So D = 2a.

Wait, but wait, in a circular aperture, the formula for the first minimum is θ = 1.22 λ / (2a). Because D is 2a. So plugging that in, θ = (1.22 λ) / (2a) = 0.61 λ / a. Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is 0.610 λ/a, which matches this.

Alternatively, wait a second, I might be getting confused between the radius and the apothem. Let me think again. The apothem 'a'
