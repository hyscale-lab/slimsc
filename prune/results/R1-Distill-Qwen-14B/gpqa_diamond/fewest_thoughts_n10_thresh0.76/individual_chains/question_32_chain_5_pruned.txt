Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of a nucleus. Hmm, I need to find the energy when the speed is 0.96c. Let's see, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, since 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons.

So, the first thing I think I need to do is find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. I remember that the mass of a nucleus isn't just the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy and mass defect. But wait, maybe for this problem, since it's a heavy ion, they just want me to approximate using the sum of the individual masses. Or perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon and multiply by the number of nucleons. Let me think. Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons). The mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So each is roughly around 938-940 MeV. But wait, the exact values might differ, but perhaps for this problem, I can take each as roughly 938 MeV/c².

Wait, but wait, I think the exact mass of Li-6 is actually measured. Let me try to remember. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015199 atomic mass units (u). Oh, yeah, because the standard atomic mass of Li is about 6.941, but the isotopic mass of Li-6 is around 6.0152 u.

So, converting that to kilograms. 1 u is 1.66053906660×10^-27 kg. So 6.0152
