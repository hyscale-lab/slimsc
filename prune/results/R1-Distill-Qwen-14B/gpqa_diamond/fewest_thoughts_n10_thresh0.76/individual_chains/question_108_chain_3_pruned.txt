Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The setup is that there's a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and m is small. The magnetic field is 1 Tesla. The given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is the Balmer series wavelength for hydrogen, like the H-alpha line.

Hmm, I remember that the paramagnetic coupling term is related to the interaction between the magnetic field and the electron's magnetic moment. Oh right, the term is usually given by something like H = μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is (eħ)/(2m_e), but wait, maybe it's μ_B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is m. Oh wait, no, the orbital magnetic quantum number is l, and m is the z-component in the case of a magnetic field along Oz. But the problem says m is small, so maybe it's not a high orbital state. Not sure if that matters for the magnitude.

The transition energy ΔE is given by the wavelength λ. Since E = hc/λ, I can calculate that. Let's calculate ΔE first.

So λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nanometers. Let's convert that to meters: 486.1e-9 meters.

Plugging into E = hc/λ: Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is about 3e8 m/s.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (4.861e-7) ≈ around 4.09e-19 J.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let's see, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = 4.09e-19 J.

So ΔE is about 4e-19 J. But wait, that's just the energy. Let me think about the paramagnetic term.

The paramagnetic term H is the energy due to the magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is H = -μ·B. For an electron, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor, but for the orbital term, g is about 1. For the spin term, g is about 2, but I think the question is asking about the orbital term since it
