Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a certain spin state.

The spin state given is (3i, 4). Wait, I think that's a column vector, right? So it's a two-component vector. And I remember that in quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, where Ô is the operator.

The operator for spin in the y-direction, S_y, is given by ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix σ_y. Oh right, σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y, which looks like:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So the operator S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

Now, the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T. To find the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩, I need to compute ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

Wait, but wait. The state is given as (3i,4), so that's the column vector. So when I take the bra vector ⟨ψ|, it should be the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩. So that would be [ -4, -3i ] as the row vector. Because the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 is 4. So the bra vector is [4*, (-3i)*] = [4, -3i], no wait wait: wait wait no, wait: wait, let me think.

Wait, the original state is |ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T. So the conjugate is [ -3i, 4 ]^T. Then the bra vector is the row vector [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait no, wait: wait, when you take the conjugate transpose of a column vector, you get a row vector where each element is the complex conjugate. So for |ψ⟩ = [ a, b ]^T, then ⟨ψ| is [ a*, b* ].

So for |ψ⟩ being [3i, 4]^T,

a = 3i, so a* = -3i.

b =4, so b* =4.

So ⟨ψ| is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, wait again. Wait, 3i is a complex number. Its complex conjugate is -3i. So when you take the conjugate transpose, the first element becomes -3i, and the second is 4.

So now, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

But S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y, so substituting that in, we get:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩.

So I can compute the matrix element σ_y |ψ⟩ first, then take the inner product with ⟨ψ|.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the matrix product σ_y |ψ⟩, then take the inner product.

So let's compute σ_y multiplied by |ψ⟩.

σ_y is [[0,
