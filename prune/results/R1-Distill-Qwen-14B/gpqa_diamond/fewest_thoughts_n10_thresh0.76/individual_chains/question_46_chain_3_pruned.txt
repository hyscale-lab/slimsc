Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to think it through. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and determining how many possible products are formed, excluding ethene. Hmm.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So, the catalyst would break and reform double bonds. Grubbs is usually good for ring-closing metathesis and also for cross metathesis. But wait, in this case, the molecule is just a simple alkene, so I'm thinking it's going to undergo some kind of ring formation or maybe a rearrangement?

The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, no, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me count. Pentene has five carbons. So, pent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon of pent-1-ene. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that's six carbons? No, wait, wait. Oh, no, wait. Let me correct.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pentene is five carbons. So, the formula is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pentene is five carbons, so 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, but that's four carbons after the double bond. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I should write it differently. Let me number the carbons. Carbon 1 is the first carbon, double bond between 1 and 2. Then carbon 3 is CH(CH3), followed by two more carbons? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me draw it step by step.
