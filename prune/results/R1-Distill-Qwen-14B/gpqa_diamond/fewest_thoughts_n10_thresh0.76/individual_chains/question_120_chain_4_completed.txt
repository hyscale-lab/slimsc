Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax, assuming stars are uniformly distributed. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) in arcseconds is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance. Or wait, no, distance is 1/plx. So as parallax increases, the distance decreases, meaning stars are closer.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So if I imagine looking at a certain range of parallax, like from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in there?

If stars are uniformly distributed, that means their distances are uniformly distributed. But wait, if the distribution is uniform in space, how does that translate into the number as a function of parallax?

Wait, what's the relationship between distance and the number of stars. Oh, wait, the volume of space increases with the cube of the radius. So, the number of stars in a shell between distance d and d + dd would be proportional to the volume, which is 4πd² dd. So the number density per unit distance is proportional to d².

But wait, we're talking about parallax here. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so d = 1/plx. So as plx increases, d decreases, meaning closer stars.

Wait, the number of stars in a given parallax range. Let me model it.

I think the number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd is 4π d² dd multiplied by the number density of stars. Assuming uniform distribution, the number of stars is (number per unit volume) * volume of the shell.

But wait, the question is about per unit range of parallax. Hmm. So let's define a unit change in parallax, say dplx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, if I have a small change in plx, dplx, how does that relate to dd?

dplx is the change in parallax. Since plx = 1/d, the change in plx dplx = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = -d² dplx. But since d is positive and we're considering small changes, maybe I can ignore the negative sign for now.

So, the number of stars in a parallax range plx to plx + dplx is equal to the number in the distance range d to d - (d² dplx), because as plx increases, d decreases.

So, substituting d = 1/plx, the number of stars in this shell is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d² dplx) ) multiplied by the number density (assuming uniform distribution).

Wait, let me write it more clearly. The number of stars N in a shell at distance d is given by:

N = 4π d² (number density) * dd

But since we're considering a change in parallax, dplx, and we have dd = - d² dplx.

So substituting, N = 4π d² (number density) * (-d² dplx)

Wait, but number density is a constant if stars are uniformly distributed. So the number of stars per unit parallax range would be proportional to d² * d² * dplx, but wait, d is 1/plx. So substituting d = 1/plx:

d² = (1/plx)^2 = 1/plx².

So N = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx^2) * dplx * (number density)

Wait, but I'm probably mixing up things here. Let me try another approach.

The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd.

If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in that shell is proportional to the volume: N = k * 4π d² dd, where k is the number density.

But d is 1/plx, so d² is 1/plx².

So N = k *4π (1/plx²) * dd.

But we need to express N in terms of parallax. So let's express dd in terms of dplx.

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Taking derivative: dd = - d² dplx. So, dd = - (1/plx)^2 dplx.

Substituting back into N: N = k *4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx²) dplx.

The negative sign indicates that as plx increases (d decreases), the number of stars decreases. But since we're interested in the magnitude, we can ignore the sign.

So N = k *4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. That is, dN/dplx. So dN/dplx = N / dplx (since N = (dN/dplx) * dplx). So dN/dplx = k *4π (1/plx^4).

Wait, but that suggests that the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. Hmm, but the options don't have that. Wait, the options are A) 1/plx^4, B) 1/plx², etc.

Wait, the question says, "how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?" So perhaps the question is asking about the density as a function of plx, which is dN/dplx.

Wait, but in my calculation, dN/dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4. But that's option A.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the number of stars in a given volume is uniform.

If I have a range in parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, this corresponds to a range in distance from d =1/plx to d' = 1/(plx + dplx). The volume between these two distances is V = (4/3)π (d'^3 - d^3).

But for small dplx, we can approximate d^3 as (1/plx)^3, and d' ≈ 1/(plx) - (dplx)/(plx^2), using a Taylor expansion.

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, using the shell approximation, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd * n, where n is the number density.

But since d = 1/plx, and dd = -(1/plx^2) dplx.

So substituting:

N = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx^2) dplx ) * n.

Again, ignoring the negative sign for magnitude, N = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number per unit parallax dN/dplx is 4π n (1/plx^4).

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4, which would be option A.

But wait, I thought that the number of stars per unit volume is constant, so the number in a given volume increases with volume. But how does the volume change with parallax?

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about it in terms of how many stars you would observe with a certain parallax.

If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number at a certain distance d is proportional to the surface area (since more stars in a larger area) but also considering that we can see more distant stars. Wait, but that might not be the case because we can only see a certain depth.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the question is about the distribution in the sky. So, each star's position on the sky is random, and their distances are uniformly distributed in space.

Wait, but in reality, more distant stars would have lower parallax. So, if we have a range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, that corresponds to a range in distance from d=1/plx to d=1/(plx + dplx).

The number of stars in that range would depend on how much volume is between those two distances.

Volume between d and d + dd is approximately 4π d² dd.

Since d =1/plx, and dd = -d² dplx, substituting, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (- (1/plx)^2 dplx) ).

So the volume is proportional to 1/plx^4 * dplx.

If stars are uniformly distributed, the number is proportional to the volume, so the number N in the range is proportional to (1/plx^4) * dplx.

Thus, the number per unit parallax (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer should be A) ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but what about other approaches? Let me think about the differential.

The number of stars at a parallax plx is dN/dplx. So, dN/dplx = N(>plx) - N(>plx + dplx), but that might not help directly.

Alternatively, suppose the number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to the area (4π d²) times the thickness in distance (dd). But since we're considering a change in parallax dplx, how does that translate?

Wait, another way: the number of stars per unit volume is n. So the number in a thin shell is n * 4π d² dd.

But since dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx, substituting, the number is n *4π (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2 dplx) ) = -4 π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

But the question is about the number per unit parallax, which would be dN/dplx = -4 π n (1/plx^4 ).

So again, it's proportional to 1/plx^4.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). This means the number of stars in a shell is proportional to \( d^2 \).

Since \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we can express \( d^2 \) as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \). Additionally, the change in distance \( dd \) is related to the change in parallax \( d\text{plx} \) by \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \), where the negative sign indicates that as parallax increases, distance decreases.

Substituting \( d^2 = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) into the expression for the number of stars in a shell, we find that the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., \( \frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \)) is proportional to:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This result arises because the number of stars in a shell depends on the volume, which scales as \( d^2 \), and the thickness \( dd \) introduces an additional factor of \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \). Thus, the total dependence on \( \text{plx} \) is \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \), corresponding to option A.
