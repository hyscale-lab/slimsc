Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. But pseudosphere... I remember that's a 2D surface, maybe with some negative curvature.

Wait, pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. So I think the metric must be conformally flat, like in 2D, which it is because it's written in terms of a conformal factor multiplied by dx² + dy².

The given metric looks like it's in conformal form. The general form for a 2D metric in conformal coordinates is ds² = e^{2λ} (dx² + dy²). Comparing that to what's given, the conformal factor here is sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)). Or wait, actually, the given is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So the factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So maybe it's more like e^{2λ} = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, but I should first figure out what this metric represents. Let's see: the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So when x
