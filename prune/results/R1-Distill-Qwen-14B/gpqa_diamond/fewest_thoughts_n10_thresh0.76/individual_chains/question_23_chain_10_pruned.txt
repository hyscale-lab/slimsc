Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The question says that a researcher reacted ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, they checked the reaction progress using TLC and found that the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots. I need to figure out which of the options correctly identifies the products.

Hmm, let's break this down. The starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me try to draw that structure mentally. The benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl group is specifically 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O- attached to benzene.

Wait, wait, let me make sure. The butenyl group is four carbons long. The double bond is between C3 and C4? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but in IUPAC nomenclature, the lower number is given to the double bond. So but-3-en-1-yl would mean the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again: the substituents are numbered to get the lowest possible numbers. So, for but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 of the butenyl group. But wait, a butenyl group is four carbons. So 1, 2, 3, 4, with the double bond between 3 and 4. But that would make it a terminal double bond. Alternatively, maybe I misread the substituents.

Wait, the structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the butenyl group is -CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-? No, wait, the double bond is in the butenyl group. So the structure is CH
