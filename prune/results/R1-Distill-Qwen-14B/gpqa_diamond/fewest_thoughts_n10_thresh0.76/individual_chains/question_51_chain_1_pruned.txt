Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but I'll give it a try. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions.

Hmm, potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to bring charges together or something like that. Right, when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the sphere is grounded, so that probably affects things a lot.

Wait, when a conducting sphere is grounded, it can have charges flow in or out from the ground. So if I place a charge q near it, the sphere will induce charges. But wait, because it's a conductor, the charges will move to the surface.

But wait, because the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere must be zero. Oh right! Because grounding means the potential is at zero. So the sphere's own potential is zero, which might simplify things.

So, the sphere is neutral to start with. When I bring a charge q near it, the sphere will have induced charges. Since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge would go to the ground. Wait, actually, no. Let me think again. Wait, when you bring a positive charge near a grounded sphere, the electrons in the sphere (which are mobile) will be attracted towards the near side. So the sphere would have a negative induced charge on the near side, and positive on the far side. But since the sphere is connected to ground, the excess positive charge can leave the sphere, right? So the sphere would end up with an induced charge of -q, because the ground provides electrons to balance it. Wait, no, that might not be correct.

Wait, another approach. The conducting sphere is neutral to begin with. When a charge q is placed near it, the sphere's charges redistribute. The induced charge on the sphere would be such that the potential on the sphere is equal to the ground's potential, which is zero. So the sphere's potential is zero, so the work done in bringing the charge q there and the induced charges on the sphere.

But let me think step by step.

The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to a distance d from the center of
