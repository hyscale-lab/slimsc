Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The problem starts by talking about reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, and others. Let me jot down what each reaction says:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm. I think I need to figure out what each of these compounds is based on the reactions. Let's start by going through each reaction and seeing if I can identify the substances.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C. Since B is used in 8 equivalents, perhaps A is a metal? Because sometimes metals react with gases in certain ratios. For example, maybe A is iron (Fe), and B is sulfur dioxide (SO2). But wait, another thought: I remember that the formation of something bright red might indicate the formation of a compound like Fe2O3, but that's more of an oxide. Alternatively, maybe it's something like sulfur being formed? No, sulfur is yellow. Or maybe a metal sulfide? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: When a solid reacts with a gas to form a red product, maybe it's a transition metal. For instance, copper reacting with sulfur could form Cu2S, which is black, so that's not it. Iron reacting with something? Hmm.

Wait, the product C is a bright red solid. I'm trying to recall red solids. Oh! Iron(III) oxide is actually reddish, but I think it's more like a rust color. Alternatively, maybe it's a compound like FeO, but I'm not sure. Another possibility: perhaps it's a sulfide. But sulfides are typically black or dark, like CuS or FeS.

Wait, another thought: the product C reacting with water gives back A and acids F and G. So, C is probably a metal oxide because when oxides react with water, they can form acids. So, if C is a metal oxide, and when it reacts with water, it produces a metal and acids, maybe C is a higher价 oxide.

Wait, for instance, if C is Fe3O4, which is a mixed oxide of FeO·Fe2O3. When it reacts with water, does it produce Fe(OH)3? But that's more of a hydroxide. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate or something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about the second reaction. C reacts with D to form E. Since D is a gas, perhaps it's a diatomic molecule. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents could be something like water, ethanol, etc. But H is a product of D and B in a 1:1 ratio. Let's think: if B is a gas, maybe it's O2, SO2, or CO2. If D reacts with B to form H, which is a solvent, which is 1:1.

Wait, another approach: let's think about possible reactions. For example, D could be H2, reacting with B in a 1:1 ratio. But what would that produce? If B is O2, then H2 + O2 → H2O. But H2O is a solvent, so that fits. So D could be H2, B is O2, and H is H2O. That seems plausible.

Wait, but in the first reaction, A reacts with 8 moles of B (O2) to form C. So
