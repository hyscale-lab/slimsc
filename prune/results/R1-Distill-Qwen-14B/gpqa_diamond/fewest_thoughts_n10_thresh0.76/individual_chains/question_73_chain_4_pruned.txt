Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. There's this formula for adding velocities relativistically. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, no, wait. I think it's (u + v)/(1 + (uv/c²)) when adding, but here we're looking for the relative speed. So if one is moving at u and the other at v in the same direction, what's their relative speed?

Wait, no, actually, I think I got that wrong. Let me think again. If object A is moving at u relative to the lab frame, and object B is moving at v relative to the lab frame, and u and v are in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B's speed would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Because from A's frame, B is moving at (v - u) in velocity terms, but you have to account for the relativity of simultaneity and length contraction, hence the formula.

So here, astronaut 1 is 2m moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 is 3m moving at 0.5c. So from astronaut 1's perspective, astronaut 2 is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

The numerator is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c², which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, so the speed is about 0.1428c. Looking at the options, I see that option C has v_rel=0.14c, which is approximately that. Option D is 0.14c as well, so that's possible.

Wait, the options say v_rel as 0.14c for both C and D. Hmm, but maybe I should calculate more accurately. 0.1428c is about 0.143c, which is 0.14 approximately if rounded to two decimal places. So, yes, 0.14c is correct.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. That narrows it down to options C and D.

Next, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy would be their relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c squared. So for each, calculate gamma and multiply by their mass.

First astronaut: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c
