Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that in crystals, the interplanar distance is important for things like X-ray diffraction. But wait, rhombohedral... what's that structure like? I think it's a type of hexagonal crystal system but with all edges equal and all angles the same. So, the unit cell is a rhombohedron.

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms, but in a crystal, interatomic distance might be related to the lattice parameter. Oh right, in a simple cubic structure, the lattice parameter a would be equal to the interatomic distance. But rhombohedral is a bit more complicated.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So the unit cell has all sides equal (a = b = c) and all angles 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral unit cell with a = 10 Angstroms, and angles of 30 each.

I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The interplanar distance formula for a crystal plane (hkl) is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the vector in reciprocal space. The formula is d = 1 / sqrt( (h²/l²) + (k²/m²) + (l²/n²) ), but wait, no, that's for a cubic system. Or wait, I think the general formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... something involving the angles... I'm a bit fuzzy.

Wait, no. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = (2 * a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (h² sin^2 α + ... no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

I think the general formula for orthorhombic is d = 1 / sqrt( (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) ), but this is for orthorhombic where a, b, c are not equal and angles are 90°. But in a rhombohedral case, a = b
