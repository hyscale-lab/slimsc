Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, to be zero. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but wait a minute—those are just the components, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized, right? Oh wait, maybe I should check that first. Because if it's not normalized, I'll have to normalize it before proceeding.

So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ]. Let me calculate its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state isn't normalized. So the actual state should be |ψ> divided by sqrt(6), right? Because the state vectors in QM are usually of unit length.

Wait, but wait—the problem says the state is given as (-1,2,1), but doesn't mention normalization. So I think I have to use it as is, but perhaps the observable's probabilities are calculated using it as a non-normalized vector. Hmm, wait, no. In quantum mechanics, the state must be normalized to 1 because the probabilities must add up to 1. So I think I need to normalize the state first.

So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Now, the observable P is represented by a matrix. The matrix P has first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So let me write that down:

P = [ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
       [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
       [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]

I think this is a 3x3 matrix.

The question is to find the probability that measuring P gives 0. Oh, right! So in quantum mechanics, when you have an observable, the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Because the possible results are the eigenvalues, and the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

So the plan is:

1. Find the eigenvalues of P.
2. Identify which eigenvalue is 0.
3. For that eigenvalue, find the corresponding eigenvector.
4. Project the state |ψ> onto that eigenvector to get the amplitude.
5. The probability is the square of the absolute value of that amplitude.

Wait, but alternatively, perhaps P is diagonal in a certain basis, but I think for this problem, the approach is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: to compute the expectation value, but no, the question is about
