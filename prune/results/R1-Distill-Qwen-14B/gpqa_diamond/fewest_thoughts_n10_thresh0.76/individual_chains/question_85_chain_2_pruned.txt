Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, let me read the question again. Two planets orbit a star. The star has a mass 1.5 times the Sun, radius 1.2 times, and effective temperature 6300 K. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earths. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earths. Both orbits are circular. 

They detected the planets using transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. Wait, the RV method uses the Doppler shift due to the star's movement from the planet's gravity. Oh right, the question gives some RV data: Planet1 causes a shift of 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. Planet2's shift is 0.04 Å. 

The question is about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, assuming same albedo. So I need to find T1/T2.

Equilibrium temperature formula... I remember it's T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. But wait, because albedo is the same for both, that term cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio will be sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a1). Wait, because sqrt(R/(2a1)) / sqrt(R/(2a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/(a1)), since R and 2 are constants in both.

So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1).

Wait wait, no. Because equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (since it's sqrt(R/(2a))). So T ∝ sqrt(R/(2a)) * (1 - A)^0.25. Since albedo A is same, that doesn't affect the ratio. So T1/T2 = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt(a2/a1).

Wait, let me think again. Equilibrium temperature formula: T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^0.25. So yeah, the star's T is given, but we have to relate the planets' temperatures based on their orbital distances a1 and a2.

So the ratio T1/T2 = [T_star * sqrt(R/(2a1)) ] / [T_star * sqrt(R/(2a2)) ] = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So the ratio is sqrt(a2/a1). So I need to find a1 and a2.

How do I find a1 and a2? The RV method gives the velocity of the star. The RV shift depends on the mass of the planet and the size of the orbit. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) )) ) ) divided by (2π)^(1/3) * c, where c is speed of light. Wait, perhaps there's a simpler way.

Alternatively, the RV method equation: The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (2π)^(1/3) * c ) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, which relates to the planet's mass and the orbital period and distance. Let me try to recall the formula
