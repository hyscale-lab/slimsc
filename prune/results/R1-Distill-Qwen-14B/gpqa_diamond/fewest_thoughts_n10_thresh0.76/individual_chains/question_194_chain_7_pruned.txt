Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I'm supposed to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, in statistical mechanics, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So each state's contribution is e^{-β E}.

But wait, the system is made of three spins, each S can be ±1. So the total number of possible states is 2^3 =8. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 each being +1 or -1.

So I need to calculate E for each of the 8 possible states, then compute e^{-β E} for each, and sum them all up.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the possible values of the energy.

The energy E is proportional to the sum of the products of pairs. So E = -J ( S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ). Let me call the sum inside as, say, H = S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3. So E = -J H.

So each term in H is
