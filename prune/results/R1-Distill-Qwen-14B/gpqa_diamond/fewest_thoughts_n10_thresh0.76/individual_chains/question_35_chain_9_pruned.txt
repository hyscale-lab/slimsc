Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. The question is about finding the correct statement regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay.

Alright, the setup: Ay is given as c·S, where c is h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I guess S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices. Oh right! The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. So S seems similar to sigma_y. Let me check: sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Yes, exactly the same as S here. So S is sigma_y.

The operator Ay is c times sigma_y. So Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

Now, the problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. I remember that for any 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

But wait, sigma_y is a Pauli matrix, and I know that the eigenvalues of Pauli matrices are ±1. So for sigma_y, the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So when we multiply by c, the eigenvalues of Ay should be c * 1 and c * (-1). So a = c and a = -c.

Since c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues of Ay are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait, but the options don't seem to match this immediately. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: Im part ±2πh, real ±h/(4π). Wait, that can't be right because eigenvalues for Ay should be real or imaginary?

Wait, wait, hold on. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but wait no, that's not quite right. Wait, actually, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, which means their eigenvalues are real. So sigma_y is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real, ±1. Therefore, Ay, being c multiplied by a Hermitian matrix, would have eigenvalues c*(±1), so real numbers.

So the eigenvalues of Ay are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real. So any option that suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is wrong. Looking at the options:

Option A: Im parts are ±2πh. No, because eigenvalues are real. So A can't be correct.

Option B: Im parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, same reasoning. Eigenvalues are real, so Im part is zero, so B is wrong.

Options C and D don't directly talk about the eigenvalues but about the eigenvectors and their properties.

So for option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Let me think. A is the angular momentum operator. The square of the angular momentum operator (A²) commutes with all components, including Ay. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, then it's also an eigenstate of A². Because [A², Ay] =0.

But what about Az? The operator Az is another component, and in general, [Ay, Az] = iħ A something (like angular momentum algebra). So unless the state is in a simultaneous eigenstate, which requires all commuting operators. But Ay and Az don't commute. So the eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az. So statement C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this. The basis functions are usually the eigenfunctions of the operator. Wait, but any operator's eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So when you have a 2x2 operator, the eigenvectors (if they are two and linearly independent) form a basis. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That might be correct, but I'm not sure if it's the correct statement.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So I think I should proceed step by step.

Wait, the matrix Ay is 2x2, so it should have two eigenvalues and two eigenvectors, unless it's defective. But assuming it's diagonalizable, yeah, the eigenvectors would form a basis.

So option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That seems correct, but I'm not certain. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

So looking back, if I'm solving Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors will form a basis for C². So the statement in D is correct.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of an observable form a basis for the space. So if Ay is an observable (since it's part of the angular momentum operator, which is an observable), then its eigenvectors would form an orthonormal basis. So D is correct.

But wait, the statement in option D is: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis
