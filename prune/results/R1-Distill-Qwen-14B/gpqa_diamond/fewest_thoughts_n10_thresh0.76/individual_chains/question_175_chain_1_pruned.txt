Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that there's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with its symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees and the possible form of f.

Wait, I remember something about dipole radiation. Oh right, when a dipole oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. The power radiated depends on the angle θ and the wavelength.

So the power pattern for a dipole radiation is given by a certain formula. I think it's proportional to (sinθ)^2, but wait, no, maybe it's cos^2θ? Or sin^2θ? Hmm. Let me think. Oh, wait, dipole radiation is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis, so θ = 90 degrees is maximum. So if θ is measured from the z-axis, then at θ=90, which is the equatorial plane, the radiation is strongest.

Wait, no, wait. The dipole's radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) is such that the intensity (or power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So the maximum is at θ=90 degrees, and it falls off as θ approaches 0 or 180 degrees.

So the function f(θ) would be proportional to sin^2θ. So, the maximum power occurs when sinθ is 1, which is at θ=90 degrees. But in this question, the maximum is given as A, so that's the peak.

We need to find the fraction of A that is radiated at θ=30 degrees. So the fraction would be f(30)/A.

Since f(θ) is proportional to sin^2θ, then f(30) = sin^2(30) * (something). The maximum A occurs at θ=90, so A = sin^2(90) * (same something) which is 1^2 times that something. So the fraction is (sin^2(30))/ (sin^2(90)).

Sin(30) is 0.5, so sin^2(30) is 0.25, and sin^2(90) is 1. So the fraction is 0.25. So at θ=30 degrees, the power is a quarter of the maximum.

So the first part of the answer, the fraction, is 1/4.

Now, what about the form of f? The question says f is a function of λ and θ. So what's the dependence on λ?

I think for dipole radiation, the power is proportional to (ω^4) and (d^2), where d is the dipole moment's displacement. But in terms of λ, since ω is related to the frequency, and λ = c/f, and ω = 2πf, so ω
