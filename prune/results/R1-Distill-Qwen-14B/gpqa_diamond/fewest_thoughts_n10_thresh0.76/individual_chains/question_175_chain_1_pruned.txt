Okay, so I have this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. The problem is asking about the radiated power per unit solid angle as a function f of λ and the angle θ. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, as well as the possible form of f.

Wait, okay, I remember when a charge oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. For a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is like a donut shape, right, maximum at the equator and minimum along the axis. But wait, isn't that for a dipole? Hmm, I think that's when the dipole is aligned along the axis, so the radiation is strongest perpendicular to it. So in that case, the radiation pattern would have maximum power at θ=90 degrees, and it falls off as you go towards θ=0 or 180.

But this is an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped. Spheroid—so maybe it's an electric dipole or a quadrupole? Wait, but the problem says it's oscillating, so it's probably acting as a dipole source because dipoles are common in oscillating charges.

Wait, but how does the radiation from a dipole look in terms of solid angle? I think a dipole's radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) is such that the intensity varies with θ. The formula I remember is something like the intensity being proportional to (1/(r²)) multiplied by sin²θ, but that's for the radiation of a dipole. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, the radiation pattern for a dipole is actually maximum at θ=90 degrees, right? So the intensity (power per unit area) in the far field for a dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2. But wait, that would be the case for the radiation pattern. So the maximum is when sinθ is max, which is at θ=90°, but the question is about θ=30°, which is less than that.

Wait, but the question is about the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity. Or wait, no, the problem says "radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of λ and θ." So f is that power per unit solid angle, which is the same as the radiation intensity.

So for a dipole, the radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) is given by I = (something) * (sinθ)^2. So for any angle θ, the power radiated per steradian is proportional to sin²θ.

But wait, what about the dependence on λ? The problem states f is a function of λ and θ. So the intensity for a dipole should have a certain dependence on the wavelength. I'm a bit confused about that.

Wait, let me think about the dipole radiation formula. The power radiated by an oscill
