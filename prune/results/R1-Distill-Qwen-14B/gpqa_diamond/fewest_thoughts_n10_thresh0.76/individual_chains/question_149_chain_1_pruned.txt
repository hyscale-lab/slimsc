Okay, I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a small peptide compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so it's not that. Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, which is what we expect. 

What do these observations mean? Let's think about possible explanations.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, if there's a precursor, the mass would probably be different. LC-MS would show a different mass. But here, both peaks have the same mass as expected, so A is probably not the answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In NMR, if the sample is a racemic mixture, the alpha-protons might not split because enantiomers have the same physical properties except for direction of optical rotation. Wait, but in NMR, each enantiomer would contribute the same peaks, so maybe you wouldn't see two separate peaks for the same proton. Or would you? No, because NMR is a bulk property. If the sample is racemic, the NMR would just show a single peak without splitting. So B might not explain it. Or maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe if the molecule has some sort of diastereotopic protons, but I'm not sure.

Option C: Double coupling during amide formation. Double coupling can happen when a proton is coupled to two different sets of equivalent protons. But the question says that spin-spin coupling is ruled out because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that. So maybe C isn't it. Or wait, if the protons are split by two different coupling partners, that could cause multiple peaks, but the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would show different NMR shifts. But wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, but
