Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question says that there's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength, lambda. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and the angle theta from the z-axis.

The question asks for two things: the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the possible form of f as a function of lambda.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each option gives a fraction and a lambda dependence.

I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since it's spheroidal and symmetric around the z-axis, I think the radiation would have some kind of dipole pattern.

Dipole radiation has specific characteristics. The maximum radiation is perpendicular to the axis of oscillation—in this case, the z-axis. So maximum power would be emitted in the plane perpendicular to z, which is theta = 90 degrees. But the question is about theta=30 degrees, which is closer to the z-axis.

Wait, no. Wait, theta is the angle from the z-axis. So theta=0 is along the z-axis, and theta=90 is perpendicular. So dipole radiation has maximum at theta=90. But what about theta=30? How much power is radiated there compared to the maximum.

I think the radiation pattern for a dipole is given by:

The power per unit solid angle is proportional to (1 + cos²(theta)). Wait, no, wait. For an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern is (3/4) (sin^2 theta) or something like that. Or maybe it's (1 + cos^2(theta)) over something. Let me think.

Wait, the radiation pattern for an electric dipole in the far field is given by the dipole antenna radiation, which has a maximum at theta=90 degrees. The formula for the radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (sin²(theta)) or (cos²(theta)) or something else.

Wait, I remember the formula for the radiation intensity (U) of a dipole is U proportional to (sin^2(theta)). Oh wait,
