Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Alright, the question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, and it's radiating. The problem is asking about the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle and the form of the power function.

Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about electromagnetic radiation from oscillating charges. Oh right, when a charge oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. The power radiated depends on the acceleration of the charge and the frequency of oscillation. But wait, the question is about the power per unit solid angle, which I remember is part of the radiation pattern.

The setup is a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating along the z-axis. So the symmetry is along z. In the radiation zone, the fields behave like those of a dipole or higher multipole, depending on the distribution. Since it's spheroidal, maybe it's a dipole or quadrupole? But for radiation, the dominant term is the dipole term because higher multipoles might contribute less. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the question is about the power per unit solid angle, which I think relates to the radiation pattern. For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern isn't isotropic. The power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle theta from the axis of oscillation.

Right, I remember that the radiation pattern for a dipole is maximum at the equator (theta = 90 degrees) and falls off as cos^4(theta) or something like that. Wait, more accurately, the radiated power per unit solid angle (intensity) for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta)) / 2. So the maximum intensity is when cos(theta) is either 1 or -1, but wait, that would be at theta=0 and theta=180. Oh wait no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, wait, the intensity for a dipole in the far field is given by I = ( (d^2 E/dt^2)^2 ) / (c^6 r^2) ) multiplied by some constants and the angular dependence. But I think the angular dependence is proportional to (1 + 3 cos^2(theta)), but wait, that's the E field. Or maybe it's
