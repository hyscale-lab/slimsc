Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, which I remember is a type of pericyclic reaction. The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and they're heated together. The question is asking for the exo product of this reaction, and the options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I think [4+2] cycloadditions are part of the Diels-Alder reactions. So, in this case, one of the molecules must be the diene and the other the dienophile. But wait, which one is which? Thiophene is an aromatic heterocycle with sulfur. Furan-2,5-dione looks like it's a dienophile because it's a dione, which is a good electron-deficient group.

Wait, but 2,5-dimethylthiopheneâ€”thiophene has conjugated double bonds. So, maybe it's acting as the diene. Furan-2,5-dione, on the other hand, has two ketone groups, which would make it an electron-deficient dienophile. So the diene is the thiophene, and the dienophile is the furan-2,5-dione.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene and a dienophile with electron-withdrawing groups. So, furan-2,5-dione has two ketones, which are strong electron-withdrawing groups. That makes it a good dienophile. The thiophene, being an aromatic molecule with conjugated double bonds, can act as the diene if it's in a s-cis conformation. But wait, thiophene is a five-membered ring, so I'm not sure if it can act as a diene. Wait, no, I think the thiophene ring itself doesn't open up, but perhaps it's acting as a diene in a different way. Or maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Alternatively, maybe the thiophene isn't the diene here.

Wait, another possibility. Maybe the furan-2,5-dione is the diene? But furan is a conjugated diene, so if the dienophile is something else
