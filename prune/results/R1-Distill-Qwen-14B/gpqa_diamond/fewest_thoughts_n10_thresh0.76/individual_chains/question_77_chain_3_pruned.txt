Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because some concepts I'm not super confident about. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about two different reactions: one involving the Cope rearrangement and another, perhaps a different kind of rearrangement. Wait, no, the first reaction is with BuLi and H+â€”maybe that's a different reaction? Hmm.

Let me read the question again. The first part is the Cope rearrangement, which involves a 1,5-diene. The molecule given is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Oh wait, no, wait. The first reaction is BuLi and then H+. The second reaction is the Cope rearrangement because it's initiated by heat or light.

Wait, no, the question says the Cope rearrangement is the reaction where a 1,5-diene rearranges. So the first part is a different reaction, and the second part is the Cope rearrangement. So I need to figure out the major product for each step.

Let me tackle the first reaction first. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The structure would be a benzene ring attached to a CH2-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2. Wait, no. Let me draw it out mentally
