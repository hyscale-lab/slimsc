Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

The question says that observations of a quasar were made in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that the peak wavelength of emission can be related to the redshift of the object. Oh wait, right, this is probably about the Lyman-alpha forest or something related to emission lines being redshifted.

Wait, the peak is at 790 nm. If I think about the Lyman-alpha line, which is in the ultraviolet. The Lyman-alpha emission line is at about 121.6 nm. So if the observed wavelength is longer, that must mean redshift. So the redshift z would be (observed wavelength)/(rest wavelength) minus 1. Let me compute that: 790 / 121.6 is approximately 6.5. So z ≈ 6.5 -1? Wait no, wait, no, the formula is (observed λ / rest λ) -1. So 790 / 121.6 is about 6.497, so z is about 5.497. Oh wait, wait, no—wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Because the rest wavelength is 121.6 nm, and we observe it at 790 nm. So the ratio is 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.497. So z is 6.497 -1, which is about 5.497. So z ≈ 5.5.

Wait, but wait, Lyman-alpha is often at about 121 nm. So when we observe it at 790 nm, that's a z of (790/121.6) -1 ≈ (6.5) -1 =5.5.

But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct emission line here. Wait, another possibility: the Balmer series in hydrogen? Like H-alpha is around 656 nm in the rest frame. So if the observed wavelength is 790, then z = (790 / 656) -1 ≈ 1.2 -1 =
