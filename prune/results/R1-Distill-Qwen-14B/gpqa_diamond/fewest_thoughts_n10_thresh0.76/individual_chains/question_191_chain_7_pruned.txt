Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions. But let me try to work through it step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me visualize that structure. So cyclohexanone, with substituents on carbons 3 and 5. The 3 position has a hydroxymethyl group (which is -CH2OH), and the 5 position has prop-1-en-2-yl, which is an isopropenyl group. So like, CH2=C(CH3)- attached to the cyclohexane.

The first reaction is treatment with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide. Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used as a base in alkylation reactions. So if we have a ketone, like cyclohexanone, perhaps it's doing an enolate alkylation. Wait, but the starting molecule is already substituted. Oh, or maybe the hydroxymethyl group is getting deprotonated?

Wait, the compound has a hydroxymethyl group. Sodium hydride is a strong base (NaH), which can deprotonate acidic protons. The hydroxymethyl group has an -OH which is somewhat acidic. Deprotonating would give an alkoxide. Then, benzyl bromide (which is an alkyl halide) would act as an electrophile. So the alkoxide would attack the benzyl bromide, leading to alkylation at the hydroxymethyl position.

Wait, but the starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl), so after deprotonation, it becomes -CH2O^-Na^+ . Then, benzyl bromide (which is C6H5CH2Br) would react in an SN2 fashion. The O^- would attack the benzyl carbon, displacing Br^- and forming a new C-O bond. So the product would have a benzyl group attached to the CH2O-, making it -CH2-O-Bn (where Bn is benzyl). So the product after step 1 would be 3-(benzyloxymethyl)-5-isopropenylcyclohexan-1-one. Or maybe the order is different.

Wait, the starting ketone is at position 1, so maybe it's possible that the enolate is formed. But the ketone is at position 1, which is adjacent to the substituents at 3 and 5. If the ketone is at C1, then the alpha carbons are C2 and maybe C6. But the hydroxymethyl is at C3, which is adjacent to C2 and C4. Hmm, maybe the hydroxymethyl's -OH is deprotonated, making an alkoxide, which then is attacked by benzyl bromide.

So product 1 would have a benzyl group added to the oxygen of the hydroxymethyl. So now, the hydroxymethyl becomes a benzyloxymethyl group: C3 would be CH2-O-Bn.

Moving on to step 2: product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in presence of catalytic HCl. That sounds familiar. p-Toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) hydrazide is used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction. Wait, but the Wolff-Kishner is usually for removing carbonyl groups, turning ketones into methylene groups (CH2). But I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Wait, the starting material after step 1 is a ketone, so product 1 is a cyclohexanone derivative.

In Wolff-Kishner, the ketone would be converted into an amine group by replacing the carbonyl with a hydrazine derivative, and then heating with a strong base like KOH or NH2NH2 in a high-boiling solvent, leading to release of N2 and forming a methylene group. But wait, I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is undergoing some kind of condensation.

Wait, the treatment is with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and HCl. Oh, wait, p-toluenesulfonyl group is a good leaving group. Maybe it's a Curtius rearrangement? Or perhaps it's a more straightforward substitution.

Alternatively, another possibility: the ketone is converted into a hydrazone. When a ketone reacts with a hydrazine derivative (like p-toluenesulfonylhydrazide), it forms a hydrazone. So the product 2 would be the hydrazone of the ketone. So the ketone (cyclohexanone part) would form a hydrazone, which would connect the carbonyl to the hydrazide group.

So product 2 would have a structure where the ketone becomes a hydrazone. So the cyclohexanone ring would have a group R-C(=N-N-Ts)-R', where Ts is the p-toluenesulfonyl group.

But wait, the reaction conditions are with catalytic HCl. So perhaps it's not a full Wolff-Kishner but a partial step. Or maybe the hydrazide is just adding to the ketone, forming a hydrazone. So product 2 would be the hydrazone, which would have the structure where the ketone is replaced by a hydrazone group.

Then step 3: product 2 is treated at low temperature with n-BuLi, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride. n-BuLi is a strong base, typically used to deprotonate compounds, especially in enolate formation or in conjugate additions.

But if product 2 is a hydrazone, perhaps the BuLi is abstracting a proton adjacent to the hydrazone group. Hydrazones can sometimes stabilize enolates or allow for nucleophilic attack.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrazone is undergoing some kind of addition. Let me think. When BuLi is added to hydrazones, it can deprotonate alpha to the carbonyl (but in the hydrazone, the carbonyl is replaced by N-N-Ts). Wait, maybe the structure after step 2 is R-C(=N-N-Ts)-R', so the carbon adjacent to the hydrazone is at the cyclohexane ring's position 1. So where would the BuLi attack?

Alternatively, perhaps the BuLi is adding to the hydrazone. Wait,
