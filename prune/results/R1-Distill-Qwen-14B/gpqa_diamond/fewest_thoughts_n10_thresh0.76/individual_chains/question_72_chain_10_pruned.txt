Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem describes a series of reactions starting with a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then it's reacted with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature to form product 1. After that, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to make product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150°C to give product 4. The question is about the number of distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Wow, that's a lot. I think I'll need to figure out what each step does.

Let me start by thinking about the first reaction. 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta is a norbornene structure, right? It has two rings: a five-membered and a six-membered ring, but arranged in a bicyclic way. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So tert-butoxy is a good leaving group because it's a bulky ether.

The reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. Hmm, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile source, especially in substitution reactions. The dibromomethyl groups are on a cyclohexadiene. Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, cyclohexa-1,3-diene has double bonds at 1,2 and 3,4 positions, right? Wait, no, 1,3-diene would be double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. Oh, wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4? Wait, wait, that's not possible because that would make four double bonds if it's 1,3, but perhaps it's a 1,3-diene as in isolated double bonds. Or maybe it's 1,3-diene as in conjugated? Oh, no, wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: 1,3-diene would mean double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, which would be conjugated. So the molecule is a cyclohexene with two double bonds—so maybe it's a diene with two double bonds. But wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene would have double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4, making a conjugated diene.

So the substituents are at positions 5 and 6, each having a dibromomethyl group. So each
