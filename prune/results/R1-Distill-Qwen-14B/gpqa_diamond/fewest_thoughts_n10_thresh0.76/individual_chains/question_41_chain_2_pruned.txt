Okay, so I have this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says a glass with index of refraction n is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, which is towards the observer in the lab. Wait, the light is moving through the glass, which itself is moving. So I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, I remember that in a medium, the speed of light is c/n, right? But that's when the medium is at rest. What if the medium is moving? Oh, right, this is probably a problem involving the addition of velocities, maybe using special relativity. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add velocities classically; you need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v. And the light is moving through it. So the light's speed in the glass's frame is c/n. But since the glass is moving, we have to find the speed as observed in the lab frame.

So in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is v_light = c/n. Now, from the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass. So the glass is moving at v in the same direction as the light, and since the light is moving towards the observer, which is in the lab.

Wait, no, wait. The glass is moving toward the observer. So from the lab's perspective,
