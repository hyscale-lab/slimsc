Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a certain concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium, forming a complex.

The problem states that the solution has 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, stochiometric means that the molar ratio is 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. 

The question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in this solution. Okay, so I need to find [Ca²+]. But wait, the complex is formed, so the calcium is bound to EDTA. But in solution, there might be some dissociation, right? So the complex doesn't stay completely together; some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA ions. 

They also give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA = 5x10^10. I think the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-. So the Kf expression would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = Kf.

Wait, but K is given here as 5e10, which is a very large number. So that means the formation of the complex is favored, and the dissociation is not favored. But even so, there's some dissociation because the solution is in equilibrium.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the complex as CaEDTA^2-. Let's say the concentration of this complex is 0.02 M initially. But some of it dissociates over time. Let me think about the equilibrium.

Let me write the dissociation equation: CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. 

At equilibrium, let’s let the concentration of Ca²+ be x. Since the stoichiometry is 1:1, the concentration of EDTA^4- will also be x. And the concentration of the complex will be 0.02 - x, but since Kf is very large,
