Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Okay, let's see what the question says.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to pick the right reagents A and B from the given options. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O), yielding 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each suggesting different A and B combinations.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about each reaction separately. Maybe starting with the first one.

The first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, what's that product look like? Let me draw its structure. 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be: the nitrile group (CN) is on the second carbon, which also has a hydroxyl (OH) and a methyl (CH3) group. So the structure is (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, wait. Wait, butanenitrile has four carbons, with the CN on C1. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, butane is four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the numbering. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CH2CN? Wait, no, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, maybe
