Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. Dipole transitions specifically have certain selection rules.

Right, for a dipole transition, the change in the angular momentum quantum number l is important. The selection rule for l is Δl = ±1. Oh wait, but wait, no, isn't it that the transition is allowed if l changes by ±1? Because for an electric dipole transition, the matrix element involves the spherical harmonics Y_l^m, so the integral must be non-zero. So the integral of Y_0^0 (since initial state is l=0) multiplied by r and Y_final... Wait, r is the position operator, which has components with l=1 (since r is proportional to sqrt(x² + y² + z²), but when you take the gradient for the dipole, maybe it's more like l=1). So the dipole operator has l=1. So the selection rule would be that the initial and final states must have l differing by 1. Oh right, because the matrix element ⟨f| r |i⟩ is non-zero only if l_i and l_f differ by ±1.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. So l_i is 0. To go to l_f, which can be 1 (because 0 +1=1). So the first transition must go to l=1. The possible states from 3 to 2 would be |2,1,m⟩ where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So first, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. It can transition to a state with n=2, l=1, m= -1, 0, or +1. So the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,+1⟩.

Then from the n=2, l=1 state, we must transition again. Since we're going to n=1, l=0. So the second transition must go from l=1 to l=0 (so Δl = -1). That's allowed because l changes by 1.

So the second transition must go from l=1 to 0. So the possible states from the intermediate are the n=1, l=0, m=0 state.

So the possible paths are:

3,0,0 → 2,1,m → 1,0,0.

But the question says it's via two dipole transitions. So each step must satisfy the selection rules.

Now, the question is about the transition probability. The options give different probabilities, and different paths.

Looking at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Option B: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0 and 1/4.

Option C: 3,0,0 → 2,1,-1 → 1,0,0 and 1/4.

Option D: Not sure about the first part, probably similar to A but with probability 2/3.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the probabilities. How do we calculate the probability for each path?

I remember that the transition probability depends on the square of the matrix element and the density of states, but perhaps in this case, it's a two-step process, so the overall probability would be the product of the probabilities of each step.

Alternatively, the transition from 3,0,0 to 1,0,0 via two steps. Each step has certain allowed m transitions.
