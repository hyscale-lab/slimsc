Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says the compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of data.

First, the FTIR spectrum. I remember that IR peaks help identify functional groups. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is probably O-H stretching, like in an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, a broad peak is more indicative of an alcohol (like in an -OH group), because carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch too, but maybe more around 2500-3300? Or maybe this is an amide or something else... Hmm, not sure. But two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. I think 1700 is a carbonyl group, likely a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, like maybe an amide (but I don't see any info about amides elsewhere) or maybe conjugated carbonyl like in a conjugated system. Alternatively, 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, but wait, another thought: 1700 is maybe ester or ketone, and 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Or perhaps an aromatic ring with substituents? But wait, FTIR might not show much about aromatic rings unless there are specific substituents. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an amide II band, but again, without other IR peaks, it's hard to say. But considering the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which are probably double bonds, maybe a conjugated system.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or aromatic ring. So, the compound has at least one double bond or an aromatic ring. But since there's a carbonyl group in IR, maybe it's something like an alpha,beta-uns
