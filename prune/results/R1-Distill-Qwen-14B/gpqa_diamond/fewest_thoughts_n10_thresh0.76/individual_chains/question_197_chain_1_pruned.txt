Okay, I need to figure out what Compound X is first, and then determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let's start by analyzing the given IR and NMR data.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm^-1, which suggests O-H or N-H stretching. But wait, the strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm^-1 are around where aromatic C=C stretching occurs, so probably an aromatic ring.

Now the 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde, but that's usually around 9-10 ppm and a triplet or something else, but a broad peak might also be from something else. Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H is broad, which fits.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like a substituted benzene ring. The doublets with 2H each suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, if there are two substituents in the para positions.

Then, the other peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a CH near an electronegative atom, like adjacent to a carbonyl group. Or perhaps a methylene adjacent to something else.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet, maybe a CH2 group, perhaps part of a chain attached to something.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methyl group attached to something that's split into a doublet. Like a CH(CH3) group, maybe.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, likely from an ethyl chain. So maybe CH2CH3.

Putting this together, let's think about the structure. The aromatic ring is para-substituted, with two substituents. One substituent is a carbonyl group (from the IR and the O-H in NMR, maybe a car
