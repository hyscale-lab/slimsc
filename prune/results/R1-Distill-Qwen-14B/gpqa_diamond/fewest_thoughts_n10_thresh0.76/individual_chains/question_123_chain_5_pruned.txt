Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm. So the question is about finding the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference over a certain time. Wait, I need to think about reference frames and maybe some relativity here.

Alright, the problem says that the supernova ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy, and both are inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I remember that when dealing with different reference frames, especially in relativity, we have to consider the relative velocities and time dilation or length contraction. But wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so maybe it's just a straightforward velocity problem without needing to bring in general relativity concepts.

Wait, the problem asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, let's think about this. Let me try to visualize. In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at some speed. From the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Oh, right, so the velocities are opposite in each other's frames. But wait, how are velocities related in different inertial frames?

In special relativity, velocities are not just simple additions. Oh wait, but maybe since the problem says both are inertial frames, perhaps we can use the velocity addition formula. Or maybe not, because I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, the problem states that the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the velocity of the Galaxy relative to the ejecta is 60,000 km/s. Then, in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at what speed?

Wait, in Newtonian mechanics, if the Galaxy is moving at v towards the ejecta, then the ejecta is moving at v towards the Galaxy in the Galaxy's frame. But that's for Galilean transformations. But with relativity, it's different. Oh right, the velocity addition formula is (u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²)). Wait, but in this case, the ejecta's frame sees the Galaxy moving at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, what is the speed of the ejecta?

Wait, I think I got this inverted. Let me think again. Let me denote the Galaxy's frame as S and the ejecta's frame as S'. In S', the Galaxy (S) is moving at velocity v = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So, in S, what is the ejecta's velocity u?

Using the velocity addition formula: u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²). Wait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up here. Let's define it correctly. Let me say that in S (Galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving at velocity u. In S' (ejecta's frame), the Galaxy is moving at velocity v.
