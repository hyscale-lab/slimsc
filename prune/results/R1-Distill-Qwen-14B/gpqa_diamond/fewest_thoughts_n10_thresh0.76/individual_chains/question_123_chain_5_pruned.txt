Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully and think through what's going on.

The question is about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question asks what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, wait, so I'm dealing with relative motion and time here. Since both are inertial frames, I think I can use special relativity principles, but I'm not entirely sure if that's necessary. Oh wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so maybe it's just a straightforward velocity problem, not involving acceleration from those factors.

Wait, but when it's about different reference frames, especially moving relative to each other, I remember something about time dilation. Because in relativity, time can pass at different rates in different frames. So, if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame?

Let me think about the situation. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. But from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Right?

Wait no, hold on. Since the frames are moving relative to each other, we need to use the Lorentz transformation. Because in one frame, the time experienced is different from the other.

Wait, no, the problem says to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So I need to find how far the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame during a certain time. But the time given is in the ejecta's frameâ€”50 seconds in their time.

So I think I need to relate the time in the ejecta's frame to the time in the Galaxy's frame. Because if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta frame, due to time dilation, the Galaxy would have experienced more or less time?

Wait, time dilation occurs when one frame is moving relative to another. The frame that is moving will have its time appearing dilated, meaning longer intervals. So from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock runs slower.

Wait, but which frame is
