Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form the final product 4. The question is about how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4, with options A to D.

Hmm. So I need to figure out the structures at each step to determine the number of distinct hydrogens in the final product.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, the starting material: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene is a norbornene structure. So the structure has two rings, a bridge, and two double bonds. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7.

Next reaction: combining with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. Sodium iodide (NaI) is a good nucleophile source, but also, in such reactions, I- is a good leaving group. Wait, but here maybe it's a substitution. Alternatively, this might be a Diels-Alder reaction? Or maybe more likely, since there's a diene and dibromomethyl groups, perhaps it's a coupling or substitution.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups attached to carbons 5 and 6. So each of those positions has a CH2Br2 group? Or each is a CH2Br, but with two Brs on each CH2? Wait, no. 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl) would mean each has a CH2 with two bromines. So each is a -CH2Br2 group.

But wait, dibromomethyl is -CH2Br2, correct. So each of the 5 and 6 positions of the cyclohexadiene has a -CH2Br2 substituent.

So when that reacts with the starting material, which is a bicyclo structure, perhaps a Diels-Alder occurs. But the starting material is a diene, but so is the other compound? Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two conjugated double bonds, so it's a conjugated diene. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is the diene, and the other compound has dienophiles? Or maybe it's a cross metath
