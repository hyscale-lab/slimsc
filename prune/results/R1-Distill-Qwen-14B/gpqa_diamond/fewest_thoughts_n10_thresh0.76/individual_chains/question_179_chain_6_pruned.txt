Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics question, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of matrices and their applications in quantum mechanics. But let's take it step by step.

The question gives me four matrices W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The options are about properties of these matrices and what they represent.

First, I need to understand what each statement is saying.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the evolution operator is unitary. For an operator U, if it's unitary, then U† U = I, where † is the conjugate transpose. The exponential of a matrix, e^M, is unitary only if M is anti-hermitian, meaning M† = -M. So, if X is not anti-hermitian, then e^X won't be unitary. If e^X isn't unitary, multiplying a vector by e^X would change its norm because unitary transformations preserve the norm.

So I need to check if X is anti-hermitian. Let me compute X† and see if it's equal to -X.

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

The conjugate transpose of X is X†:

Column 1 becomes row 1 in conjugate:
First element: i → -i (conjugate)
Second element: 1 → 1
Third element: 2i → -2i

So X†'s first row is [-i, 1, -2i].

Second row of X† is the conjugate of X's second column:
-1 → 1 (since -1 is real, same)
0 →0
1 → 1
So second row of X† is [1, 0, 1].

Third row of X† is the conjugate of X's third column:
2i → -2i
-1 →1
-i →i
Wait, wait, no. Wait, X's third column is [2i, 1, -i]. So the conjugate of each element is [-2i, 1, i]. So the third row would be [-2i, 1, i].

So X† is:

Row 1: (-i, 1, -2i)
Row 2: (1, 0, 1)
Row 3: (-2i, 1, i)

Now, -X is the negative of X. Let's compute -X:

Each element is multiplied by -1.

-X:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Comparing X† and -X:

X† row 1: (-i, 1, -2i) matches -X row 1.

X† row 2: (1,0,1) vs. -X row 2: (-1,0,-1). Oh, they are negatives of each other. So X† row 2 is (1,0,1) which is not equal to -X's second row.

So X† is not equal to -X. Thus, X is not anti-hermitian. Therefore, e^X is not unitary, so multiplying it by a vector would change the norm. So option A says that such a vector exists. But wait, if e^X isn't unitary, then for all vectors, the norm would change. Hmm, no, wait. If the matrix isn't unitary, applying it to a vector will change the norm. So the statement in A is saying that such a vector
