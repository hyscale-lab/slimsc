Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, sounds like a titration problem where acids and bases are reacting.

First, I need to figure out what's happening when these solutions are mixed. The three solutions are:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid, a weak acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base)

I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So, the HCl and Ba(OH)2 will react first, and then any excess will react with the acetic acid.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- ions, right? Because it dissociates completely: Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH^-.

Similarly, HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl^-.

Acetic acid is a weak acid; it doesn't dissociate completely. So, any H+ from HCl that isn't neutralized by OH- will affect the pH, but the acetic acid's contribution is a bit more complicated.

So, let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll find the moles of each substance.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity (M) = moles/volume(L)
Moles = M * Volume(L)
Volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L. So, moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

For HCl:
Volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

For Ba(OH)2:
Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, the moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when HCl (a strong acid) and Ba(OH)2 (a strong base) are mixed, they'll neutralize each other. The reaction is HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O. But let's write it in terms of H+ and OH-.

H+ (from HCl) + OH- (from Ba(OH)2) → H2O.

So, the moles of H+ from HCl is 0.08, and moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18.

The neutralization reaction will proceed until one of the reactants is used up. The OH- is in excess here because 0.18 > 0.08. So, all the H+ will react, and the remaining OH- will be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Wait, but wait a minute. HCl provides 0.08 moles of H+, and Ba(OH)2 provides 0.18 moles of OH-. So, the net OH- after reaction is 0.10 moles. So, the total solution will have excess OH-.

But what about the acetic acid? The acetic acid is a weak acid and will donate H+. So, the excess OH- will react with the acetic acid as well. Let's see.

The reaction between OH- and CH3COOH (CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it can donate H+). So, OH- will take H+ from the acetic acid.

So, the initial moles of H+ in the acetic acid? Well, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't fully dissociate. But when OH- is present, it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.05. So, that's the maximum H+ it can contribute, but since OH- is 0.10, which is more than 0.05, all the acetic acid's H+ will be neutralized, and there will be leftover OH-.

Wait, no, when OH- reacts with CH3COOH: the reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- can take one mole
