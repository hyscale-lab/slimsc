Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR questions can be tricky. Let's see what I can do. The question is about identifying Compound X based on its reaction product's NMR spectra.

First, the reaction conditions: Compound X reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, what does that reagent do? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common catalyst for the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. No, actually, it's used in the formation of epoxides too. Wait, maybe in the ring-opening of epoxides under certain conditions. Hmm, or perhaps it's a base? No, wait, it's more likely a catalyst for certain reactions. Oh wait, maybe it's a phase transfer catalyst or something else. Or perhaps it's used in the formation of epoxides via the Prilezhaev oxidation. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's a base. Wait, but more accurately, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is commonly known as a catalyst for the epoxidation of alkenes using peracids. Wait, no, peracids are usually the source of the oxygen for epoxidation. Oh wait, maybe this reagent is a base or a catalyst for something else.

Wait, the reaction is done in a nonpolar solvent. High temperature, 403 K is 130°C, which is pretty hot. So perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. Let me look at the NMR data first. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let me list them:

1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s) → a singlet for 3H, likely a methyl group attached to something deshielded, maybe an electronegative atom or in a ring. Or perhaps a benzylic position.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s) → another singlet, maybe another methyl group.
Wait, that's two singlets for 3H each. So perhaps two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split the signal, like being part of an epoxide ring or attached to an electronegative atom. Alternatively, maybe one is an aromatic substituent and the other is something else.

Then, the rest are aromatic signals:
- 6.75 (1H, d)
-7.08 (2H, d)
-7.68 (1H, d)
-7.71 (2H, d)

So that's 6 aromatic protons in total. Let me think about the splitting. The downfield shifts are around 7.7, which are typical for aromatic protons, maybe substituted with electron-withdrawing groups or in a conjugated system.

The 13C NMR data:

- 21.3 (1C, s) → a very low shift, possibly a methyl group attached to something. Like a CH3 in an epoxide? Or perhaps a CH3 attached to an oxygen, like in an ether.
- 28.4 (1C, s) → another methyl, maybe attached to a nitrogen or another electronegative atom, but 28 is a bit higher than a regular CH3. Hmm.
Wait, 21.3 is more like a methyl attached to an oxygen, like CH3-O or CH3-S. But in this case, looking at the reaction, maybe it's part of an epoxide. So perhaps two methyl groups are present: one attached to oxygen (like in an epoxide ring) and another as a substituent elsewhere.

Then the aromatic carbons:
- 126.9 (2C, s) → possibly two equivalent carbons, maybe in a para position.
Wait, no, because the 1H NMR shows more complex splitting. Alternatively, maybe part of a conjugated system. Let me think.

Looking at the 13C NMR, there's a carbon at 141.5 and 144.1, which are likely carbonyls or substituted carbons in an aromatic system. The 197.7 is a very high shift; that's indicative of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an aldehyde. Wait, but in an epoxide, the carbons are usually around 60-70 ppm. So 197 must be a carbonyl, perhaps a ketone or an ester? Hmm.

Wait, but looking back, the starting material is C11H12O. The product after reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclooctane—maybe
