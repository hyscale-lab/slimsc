Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about the minimum resolution needed in the CERN Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. The decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

First, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be longer due to their high speed—in this case, because they're moving at relativistic speeds. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. So, the observed lifetime is longer because of time dilation from special relativity.

The formula I think I need here is the time dilation formula: τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Gamma (γ) is calculated using the total energy of the particle divided by its rest mass energy. So, γ = E / m. 

Wait, the energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. So, γ would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 

27 divided by 3.41—let me see. 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41 times 7.9 is roughly 27 (since 3.41 *8 is 27.28, so maybe 7.95 or something). So approximately 7.9 or 8. I think it's roughly 7.915.

So γ ≈ 7.915. That means the observed lifetime τ is 7.915 times the proper lifetime τ₀. So τ = 7.915 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that:

7.915 * 8e-16 = 63.32e-16 seconds, which is 6.332e-15 seconds. Hmm, that's the mean lifetime in the lab frame.

Now, particles moving in the bubble chamber will travel some distance before decaying. The distance they move depends on their velocity and the lifetime. The decay length L is approximately the velocity multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, since they're moving at relativistic speeds, we can approximate the velocity as the speed of light, right?

So L = v * τ. If v ≈ c (speed of light), then L ≈ c * τ.

The speed of light is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So c is 3e8 m/s. Multiply that by τ which is 6.332e-15 s.

Calculating that: 3e8 m/s * 6.332e-15 s = (3 * 6.332) * 1e(8
