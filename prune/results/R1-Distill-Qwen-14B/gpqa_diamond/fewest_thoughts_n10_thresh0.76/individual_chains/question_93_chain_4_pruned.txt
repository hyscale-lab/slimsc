Okay, so I've got this qPCR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The scientist is making a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and ran three technical replicates at each concentration. The efficiency is 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect, so each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² is 1, which means the data fits the curve perfectly, right? The slope is -3.3.

Looking at the results, the Ct values are given for each concentration. The Ct values vary a little between the replicates, but the trend is clear: as the concentration decreases, the Ct increases, which makes sense because there's less starting material, so it takes more cycles to reach the threshold.

The question is asking why there are discrepancies in the results. The options are A to D.

Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. But wait, that can't be right because qPCR is used for quantification. Plus, the R² is 1, so the calibration curve is perfect. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Ct values not in agreement with the target. Hmm. If the efficiency is 100%, each tenfold dilution should increase Ct by about 1 cycle (since each cycle doubles DNA, a tenfold increase would need about 3.3 cycles, but wait, maybe I'm mixing that up). Wait, wait, the slope is -3.3. I remember that the slope of a qPCR calibration curve relates to the efficiency. The formula for the slope is ln(10)/E, where E is efficiency. Since E is 100% (or 1, because E is usually expressed as a decimal, like 0.99 for 99% efficiency), so the slope would be ln(10)/1 ≈ 2.3026. But here, the slope is -3.3. That doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Oh wait, wait, the formula for the slope (m) is m = ln(10)/E. If E is 100%, that's E=1. So ln(10) is about 2.3026. So the slope should be positive 2.3026, but the given slope is -3.3. That's a problem. But wait, maybe the slope is negative because the y-axis is Ct, which decreases as concentration increases. So a standard curve is usually made with log dilutions on the x-axis and Ct on y. So the slope should be negative because higher concentrations (log dilution is lower) have lower Ct. So the expected slope would be -2.3026. But the given slope is -3.3, which is more negative. So that would mean the efficiency is lower than 100%. Wait, but the question says efficiency is 100%. Hmm, that seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe I should recalculate. If the efficiency is 100%, then each cycle doubles the target. So the formula for the number of cycles needed is Ct = logE (N0 / Nt), where Nt is the threshold. Wait, perhaps another approach: the expected change in Ct per tenfold dilution, with 100% efficiency, should be about 3.32 cycles. Wait, no, no. Wait, the expected change is based on log2. Because with 100% efficiency, each cycle doubles the DNA. So a tenfold dilution (which is 10 times less) would require log2(10) ≈ 3.32 cycles more. So each tenfold decrease in concentration would increase Ct by about 3.32 cycles.

Looking at the data, the concentrations are 100000, 10000 (which is 10 times less), 1000, etc. The Ct values at 100000 are around 33.9-34.5. At 10000, they're around 30.6-31.2. So the difference between 100000 and 10000 is about 3.3-3.4 cycles. That's exactly what we'd expect with 100% efficiency. So the discrepancy isn't in the trend but the technical replicates.

Wait, but the question is about the discrepancies. The options are about why the Ct values vary.

Looking at the options again, option C says ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, the ten-fold dilution is exactly a 10x difference, which should correspond to about 3.3 cycles. In the data, the change from 1e5 to 1e4 is a 10x decrease, and Ct goes up by about 3.3 (33.9 to 30.6, difference of 3.3 in the middle). So the ten-fold dilution corresponds to exactly 3.3 cycles, which matches the expected. So option C is incorrect because the dilution is exactly 3.3 cycles.

Option D says the deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. Looking at the data: each sample has three technical replicates. For 1e5, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The max difference is 0.6 (34.5-33.9=0.6). Similarly, for 1e4, the range is 30.6 to 31.2, which is 0.6. For 1e3, 27.3 to 27.9, 0.6. 1e2: 24 to 24.6, 0.6. 1e1: 20.7 to 21.3, 0.6. So the maximum deviation between any two replicates is 0.6. The question is whether this is more than 0.3. 0.6 is more than 0.3, so the deviation is more than 0.3. So option D seems to be correct.

Wait, but option B says Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target. But the R² is 1, so the overall trend is perfect. So the Ct values do correlate with the concentration. The discrepancies are only within each sample's replic
