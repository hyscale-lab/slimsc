Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The question says that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, its concentration changes, which affects the pH. Then when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, things change at different stages. Oh right, the 25% titration is when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized, and the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized.

Wait, let me break this down. First, I need to find the initial concentration after dilution. Oh wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the diluted concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that.

0.05 * 20 = 1 mmol (since 1M is 1 mmol/cm³). Then divided by 40 cm³ gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point comes when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, the moles of acetic acid initially is 0.05 M * 0.02 L (20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.001 moles. So to neutralize that, moles of NaOH needed are the same, 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume V = moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added, but wait the question is about when we reach 25% titration. Oh, 25% of the equivalence volume? Or 25% of the acetic acid reacted.

Wait, no, 25% titration probably refers to when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Because the equivalence point is 100% neutralization. So 25% would mean 25% of 0.001 moles is neutralized, which is 0.00025 moles of NaOH.

Alternatively, sometimes people use percentage based on volume. But in titration, the percentage is usually based on the amount of substance. So for this problem, 25% titration means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

So at 25% titration, moles of NaOH added would be 0.25 times the moles of acetic acid. Since the acetic acid is 0.001 moles (0.05 M * 0.02 L), 25% is 0.00025 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³.

But wait, I don't think I need the volume of NaOH for the pH calculation. Let me think about the solution at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. Let's model the reaction.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

So when 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized, the concentrations of the acid and conjugate base can be determined.

The total volume when we added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH to the diluted solution. The diluted solution was 40 cm³, adding 2.5 cm³ makes it 42.5 cm³.

Moles initially after dilution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

25% of that is 0.00025 moles neutralized, so moles of CH3COOH left: 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 moles.

So in 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L), the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Wait, wait, I can model this using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Which is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.736 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733, but precise calculation later).

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025/0.0425) / (0.00075/0.0425) ) = (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3.

So pH = pKa + log(1/3). Log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.736 - 0.477 ≈ 4.259. So approximately 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, but let me check if I did everything correctly.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the moles.

Wait, after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH to the diluted solution, the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

The initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. So 25% of that is 0.00025 mol neutralized, so remaining is 0.00075 mol. The acetate formed is 0.00025 mol. So yeah, the ratio is 1/3.

So pH is pKa + log(1/3) ≈ 4.736 - 0.477 ≈ 4.259, so about 4.26. So the first part is 4.26. Option A and D have 4.26 and 4.57 as their first pH. Let me check the options.

Options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

D) 4.57; 6.92

Wait, but wait, the equivalence point. Because at equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate will be moles / total volume.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol (since all acetic acid is neutralized). The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ (since equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH) = 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So in solution, it will hydrolyze:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb is 5.405e-10. Let's set up the ICE table.

Initial: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M, [CH3COOH] = 0, [OH^-] = 0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

So Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02, since x is very small.

x^2 = Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have a pH near 9 at equivalence point. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, what's the option D? D says 4.57; 6.92. No, that's not matching. Option A is 4.26;8.52.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate the Kb.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

So for [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M.

Kb = 5.405e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 - x). Since x is small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → Let's compute log(1.04e-5).

Log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -4.983. So pOH is 4.983, pH is 14 -4.983=9.017, approx 9.02.

But none of the options have a pH near 9. So perhaps I made an error somewhere.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the moles or concentration. Let me go back.

Wait, the initial solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then adding 20 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³, so concentration is (0.05 * 20)/(40) ) = 0.025 M.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. Moles of acetic acid is 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. So moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. Total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³. So [CH3COO^-] is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression instead of approximation. Let me see.

x^2 = (5.405e-10)(0.02 -x).

Assume x is very small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So x is about sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) as before. So 1.04e-5.

Wait, perhaps I should consider activity coefficients or not, but I think that's beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is not 0.02 M acetate. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the volume.

Wait, the initial diluted solution is 40 cm³. Then when we add 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total is 50 cm³. So 0.001 mol in 0.05 L is 0.02 M. So that's correct.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the equivalence point pH in option A is 8.52, which is lower than 9. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong approach for the equivalence point. Alternatively, maybe I should have considered the dilution of the acetate solution.

Wait, another approach: calculate the concentration, then the pH.

CH3COO^- is a weak base. Kb = 5.405e-10. So:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial concentration: 0.02 M.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

So Kb = x² / (0.02 -x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

x² = 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x≈1.04e-5.

So [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the equivalence point pH using another method, like the exact solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the concentration of acetate.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the pH without approximation.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

x² = Kb (0.02 -x).

So, x² + Kb x - 0.02 Kb =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-Kb ± sqrt(Kb² +4 *0.02 Kb ) ] / 2.

But Kb is 5.405e-10. So:

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(0.02)(5.405e-10) = approx 4*(0.02)(5.4e-10) = 4.32e-11.

So sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(4.32e-11) ≈ 6.57e-6.

So x = [ -5.4e-10 + 6.57e-6 ] / 2.

Wait, that gives x≈(6.57e-6)/2= ~3.285e-6.

Which is larger than the previous approximation. So [OH^-] is 3.285e-6 → pOH=5.49 → pH=14-5.49=8.51.

Oh, that makes sense. So the pH is about 8.51, which rounds to 8.52. So at equivalence point, pH is 8.52.

So the first part of the problem (25% titration) is pH≈4.26, and equivalence point is 8.52. So option A is 4.26;8.52. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the Henderson-Hasselbalch gave me 4.26 for 25% titration, which matches option A. So why did I get a pH of 8.52 at equivalence point. Oh, because when I used the quadratic equation, I got x≈3.285e-6, which is 3.285e-6 M OH-.

Wait, let me compute that again. So x^2 = Kb * (0.02 -x). Let me plug in the numbers with Kb=5.405e-10.

x^2 =5.405e-10 * (0.02 -x).

Assume x is small, but perhaps the approximation isn't good enough. Let me try using the exact equation.

x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 *0.02)=0.

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1.081e-11 ) ] / 2.

Compute discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 = approx 2.92e-19.

4 *1.081e-11 =4.324e-11.

So D=2.92e-19 +4.324e-11.

Wait, 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.92e-19. So D≈4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

Thus, x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2=3.288e-6.

So [OH-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.49 → pH=8.51, which rounds to 8.52.

So that's why. I think the initial approach with approximation was not accurate enough, but using the quadratic gives a pH of 8.51, which matches option A's equivalence point of 8.52.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A. So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, there are 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting it with 20.00 cm³ of water gives a total volume of 40.00 cm³. The diluted concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M} \times 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3}{40.00 \, \text{cm}^3} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.0400 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

At 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of acetic acid has been neutralized, leaving 0.00075 mol unneutralized. This forms 0.00025 mol of acetate ions. The total volume is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.736\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.736 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) = 4.736 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.736 - 0.477 = 4.259 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate. The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0500 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \(K_b \ll [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]\), the concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) is:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.020} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, using the exact quadratic solution gives a slightly lower pH of approximately 8.52.

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately 4.26, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately 8.52. These values match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
