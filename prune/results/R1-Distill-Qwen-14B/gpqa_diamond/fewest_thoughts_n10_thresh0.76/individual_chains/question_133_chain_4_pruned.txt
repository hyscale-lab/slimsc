Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

We have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate. The temperature is 25°C, which is probably standard conditions.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO₄³⁻, in this solution. The options are all in the 1e-7 M range. Hmm, so I'm dealing with a very dilute solution, maybe?

I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. Since we have both KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄, they're likely going to form a buffer solution. KH₂PO₄ is H₂PO₄⁻, and Na₂HPO₄ is HPO₄²⁻. So when they're mixed, the phosphate ions can exist as H₂PO₄⁻, HPO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻, and maybe H₃PO₄, depending on the pH.

Wait, but the orthophosphate ion is PO₄³⁻. So the solution will consist of different phosphate species. I think the key here is to figure out the concentration of each species and then sum up to get the total phosphate concentration, but wait, the question specifically asks for orthophosphate, which is PO₄³⁻, not the others.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: orthophosphate is H₃PO₄, but when it dissociates, the ions are H₂PO₄⁻, HPO₄²⁻, and PO₄³⁻. So the PO₄³⁻ is the most deprotonated form. So, in this solution, how much of it is present?

I think the steps I need to take are:

1. Calculate the moles of each salt in solution.
2. Determine the total phosphate concentration, considering the stoichiometry of each salt.
3. Use the buffer equation or the relevant Ka values to find the pH of the solution because the form of phosphate depends on pH.
4. Once pH is known, calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻.

Wait, but perhaps there's a simpler way. Since both KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄ are present, they form a buffer. The pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, considering the relevant pKa values.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). For this buffer system, what's the acid and the base?

In the case of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄, the acid would be H₂PO₄⁻ and
