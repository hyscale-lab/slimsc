Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. The options are given, so I'll think through it step by step.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Beta is like 1/(kT), but I don't think the actual value matters here; it's more about the structure.

Each spin has two possible states, so with three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. So I'll need to list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate the energy E for each. Then for each state, I calculate the Boltzmann factor exp(-βE) and sum them all up to get Z.

But calculating all 8 states might take time. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the energy expression. E is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair of spins. The term S1S2 is 1 if the spins are aligned, and -1 if they're anti-aligned. Same for the other terms.

So let me try to find the possible values of E. Let's see, each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. Let me compute the sum H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. The energy E is -J times H. So E = -J * H.

What are the possible values of H? Let's enumerate all possible states, but maybe find how many states have a certain H.

Wait, each spin is ±1. So for three spins, how does H vary?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate H for each possible state. Maybe considering different cases.

Case 1: All spins are the same. So S1 = S2 = S3 = +1, or all -1.

If all are +1, then S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. So H=3.

Similarly, if all are -1, each product is 1, so H=3.

So in these two cases, H=3. Each contributes an energy E = -3J.

Case 2: Two spins are +1, one is -1. Let's see how many such states there are. For three spins, choosing which one is -1: 3 possibilities. For each of these, what is H?

Let's take S1= -1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

Compute H: S1S2 = (-1)(1) = -1.

S1S3 = (-1)(1) = -1.

S2S3 = (1)(1)=1.

So sum H= (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.

Similarly, each of these three states (each with two +1 and one -1) will have H equal to -1.

So for each of these 3 states, E = -J*(-1) = J.

Case 3: One spin is +1, two are -1. How many states? Also 3, same as above.

Take S1= +1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

H = S1S2 = (1)(-1) = -1.

S1S3 = (1)(-1) = -1.

S2S3 = (-1)(-1)=1.

H= (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.

Wait, same as before. So each of these three states also have H=-1. So E = J.

Case 4: All three spins are anti-aligned. Wait, can't have all three anti-aligned because with three spins, each spin is either +1 or -1. Wait, another possibility? Let me think— what if two are anti-aligned and one is same? No, I think I covered all the cases.

Wait, no, another case: maybe two spins are aligned and the third is opposite, but in a different way. Wait, perhaps I missed a case where all three are anti-aligned? Wait, no, because with even number of -1's, maybe? Let me think.

Wait no, three spins can't all be anti-aligned in a way that each pair is anti-aligned. Because if S1=-S2, S2=-S3, then S1 = S3. So it's not possible for all three to be mutually anti-aligned. So the four cases I thought might not cover all possibilities. Wait, let's check:

Wait, if all three spins are -1, that's case 1.

If two are +1 and one is -1, three states, case 2.

If two are -1 and one is +1, three states, case 3.

Wait, what about a state where all three are anti-aligned pairwise? That's impossible because if S1=-S2, S2=-S3, then S1=S3. So each pair can't all be anti-aligned. So those are the only cases.

Wait, but wait, let's think of another way. Let's calculate all possible H values.

H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each term is ±1, so possible sums can range from -3 to +3, I think.

Wait, let me compute H for all the possible states.

List all 8 states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
H = 1+1+1=3.

E= -J*3.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
H = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) → 1 -1 -1 = -1.

E= J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
H = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) → -1 +1 -1 = -1.

E= J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
H = (-1) + (-1) + 1 → (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.

E= J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) → -1 -1 +1 = -1.

E= J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) → -1 +1 -1 = -1.

E= J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
H = (1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) → 1 -1 -1 = -1.

E= J.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
H = 1+1+1=3.

E= -3J.

Wait, looking at this, states 2,3,4,5,6,7 all have
