Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is asking about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z, each given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. 

Hmm, right. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement is made. So the eigenvector here will correspond to measuring the component of angular momentum in direction n and getting +ħ/2.

Wait, wait. Oh, right! The operator P here is likely representing the spin angular momentum operator, since we're dealing with a muon (which has spin-1/2). So the operator P must be the spin operator in some direction.

In the standard basis, the spin operators are usually S_x, S_y, S_z. But here the components P_x, P_y, P_z are given. So each component is (ħ/2) times a Pauli matrix. Because Pauli matrices are 2x2 and have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by ħ/2, so the eigenvalues for P would be ±ħ/2, which matches the given eigenvalue of +ħ/2.

So, the operator P is the spin operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means it can be written as a vector with components (something, 0, something). So, the direction is specified by an angle θ from the z-axis, perhaps. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin operator along a direction n is given by P = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z ), where σ are the Pauli matrices.

But wait, in this problem, the operator P is given as having components P_x, P_y, P_z. So the total operator P is the vector sum P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y must be zero
