Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me take a deep breath and think it through.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a specific reaction. The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I need to break it down.

First, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us about the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. The formula to calculate it is Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens. But I think in this case, since there's no mention of X or N, I can ignore them.

So, the product is formed when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Wait, red phosphorus with HI... Oh, right, that's a reaction where phosphorus is used to cleave double bonds. I think it's called the hydroboration reaction or something else? Or wait, no, I remember that when you have a dihalide and use something like H2O or another reagent, but wait, red phosphorus and HIâ€”maybe it's about adding HI to a double bond.

Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Let me think. The reaction of alkenes with red phosphorus and HI. Oh, right! I think that's the reaction where the double bond is converted into a diiodide. For instance, when you have an alkene reacting with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it adds across the double bond, breaking it and adding two iodine atoms. Like, each carbon of the double bond would get an iodine attached.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Another possibility is that it's the addition of HI to a triple bond. Or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation reaction? No, wait, red phosphorus is used in the dehydrohalogenation sometimes, but that's when making alkenes from alkanes with HX.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the reaction where an alkene reacts with HI and red
