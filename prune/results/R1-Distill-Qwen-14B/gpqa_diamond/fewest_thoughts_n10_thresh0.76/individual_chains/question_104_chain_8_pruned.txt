Alright, let's tackle this astronomy problem. So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet orbits, causing the star to wobble. The shift relates to the planet's mass and orbital period.

The problem states that two stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key data is the periodic shift in the spectral lines: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods—specifically, how many times longer planet #2's period is compared to planet #1's.

Wait, I think the RV method's measured velocity is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. Oh right, the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*) + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (2π) * (P)^(1/3) )) )

But since M_p (planet mass) is much smaller than M_* (star mass), we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. And because both stars have the same mass (similar to Sun), M_* is the same for both. So, the formula simplifies.

Wait, but the problem says both stars have the same mass, but the planets have similar masses to Neptune's. So, M_p is about the same for both planets? Or is that not necessarily the case? The question says "masses similar to that of Neptune"—so maybe their masses are similar, so perhaps M_p1 ≈ M_p2, but the problem doesn't state that they're exactly the same, but for approximation, I'll assume they are because both are Neptune-like.

Wait, but each detected planet has a mass similar to Neptune, but perhaps the exact masses could differ. However, for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can treat M_p1 = M_p2. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the RV shift to find the ratio of the periods.

The RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K. The velocity shift (in the spectral lines) is proportional to K. So, if planet 1 causes a 5 mA shift, and planet 2 a 7 mA, then K1 = 5 and K2 =7 (in some units, but proportional).

We need to find the ratio P2/P1.

Wait, the formula for K is K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*) + M_p ) ]^(1/3) ) * (1/( (2π) * (P)^(1/3) )) )

Wait, let me get the exact formula. The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

K = [ ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ] * (1/( (2π) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_*, M
