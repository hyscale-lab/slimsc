Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about two electrons in p orbitals, and it's asking about the probability of measuring their orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z each as -ħ. The given state is |1,1,2,-1>, where the numbers represent l₁, l₂, l, and m respectively.

Wait, so each electron is in a p orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are l₁ = 1 and l₂ = 1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1. But we're told to ignore spin here, so we're only dealing with the orbital angular momentum part.

The problem is asking about the joint probability of both L₁z and L₂z being measured as -ħ. Hmm. So each of their individual m values would be -1, right? Because L_z eigenvalues are mħ. Wait, but wait, in this state, the total m is -1. So how does that affect the individual m's?

Wait, I think I'm conflating individual m's with the total m. Let me think. Each electron has its own orbital angular momentum, l₁ and l₂. The state is a coupled state, so it's a product of the individual states coupled together.

Wait, no, actually, the state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m>. So the state is |1,1,2,-1>, which means the two electrons' orbital angular momenta are combined to give a total l of 2 and m of -1.

But the electrons are in a p orbital each, so each has l=1. So each can have m values of -1, 0, +1.

When coupling two angular momenta, the total m is the sum of m₁ and m₂. So m = m₁ + m₂. So in this state, the total m is -1. So m₁ + m₂ = -1.

Now, the measurement we're making is for L₁z and L₂z. The eigenvalues for each are m₁ħ and m₂ħ. The question is, what's the probability that both are -ħ. So m₁ =-1 and m₂=-1.

So let me think: the total m is m₁ + m₂ = -1. So if m₁ = -1, then m₂ = 0. Alternatively, if m₁ =0, m₂ =-1. Or other combinations. But in this case, we want m₁=-1 and m₂=-1. But wait, that would sum to m=-2, which is not the same as the total m of -1 in the state. So is that possible?

Wait, no. Because the state is |l₁=1, l₂=1, l=2, m=-1>. So this state is a combination of all possible m₁ and m₂ where m₁ + m₂ = -1. So the possible (m₁, m₂) pairs are:

(-1,0), (0,-1), (1, -2) but wait, wait, m₂ can't be less than -1 because l₂=1, so m₂ can be -1, 0, +1. So possible (m₁, m₂) pairs are:

(-1,0): sum is -1

(0,-1): sum is -1

(1, -2): no, m₂ can't be -2, so that pair isn't allowed.

So the possible allowed (m₁, m₂) pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So for the given state, the possible individual m's are either m₁=-1 and m₂=0 or m₁=0 and m₂=-1.

Wait, but wait, what about other m's? For example, m₁= -1, m₂=0: sum is -1. m₁=0, m₂=-1: same sum. Are there other possibilities? No, because if m₁ is 1, then m₂ would have to be -2, which is impossible since l₂=1, so m₂ can't be less than -1. So the only allowed pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is an eigenstate of L² and L_z, so it's a linear combination of the product states |m₁, m₂> where m₁ + m₂ = -1.

Wait, but how is the state |1,1,2,-1> expressed in terms of the product states |m₁, m₂>? Because when you couple two angular momenta, you have to consider all possible ways to get m= -1 for the total.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m₁, m₂> states where m₁ + m₂ = -1.

So the possible product states are |m₁=1, m₂=-2> → but wait, m₂ can't be -2 because l₂=1. So only the possible product states are |m₁=-1, m₂=0> and |m₁=0, m₂=-1>, since m₂ can't be less than -1.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of these two product states.

Wait, but what's the expansion? For two p orbitals (l=1 each), the coupled states can be built.

I think the expansion is symmetric in a way. So the state |1,1,2,-1> would be a combination of |m₁=-1, m₂=0> and |m₁=0, m₂=-1>.

But I'm not exactly sure about the coefficients. Let me think about the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients tell us how to combine the product states into the coupled states.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l₁ and l₂ into L, M is <l₁ m₁ l₂ m₂ | L M>. So for l₁=1, m₁=-1, l₂=1, m₂=0: their sum is M=-1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> would have components with certain coefficients.

Wait, but what's the expansion. Let me think. The possible m₁, m₂ for M=-1 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |m₁=-1, m₂=0> and |m₁=0, m₂=-1>.

But what are the coefficients? I think for the case of combining l₁ and l₂, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients depend on the specific m's and L.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the coefficients for these two states.

Hmm. For l₁=1, l₂=1, L=2, M=-1.

The general expression for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2 and M is built from the product states.

The CG coefficients for coupling two l=1 (p orbitals) to L=2. The state with M=2 would be |1,1> only. Similarly, M=-2 would be |m₁=-1, m₂=-1>, but wait, in our case, L=2, so M can be from -2 to +2.

Wait, but for M=-1, the state is a combination of |1, -2> (but that's not possible because l₂=1 can't have m₂=-2) and |0, -1> and |-1, 0>. Oh wait, but m₁ can't be less than -1, so the possible product states are |m₁=-1, m₂=0> and |m₁=0, m₂=-1>.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of these two product states.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for these states can be found. Let me recall: For L=2, M=-1, the state is |1,1,2,-1> = sqrt(1/3) |m₁= -1, m₂=0> + sqrt(2/3) |m₁=0, m₂=-1>.

Wait, no, I think the coefficients might be sqrt(1/2) and sqrt(1/2), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, I might have to calculate them.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that the state |1,1,2,-1> is a symmetric combination of the two product states.

Wait, but wait, when you have two identical particles (like electrons), the state might have to consider symmetry, but in this problem, since we're dealing with orbital angular momentum and ignoring spin, perhaps it's just a regular coupling.

Wait, but the question says two electrons, but since we're ignoring spin, perhaps the orbital parts are treated as distinguishable. Or perhaps not. Wait, but electrons are identical particles, so their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But since we're ignoring spin, we're considering only the orbital part. But orbital angular momentum states are symmetric under exchange because they are part of the spatial wavefunction, which for electrons would be antisymmetric. Hmm, maybe I don't need to worry about that here because the question is about orbital angular momentum only.

Wait, but perhaps that's complicating things. Let's proceed.

Assuming the state is a linear combination of |m₁=-1, m₂=0> and |m₁=0, m₂=-1>, each with some coefficients. The coefficients squared give the probability of each outcome when measuring m₁ and m₂.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is some combination like a |m₁=-1, m₂=0> + b |m₁=0, m₂=-1>.

What's a and b?

I think I can get the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients from a table or formula. Let me think about the general formula.

When combining two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L and M, the CG coefficient is:

< l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M > = sqrt( ( (2L +1) (L - M + m2)(L + M - m1) ) / ( (l1 + l2 + L)(-l1 + l2 + L)(l1 - l2 + L)(l1 + l2 - L) ) ) ) * [some factors]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look up the specific case for l1=l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

The CG coefficients for this case can be found in standard tables. From memory, I think for L=2 and M=-1, the state is a combination of the product states with m1 + m2 = -1.

So for M=-1 and L=2, the possible m1 and m2 are:

m1 = -1, m2 =0; m1=0, m2=-1.

The CG coefficient for each is sqrt(1/3) and sqrt(2/3), respectively. Or maybe the other way around. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty, so perhaps I should think about the expansion for |1,1,2,-1>.

The state |L=2, M=-1> is a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

The coefficients can be found using the formula for the CG coefficients.

The general formula for CG coefficients is a bit involved, but for two p orbitals (l1=l2=1), combining to L=2:

For M=2: only |m1=1, m2=1> → coefficient is 1.

For M=1: it's a combination of |1,0> and |0,1>, with coefficients sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), respectively? Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, perhaps it's better to refer to a table. Alternatively, I can recall that for adding two l=1 to get L=2:

The state |1,1,2,2> is |1,1>.

The state |1,1,2,1> is (sqrt(2/3)|1,0> + sqrt(1/3)|0,1>).

The state |1,1,2,0> is (sqrt(1/3)|1,-1> + sqrt(1/3)|0,0> + sqrt(1/3)|-1,1>).

Wait, no, perhaps that's when adding two l=1's to get L=1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps when adding two l=1's, the L=2 states have the following:

The M=2 state is |1,1>.

M=1: (|1,0> + |0,1>)/sqrt(2) → but wait, for L=2 and M=1, the state is (sqrt(2/3)|1,0> + sqrt(1/3)|0,1>).

M=0: (|1,-1> + |0,0> + |-1,1>)/sqrt(3).

M=-1: (sqrt(1/3)|-1,0> + sqrt(2/3)|0,-1> ) ?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the possible ways to get M=-1.

The state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m₁, m₂> with m₁ + m₂ = -1.

Possible terms are:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → |1, m=-1> and |1, m=0> → product state |m1=-1, m2=0>.

m1=0, m2=-1 → |m1=0, m2=-1>.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of these two.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for each term can be found using the formula:

< l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M > = sqrt( ( (2L +1) ) / ... )

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look up the CG coefficients for specific cases. From what I remember, for M=-1 and L=2, and l1=l2=1, the state is:

|1,1,2,-1> = (sqrt(1/3)) |m1=-1, m2=0> + (sqrt(2/3)) |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think about the case where m1=-1 and m2=0. The product state would have m_total = -1. Similarly for m1=0 and m2=-1.

So the coefficients would be sqrt(1/3) and sqrt(2/3), but I'm not entirely sure about the exact values.

But regardless, the probabilities are the squares of the coefficients, so for each product state, the probability is the square of the coefficient.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a superposition of the two product states:

|ψ> = a |m₁=-1, m₂=0> + b |m₁=0, m₂=-1>.

Where a² + b² =1. Let's say a²=1/3 and b²=2/3, or vice versa.

Wait, but if the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, with coefficients a and b, then the probabilities of measuring each would be |a|² and |b|², respectively.

So the probability of getting m1=-1 and m2=0 is |a|², and for m1=0 and m2=-1, it's |b|².

But in the question, we're being asked for the joint probability of both L₁z and L₂z being -ħ. That would require both m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1, because L_z eigenvalues are mħ.

Wait a minute, wait. Each L_z is mħ for each particle. So if L₁z is -ħ, then m₁ is -1, and same for L₂z being -ħ, m₂ is -1.

But in the state |1,1,2,-1>, which is the state of the two-electron system, the total m is -1. So m_total = m₁ + m₂ = -1.

If both m₁ and m₂ are -1, then their sum is -2, which doesn't match the total m of -1. Therefore, this state can't have both m₁ and m₂ as -1.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> doesn't have a component where m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1. Because the sum of m's would be -2, which is outside the total m of -1.

Therefore, the probability of both m₁ and m₂ being -1 is zero.

So the answer would be option D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, with their orbital angular momentum quantum numbers \( l_1 = 1 \) and \( l_2 = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state of the system is given as \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), where \( l_1, l_2 \) are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers, \( l = 2 \) is the total angular momentum quantum number, and \( m = -1 \) is the total \( z \)-component of angular momentum.

The question asks for the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \). The eigenvalues of \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) are \( m_1 \hbar \) and \( m_2 \hbar \), respectively. Measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) corresponds to \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \). For the total angular momentum state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), the total \( z \)-component of angular momentum is \( m = m_1 + m_2 = -1 \). 

If \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \), the total \( m \) would be \( m = -2 \), which does not match the given total \( m = -1 \). Therefore, the state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) does not include a component where both \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \). This means the probability of measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) is zero.

Thus, the answer is:

Answer: D
