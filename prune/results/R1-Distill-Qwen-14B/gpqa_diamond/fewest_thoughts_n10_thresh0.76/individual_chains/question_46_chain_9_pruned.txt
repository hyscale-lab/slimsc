Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and a racemic compound. Hmm, I need to figure out how many products are formed when racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst, and I have to exclude ethene from the count. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene bonds. So, the catalyst will break and reform the double bonds in the molecule. Since the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene, I should draw its structure to visualize.

3-methylpent-1-ene has a double bond starting at carbon 1. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2? No, wait: pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But it's 3-methyl, so on the third carbon. Let me count: the chain is five carbons long. Position 1 is the double bond, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I should number the carbons correctly. Wait, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent has five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2 (since it's 1-ene). The substituent is at C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: For pent-1-ene, it's CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₃. Now, 3-methyl would mean a methyl group is attached to the third carbon. So the structure would be CH₂=CH–CH(CH₃)–CH₂–CH₃. So that's correct.

But wait, the molecule is racemic. So it's a racemic mixture, meaning it's a 50:50 mix of the enantiomers. So, each molecule has a stereocenter? Wait, wait, does 3-methylpent-1-ene have a stereocenter?

Looking at the structure: the third carbon is CH(CH3). The groups attached
