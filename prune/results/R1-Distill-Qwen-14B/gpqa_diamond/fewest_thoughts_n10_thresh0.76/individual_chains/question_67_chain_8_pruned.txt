Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question says there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l=1. The coupled state is given as |1,1,2,-1>, right? So, l1 and l2 are both 1, the total l is 2, and m is -1.

Wait, I remember that when you couple two angular momenta, you combine l1 and l2 to get l. The possible values of l range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2, in integer steps. So here, l1=1, l2=1, so l can be 0,1,2. But the state here is l=2, m=-1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. So they're asking for the probability that both measurements give -ħ.

Wait, each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is given by L_z = m * ħ, right? But in this state, m is -1 for the total angular momentum. So the total m is -1, which is the sum of the individual m1 and m2.

So L1z and L2z are each m1 * ħ and m2 * ħ. So the total m is m1 + m2 = -1.

We need to find the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1. Because that would make L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ.

Wait, but in the coupled state |l1, l2, l, m>, the state is a combination of the product states of the individual angular momenta. So when you have a state with total l and m, it's a linear combination of all possible |l1, m1> |l2, m2> states where m1 + m2 = m_total.

In this case, m_total is -1. So all possible pairs (m1, m2) where m1 + m2 = -1. Possible pairs would be (0,-1), (1,-2), (-1,0), (-2,1), etc.? Wait, but wait, m for each electron can only be -l to +l in integers. Since l1 and l2 are both 1, m1 and m2 can each be -1, 0, +1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs for m_total = -1 are:

m1 = +1, m2 = -2 → but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2=1 → m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So that's invalid.

m1=0, m2=-1 → valid.

m1=-1, m2=0 → valid.

m1=-2 → no, because l=1 means m can't be -2.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Same for m2. So possible pairs where m1 + m
