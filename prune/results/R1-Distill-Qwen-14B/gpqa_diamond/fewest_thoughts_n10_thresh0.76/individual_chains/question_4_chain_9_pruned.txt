Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this Maxwell's equations question here. Hmm, the question is about a universe where a magnet can have isolated North or South poles. So in our real world, magnets have both poles together, like a bar magnet has both a north and a south pole. But in this scenario, you can have a magnet with just one pole, like a single north or a single south. That must change some of Maxwell's equations somehow.

Wait, right. In our universe, we have the concept of magnetic monopoles, which are hypothetical particles that act as isolated north or south magnetic poles. But Maxwell's equations as we know them don't allow for magnetic monopoles. Let me think about each of Maxwell's equations and how they'd be affected if monopoles exist.

Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let's list them out:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t

In our world, the second equation, Gauss's Law for magnetism, says that the divergence of B is zero because there are no isolated magnetic charges (monopoles). So if there were magnetic monopoles, this equation would change. Instead of ∇·B = 0, it would have a term involving the magnetic charge density, like ∇·B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density.

But wait, the question is about Maxwell's equations looking different in this universe. So which equations would change? Let's see.

Option A says the divergence of the magnetic field is different. That makes sense because the second equation would change. But looking at the options, I see more than one equation could be involved.

Wait, the other equation that might be affected is Faraday's Law. In our world, the curl of E is equal to the negative time derivative of B. But if magnetic monopoles exist, does that affect Faraday's Law?

Hmm, I remember that with magnetic monopoles, there's another term in Ampère's Law or maybe Faraday's Law. Let me think. When magnetic monopoles exist, the divergence of B isn't zero anymore. Also, there's a modified version of Faraday's Law. Wait, no. Faraday's Law deals with the curl of E, which is the rate of change of B. If we have magnetic monopoles, the way the magnetic fields change might impact that.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me go back. The original Faraday's Law is: ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. If there's a magnetic current (like a current made of monopoles), I think the equation would have an additional term. Or perhaps Faraday's Law remains the same, but another equation gets modified.

Alternatively, I've heard that in the presence of magnetic monopoles, two of Maxwell's equations change. One is the Gauss's Law for magnetism (div B), which would no longer be zero. The other equation that changes is Ampère's Law, which includes
