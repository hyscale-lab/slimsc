Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit rusty, but I think this is about how the boson X interacts with fermions. Oh right, in particle physics, the Lagrangian tells us the interaction terms. So the X boson couples to fermions, right?

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and the question is about its kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So I need to find which fermion pairs can result from the decay of X.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the energy and mass conditions are satisfied. For a boson to decay into two fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of each fermion. Because each fermion must have enough energy to have their rest mass. So if X is 6 GeV, each fermion in the decay products must have a mass less than 3 GeV, because 6 = 2 * 3. So each fermion's mass has to be less than 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, when the fermions are a pair, like f and \bar{f}, the total mass for each is 2m_f. So the maximum mass for each fermion is M_X/2, which is 3 GeV.

So let me think about the masses of the known fermions. The particles are quarks and leptons.

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). But wait, the top quark is way too heavy—its mass is around 173 GeV, so that's way above 3 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks.

What about the other quarks? u, d, s, c, b.

Wait, let me recall their masses. The up quark is about 2.2 MeV, down is about 4.7 MeV, strange is about 95 MeV, charm is around 1.5 GeV, bottom is about 4.7 GeV. Wait, bottom is about 4.7 GeV, so half of X's mass is 3 GeV. So 4.7 GeV is larger than 3, so the bottom quark is too heavy. So X can't decay into b quarks either.

Wait, but wait, the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. So for a decay into two fermions, each must have mass less than 3 GeV. So the bottom quark is about 4.7 GeV, which is more than 3, so their pair (b and anti-b) can't be produced by X decay because 2*m_b is about 9.4 GeV, which is greater than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar.

Wait, but what about the charm quark? Charm is about 1.5 GeV. So 2*m_c is 3 GeV, which is exactly the mass of X divided by two. So that's the threshold. So the decay into c c-bar is allowed, because 2*1.5 =3 GeV, and X is 6 GeV. So that's allowed.

So for quarks, possible are u, d, s, c. Because their masses are all under 3 GeV. Wait, u is 2.2 MeV, so way under. So the possible quarks are u, d, s, c.

Wait, but wait, the Lagrangian given is -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps I should think about which fermions are involved in the interaction. The interaction term involves ψ_f, so the fermion f is the one that the boson X couples to. So maybe X couples to all fermions, but only certain fermions have masses low enough for this decay to happen kinematically.

Wait, but in the problem, the boson X is a boson field, and the interaction is with fermions ψ_f. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided their combined mass is less than or equal to the X mass.

So the possible fermions are quarks and leptons. So let's list all possible fermions and their masses:

Leptons: electron (e-, e+), mass ≈ 0.0005 GeV. Muon (μ±), ~0.105 GeV. Tau (τ±), ~1.777 GeV.

Quarks:
up (u), ~2.2 MeV → 0.0022 GeV,
down (d), ~4.7 MeV → 0.0047 GeV,
strange (s), ~105 MeV → 0.105 GeV,
charm (c), ~1.5 GeV,
bottom (b), ~4.7 GeV,
top (t), ~173 GeV.

So the fermions with mass less than 3 GeV are:

e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but the tau is about 1.777 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So tau can be produced.

So, the possible fermion pairs X can decay into are:

ee, μμ, τ τ,

uu, dd, ss, cc,

but not tt, bb, since their masses are too high.

So the decay options are any of these pairs.

Now, looking at the options.

Option A: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b's mass is 4.7 GeV, which is above 3 GeV, so X can't decay into b b-bar. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So this includes c quarks. Since 2m_c = 3 GeV, which is exactly equal to X's mass/2, so allowed. So this option includes c, which should be allowed. Does that mean this option is possible?

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is way too heavy, so X can't decay into t t-bar, so option C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But again, b is too heavy, so option D is incorrect.

Wait, but looking back, option B includes c, which is allowed. Because 2m_c =3 GeV, so X can decay into c c-bar. So in that case, option B is possible. But wait, looking at the options, option B includes c c-bar, which would be correct.

Wait, but let me check what the interaction allows. The interaction term is -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the X field couples to ψ_f, meaning that X can decay into any ψ_f and its antiparticle, provided the mass is correct.

So the possible decays are any pair where the fermion's mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So the possible fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So the decays would be X→ e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-,

and X→ u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

But looking at the options, option B includes all of these except for the tau. Let me check:

Option B says: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait no, option B includes tau, mu, e, and the quarks. So option B is correct.

Wait, but what about the top quark? Oh, it's not in any of the options except C, which is wrong.

Wait, but wait. Option B includes c c-bar. So 2m_c is 3 GeV, so it's allowed. So option B is correct.

Wait, but the question says "the lowest order". Hmm, but that just refers to tree-level decays. Higher-order effects might allow more decays, but the question is about kinematical allowance, which is just about mass.

So the correct answer should include all possible fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So looking at the options, option B includes c, which is allowed, and excludes b, which is not allowed.

So option B is correct.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term in the Lagrangian, \(\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y)\), indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions \( \psi_f \). For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the mass of \( X \) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion \( f \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq m_X \). Since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the maximum allowed fermion mass is \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:
1. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 95 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (too heavy).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (too heavy).

2. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.

Thus, the allowed fermion pairs for \( X \to f \bar{f} \) are:
- \( e^+ e^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \),
- \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( c \bar{c} \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( e^+ e^- \). All these fermions satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed fermion pairs for the decay of \( X \) with \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

Answer: B
