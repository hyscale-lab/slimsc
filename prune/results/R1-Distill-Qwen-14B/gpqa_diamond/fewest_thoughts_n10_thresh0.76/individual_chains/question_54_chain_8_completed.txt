Okay, so I've got this problem about ring-closing metathesis. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which starting material would lead to 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis. The options are A to D, which are all octadienes with various substituents.

First, I remember that ring-closing metathesis (RCM) typically involves a catalyst, like Grubbs, which facilitates the redistribution of alkene fragments. The process forms a ring by breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds.

In RCM, two alkenes exchange partners, right? So, a diene (with two double bonds) or a dienophile would undergo a metathesis reaction to form a ring. Wait, but in most cases, especially for rings, the starting material is a diene with two double bonds or a dienophile that can form a new double bond upon metathesis.

Wait, no, in ring-closing metathesis, the starting material is an olefin (alkene) that can undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition, but more accurately, it's a process where two alkenes exchange partners to form a ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a diene where each end can form a new double bond when connected.

Wait, no, RCM generally involves a diene where the metathesis will connect the two ends, forming a ring. So, the starting material should have two double bonds, or more precisely, a diene with two double bonds that allows the ring formation.

Wait a second, wait. Let me correct myself. No, in RCM, the starting material is a diene with two double bonds or perhaps a dienophile. But actually, more accurately, RCM uses a olefin with two alkenes, or a compound that can form a ring when the alkenes are connected.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product structure. The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So it's a cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3,4 (methyl groups) and 5 (isopropyl group), and a double bond between C1 and C2.

In RCM, the ring formation would bring two ends of a diene together. So the starting material must be an octadiene where, when the ends undergo metathesis, the double bonds form the ring and the substituents are positioned correctly.

Wait, the ring is cyclohexene, so a six-membered ring with one double bond. So the starting material must be an eight-carbon diene because 6-membered ring (6 carbons) plus two more for the metathesis ends, but let me count.

Wait, no. Wait, cyclohexene has six carbons. So the starting material before RCM would be an eight-carbon diene (octadiene) with double bonds at positions where metathesis can form a six-membered ring. Alternatively, maybe a diene in a position that allows the ring formation.

Wait, but in RCM, the process involves a diene that, when the ends undergo exchange, forms a ring. So the starting material would be a diene where the two double bonds are at positions that, when connected, form the cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this out mentally. The product is cyclohexene with substituents at carbons 3,4 (two methyl groups) and 5 (isopropyl). So positions 3,4 have methyl groups, and position 5 has isopropyl.

So the starting material would have substituents that, after ring closure, end up at those positions. Let me think about the structure before metathesis.

RCM typically takes a diene, say, with two double bonds. The metathesis would break each double bond, swap the ends, and form a new double bond in the ring.

Wait, no. Let me think again. RCM usually uses a single diene, like an alkyne? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, ring-closing metathesis is a process where a diene (with a double bond) undergoes a process where the catalyst (like Grubbs) causes the ends to swap, forming a ring. So, for example, if you have a molecule with two double bonds separated by a certain number of carbons, metathesis can connect the ends to form a ring.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model this. Let's say the product is a cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So the starting material must be a diene (maybe a monoene but with substituents that allow ring formation) that, upon metathesis, loses two ethylene fragments and forms a six-membered ring with the correct substituents.

Wait, another thought: the product is a cyclohexene, which implies that the starting material must be a diene with two double bonds. Because during metathesis, the two ends are connected, forming a ring and releasing ethylene as a byproduct.

Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a monoene, but that doesn't make sense for RCM. RCM usually requires a diene or a dienophile.

Wait, another approach: the product has substituents at positions 3,4,5. So, let's number the cyclohexene ring.

Carbon 1: part of the double bond (C1-C2).
Carbon 3: methyl.
Carbon 4: methyl.
Carbon 5: isopropyl.

So the double bond is between C1 and C2.

To get the substituents in place, the starting material must have these substituents in positions that, upon ring closure, end up as 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an 8-carbon diene, so that when the two ends are connected (via metathesis), the substituents end up at the correct positions.

Alternatively, the starting material is a diene that, when the ends are connected, forms a six-membered ring, with substituents correctly placed.

Let me try to imagine the starting material: suppose it's an octadiene with substituents in positions that, when the ends are connected, form the cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has substituents on carbons that, when the ring forms, those substituents are at 3,4,5.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an 8-carbon diene. Let's number it as 1 to 8:

Suppose the diene is at positions 1-2 and 7-8 (so 1,7-diene). Then, if metathesis occurs between 1-2 and 7-8, the ends 1 and 8 would connect, and 2 and 7 would connect, forming a 6-membered ring (since 8 - 2 + 1 =7, but that might not make sense. Wait, no, the number of carbons in the ring would be 6. So the starting material must have substituents at positions that, upon ring closure, become 3,4,5.

Wait, maybe I should draw this. Let's imagine the starting material is octa-1,7-diene.

Structure: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, octa would have 8 carbons. So 1 to 8.

Wait, octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds between C1-C2 and C7-C8.

If RCM occurs, the catalyst would break the double bonds and connect C2 to C7 and C1 to C8, forming a ring.

Wait, but in a six-membered ring, the positions would be 1-2-3-4-5-6. So when you form the ring by connecting C1 to C8 and C2 to C7.

Wait, the positions in the starting material would influence where substituents end up in the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has substituents at positions that, upon ring closure, become 3,4,5.

Wait, in the product, the substituents are at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, if the substituents are on the 3rd and 4th carbons, then when the ring forms, they would be at 3 and 4. But wait, the starting material is a diene, so substituents may be in positions that, when the ring forms, they end up at 3,4,5.

Alternatively, maybe the positions in the starting material are such that, when ring closes, the substituents are placed correctly.

Let me think about the options given.

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

Structure: positions 1 and 7 have double bonds.

So the substituents are on C3, C4 (dimethyl), and C5 (isopropyl).

When metathesis occurs, connecting C1 to C8 and C2 to C7, forming a six-membered ring.

Wait, but in the product, the substituents are on C3, C4, and C5. So in the starting material, if the substituents are on C3, C4, and C5, then during ring closure, where do they end up?

Wait, perhaps the positions in the starting material will correspond to positions in the ring. Let me think about how the ring is formed.

In RCM, the diene is something like CH2=CH-(CH2)n-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, perhaps an example would help. Let's take the starting material as octa-1,7-diene.

The structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, that's getting too long. Let me imagine: starting with CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an 8-carbon molecule with double bonds at 1 and 7. So positions 1-2 double bond and 7-8 double bond.

When RCM occurs, the catalyst will facilitate the exchange of the terminal alkenes. So the ends (1 and 8) will break and connect, and the other ends (2 and 7) will connect.

Wait, that would form a six-membered ring because the distance between C1 and C8 is 7 bonds, but when you form a ring, that's 6 carbons (since 1-8 would be connected, with 6 in between? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

If the starting material is octa-1,7-diene:

Structure: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, perhaps a better way to write it is:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2

So positions 1 and 2 are double bond, and positions 7 and 8 are double bond.

During RCM, the catalyst will break the double bonds and swap the ends.

So the catalyst will take the CH2=CH-...-CH2-CH2=CH part and form a new bond between C2 and C7, and between C1 and C8.

Wait, so when the metathesis occurs, the new bonds would be between C2 and C7, and between C1 and C8, forming a ring.

So the ring would have six members: C1, C8, C7, C6, C5, C4, C3, C2. Wait, no, that would be a 7-membered ring. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should count the carbon atoms between the two double bonds. From C1 to C8: there are 7 single bonds, so when you connect C1 and C8, the ring would have 6 carbons, right?

Wait, no. The distance between the two double bonds is 5 carbons (positions 3,4,5,6,7). So when you connect C1 to C8 and C2 to C7, the ring would consist of C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, and C8? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps when you connect C1 to C8 and C2 to C7, the ring would be formed by C1, C8, C7, C6, C5, C4, C3, C2. Wait, that's 8 carbons, which would form an 8-membered ring. But the product is a 6-membered ring, so perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I have the starting material wrong. Let me think again.

The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So, six-membered ring.

Assuming the starting material is an 8-carbon diene, maybe the substituents are on certain positions so that when the ring closes, they end up at 3,4,5.

Let me consider option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So, the double bonds are at positions 2 and 6. So the structure is CH2-CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is octa-2,6-diene, so double bonds at 2-3 and 6-7.

In this case, when RCM occurs, the catalyst would exchange the ends. So perhaps the metathesis between the two double bonds would form a ring.

Wait, maybe the starting material is octa-2,6-diene with substituents at 3,4,5.

So the starting material would have substituents on carbons 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl).

When the ring forms by connecting the ends, say, between C2 and C7, and C3 and C6, the substituents would end up at positions 3,4,5 in the ring.

Wait, but the product's double bond is at 1-ene, so in the cyclohexene, the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is octa-1,6-diene. Let me check option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7.

If RCM occurs, the two double bonds would exchange ends. So C1 would connect to C7, and C2 would connect to C6.

Wait, connecting C1 to C7 and C2 to C6 would form a ring. Let's see how many members that would be.

The distance between C1 and C7 is 6 carbons, so the ring would have 6 members: 1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7. Wait, no, that's 7 carbons in a row, which would form a 7-membered ring. But product is a 6-membered ring, so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm counting wrong. Let me think again. The starting material is octa-1,6-diene.

So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, octa is 8 carbons. So:

1 (CH2=) 2 (CH-) 3 (CH2-) 4 (CH2-) 5 (CH2-) 6 (CH=) 7 (CH2-) 8 (CH2-?)

Wait, that can't be. So for octa-1,6-diene, it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, 8 carbons with double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7.

So positions 1-2: double bond.

Positions 6-7: double bond.

So, structure: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should number the starting material as:

1: CH2-
2: CH2-
3: CH2-
4: CH2-
5: CH2-
6: CH2-
7: CH2-
8: CH2-

Wait, no. Let me think again. The starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. So the substituents are on carbons 3,4,5. The double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7.

So structure:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH2)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, that's not right. The substituents on 3,4 are methyl, and 5 is isopropyl.

So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me construct it step by step.

Carbon 1: CH2= (due to double bond between 1-2)
Carbon 2: CH- (connected to 1)
Carbon 3: CH(CH3) (methyl group)
Carbon 4: CH(CH3) (methyl group)
Carbon 5: CH(CH2CH3) (isopropyl group, which is CH(CH2CH3)? Wait, isopropyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, isopropyl is CH(CH3)2. So perhaps carbon 5 is CH(CH2CH3) ? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, actually, 5-isopropyl would be CH2CH(CH3)2 attached to carbon 5.

So, the substituents are:

Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
Carbon 4: CH(CH3)
Carbon 5: CH(CH2CH3) ?

Wait, perhaps that's not accurate. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituent at carbon 5 is isopropyl, which is -CH(CH3)2. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to imagine the ring formation.

When the starting material undergoes RCM, the two double bonds (1-2 and 6-7) would undergo metathesis. The catalyst would break the double bonds and form new bonds between the ends.

So, the new bonds would form between C2 and C7, and between C1 and C6.

So, the structure would form a ring by connecting C1 to C6 and C2 to C7.

Wait, so the ring would have C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8? No, that's 8, which can't form a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the starting material.

Alternative approach: the product has a six-membered ring. So the starting material must have eight carbons with two double bonds, such that the distance between the two double bonds allows the ring to be six carbons.

So the number of carbons between the two double bonds plus one equals the ring size.

Wait, for a six-membered ring, the starting material's two double bonds should be separated by four single bonds. Because 4 + 2 (double bonds) = 6.

Wait, so in the starting material, the two double bonds are separated by four single bonds. That would allow a six-membered ring to form.

So, for example, in octa-1,6-diene, the two double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7, which are four carbons apart (2,3,4,5 are single bonds between them). So 1-2 (double), then single bonds at 3,4,5, then double at 6-7. So that's four single bonds between the two double bonds, meaning the ring formed would be 6-membered.

So, if the starting material is octa-1,6-diene with substituents at 3,4,5, then during ring-closing metathesis, the two ends (1 and 6) would form bonds, bringing the substituents into the ring at positions 3,4,5.

Wait, but the product's substituents are at 3,4,5, so the starting material's substituents should also be at 3,4,5.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. So substituents at 3,4,5.

So during metathesis, the starting material's structure is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, the structure would be:

1: CH2= (from 1-2 double bond)
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)
4: CH(CH3)
5: CH(CH2CH3) (isopropyl)
6: CH2= (from 6-7 double bond)
7: CH-
8: CH2.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

1: CH2=CH-
2: -CH(CH3)-
3: -CH(CH3)-
4: -CH(CH2CH3)- (isopropyl)
5: -CH2-
6: -CH2-
7: CH2-
8: CH2.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, in any case, when the RCM occurs, the two double bonds (1-2 and 6-7) would undergo metathesis, breaking and reforming to connect C1 to C6 and C2 to C7.

That would form a six-membered ring, because the distance between C1 and C6 is 5 carbons, which would make a six-membered ring.

So, in the ring, the substituents would be at positions:

C1: connected to C6
C2: connected to C7
C3: from the starting material's substituent at C3 (methyl)
C4: substituent at C4 (methyl)
C5: substituent at C5 (isopropyl)
C6: connected to C1
C7: connected to C2
Wait, but in the ring, the positions would be 1,2,3,4,5,6.

So substituents at C3, C4, and C5 in the starting material would end up at positions 3,4,5 in the ring.

Yes, that makes sense. So the starting material must be octa-1,6-diene with substituents at 3,4,5. Looking at the options, that's option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Yes, which has substituents at 3,4,5 and double bonds at 1 and 6.

So upon RCM, this would form a six-membered ring with substituents at 3,4,5, and the double bond at position 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis (RCM), we analyze the product and the reaction mechanism. The product is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl), and a double bond between C1 and C2.

In RCM, a diene undergoes metathesis to form a ring. The starting material must be an octadiene with double bonds positioned such that, upon metathesis, the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the starting material align correctly in the product. The reaction connects the ends of the diene, forming a six-membered ring.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This structure has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8. If RCM occurs, the ring formed would be too large (greater than six members), as the distance between the double bonds is too great. This does not match the product.

2. **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
   This structure has double bonds at positions 2-3 and 6-7. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 would not align correctly in the six-membered ring after RCM, as the double bonds are not positioned for proper ring closure.

3. **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
   This structure has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 are correctly positioned. During RCM, the double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7 undergo metathesis, forming a six-membered ring with the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5, and a double bond at position 1. This matches the product.

4. **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This structure has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8. Additionally, the substituents are incorrectly positioned (isopropyl at position 4 and methyl groups at positions 5 and 6), which would not result in the correct substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the product.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**, as it has the correct substituents and double bond positions to form the desired product via RCM.

**Answer: C**
