Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let's see. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector and n is a unit vector. I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix, right?

So the Hamiltonian is a dot product of the Pauli matrices with a unit vector. Wait, the dot product should give a scalar multiplied by ε. But wait, H is an operator, so it's actually the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding Pauli matrix scaled by the component of n. So H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z).

Now, eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix. I think each individual Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. Because, for example, σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But in this case, the Hamiltonian is a combination of all three Pauli matrices scaled by ε and the unit vector components.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of any Pauli matrix combination multiplied by a scalar. Oh wait, I think the eigenvalues of σ · n would be ±1 because n is a unit vector. Let me think about that. Because σ · n is a spin operator in the direction of n, and its eigenvalues should be ±1. Because the spin-1/2 system has spin in any direction having eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but wait, wait, wait. Oh wait, no. Because σ itself is a vector of matrices where each σ_i has eigenvalues ±1. But when we take σ · n, which is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix would be the same as the eigenvalues of any Pauli matrix, which are ±1, because the trace and determinant are the same regardless of the combination. Because for any unit vector, σ · n is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues ±1. So the eigenvalues of σ · n are +1 and -1.

But then the Hamiltonian is ε times that. So the eigenvalues of H would be ε times ±1, so ±ε. So the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε. Looking at the options, option B says +ε and -ε. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing
