Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets. Hmm, let's see. The question says there are five exoplanets in a system, all with circular orbits and discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 4 and Planet 2, assuming they have the same albedo.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. Since they all have the same albedo, that factor will cancel out when taking the ratio. So the main thing is the distance.

Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * (L / (16πσ d^2))^½, but more simply, since all planets orbit the same star, the T_star factors would be the same and can be ignored when taking the ratio. So the key is the distance d.

Wait, no, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is usually given as T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), where R is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital radius. But wait, I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, I remember that the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. Because the further out, the colder.

So the formula is T ≈ T_0 * sqrt( (1/(1 + Q)) ), but wait, in this case, Q is probably negligible because orbital distance is much larger than the star's radius, so it's just T ≈ T_0 * (1 / sqrt(a)), where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, that's not right. The formula I'm recalling is T = T_star * (L/(16πσ a^2))^½, but if L is the star's luminosity, then the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to sqrt(L/(a^2)) ), so sqrt(L) / a.

But wait, in this problem, all planets orbit the same star, so L is the same for all. Therefore, T is proportional to 1/a. So the ratio of temperatures between two planets would be (a2/a1)^(-1). Wait, no, wait a second. Because if a planet is farther away, its equilibrium temperature is lower. So T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, and the temperature is proportional to the square root of the flux. Oh wait, right, flux is F = L/(4πa²), so the equilibrium temperature is T = [F*(1 - A)/(4σ)]^½. So T ∝ sqrt(F) → sqrt(1/a²) → 1/a.

Wait, so T is proportional to 1/a. So the ratio of T4 to T2 would be a2/a4? Or is it the inverse? Let me get this straight.

If Planet 4 is farther from the star than Planet 2, then its equilibrium temperature would be lower. So T4 < T2, so the ratio T4/T2 would be less than 1.

But how do the orbital periods relate to the semi-major axis? Oh, Kepler's third law. For a star, the period P is related to a by P² ∝ a³ (assuming same mass star). So the ratio of a's would be (P4/P2)^(2/3). Because Kepler's law is P² = (4π²/GM) a³ → a = ( (G M) (P²/(4π²)) )^(1/3) → a ∝ P^(2/3).

So, a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Wait, but the periods are given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planets 1 to 5. So Planet 2 has a period of 2, Planet 4 has a period of 3.5.

So the ratio P4/P2 is 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

So a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3).

Then, since T is proportional to 1/a, T4/T2 = a2/a4 = 1/(a4/a2) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) ) → (2/3.5)^(2/3).

Wait, let me compute that. 2/3.5 is 2/(7/2) )=4/7 ≈0.5714.

So (0.5714) raised to the (2/3) power.

Wait, 0.5714 ≈ 4/7.

So (4/7)^(2/3) → Let me compute that.

Alternatively, take logarithms. Let x = (4/7)^(2/3).

Take natural log: ln x = (2/3) ln(4/7).

Compute ln(4/7): 4/7 ≈0.5714, ln(0.5714) ≈ -0.558.

So ln x = (2/3)*(-0.558) ≈ -0.372. So x ≈ e^(-0.372) ≈ 0.688.

Wait, e^-0.372 is approximately 1 - 0.372 + (0.372^2)/2 - ... but I can approximate it.

Alternatively, I recall that e^(-0.35) is about 0.7047, e^(-0.4) is about 0.6703. So 0.372 is closer to 0.35. Let's say around 0.688 or 0.69.

Wait, but the options are A) ~0.57, B) ~0.69, C) ~0.83, D) ~0.75.

So B is ~0.69. So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.69, which is option B.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't mix up the ratio.

Wait, T is inversely proportional to a. So T4 = T2 * (a2/a4).

Wait, because T ∝ 1/a, so T4 = (a2/a4) * T2.

So the ratio T4/T2 = a2/a4.

Wait, but a4/a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3) → (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3) ≈ (1.75)^(0.6667).

What is 1.75^0.6667?

Alternatively, let me compute (1.75)^(2/3):

Take ln(1.75) ≈ 0.5596.

Multiply by 2/3: 0.5596 * 0.6667 ≈ 0.373.

Exponentiate: e^0.373 ≈ 1.451.

So a4/a2 ≈ 1.451.

So a2/a4 is 1/1.451 ≈ 0.688, so T4/T2 = 0.688, which is about 0.69, so option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. All the planets are in orbital resonance, but does that affect their actual semi-major axes? Or is the ratio given already their period ratios, which we can directly use Kepler's law to find a's?

I think the problem says the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, so we can take those as exact ratios. So the periods are P1=1, P2=2, P3=2.5, P4=3.5, P5=5.

Thus, for the ratio a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) → (3.5/2)^(2/3) = 1.75^(2/3) ≈ (1.75)^(0.6667)≈ as above.

Another way: 3.5 is 7/2, so 3.5/2 = 7/4 = 1.75. So (7/4)^(2/3) is the same as ( (7/4)^(1/3) )^2.

Compute (7/4)^(1/3) ≈ (1.75)^(1/3) ≈ around 1.2, because 1.2^3 is about 1.728, which is close. So 1.2^3=1.728, 1.21^3≈1.771. Hmm, 1.75 is between 1.728 and 1.771, so (7/4)^(1/3) is approximately 1.205.

So square that: (1.205)^2 ≈ 1.452.

So a4/a2 ≈1.452, so a2/a4 ≈0.688.

So T4/T2 = 0.688, which is approximately 0.69. So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( T \propto \frac{1}{a} \). Since all planets orbit the same star, the ratio of temperatures depends only on the ratio of their orbital distances.

From Kepler's third law, the orbital distance \( a \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Thus, the ratio of distances \( a_4/a_2 \) is given by:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

The orbital periods of Planet_4 and Planet_2 are \( P_4 = 3.5 \) and \( P_2 = 2 \), respectively. Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = (1.75)^{2/3}.
\]

To compute \( (1.75)^{2/3} \), take the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln(1.75) \approx 0.5596, \quad \ln\left((1.75)^{2/3}\right) = \frac{2}{3} \cdot 0.5596 \approx 0.373.
\]

Exponentiating:

\[
(1.75)^{2/3} \approx e^{0.373} \approx 1.451.
\]

Thus, \( a_4/a_2 \approx 1.451 \), and the reciprocal \( a_2/a_4 \approx 1/1.451 \approx 0.688 \). Since \( T \propto 1/a \), the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_4} \approx 0.688.
\]

This value is approximately \( 0.69 \), which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
