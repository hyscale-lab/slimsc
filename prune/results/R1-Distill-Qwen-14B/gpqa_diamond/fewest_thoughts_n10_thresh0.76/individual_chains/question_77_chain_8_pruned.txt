Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and some other reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes rearranging. But wait, let me think more carefully.

The question has two parts: reaction A and reaction B. I need to find the major products for each. Let me take them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. That sounds a bit complicated. Let me visualize it. So, the structure is a benzene ring attached to a (CH2OCH2CH2CH(CH3)) group. Wait, no, the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, but since it's 1-yl, the substituent comes from the first carbon. So, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between 2 and 3. Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between 2 and 3? Or is the substituent from the first carbon? Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- attached via the first carbon, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So, the group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with double bond at 2, so CH2-CH2 is CH2-CH2, but wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond between the first and second carbons? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is: the substituent comes from the first carbon of the butene. So, but-2-en is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, no, wait. Wait, but but-2-en is CH
