Okay, so I'm trying to solve this statistical mechanics problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Let's see what I remember from my studies.

The problem states that there are three spins S1, S2, and S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the partition function Z. The options are given, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

First, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). Each state corresponds to a particular configuration of the spins. Since each spin can be either +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. So I'll need to compute the energy for each state and then sum the exponentials.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the structure of the energy. The energy is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair of spins. So maybe I can find the possible values of that sum and how many states correspond to each value.

The sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's see what possible values S can take.

Each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1, because each S is either +1 or -1. So each term is ±1, and there are three terms. So the sum S can vary between -3 and +3 in steps of 2, maybe?

Wait, let's check all possible combinations. Let me think about cases.

Case 1: All three spins are the same. That is, all +1 or all -1. Let's say all +1: S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. So S = 3. Alternatively, all -1: each product would be 1, so S =3 again. So when all spins are same, S=3.

Case 2: Two spins are +1, one is -1. Let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So
