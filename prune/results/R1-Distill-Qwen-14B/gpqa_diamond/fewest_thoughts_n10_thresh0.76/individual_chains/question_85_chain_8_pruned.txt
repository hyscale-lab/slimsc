Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's start by breaking down what I know.

First, the star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 times the Sun's, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets are both detected via transit and radial velocity methods.

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both are in circular orbits, so that's good because it avoids complications from eccentricity.

The question is about their equilibrium temperatures. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming radiation from the star and the outgoing thermal radiation from the planet. The formula I think is T = T_star * sqrt( (R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )^(1/2)? Wait, no, probably it's more like T = T_eff * ( L / (16 pi sigma a^2) )^(1/4), but maybe I should think about it in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Wait, the star emits energy as a blackbody, so the flux at the planet's orbit is F = sigma * T_star^4 * (R_star^2 / a^2), where a is the semi-major axis. But since the planets are in circular orbits, a is just the orbital radius.

The planet absorbs this flux, but considering its albedo. So the absorbed power is F * (1 - albedo) * pi R_planet^2. The planet emits as a blackbody too, so the power is 4 pi R_planet^2 * sigma * T_planet^4. Setting them equal:

sigma T^4 * (1 - a) * pi R_p^2 = 4 pi R_p^2 sigma T^4 (1 - a) = 4 pi R_p^2 sigma T_p^4

Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Let me get the formula right. The equilibrium temperature formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - a_p) )^(1/4) / ( (1 + e)^(1/4)
