Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal. So the interatomic distances are the same in each direction, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all the same here—30 degrees each.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I think interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance is usually given by d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + (2hk cos α)/(h+k) )... Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing something up. Oh right, for cubic systems, it's simpler because angles are 90 degrees. But rhombohedral isn't cubic, so the formula must be more complicated.

Wait, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system? Or is it a separate category? No, I think it's a subclass of cubic systems. Or maybe it's part of the trigonal system. Well, regardless, the general formula for interplanar distance when the lattice isn't cubic would involve the angles between the lattice parameters.

Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \gamma) - 2(h
