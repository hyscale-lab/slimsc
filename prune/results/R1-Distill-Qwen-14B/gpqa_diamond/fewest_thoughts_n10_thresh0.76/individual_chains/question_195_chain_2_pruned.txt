Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and an orbital period of 3 days. The second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii, and we're supposed to find the maximum orbital period such that both transit and occultation events occur. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, transit and occultation events. Wait, I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the star blocks the planet's light. For both to happen, the planets must be aligned in such a way that their orbits are in the same plane and the second planet's orbit is either inside or outside the first one's. Wait, no, I think it's more about the orbital periods. Or maybe it's about the relative sizes of their orbits. Because if the second planet is too far out, it might not have the same alignment for transits and occultations.

Wait, let's think. Both transit and occultation events require that the planet passes in front of and behind the star. For this to happen, the two planets must be in a configuration where one can pass in front of the other from our point of view. So, the second planet must be in an orbit that allows it to both transit (pass in front) and occult (be behind, so the star eclipses it).

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Maybe it's about their orbital periods and orbital distances. Oh right, the key here is probably about the Hill sphere or the Roche limit, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be about the condition for a planet to be able to transit. For a planet to transit, it has to pass directly in front of the star, so the star and planet must be aligned as seen from Earth.

Wait, but the problem says that the second planet shares the same orbital plane as the first. So their orbits are coplanar, which is a necessary condition for transits. So alignment is already taken care of. But the question is about the maximum orbital period. So, the maximum period would occur when the second planet is as far out as possible while still allowing transits and occultations.

Wait, no, I think the key is the condition for a planet to transit. For a planet to transit, it must lie within the star's habitable zone? No, that's not right. The transit depends on the planet's orbital distance and the star's size. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on, which is given here. But the problem is about two planets in the same system, and both transiting and occulting each other.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is about the orbital period of the second planet such that it can transit and also be occulted by the star. Wait, but the occultation event is when the planet is behind the star, so the star blocks it. So for that to happen, the planet must be in an orbit where it can pass behind the star, which depends on the orbital distance.
