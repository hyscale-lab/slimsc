Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first reaction is heating with excess KOH to produce product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Let me start by figuring out each step.

First Reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) heated at 240°C.

I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo elimination to form alkenes via an E2 mechanism. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide where the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of adamantane. Wait, but in adamantane, each carbon is part of a diamondoid structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two non-adjacent carbons.

Wait, but if they're 1 and 3 positions, maybe they're across a bridge or something. So heating with KOH would lead to elimination. But since both are bromides, perhaps it's a double elimination. Let me think: when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) eliminate, they form alkenes. But for 1,3-dibromide, perhaps the elimination isn't possible, or maybe it's a different structure.

Wait, wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe KOH could cause a substitution. No, elimination is more likely with heat. Wait, but in an adamantane structure, each carbon is connected in a way that's very rigid. So maybe the elimination occurs in such a way that forms a double bond between C1 and C2, but wait, that's 1,2. No, wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm.

Wait, maybe
