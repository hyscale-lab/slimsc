Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. Hmm, let me think. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector and n is an arbitrary unit vector. Oh right, σ has components which are the Pauli spin matrices, like σ_x, σ_y, σ_z.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. So, when you take their dot product with a vector n, which is a unit vector, you're essentially creating a matrix that depends on the direction of n. But since n is arbitrary, the specific direction shouldn't affect the eigenvalues because the eigenvalues should be the same regardless of the direction, right?

Wait, no, wait. The eigenvalues of σ · n would be the same as the eigenvalues of σ · any unit vector because the magnitude is what matters, not the direction. So, let me think about the general case. The Pauli matrices are such that σ · n is a Hermitian matrix because n is a real unit vector. So, the eigenvalues should be real.

I remember that for any Pauli matrix σ_i, the eigenvalues are ±1 when multiplied by some coefficient. Oh wait, wait. Let me think. The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues of ±1. But when you take σ · n, which is a linear combination of σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each multiplied by components of n, say n_x
