Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with benzene and going through several transformations. Each step leads to a product, and the final product is one of the options given. My goal is to determine which option (A to D) is correct.

Let me break down each step.

Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1. I remember that HNO3 and H2SO4 are used for nitration. Benzene typically undergoes nitration at the meta position because the nitronium ion is a meta-directing group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene's first nitration is at the meta position? Or is it para? Hmm, no wait, actually, nitration of benzene occurs at the meta position because the nitro group is a meta director. Wait, noâ€”I think that's incorrect. Wait, wait. Let me think again. Nitration of benzene occurs under conditions that favor the attack at the para and ortho positions, but wait, no, wait. No, wait: when benzene undergoes nitration, the nitronium ion is a strong meta director. Because nitro is a strong meta director. So the product should be nitrobenzene, but wait, no, wait, nitro group is a meta director. So the nitration of benzene would add the nitro group to the meta position? Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, benzene is symmetric, so the nitration can occur in any position, but the product is nitrobenzene, which has the nitro group attached. But wait, benzene is a planar molecule, so all positions are equivalent? No, wait, when benzene undergoes nitration, the major product is nitrobenzene, but the nitro group can be attached in any position, but since it's a single substitution, it's just mononitrobenzene. Wait, but the initial positions after nitration will determine where the next substituents go.

Wait, perhaps I should think that product 1 is nitrobenzene. Or maybe not. Wait, sometimes nitrating benzene under certain conditions can give different products, but generally, the first nitration gives nitrobenzene with
