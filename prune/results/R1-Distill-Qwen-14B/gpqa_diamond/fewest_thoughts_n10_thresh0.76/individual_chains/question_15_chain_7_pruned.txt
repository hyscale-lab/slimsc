Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and their orbital distances.

The question gives two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because the orbital period is shorter when you're closer (like how Mercury has a shorter year than Venus).

The stars they're orbiting are important too. The host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, so a more massive star doesn't necessarily mean it's bigger in radius. Oh, because stars can be more massive but have similar sizes if they're in different stages or something.

I think the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on to our line of sight. The probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. The formula I remember is something like R_star / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So a smaller a (closer planet) would increase this ratio, making the probability higher.

Wait, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)², or is it just R_star/(a * something)? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, the transit probability P is roughly (R_star / a) times some factor, maybe considering the inclination and other factors. But for this problem, since both planets are around stars of the same radius, and their a's are different, I can probably just compare (R_star/a) for each.

So let me think: for transit probability, it's higher when the planet is closer and the star is larger. But in this case, both stars have the same R. So the main factor is the semi-major axis (a) of the planet's orbit.

Orbital period is related to a via Kepler's third law. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M is the star's mass. So a³ is proportional to P
