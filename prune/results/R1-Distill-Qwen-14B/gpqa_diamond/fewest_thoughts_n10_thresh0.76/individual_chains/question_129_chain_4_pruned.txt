Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me read through the question carefully.

Alright, the problem is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are four steps in the reaction scheme, and some hints provided. Plus, there are four options to choose from. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are:
a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while compound E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are all cyclic ketones, so compound E must be a ketone. That makes sense because the last step involves elimination of an inert gas, which I think refers to dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not too sure yet.

Let me think about each step and what each reaction implies.

Starting with compound A. It reacts with HCN to form B. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups (like ketones or aldehydes) in a nucleophilic addition. So if A is a ketone, then B would be the cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, same thing. But since the IR of A is around 1750 cm^-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So A is a ketone.

Wait, but cyclohexanone has a carbonyl around 1700, whereas a more substituted ketone or an aromatic one can be higher. So perhaps A is an aromatic ketone? Or maybe a cyclopropane ketone, but I'm not sure yet.

Moving on, the next step: B is reduced with H2 and Pd to give C. H2 with Pd is hydrogenation, probably reducing a nitrile group. Because when HCN adds to a ketone, you get a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol (-OH) and a nitrile (-CN) group. So B has both an alcohol and a nitrile.

Then, when B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, the nitrile (-CN) would be reduced to an amine (-CH2NH2?), but wait, no. Wait, nitriles on hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would typically become amines. Wait, no, H2 and Pd would probably hydrogenate the nitrile to an amine only if it's under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine via a ketone intermediate. Wait, no, I think nitriles upon catalytic hydrogenation (H2, Pd)
