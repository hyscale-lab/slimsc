Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about reacting ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, the researcher checked the reaction using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots appearing. The options give possible product structures, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material to visualize what's happening. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So, the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The substituent on the oxygen is a butenyl group. But wait, but-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, right? So the structure is O-benzene connected to a CH2 group, then a CH(C(CH3)2) group, but wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the butenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond, but the position is 3-en. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond starting at C3. Wait, but but has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- ?

Wait no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be: the substituent is on the 1st carbon of the butenyl group. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait that can't be because but has four carbons, so but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond at the end, between C3 and C4, making it a terminal double bond. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is
