Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The first part of the reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something else (A) to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reacts with B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I think I remember that when ketones react with compounds like cyanide (NaCN), it's usually the formation of a cyanohydrin. Wait, right, the cyanide acts as a nucleophile and adds to the carbonyl carbon. But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures to visualize.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)C(O)CH2CH3. Adding NaCN would add a CN group to the carbonyl carbon. So the product would have an OH and CN on the same carbon. Oh wait, the product is 2-hydroxy... so the addition is happening at the same carbon as the ketone.

But how does that happen? Oh, right, the general reaction is ketone + CN- â†’ cyanohydrin. The mechanism is that the NaCN provides CN-, which attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen gets a proton (from an acid catalyst?), leading to the formation of the alcohol and the cyanide group on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but in the product, both OH and CN are on the same carbon. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Oh right, because the structure would be CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. So when the cyanide adds, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's the structure.

So for this reaction, the conditions are
