Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the diffraction pattern created by a large N-sided polygonal aperture. Hmm, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, creating a pattern of bright and dark spots known as interference maxima and minima.

The question says the aperture is a regular N-sided polygon with all apothems of length 'a'. Wait, what's an apothem? Oh right, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So all sides are equidistant from the center, meaning the polygon is regular and convex.

The light is monochromatic, so it has a single wavelength λ, and it's traveling along the z-axis, falling vertically on the aperture. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field, assuming N is infinitely large. Oh, so as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. Wait, is that correct? Because if you have a polygon with a huge number of sides, it approximates a circle. So the problem is essentially about a circular aperture, but perhaps approached from the polygon perspective.

Wait, but the question is about the first two minima. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot (the zeroth order) surrounded by dark rings. The first dark ring (minimum) occurs at a certain angle, and the second would be the next dark spot after that.

I remember the formula for the minima in a single slit (which is similar to the circular aperture's first minimum) is given by a sinθ = mλ
