Okay, so I have this physics problem about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The question gives me the uncertainty in the electron's position, Δx, and I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. 

Wait, let me think about what I know. The Uncertainty Principle says that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh right, and since it's the minimum uncertainty, I can probably use this as an equality for the calculation. So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx).

But wait, energy is related to momentum. The kinetic energy of a particle is given by (p²)/(2m), where m is mass. So if I can find the uncertainty in momentum Δp, I can find the uncertainty in energy ΔE. Let me try to work this out step by step.

First, let's note down all the given values. The speed v is 2e8 m/s, but wait, is that necessary? Because the problem gives Δx as 0.1 nm. Oh, but wait, maybe the speed is given to help us relate momentum, but I'm not sure. No, wait, the problem is about the uncertainty principle, so perhaps the speed isn't directly needed. Because the uncertainty in position is given, maybe that's all I need.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy. So perhaps the energy uncertainty comes from the uncertainty in momentum. Let me think again.
