Okay, so I have this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The question says that there's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A. They're asking for two things: the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees, and the possible form of f.

The options are A to D, each giving a fraction and a lambda dependence. 

I remember that when a charge oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. The dipole radiation comes into play here. Oh right, the radiation from an oscillating dipole. The power radiated by a dipole is given by the Larmor formula. 

Wait, the Larmor formula is P = ( ( (e² a² ) / (6π ε₀ c³) ) ), where a is the acceleration. But I'm not sure how that directly applies here. Maybe I should think about the angular distribution of the radiation.

Right, for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) depends on the angle theta. The intensity or the power per unit solid angle is maximum along the direction of the dipole's axis and falls off as you move perpendicular. 

Wait, the dipole's radiation is perpendicular to the direction of motion. Wait, no, the dipole moment's direction is along the oscillation, which is along the z-axis. So the radiation pattern should have maximum intensity perpendicular to the z-axis. Or wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 

The radiation from a dipole is maximum at theta = 90 degrees, I think. Because the dipole's electric field oscillates in the plane perpendicular to the axis. So the maximum intensity is at the equator, so to speak.

Wait, so if the dipole is along the z-axis, the radiation is strongest in the theta = 90 degrees direction. So the maximum power per unit solid angle is at theta=90, and it decreases as you move towards theta=0 or 180. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I
