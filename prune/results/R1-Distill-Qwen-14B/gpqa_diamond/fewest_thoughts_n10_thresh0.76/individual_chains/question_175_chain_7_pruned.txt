Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with its symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and they're asking about the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and the possible form of f.

So the options give possible fractions and dependencies on λ. Hmm.

I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation, and the radiation pattern depends on the distribution and the angle θ. For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is maximum along the equator (θ = 90 degrees) and falls off as you go towards the poles (θ=0 and 180). Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, for a dipole, the radiation is maximum perpendicular to the dipole, which is θ=90 degrees. So in that case, the radiation pattern is strongest at θ=90.

But wait, the problem here says the charge distribution is spheroid. Spheroid symmetry along z-axis, so the dipole moment would be along z, I think. So the radiation would be strongest perpendicular to that, which is θ=90.

But the question is about θ=30 degrees. So the power at 30 degrees would be less than the maximum.

What's the dependence of the radiated power per unit solid angle as a function of θ?

I think for a dipole radiator, the radiated power per unit solid angle (the radiation pattern) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. Wait, no, I think it's proportional to (sinθ)^2. Because the radiation pattern for a dipole is (sinθ)^2, which peaks at θ=90 degrees (so sinθ=1, which is maximum). So if that's the case, then the power at θ=30 degrees would be sin²(30) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25.

Wait, but wait. The maximum power is at θ=90, which is sin^2(90) = 1. So the fraction at
