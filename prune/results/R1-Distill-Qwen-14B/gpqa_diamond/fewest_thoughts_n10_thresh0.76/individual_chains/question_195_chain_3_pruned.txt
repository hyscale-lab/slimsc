Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the setup is there's a star similar to the Sun but a bit bigger—radius 1.5 solar radii. There's a planet around it with Earth's radius, and it's orbiting in a circular path. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, but I'm not sure how relevant that is for this question. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days.

Now, the question is about a second planet. This one has a radius 2.5 times Earth's, so that's larger. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have so that it both transits and occults the star. Both planets share the same orbital plane and have circular orbits.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that for a planet to transit, it must pass directly in front of the star from our perspective. The transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The impact parameter relates to how close the planet passes to the star's center during transit. A lower impact parameter means the planet is closer to the center, so a more central transit.

Wait, but how does that affect the second planet's period? Maybe it's about the relative positions of their orbits.

Oh, wait! Both planets need to transit and occultate each other. Occultation happens when one body passes behind the other from our view. So for both events to occur, the two planets must be in such a configuration that they can both eclipse each other relative to the star.

Wait, no. Wait, occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, right? Or is it when one planet passes behind another? Hmm, I think in this context, since the question says "exhibit both transit and occultation events," it's about each planet. So the second planet must transit (so its orbit is aligned) and also be occulted by the star (which just means when it's behind the star, but maybe that's always the case if it's in the same orbital plane, but perhaps the timing is important).

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The second planet must transit (so we see it pass in front of the star), and also be occulted (so the star passes in front of it). But wait, occultation of the planet by the star is a normal occurrence during transit. Wait, no, occultation is when the planet is hidden by the star—so it's when the planet is behind the star from our point of view. So for that to happen, the planet must be on the other side of the star during some part of its orbit. So how does that relate to their orbital periods?

Ah, I remember something about orbital periods and orbital separation. If two planets are in the same plane, their orbital periods must be such that they can both transit and occult each other. But in this case, the second planet is in the same system but another planet, so perhaps their orbital periods must be such that the two planets can align in certain ways.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum period of the second planet where both transit and occultation events occur. So maybe it's about the planet being in a position where it can transit the star and also have
