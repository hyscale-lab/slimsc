Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's take it slow.

Alright, the problem says we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Their total weight is 7.20 grams. They are heated to 200°C without air. So, I'm thinking this is probably a decomposition reaction, maybe releasing some gases.

The gases formed are passed through three tubes. Let's see what happens in each tube.

Tube 1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. So, magnesium perchlorate is a strong desiccant, but wait, it's used to absorb moisture, specifically water. So, Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs water vapor. The weight of tube 1 increased by 3.60 grams. That suggests that the gas passing through had water vapor, which was absorbed, adding 3.60 g to the tube.

Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. Calcium hydroxide solution is used to absorb CO2. But the weight didn't change here. So, that means no CO2 was present in the gas mixture. Because if CO2 was there, the solution would react and increase in mass. Since there's no change, the gas doesn't have CO2.

Tube 3: Red-hot copper. Copper at high temperatures can react with certain gases. The product is CuO, and the mass increased by 0.80 grams. So, what gas reacts with copper to form CuO? I think it's O2, but wait, O2 would form CuO only when there's a reaction. Or maybe it's another gas. Wait, no, another possibility: if the gas is H2S, but that wouldn't react with copper. Alternatively, maybe it's water vapor again, but copper wouldn't react with water unless it's in steam and under certain conditions. Wait, let me think. Red-hot copper in the presence of steam can produce CuO and H2. The reaction is 2 Cu + 2 H2O → 2 CuO + H2↑. But in this case, the gas is passing through, so maybe steam is involved. Wait, but the tube's weight increased by 0.80 grams. If the gas was H2, then when it's passed through, the H2 would be absorbed by the copper, but wait, no. The copper is in a tube, and the gas is passed through. So, if the gas is H2O, then the copper would react with it, producing CuO and H2. But wait, in that case, the mass change would come from the H2O consumed. Let me calculate that. The mass increase is 0.80 grams. The reaction is:

2 H2O + 2 Cu → 2 CuO + 2 H2↑

The molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. For every 2 moles of H2O (36 g), 2 moles of H2 are produced (which is 4 g). So the mass increase would be the mass of CuO formed minus the H2 produced, but actually, the mass comes from the H2O. Wait, wait, the H2O is consumed, so the mass increase is the mass of the product minus the H2O. Let me clarify:

Each mole of H2O is 18 g. When 2 moles (36g) react, they produce 2 moles of H2O converted to CuO. Wait, no, the H2O becomes H2 and CuO. So, the mass change is the mass of CuO added minus the mass of H2. So, 2 moles of CuO is 160 g (since each mole is 80 g/mol). 2 moles of H2 is 4 g. So the net mass increase is (160 - 4) = 156 g? That can't be right because our increase is only 0.80 g. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas in tube 3 is H2. Wait, but H2 is a product, not a reactant. Or maybe the gas is something else. Wait, another possibility: the gas could be CO, but CO wouldn't react with copper. Alternatively, maybe it's SO3? But I don't think so. Wait, perhaps the gas is O2. If O2 passed through hot copper, would that react? I don't think so because O2 is O2, and copper in that state might not react unless there's some other condition. Hmm, perhaps I'm off track here.

Wait, the problem says that in tube 3, only CuO is formed. So, the reaction must involve the gas reacting with copper to form CuO and another product. Let's think about possible reactions.

Another possibility is that the gas is H2S. But H2S wouldn't react with copper. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a halogen, like Cl2 or Br2, but those would probably form some other compounds. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfur-containing gas, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the mass increase in tube 3 is 0.80 g. Let's find out what that could be. Let's assume that the gas is H2O. The reaction would be 2 H2O + 2 Cu → 2 CuO + H2. The mass change is the mass of CuO formed minus the mass of H2 produced.

The moles of CuO formed would be equal to the moles of Cu reacted. Let's compute for the 0.80 g increase.

Let's let x be the mass of H2O that reacted. The reaction consumes x g of H2O and produces (mass of CuO) - (mass of H2) = 0.80 g.

The molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol, so moles of H2O = x / 18.

Each mole of H2O produces 1 mole of H2 and 1 mole of CuO.

Molar mass of CuO is 80 g/mol, so moles of CuO = x/(18) → mass = (x/18)*80 = (40x/9) g.

Moles of H2: x/(18) → mass is (x/18)*2 = x/9 g.

So, the mass increase is (40x/9) - (x/9) = (39x/9) = 13x/3 g.

Set this equal to 0.80 g:

13x/3 = 0.80 → x = (0.80 * 3) /13 → 2.4 /13 ≈ 0.1846 g.

So, approximately 0.1846 g of H2O reacted. That seems plausible.

So, the gas passing through tube 3 is H2O, which reacts with copper to form CuO and H2. But wait, tube 3 is a red-hot copper, so maybe the gas is H2O vapor.

Wait, but then why is there a 0.80 g increase? Because the H2O is being converted into CuO, which adds mass.

So, putting that together, the gas that entered tube 3 was H2O.

But wait, earlier, tube 1 absorbed water. So, the initial gas must have had water vapor, which was absorbed in tube 1. Then, what about the remaining gas after tube 1? Perhaps the gas after tube 1 is something else. But according to the problem, the gas in tube 3 is the same as the initial gas, but passed through the previous tubes. Or perhaps, the gas after tube 1 is H2O, but that doesn't make sense because Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb the H2O.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The initial gas mixture is passed through tube 1 first. Tube 1 has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong desiccant. It absorbs water vapor. So, any water vapor
