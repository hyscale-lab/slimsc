Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the oxidizing strength of oxygen in different solutions and how it reacts kinetically. The task is to fill in the blanks with the right terms. Hmm, I remember that in electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidant relates to its tendency to gain electrons, right? So stronger oxidants have a higher tendency to be reduced.

Wait, the statement says: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. So I need to figure out whether oxygen is a stronger or weaker oxidant thermodynamically in basic solutions, and whether it reacts faster or slower kinetically in acidic solutions.

I think about the standard reduction potentials. For oxygen, in basic solutions, the reaction is O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH- with a standard E° of about 0.40 V. In acidic solutions, it's O2 + 4H+ +4e- → 2H2O with E° of about 1.23 V. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the standard E for O2 in basic is higher? Or lower? Let me think again. 

Wait, in acidic solution, the O2 reduction is more favorable because the E° is higher. So in acidic solution, O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent than in basic. Oh wait, no, because higher E° means it's a better oxidizing agent. So in acidic solution, the E° is higher, so oxygen is a stronger oxidant there. In basic, the E° is lower, so as an oxidant, it's weaker compared to acidic conditions. So thermodynamically, in basic solutions, oxygen is a weaker oxidant (compared to when it's in acidic). So the first blank is filled with 'weaker'.

Now the kinetic part. Kinetic refers to the rate of reaction. So how does the reaction rate of O2 compare in acidic vs. basic solutions. I remember that the reaction rate can depend on how easy it is for the reaction to proceed. In acidic solutions, the reaction might have a lower activation energy because maybe the protons help in the reaction mechanism.

Wait, but wait, the reaction in basic is O
