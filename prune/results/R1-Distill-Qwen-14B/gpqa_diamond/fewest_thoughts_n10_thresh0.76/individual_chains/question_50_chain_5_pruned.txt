Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a Feynman diagram and some terms written next to it. The terms are alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. The question is asking how many loops the diagram has, based on these terms. The options are A) 6, B) 2, C) 1, D) 3.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order of the process. Each loop typically contributes a factor of some sort, usually involving integrals and possibly some constants. So the idea is that the terms in the amplitude or the expression can tell us about the number of loops.

Wait, I think the general formula for the contribution of Feynman diagrams is based on the expansion in terms of the coupling constants and other parameters. For example, the number of loops L is connected to the degree of divergence and the superficial degree of divergence.

Alternatively, I recall that each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of i times some loop integral, which often includes factors of 4π and possibly the coupling constants and other terms. But how does this tie into the given expression?

Looking at the given expression: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

Let's break this down. Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4πε0 ħ c), approximately 1/137. G is another coupling constant, maybe for a gauge group or something else. The sqrt(2) is a numerical factor, as is 8/(4pi)^6.

But wait, I'm trying to think about how the number of loops relates to the exponents of these terms. Each loop might contribute a certain number of factors, so maybe the exponents can tell us the number of loops.

Let me think about the standard form of loop integrals. A one-loop diagram would contribute a term proportional to (alpha * something) with certain exponents. Two loops would have higher powers, perhaps, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another approach. The general form of a Feynman diagram's contribution has a
