Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product after a certain reaction. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize its structure. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂, but wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH-). Oh wait, no. Wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH-, so the substituent is probably a CH₂CH₂ group with a double bond. Wait, no—vinyl is a substituent where the group is CH₂-CH₂ but in a double bond arrangement. So, more accurately, the substituent is -CH₂CH₂? No, no, wait. The vinyl group is -CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond, so it's actually -CH₂-CH₂ but with a double bond. Or wait, no. The vinyl group is -CH₂CH₂ where the substituent is attached to the double bond. So more correctly, the structure is CH₂=CH- as a substituent.

So the parent structure is cyclohexene (so one double bond in the ring), with a formyl group (CHO) at carbon 2, and a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) at carbon 5. Also, there's a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) somewhere. Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene is substituted at positions 2,5, and the carboxylic acid is at position 3? Or wait, the numbering might be a bit different. Let me think. The cyclohexene has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, because the suffix is 'enecarboxylic acid'—so the double bond is at position 3. The carboxylic acid is at position 1, perhaps, but in the numbering, the substituents are numbered in a way that gives the
