Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology techniques, specifically about a transgenic mouse model. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They want to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. So they modified the coding sequence by adding the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen sequence at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they started testing, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

Looking at the problem, the main issue is that the protein isn't being expressed as intended. So I need to figure out why the construct isn't working.

The given sequence is the plus strand of the construct. Let me look at that. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then there's a bunch of codons. Wait, I should probably check for any in-frame stop codons because if there's a stop codon earlier, the ribosome would terminate translation early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all.

Looking at the sequence, I'll scan through the codons. Let's break it down into triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT ACC GCC AAA TGA CTC GGA AGA GTC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GAA AGC GCT GCA GAT GAG TTG CTC TGC GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC TCA CTC GCG TCG CGG CGA GAG GCG GGC GAC CTA CGC GCT GCA CGG GCG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC CGC GCT GCA GAT CCA TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACA GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTC GCA TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC GCG CTG GAA GGA GGC CTG GAG GAT CCC GCT TGG AGA AGC TCA GCC TGT TTT GCG AGA AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA

Wait, so let me look for any TAA, TAG, or TGA stop codons in the reading frame.

Starting from ATG, each codon:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (tyrosine)
3. CCA (proline)
4. TAC (tyrosine)
5. GAT (aspartic acid)
6. GTC (valine)
7. CAG (glutamine)
8. ATT (isoleucine)
9. ACC (threonine)
10. GCC (alanine)
11. AAA (lysine)
12. TGA (stop codon!) Oh wait, here's a TGA at position 12-14 (assuming triplets). So the 11th codon is AAA (lysine), 12th is TGA, which is a stop. So the first 12 codons would be from ATG to TGA, which is a stop.

So the construct's coding sequence includes a stop codon within the coding region, right after the HA tag. That would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, producing a truncated protein. But wait, the person was trying to overexpress GADD45G with HA tag. If the stop codon is present, the protein won't be made beyond that point.

Why would a stop codon be present in the construct? Maybe during the cloning process, there was an error. For example, if the plasmid was designed incorrectly, perhaps the HA tag added included a stop codon, or the original GADD45G sequence had an early stop codon introduced.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: The HA determinant has a missense mutation. That would change an amino acid, but the main issue here is the stop codon causing no protein or truncated. So this might not explain the lack of overexpression. Unless the mutation is in the HA sequence, but the problem is the presence of a stop codon.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early due to a stop codon. Yes, because the construct has a TGA in the coding sequence. So the ribosome would stop there, not making the full-length protein. This seems likely.

Option C: The lack of linker causing proteolysis. So if the HA tag is at the N-terminus, perhaps a linker is missing, leading to the protein being degraded. But the main issue here is the stop codon, not proteolysis. The construct wouldn't produce a full-length protein anyway due to the stop, so proteolysis might not be the main cause here.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. But all cells have tRNA that recognize stop codons, but they don't have aminoacyl-tRNAs. Instead, release factors recognize stop codons. So the presence of a stop codon would terminate regardless of tRNA availability. So this option is not
