Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles emitted, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (like neutrons and protons) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli statistics condition is given: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2, where T is isospin, S is spin, and L is orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We need to figure out which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each showing a transition from 1S0 to some state plus a particle.

First, I should remember how the quantum numbers work in these transitions. The problem mentions conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Let me think about the initial state. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 would mean 2S+1=1 → S=0, L=0 (since S is for spin and L is orbital angular momentum), and J=0. So the initial total angular momentum is J=0.

When the two nucleons emit a particle X, the final NN state has some quantum numbers. Let's denote the emitted particle X with some angular momentum state, denoted by lowercase letters (like s, p, d, f). So the initial system (1S0) must transition to a new state plus the emitted particle.

Wait, but the problem says the term symbol for the options is 1S0 -> ... + p, etc. So I think the "p" here refers to the type of the emitted particle's angular momentum. So each option is like a decay process where the NN system emits a particle X with a specific angular momentum state.

The key is to apply the Pauli condition and parity conservation.

Pauli's condition says T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since T is 0, 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. That means S and L can't both be even or both be odd. One must be even and the other odd.

Wait, actually, let me rephrase the equation. Because T=0, the equation is 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. So S + L must equal 1 mod 2 → (S + L) mod 2 =1. So S and L are of opposite parity. If S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.

Now, the initial state is 1S0, which has S=0 (even), L=0 (even). So the initial total angular momentum J is 0 (from S=0, L=0).

When the NN system emits a particle X, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the total angular momentum of the emitted particle plus the final NN state must equal the initial J, which is 0.

Wait, but J is a vector, so maybe it's more about the coupling. Hmm. Alternatively,
