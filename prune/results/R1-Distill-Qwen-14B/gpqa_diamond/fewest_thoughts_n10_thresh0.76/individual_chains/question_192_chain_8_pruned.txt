Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the electric field at a point outside a conductor with a cavity. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity, which is also spherical, with radius r. The center of this cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. So, the conductor's main sphere has its center, and the cavity is shifted by s units from that point. The radius of the cavity is smaller, r < R.

Now, someone placed a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor and a distance l from the center of the cavity. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is outside the conductor.

Hmm, okay. I remember from my studies that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Oh right, in electrostatics, charges reside on the surface of conductors. Also, the electric field inside the conductor (the material part) is zero. But this is about a conductor with a cavity.

Wait, the conductor was uncharged initially. Then, we add a charge inside the cavity. Since the conductor was neutral, adding a charge inside should induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Let me think: when you place a charge inside the cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So, if +q is inside, the inner surface will have -q. But since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out.

Wait, but is that correct? So, the total charge on the conductor is zero initially. When you add +q in the cavity, the inner surface must have -q. Because the conductor as a whole must remain neutral (since only +q was added inside, and the conductor was neutral to begin with), the outer surface must have +q. So, that would mean the conductor's
