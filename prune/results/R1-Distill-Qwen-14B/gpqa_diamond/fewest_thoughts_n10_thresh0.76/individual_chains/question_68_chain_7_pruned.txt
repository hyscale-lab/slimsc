Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try my best.

The problem says the particle has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. So mu = γ S_z. Got it. Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, so the particle's moment is aligned with that field. Then the field is turned off and another one is applied along +Y, same magnitude B. After that, the average z-component of the moment starts oscillating, and we need to find the frequency.

Wait, but wait. So initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. That means its spin is quantized along Z. So the energy levels are determined by the magnetic field along Z. The system was in an eigenstate of S_z.

Then, the magnetic field is switched off. So the Hamiltonian changes. Oh wait, but the particle's spin is intrinsic, so the spin itself doesn't change. The magnetic moment is still mu = γ S. But when the magnetic field is turned off, the Hamiltonian before was proportional to S_z, but after the field is turned on in Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y.

Wait, wait, no. Because the magnetic field creates a Hamiltonian of the form H = -μ·B. Oh wait, but the problem says mu is equal to gamma S_z. So originally, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -μ·B_initial = -gamma S_z B pointing in +Z. So H_initial = -gamma B S_z.

But then the field is turned off, and another field is applied along +Y. So the new Hamiltonian would be H_final = -mu · B_new. But wait, mu is given as gamma S_z. Wait, is that correct? Or is mu given as gamma S, the total spin? Hmm, the question says mu = gamma S_z. Oh, so mu is a vector? Or is it a scalar? Wait, the magnetic moment is a vector, so mu = gamma S_z would imply that the magnetic moment is along the z-direction. Wait, but then if the field is in the y-direction, mu is still along z, so mu · B would be zero. That can't be right because then the system wouldn't interact with the field.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps mu is proportional to the spin vector. Let me read the question again. It says mu = gamma S_z. So mu is a vector pointing along the z-direction with magnitude gamma times S_z. But that would mean that when the magnetic field is along Y, the dot product mu · B would be zero, right? Because mu is along Z and B is along Y. So that would imply no interaction, which can't be the case because the question says the average oscillates. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe mu is the vector gamma times the spin vector S. So mu = gamma S. So as a vector, it's gamma times each component. So mu would point in the same direction as S. So when the magnetic field is in the +Z direction, mu is in +Z, so the energy is lower. When the field is in +Y, mu is in whatever direction the spin is in, so the interaction is mu · B = gamma S · B.

Ah, that makes sense. So the initial magnetic moment is along Z, and when the field is along Y, the interaction is S·Y direction.

So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z, probably spin-up along Z. Then the field is turned off, but then a new field is applied along Y, so the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B S_y. Because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so H = - mu · B, which would be -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but the problem says mu = gamma S_z. Oh, that's confusing. Hmm. Maybe I should recheck. The question states: "mu (= gamma*Sz)", which suggests that mu is equal
