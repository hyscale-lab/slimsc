Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is: A charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that potential energy in electrostatics involves interactions between charges. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, that must play a role. Grounding usually means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge would go to the ground. Oh wait, but a conducting sphere in electrostatic equilibrium has its charge on the surface. So if it's grounded, any induced charges from the external charge q would be neutralized by the ground.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. When a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere's charges redistribute. But because it's grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface must be zero. Because a conductor's surface adjusts so that the electric field inside is zero, and grounding sets the potential to Earth's potential, which is zero.

So the induced charges on the sphere would be such that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. Let me think about image charges. Oh right! The method of images is used for this scenario. For a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge would be inside the sphere but in a specific position.

Wait, the method of images: when you have a charge outside a conducting sphere, the sphere can be considered as having an image charge. The image charge's position is inside the sphere, and its magnitude depends on the radius of the sphere and the distance of the external charge.

The formula for the image charge, I think, is q' = - (R² q) / d, where d is the distance between the center of the sphere and the external charge q. Wait, no, let me get the formula right. The image charge for a sphere of radius R, when the charge q is at a distance d from the center, is q' = - (R² / (d - R)) ) * q? Or wait, maybe it's (R^2 / d) * q or something else. I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Wait, another approach: The potential at the surface of the sphere must be zero because it's grounded. The potential due to the external charge q and the induced charge on the sphere must add up to zero at the
