Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So, I know |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So, these are the standard basis states for spin-½ systems, right? So, the state is a linear combination of these two.

The first part of the question asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The operator's matrix representation has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm. Wait, what's this operator look like?

For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So, the matrix would be:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0  ]

Because when i != j, it's ħ/2, and when i = j, it's 0. So, that's the operator in question.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices have similar structures. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the Y matrix is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is diagonal. But this operator isn't exactly a Pauli matrix. Let me think about what this operator represents.

Alternatively, perhaps this operator is proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X has 1s off-diagonal. So, if I multiply by ħ/2, that would give the elements as given. So, the operator could be written as A = (ħ/2) * sigma_x, because sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, A = (ħ/2) |up><down| + (ħ/2) |down><up|. 

Well, regardless, the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenvectors of A. So, to find the eigenstates, I need to solve the eigenvalue equation A|psi> = λ |psi>. 

Alternatively, since A is a 2x2 matrix, perhaps I can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, the matrix A is:

[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A - λ I) = 0. So,

| -λ      ħ/2      |
| ħ/2     -λ      |  = 0

So, determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)^2 = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0. So, λ² = ħ²/4, so λ = ± ħ/2. So, the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The eigenvectors for each eigenvalue can be found by solving (A - λ I) |v> = 0.

For λ = ħ/2:
The matrix becomes:
[-ħ/2, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, -ħ/2]

So, the equations are:
(-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So, the eigenvectors are of the form (1, 1) multiplied by normalization. Wait, but let me think about it. Because the equations are -v1 + v2 =0, so v1 = v2, so the eigenvector is proportional to |up> + |down>. Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2, the equations would be (ħ/2)v1 + (-ħ/2)v2 =0 → v1 = v2. Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate.

Wait, when λ = -ħ/
