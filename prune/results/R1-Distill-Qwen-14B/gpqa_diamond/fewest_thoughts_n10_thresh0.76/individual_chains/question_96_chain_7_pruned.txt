Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that black holes have something called entropy, which is related to their area. Oh right, the Hawking formula! The entropy S of a black hole is given by S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon. 

Wait, but wait, how do I get the area A from the given information? The question says the angular size θ is 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is 10^10 parsecs. Oh, right, angular size relates to the actual size through the distance. So the formula for angular size is θ ≈ size / distance, assuming θ is small in radians.

But wait, θ is given in degrees. I should convert that to radians first. So θ in radians is θ = (10^-17 degrees) * (π radians / 180 degrees). Let me compute that: θ ≈ (10^-17 * π) / 180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So the size of the event horizon (let's call it D) is approximately θ * distance. The distance d is 10^10 parsecs. Oh, but parsecs to meters. 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 3.086e26 meters. 

So D ≈ θ * d = (1.745e-19 radians) * (3.086e26 m) ≈ 5.37e7 meters. Wait, that seems a bit off... Did I compute that correctly? Let me check: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = 1.745 * 3.086 ≈5.37, and exponents: 10^(-19+26)=10^7. Yeah, so D ≈5.37e7 meters.

Wait, but the event horizon's size is related to the Schwarzschild radius, R_s = 2 G M / c². Oh, right, so the area A is 4 π R_s²
