Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to recall.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles composed of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are particles that don't exist long enough to be observed directly and quickly decay into other particles. The mean decay distance would depend on how long the particle lives before decaying, right? The longer it lives, the further it can travel before decaying.

The given data are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Wait, the width Γ is the decay width, which is related to the lifetime of the particle. I think the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy times the uncertainty in time is about ħ (reduced Planck's constant). So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. But wait, the decay width is Γ, which is the uncertainty in energy, so ΔE is Γ. Then, the lifetime τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. Because Γ is the total decay width, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I think the relationship is Γ = ħ / τ. No, wait, I think it's Γ = ħ / τ, which would mean τ = ħ / Γ. Because
