Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and the uncertainty in time for each state is roughly that lifetime. So for E1, the lifetime (Δt1) is 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 seconds. 

Wait, but how does that apply to the energy difference between E1 and E2? Let me think. If we're trying to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy for each state is smaller than ΔE. Because if the uncertainty is bigger than the actual difference, the lines would overlap, and you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and ensure that the energy difference is larger than both uncertainties. Wait, but the states themselves have their own uncertainties. So the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state's energy, perhaps?

Wait, no. Let's think differently. When you have two states, each with a certain uncertainty in energy, their energy separation must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, right? Because if the separation is smaller than the uncertainties, you can't distinguish them. 

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Let me think. For each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i ≈ ħ/(2 Δt_i). So for E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 * 1e-9), and for E2: ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2 * 1e-8). 

So the uncertainty for E1 is higher because the lifetime is shorter. Because a shorter lifetime implies a larger uncertainty in energy. Makes sense because Heisenberg's principle says that if you know the lifetime (time) more precisely (longer Δt), the energy uncertainty is smaller. 

So to distinguish the two energy levels, the difference between E2 and
