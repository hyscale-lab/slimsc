Okay, so I've got this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let me think. The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30 degrees, as well as the possible form of f as a function of λ.

Wait, so I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The power radiated depends on the angle θ. For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is such that the power is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole axis, right? So if the dipole is along the z-axis, the power is maximum at θ = 90 degrees. But wait, is this a dipole or a quadrupole or something else? The shape is spheroidal, which I think is like a prolate spheroid, so maybe it's a dipole-like radiation?

Oh, wait, the radiation pattern for a dipole is given by the formula for the power per unit solid angle. The formula for the radiated power (dP/dΩ) for a dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2, I think. Wait, no, wait. No, I remember that for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is maximum at θ = 90 degrees, and it's proportional to sin²θ? Or is it something else?

Alternatively, wait, the general form for radiation from a dipole is P ∝ (1/(r²)) * sin²θ, but in the far field (radiation zone), the dependence on r would be different, but here we're considering the power per unit solid angle, which is the radiation intensity. For a dipole, the intensity is proportional to sin²θ. So the maximum occurs at θ = 90 degrees, where sinθ is 1, so the intensity is maximum. At θ = 0 (along the axis), the intensity is zero.

Wait, but the question says the maximum power is A. So the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees, and the intensity at other angles is less. So the fraction at θ=30 degrees would be the intensity at 30 divided by the maximum intensity.

So, the intensity I(θ) is proportional to sin²θ. So at θ=30 degrees, sinθ is 0.5, so I(30) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 times I_max. So the fraction would be 0.25, which is 1/4.

So the first part of the answer is 1/4.

Now, for the form of f as a function of λ. Wait, what's f? The question says f is a function of λ and θ. So the power per unit solid angle is f(λ, θ).

I think for electromagnetic radiation from an oscillating charge, the power depends on the acceleration of the charge. But in the far field (radiation zone), the power radiated per unit solid angle should depend on the square of the dipole moment, and for a dipole, the radiation is proportional to (1/λ^4), because dipole radiation scales with wavelength as λ^-4. Wait, alternatively, let's think in terms of the formula for the power radiated by an oscillating dipole.

The power radiated by a dipole is given by P = ( (μ_0 μ_e)^2 ω^4 ) / (12 π c^3 ), where μ_e is the electric dipole moment. But in terms of the dependence on wavelength, since ω is 2πc/λ, so ω^4 is proportional to c^4 / λ^4. So P is proportional to (1/λ^4).

But wait, wait. The power per unit solid angle is the intensity. So for a dipole, the intensity is proportional to sin²θ / λ^4, perhaps? Because the total power is P = 4π ∫ (I) sinθ dθ dφ. So if I(θ) is proportional to sin²θ, then integrating over all angles gives a total power that's proportional to 1/λ^4.

Wait, let me think again. The intensity (power per unit solid angle) for a dipole is I(θ) = ( (μ_0 μ_e^2 ω^4 ) / (12 π c^3 )) * sin²θ. So the function f would be proportional to 1/λ^4 because ω^4 is (2π c / λ)^4, so 1/λ^4. So yes, f is proportional to λ^(-4).

So looking at the options, the fraction is 1/4 and the form is λ^-4.
