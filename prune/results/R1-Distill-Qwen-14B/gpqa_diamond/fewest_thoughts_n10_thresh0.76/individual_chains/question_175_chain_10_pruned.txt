Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let me try to think through what I remember from electromagnetism classes.

The question says there's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A. The question is asking for two things: the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the possible form of f. The options are A to D.

Wait, so first, what's the general behavior of radiation from an oscillating dipole? I remember that for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator (theta = 90 degrees) and falls off towards the poles (theta = 0 and 180). The radiation pattern is symmetric around the axis.

The formula for the power per unit solid angle, the radiation intensity, I think is given by something like (p^2 omega^4 sin^2 theta)/(12 pi epsilon0 c^3), but I might be mixing some constants here. Wait, the dependence on theta is sin^2(theta), right? So the maximum occurs when sin(theta) is 1, which is theta=90 degrees. So the maximum intensity is when theta is 90, but wait the question here is about theta=30 degrees. So what's the fraction of the maximum A at that angle?

Wait, the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So if the maximum is A, that would correspond to the maximum value of f. So when is f maximum? Since f depends on theta, I think it's maximum when sin(theta) is maximum, which is at theta=90, so sin(theta) = 1. So f(theta) = k * sin^2(theta), where k is some constant that depends on lambda and other factors. But the question is about how much of the maximum A is radiated at theta=30, so I need to compute f(30)/A.

Wait, A is the maximum value of f. So if f(theta) = something proportional to sin^2(theta), then the maximum is when sin(theta) is 1.
