Okay, so I overheard this conversation between two chemists, and I'm trying to figure out what the second chemist meant by saying, "my compounds are on top of each other." Hmm, let's think about this.

The question is a multiple-choice, so I need to look at the options and see which one fits best. Let me break it down.

First, the context is synthetic organic chemistry. They're working in a lab, probably dealing with separating compounds after a reaction. When a chemist says their compounds are "on top of each other," I think they're talking about chromatography. In chromatography, you want your compounds to separate so you can isolate them. If they're not separating, they might be too similar in some way.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Similar polarities. Polar compounds would elute similarly in chromatography, so they might not separate. But I'm not sure if this is the main issue.

Option B: Bonding through non-covalent interactions. If the compounds are bonding, maybe they're sticking to each other. Like if they have hydrogen bonds or other intermolecular forces, they might not separate. But wait, in chromatography, the stationary phase and mobile phase interactions matter. If the compounds are too similar, they might not move apart.

Option C: Similar boiling points. If they have similar boiling points, perhaps they don't vaporize at the same rate, but this seems more relevant to distillation. In chromatography, it's more about the interaction with the stationary phase.

Option D: Similar optical rotations. Optical rotation relates to chirality, but unless they're enantiomers, that wouldn't cause them to not separate. Plus, chromatography usually isn't about optical activity.

Wait, the key here is chromatography. If the compounds are "on top of each other," it suggests they're eluting together, not separating. So the issue is that the compounds are too similar in how they interact with the stationary phase. That's about their polarity, right? If they're too similar in polarity, they'll have similar retention times.

So option A says "have similar polarities." That sounds plausible. But what about option B? If they're bonding through non-covalent interactions, maybe they form dimers or something that makes them stick together. But in chromatography, it's the interaction with the stationary phase that causes separation. If the compounds are too similar, they'll stick similarly and not separate.

Wait, but all organic compounds have some non-covalent interactions. So if the compounds are similar, maybe their non-covalent interactions with the stationary phase are similar, causing them to stay together.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the compounds are not eluting because they're too non-polar, so they stay in the mobile phase. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Another angle: when a chemist says the compounds are on top of each other, that implies they didn't separate during a purification step. So in a column chromatography, if two compounds have similar affinities for the stationary phase, they'll emerge together, leading to a single peak instead of two. So the issue is their similarity in how they interact.

So the problem is that the compounds have similar properties, like similar polarity, which affects their retention. So the correct answer is A, because similar polarities would cause them to not separate.

Wait, but option B says they're bonding through non-covalent interactions. If the compounds themselves are interacting with each other, like forming hydrogen bonds or something, maybe they stick together. But in chromatography, the main issue is their interaction with the stationary phase. So if their polarities are similar, they'll behave similarly during separation.

So I think the correct answer is A) The compounds have similar polarities.


The phrase "my compounds are on top of each other" suggests that the chemist is referring to a situation where compounds are not separating during a purification process, such as chromatography. In chromatography, compounds are separated based on their interactions with the stationary phase, which are influenced by their physical properties, such as polarity. If the compounds have similar polarities, they will interact similarly with the stationary phase and have similar retention times, causing them to elute together and not separate. This aligns with the chemist's observation of the compounds being "on top of each other."

Option A directly addresses this issue, as compounds with similar polarities are less likely to separate during chromatography. While non-covalent interactions (Option B) might influence compound behavior, the primary factor in chromatographic separation is the interaction with the stationary phase, which is determined by polarity. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the compounds have similar polarities.

Answer: A
