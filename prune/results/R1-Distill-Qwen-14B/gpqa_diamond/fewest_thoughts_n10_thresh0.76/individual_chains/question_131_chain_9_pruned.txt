Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem starts by talking about a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So, the structure probably has two carboxylic acid groups and a double bond that's cis (meaning the two substituents on either side of the double bond are on the same side). When this acid is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically leads to the formation of a cyclic anhydride, right? Because when you lose water from two carboxylic acid groups, they can form a ring by connecting the two oxygen atoms.

The anhydride has some specific NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. High ppm values around 7 usually indicate aromatic protons. Wait, but this is a proton NMR of an anhydride. Hmm. Wait, but maybe it's not aromatic. Oh, wait, another possibility: an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl in such a structure can resonate around 6-7 ppm. Because of the conjugation, the protons could be deshielded. So maybe the anhydride has some conjugated carbonyl groups.

Looking at the 13C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Okay, carbon-13 NMR peaks: 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to a double bond or in a conjugated system. 165 ppm is a carbonyl carbon, like a ketone or an ester or anhydride. So maybe the anhydride has a structure with a conjugated double bond next to a carbonyl. Wait, anhydrides have two carbonyl groups. So perhaps it's a cyclic anhydride where the ring is a five-membered one, like maleic anhydride. Wait, maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring with two double bondsâ€”one internal and one exo. But in this case, the starting material was a cis-alkene. So maybe the anhydride is a five-membered ring with a conjugated double bond.

Wait, when you dehydrate a cis-dicarboxylic acid, you form a cyclic anhydride. If the starting alkene was cis, the resulting anhydride would have the two carbonyl groups adjacent to each other in the ring. So for example, in maleic anhydride, the structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. The two carbonyl oxygens are part of the ring. The structure is like:

O=C-(C-O)-C=C-O=C-

Wait, no, more accurately, maleic anhydride is a cyclic structure where the oxygen atoms are part of the ring. The structure is an annulene with two carbonyl groups opposite each other, connected
