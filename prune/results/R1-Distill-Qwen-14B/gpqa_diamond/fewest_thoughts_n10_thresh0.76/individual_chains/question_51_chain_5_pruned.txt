Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step. So the question is about calculating the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere induces charges on its surface. Since the sphere is grounded, electrons can move freely, right? So the induced charges will depend on the charge q. If q is positive, the sphere will have induced negative charges, and vice versa. But since the sphere is neutral initially and grounded, the induced charges will stay on the surface.

The setup is that the charge q is at a distance d from the center of the sphere, which has a radius R. So the distance between the charge and the sphere's surface is d - R, but wait, I think that's only if the charge is outside the sphere. Oh wait, yes, because the sphere has radius R, so the center is d away from q. So the distance from q to the surface is d - R, assuming d > R. But if d is less than R, the charge would be inside the cavityâ€”wait, no, the sphere is conducting, so charges on the surface. But the problem doesn't specify if d is inside or outside, but I think in this case, the charge is outside the sphere because the sphere is conducting and grounded. Hmm, but wait, no, the problem says the charge is placed d away from the center, so d is the distance from the charge to the center. So if the sphere's radius is R, then the charge is outside the sphere if d > R.

Now, potential energy in such systems. I remember that the potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k q1 q2 / r. But in this case, it's a bit different because one of the charges is induced on a conducting sphere.

Wait, I think the method involves considering the work done to bring the charge q near the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charge will be at the surface. But how do I calculate the potential energy?

Another thought: when you bring a charge near a conductor, the conductor's induced charges create a potential. The work done in bringing the charge q into that potential is the potential energy. Alternatively, the potential energy is the work done by an external agent in assembling the system.

Wait, but the sphere is grounded,
