Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is the correct one based on the spectral data given. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that FTIR and 1H NMR were used for characterization. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak around 3000 usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong peak at 1700 is probably a carbonyl group, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But since the broad peak suggests an -OH group, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. So the compound probably has a -COOH group.

Looking at the NMR data: several signals, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. So no double bonds in the molecule, or if there are, the hydrogens on them aren't showing up, but I think that's unlikely because vinyl hydrogens usually show up in specific regions. So maybe the structure doesn't have any double bonds.

Wait, but wait. The NMR has a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me think. Splitting in NMR can tell us about neighboring protons. A doublet of triplets suggests that a proton is next to two sets of neighboring protons. Maybe it's a case of geminal coupling or something else.

Looking at the options, all of them have a COOH group, and the structures are a bit similar. Let me look at each option:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So this is like a pentyl group maybe? Wait, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So perhaps it's a gem-dialkyl group attached to a CH2COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. Structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the COOH is directly attached to the central carbon which has two C2H5 groups.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So this would be like CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH. So two isopropyl groups attached to a central carbon, then a CH2COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. The COOH is directly attached to the central carbon, which has two CH3 groups and two ethyl groups? Wait, no, the structure is CH3CH2 attached to the first C, which is connected to another C that has a CH3 and two Hs, and another C that has a CH3 and two Hs, then COOH. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, all these structures have a geminal di-substitution. Let me think about the NMR signals. The presence of multiple splitting patterns suggests that the protons are near multiple equivalent or nonequivalent protons.

The broad IR peak suggests an -OH, so it's a carboxylic acid, so the structure must have that.

In the NMR, each proton environment will have a unique signal. The signals mentioned are a doublet of triplets of quartets (let's call this a dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triple
