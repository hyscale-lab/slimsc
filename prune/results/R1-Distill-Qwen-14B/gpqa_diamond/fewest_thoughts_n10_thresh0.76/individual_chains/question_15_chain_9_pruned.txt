Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the researchers are trying to decide which planet to observe because they want the one with the highest chance of transiting. Both planets were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, both have the same mass? So, the minimum masses are equal. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has three times shorter a period than Planet_2. So, Planet_1's orbital period is like P, and Planet_2's is 3P? Or wait, no, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter, meaning P1 = P2 / 3. So if Planet_2 takes 300 days, Planet_1 would take 100 days. Right.

Both have circular orbits, so that's simpler. Now, the host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's, but both have the same radii. Interesting, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius—maybe a subgiant or something.

The question is about the probability of a transit. So, the transit probability depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. Wait, no, more specifically, the probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but I might be getting that mixed up. Let me think.

The transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective) is highest when the planet is closer to the star. Because the orbital plane needs to be edge-on for the transit. The probability increases as the planet is closer because the chances that the inclination is right are better when the orbit is tighter.

Wait, actually, the probability formula is something like (R_star / a) * (something), where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, more accurately, the transit probability is given by (R*/a) multiplied by the probability that the orbital inclination is just right (like edge-on), but the exact formula is a bit tricky.

Wait, I remember that the probability of a transit is approximately (R_star / (a * sqrt(1 - e²)) ), assuming a circular orbit, e=0. So for circular orbits, it's
