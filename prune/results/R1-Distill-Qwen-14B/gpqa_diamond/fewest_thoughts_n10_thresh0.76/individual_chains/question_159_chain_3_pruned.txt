Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that when observing a quasar in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, there's a peak at around 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. I remember that in quasars, the emission lines are broad and can tell us about the quasar's properties. But wait, the peak at 790 nm... Oh! I think that's related to the Lyman-alpha emission line. Wait, no, wait. The Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But wait, when it's observed in the near-infrared, that means it's been redshifted a lot. So the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted.

So the quasar's emission line is moving from the UV into the infrared because of the expansion of the universe. The rest wavelength of Lyman-alpha is 121.6 nm. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, we can calculate the redshift.

Redshift z is calculated by (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. Let me do that math. Observed is 790, rest is 121.6. So 790 / 121.6 is approximately 6.5. So z is about 6.5 -1 which is 5.5? Wait, let me recalculate. 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.498, so z ≈ 5.498. So z≈5.5.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar. The options are all in gigaparsecs. The universe parameters are given as Hubble constant H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ω_m=0.3, dark energy Ω_λ=0.7, and it's a flat universe (so Ω_k=0).

The comoving distance D_C is the integral from a=1 (now) to a=1/(1+z) of c/(a^2 H(a)) da. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I remember that for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance is given by a certain integral involving the scale factor a and the Hubble parameter H(a).

Alternatively, I remember that the comoving distance can be approximated using some functions based on the redshift. Oh right, there's a function called the comoving distance integrator. Let me think: the formula is D_C = (c/H0) * ∫ from 0 to z [ 1 / sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z')^3 + Ω_λ*(1+z')^3 + Ω_k*(1+z')^2) ) ] dz'

Wait, no, the dark energy density parameter is usually associated with a cosmological constant, which scales as (1+z)^3? Wait, no, no. The energy density for a cosmological constant is constant, so it doesn't change with a. But when a is different, the terms are scaled. Let me get this right.

The Friedmann equation in a flat universe is H^2 = (H0^2) [Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_λ*(1+z)^0 + Ω_k*(1+z)^2]. But since the universe is flat, Ω_m + Ω_λ + Ω_k =1. Given that Ω_k=0 here, so Ω_λ=0.7 and Ω_m=0.3.

Wait, no, no, the Friedmann equation is H^2 = H0^2 [Ω_m a^{-3} + Ω_λ a^{0} + Ω_k a^{-2}]. But since a=1/(1+z), for a given z, a is 1/(1+z). So (1+z) = 1/a, so a^{-3} is (1+z)^3. So yes, the terms in the Friedmann equation become
