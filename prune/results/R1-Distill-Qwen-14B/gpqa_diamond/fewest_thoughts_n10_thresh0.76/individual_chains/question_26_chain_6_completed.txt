Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question involves dienes reacting with cyclohexene to form a specific product. The product given is 8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. And I need to determine what reactant A is, and the order of reactivity of the dienes provided.

First, I should probably figure out the reaction type happening here. The product is an iodo compound, and cyclohexene is a diene. Wait, cyclohexene is a diene, and the product has iodine. So maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction? Because the Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile to form a six-membered ring with two new sigma bonds.

Wait, but in the product, there are two iodines at position 8,8, and a ketone at 7. So the product is a bicyclic compound with two iodines and a ketone. Let me think about the structure. Bicyclo[4.2.0]octane... So it's a bicyclic system with rings of 4 and 2 carbons? Wait no, the numbers in the bicyclo notation represent the number of carbons in each bridge. Bicyclo[4.2.0]octane would have bridges of 4, 2, and 0? Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. Wait, the bicyclo system is determined by the numbers. So for bicyclo[m.n.p], the numbers are in decreasing order, and they indicate the number of carbon atoms in each bridge. So bicyclo[4.2.0]octane would have three bridges: 4, 2, and 0. But 0- that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe it's bicyclo[4.2.0]octane, which has two bridges, but perhaps the third number is zero because it's not present? Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ring formed via a Diels-Alder reaction. So the dienophile must have the iodine and the ketone. Wait, but cyclohexene is the diene. So the dienophile would be A. So A must be something that can act as a dienophile and form a six-membered ring with cyclohexene. The product has two iodine atoms and a ketone.

Wait, the product is 8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. So position 7 is a carbonyl group, and positions 8 have two iodines. The bicyclo structure must come from the Diels-Alder reaction. So the dienophile must have a structure that includes the ketone and the two iodines.

Wait, the dienophile usually is something like a diketone, or a dihalide. But in this case, the product has a ketone and two iodines. So perhaps the dienophile is a diiodoketone? Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone with iodine substituents.

Wait, another thought: the product is bicyclic, which suggests that the dienophile must have a bridged structure. Or perhaps the dienophile is a cyclic dienophile. Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is a cyclobutane ring with iodines attached.

Wait, the product is bicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. So the bridge must come from the dienophile's structure. So perhaps the dienophile is a bicyclic compound. Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is a cyclic dienophile like cyclobutene or something similar.

Wait, but the product has a ketone and two iodines. So perhaps the dienophile is something like 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one. Because cyclohexene is the diene, and this would form a six-membered ring upon Diels-Alder. Let me see: cyclohexene (as diene) + 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one (as dienophile) would react. The dienophile has a carbonyl group and two iodines.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the Diels-Alder reaction. The dienophile is usually something like a dienophile with a double bond and electron-withdrawing groups, which make it a good dienophile. The dienophile in this case would have a carbonyl group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, and the iodines are also halogens, which can have some effect.

So, if cyclohexene (the diene) reacts with this dienophile, the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring. The product would have substituents from the dienophile. So the dienophile's substituents would be at the ends of the new six-membered ring. But in the product, the substituents are on a bridge structure. Hmm, maybe the dienophile is a bicyclic compound itself, or perhaps the cyclohexene adds in such a way that it forms a bridge.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is a cyclic dienophile, such as cyclobutene. Wait, but cyclobutene is a strained dienophile. But in this case, the dienophile has a carbonyl group and iodines.

Wait, looking at the product: bicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. So the bridge is between carbons 7 and 8, perhaps. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one. Let me think about its structure. That would be a cyclobutane ring where one of the double bonds is between C2 and C3, and there's a ketone at C1 and iodines at C4 and C4.

So when cyclohexene (the diene, four carbons) reacts with this dienophile, the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring. Wait, but cyclohexene is a six-membered diene, but wait no, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. Wait, no. Cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond between two adjacent carbons. So it's a cyclic diene. But the Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene, which cyclohexene is. So the diene is the cyclohexene, and the dienophile is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one.

Wait, but when Diels-Alder occurs between a cyclic diene and a dienophile, the product is a bicyclic structure. Because the diene is a ring, adding the dienophile would bridge it. Let me imagine: cyclohexene has a double bond between C1 and C2. The dienophile is cyclobutene with substituents. So the Diels-Alder would form a bridge between the two ends, creating a bicyclic system.

Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is a conjugated dienone with iodines. Like, perhaps it's a 1,3-diketone with iodines at certain positions.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options given for A. The options are A and B with different structures. Let's see.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one.

Option C: A is 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one.

So, which of these would be a better dienophile?

Diels-Alder dienophiles are typically electron-deficient. So a dienophile with electron-withdrawing groups is better. 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one has a ketone (which is EWG) and iodines, which are slightly EWG because they have higher electronegativity. But wait, cyclobutene itself is a strained dienophile, but with a ketone and iodines, it might be more reactive.

On the other hand, 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. That's a good dienophile because the ketone is an EWG. So that would make the dienophile more reactive.

Wait, but the product is a bicyclo structure. How would that form? Let me think about the structure of the dienophile. If the dienophile is 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one, that's an enone: O=C-CH2-I-I? Or wait, 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one would be CH2(CO)-C(I)(I). Wait, no. 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one would have the structure: O=C-CH2-CH2-I-I? No, wait, ethenone is O=C-CH2-CH2? No, ethenone is probably O=C-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, ethen-1-one would be CH2=CH-CO? No, no. Wait, the structure of ethen-1-one is CH2=CH-CO..., but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's O=C-CH2-CH2, but that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's O=C-CH2-CH2-I, but I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one is O=C-CH(I)CH2-I? No, wait, ethen-1-one would have the structure CH2=CH-CO? No, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't seem to fit. Wait, maybe I should think of it as the enone: O=C-CH2-CH2. No, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-... Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the structure right, but perhaps it's a simple alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one is (CH2)2-CO, but with iodines on the adjacent carbons. Let me correct that. 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one would have the structure O=C-CH(I)2. Wait, no, because ethenone is O=C-CH2-CH2, but that's butanone. Hmm, maybe 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one is O=C-CH(I)2. So the structure would be:

O
||
C-CH(I)2

Wait, but that would make it a three-carbon chain, perhaps. So the dienophile would be O=C-CH2-CH2, but with two iodines on the same carbon. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the Diels-Alder reaction. The dienophile needs to have a double bond and electron-withdrawing groups.

But for the product to be a bicyclo structure, perhaps the dienophile is a cyclic compound like cyclobutene with substituents. So, 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one would have a ketone at position 1 and two iodines at position 4 of a cyclobutene ring.

When cyclohexene (the diene) reacts with this dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction, the dienophile's double bond would react with the diene's conjugated system. The ketone and iodines would be substituents on the dienophile.

Wait, but in the Diels-Alder, the dienophile is the electrophilic partner. So a dienophile with EWG is more reactive. So 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one has a ketone (EWG) and two iodines, which are EWG as well. This would make it a good dienophile.

Alternatively, 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one (if it's an enone) would be a good dienophile because of the ketone, but without a ring, but maybe the ring in the dienophile would help form the bicyclic product.

So the product is 8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. Let me try to imagine the structure. The bicyclo[4.2.0]octane would have two bridges: one of four carbons, another of two, and the last bridge is zero? Hmm, maybe it's better to imagine as a bicyclo system with a seven-membered ring? No, wait, bicyclo[m.n.p] refers to the number of carbons in each bridge. Wait, maybe it's a norbornane-like structure, but with different bridge sizes.

Norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So, in this case, bicyclo[4.2.0]octane would have bridges of 4, 2, and 0? Wait, perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the bicyclo notation is [4.2.0], which would mean that the molecule has three bridges: with 4, 2, and 0 carbons. But the 0 bridge doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something, but perhaps it's a bicyclo system with two bridges of 4 and 2 carbons.

Alternatively, maybe it's a bicyclo system where the main ring has four carbons, and the bridge has two, creating a bicyclo structure.

But perhaps I should focus more on the reaction. The cyclohexene would act as the diene, and the dienophile (A) would have a structure that, when reacting, forms the bicyclic product with two iodines and a ketone.

If the dienophile is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one, then the Diels-Alder reaction would form a bicyclic structure because the diene (cyclohexene) is a six-membered ring with a double bond. Wait, no, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so it's a conjugated diene? Wait, cyclohexene is a monocyclic diene, but it's a conjugated diene because it's a single double bond.

Wait, no. Wait, a diene is a conjugated system of two double bonds adjacent to each other. So cyclohexene has a single double bond, so it's a single diene, not a conjugated diene. Wait, that's confusing. No, cyclohexene has one double bond. So for a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene must be a conjugated diene with four pi electrons. So cyclohexene can't be the diene because it has only two pi electrons (from one double bond). Oh wait, wait! No, I'm making a mistake here. The Diels-Alder reaction requires a conjugated diene, which is a four-pi-electron system. So cyclohexene is a diene with one double bond, so it's a two-pi-electron system, which isn't sufficient. Oh no! That changes things. Because then, cyclohexene can't be the diene. So perhaps the diene is the other molecule.

Wait, but the question says cyclohexene is the reactant, and A is the dienophile. Hmm. So now I'm confused because I thought cyclohexene is the diene, but if it's a single double bond, it can't be a diene. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't a Diels-Alder. What other reactions involve dienes and dienophiles? Oh, there's the Diels-Alder, but also the reverse electron demand Diels-Alder, but that's similar. Alternatively, maybe it's a [4+2] cycloaddition but with a different diene.

Wait, maybe the diene is the cyclohexene, which is a cyclic diene, but it's a single double bond. So perhaps it's not the diene but the dienophile. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the diene and dienophile mixed up.

Wait, let's think again: Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene (four pi electrons) and a dienophile (two pi electrons). So cyclohexene has a single double bond (two pi electrons), so it can't be the diene. So perhaps the other compound (A) is the diene, and cyclohexene is the dienophile.

But cyclohexene as a dienophile? That would be unusual because dienophiles are usually like electron-deficient alkenes, such as maleic anhydride. But cyclohexene is just a regular alkene, so it's a poor dienophile. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't a Diels-Alder. Let me think of other reactions involving dienes. There's the addition of dienes to carbonyl groups, like in the Michael addition or other conjugate additions. Or maybe it's an electrocyclic reaction, but that's about ring opening and closing.

Wait, another possibility is that the diene is undergoing some kind of cycloaddition, perhaps with a dienophile that's a ketone with iodine substituents.

Wait, the product has a ketone and two iodines. So perhaps the dienophile is a diiodoketone, and when it reacts with the diene (cyclohexene), forms the bicyclic product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a 1,4-conjugate addition. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is formed via a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder) where the diene is cyclohexene, but wait, that doesn't make sense because cyclohexene is a monoene. So perhaps the diene is another molecule, and the dienophile is A.

Wait, the product has a bicyclo structure, which suggests that the dienophile must have a part that allows the formation of a bridge. So maybe the dienophile is a cyclic compound, such as a cyclobutane ring with substituents.

Wait, if the dienophile is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one, then during the Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (which would have to be a conjugated diene) would attack the dienophile. So perhaps the diene in this case is something else, not cyclohexene.

Wait, but the question states that cyclohexene is the reactant, so perhaps I'm getting this wrong again. Let me re-express the problem: the given reaction is cyclohexene + A → product. So A is the dienophile, and cyclohexene is the diene. But wait, cyclohexene can't be the diene because it's not a conjugated diene. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is another molecule, and cyclohexene is the dienophile. But then A would be the diene, and cyclohexene is the dienophile.

Wait, but the product has a ketone and two iodines attached. So perhaps the dienophile (cyclohexene) isn't involved in the ketone part. Or perhaps the dienophile is something else.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Let's look at the options for A. The options are:

Option A: A is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one.

Option C: A is 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one.

I need to determine which of these would form the product when reacted with cyclohexene.

If A is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one, which is a cyclobutene ring with a ketone and two iodines, then when it reacts with cyclohexene via Diels-Alder, what would happen?

Wait, cyclobutene is a dienophile. The Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. So perhaps A is the dienophile, and the diene is another molecule, but the question says the reactant is cyclohexene. So perhaps the diene is something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't a Diels-Alder but something else. Another possibility is that A is a dienophile that can undergo addition with the diene (cyclohexene) to form a bicyclic product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Diels-Alder where the diene is a different molecule. But the question says cyclohexene is the reactant, so it must be part of the reaction.

Wait, maybe the diene is part of the dienophile. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try another angle.

The dienophile needs to have a good EWG to be reactive. 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one has a ketone (EWG) and two iodines (also EWG). So it's a good dienophile. So if cyclohexene is the diene, but wait, no, because cyclohexene isn't a conjugated diene. So perhaps the diene is actually a different molecule. Wait, but the question says cyclohexene is one of the reactants. So maybe the reaction is not Diels-Alder. Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of a different cycloaddition.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a [2+4] cycloaddition, but more likely, perhaps it's a [4+2] between cyclohexene and another diene.

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the product. The product is 8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. So in the bicyclo system, the ketone is at position 7, and the two iodines are at position 8.

So the bicyclo system must have come from the combination of the diene (cyclohexene) and the dienophile (A). If the dienophile is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one, then perhaps the reaction forms a bridge where the ketone and iodines are attached.

Alternatively, if the dienophile is 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one, which is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, then the Diels-Alder reaction would form a six-membered ring with substituents at the end. But would that give a bicyclo structure? Maybe not, unless the diene is a cyclic one.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a cyclic diene, but not a conjugated diene. Wait, no. Cyclohexene has a single double bond, so it's not a conjugated diene. Therefore, it can't act as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction.

So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the dienophile is A, and the diene is another molecule. But the question says the reactant is cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't a Diels-Alder at all. Another possibility is that the diene is undergoing some kind of addition reaction with a carbonyl compound, but that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Michael addition, but that involves a nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an example of a diene undergoing a ring-opening metathesis, but that's probably more advanced than what's being asked here.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Let me try to think about the options again. The options for A are either 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one or 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one.

Looking at the product, which has a bicyclo structure, it's more likely that the dienophile is a cyclic compound. So 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one is a cyclic dienophile, which would make the bicyclo product. So option A's A is this structure.

Now, regarding the reactivity of the dienes (B part), the options are the four dienes listed. I need to arrange them in order of reactivity from most to least reactive.

The dienes given are:

1. 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene

2. (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene

3. cyclopenta-1,3-diene

4. (2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene

Diene reactivity in Diels-Alder reactions depends on conjugation, electron-donating groups (which increase reactivity), and ring strain (which can affect reactivity).

Let me think about each diene:

1. 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene: This is a conjugated diene with two methyl groups. The methyl groups are EDGs, which activate the diene, making it more reactive. Also, it's a longer chain, which might have better orbital overlap.

2. (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene: This is a conjugated diene. The E configuration might influence reactivity, but since it's a longer chain and conjugated, it's a good diene.

3. cyclopenta-1,3-diene: This is a cyclic, conjugated diene. Because it's cyclic and has ring strain (cyclopentadiene is more reactive than open-chain dienes because of conjugation and possible diradical stability?), but wait, cyclopentadiene is actually known to be quite reactive in Diels-Alder reactions because of conjugation and ring strain. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, cyclopentadiene is less strained than cyclopropane, but compared to other dienes, cyclopentadiene is quite reactive.

4. (2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene: This is a conjugated diene but with Z configuration. Z dienes can sometimes be less reactive than E because of steric hindrance, but not always.

Wait, but in terms of general reactivity, the more substituted and conjugated the diene, the more reactive it is. Also, electron-donating groups increase reactivity.

So the dienes:

1. 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene: has methyl groups, which are EDGs. So more reactive.

3. cyclopenta-1,3-diene: cyclic, conjugated. High reactivity due to conjugation and ring strain.

2. (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene: conjugated, longer chain, but no substituents. So less reactive than 1 and maybe 3.

4. (2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene: same as 2 but Z configuration. Maybe less reactive due to steric hindrance, but not sure.

So ranking them from most to least reactive:

3. cyclopenta-1,3-diene (most reactive)

1. 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene

2. (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene

4. (2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene (least reactive)

Wait, but I've heard that the order might be cyclopentadiene is the most reactive, followed by the more substituted open-chain dienes.

Wait, another angle: in Diels-Alder reactions, the diene's reactivity can be influenced by the extent of conjugation, the electron density (EDGs increase reactivity), and any ring strain (which can make cyclic dienes more reactive).

So cyclopentadiene (3) is a conjugated diene with ring strain, making it more reactive. Then 1 has methyl groups (EDGs), making it more reactive than 2 and 4. 2 is a conjugated diene without substituents, and 4 is a conjugated diene with Z configuration, possibly less reactive than 2 due to steric hindrance.

So the order would be 3 > 1 > 2 > 4.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices for B are:

Option A: B = 3, 1, 2, 4.

Option C: B = 4, 2, 1, 3.

Others have different orders.

So the correct order is 3, 1, 2, 4.

Looking back at the options, option A's B is 3,1,2,4. So if A is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one (option A's A), and B is 3,1,2,4, then option A would fit.

But in the options, option A says A is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one, and B is 3,1,2,4. So that would fit.

But wait, another possibility: if the diene is longer, it's more reactive. So for example, longer conjugated dienes are more reactive. So hexa-2,4-diene (2 and 4) are longer than butadiene, so perhaps more reactive than 1. But 1 has methyl groups which are EDGs.

So, the order is a bit tricky. Let me think again.

Cyclopentadiene is more reactive than any open-chain diene because of its high s-cis conformation and ring strain.

Then, open-chain dienes:

Which is more reactive: 1 (buta-1,3-diene with methyl groups) or 2 (hexa-2,4-diene, E).

Methyl groups are EDGs, so 1 should be more reactive than 2.

Then, 4 is a conjugated diene but with Z configuration, which may make it less reactive than 2 because of steric hindrance.

So the order is 3 (cyclopentadiene) > 1 (butadiene with methyl) > 2 (E-hexadiene) > 4 (Z-hexadiene).

So option A's B is 3,1,2,4, which matches this order.

So, putting it all together, the correct A is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one, and the order of reactivity is 3,1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option A has A=4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one and B=3,1,2,4.

So the correct answer would be option A.


The reaction involves cyclohexene and a reactant (A) forming 8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. To determine the correct reactant (A) and the reactivity order of the dienes, the following analysis was conducted:

### Reactant (A)
The product is a bicyclic compound with a ketone and two iodines. This suggests that the reactant (A) must be a dienophile capable of forming a bicyclic structure via a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder reaction). Two options for A were considered:

1. **4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one**: This is a cyclic dienophile with a ketone and two iodines, both of which are electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs), making it a strong dienophile. Its cyclic nature would facilitate the formation of the bicyclic product.
2. **2,2-diiodoethen-1-one**: This is an α,β-unsaturated ketone with iodines. While it is a good dienophile due to the ketone, it lacks the cyclic structure necessary to form the bicyclic product.

Given the bicyclic nature of the product, **4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one** is the most suitable reactant (A).

### Reactivity of the Dienes
The reactivity of the dienes in Diels-Alder reactions depends on factors such as conjugation, electron-donating groups (EDGs), and ring strain. The dienes provided are:

1. **2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene**: A conjugated diene with methyl groups (EDGs), increasing its reactivity.
2. **(2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene**: A conjugated diene without substituents, less reactive than 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene.
3. **cyclopenta-1,3-diene**: A cyclic, conjugated diene with significant ring strain, making it highly reactive.
4. **(2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene**: A conjugated diene with Z-configuration, which may experience steric hindrance, making it the least reactive.

Based on these considerations, the reactivity order is:

**3 (cyclopenta-1,3-diene) > 1 (2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene) > 2 (2E,4E-hexa-2,4-diene) > 4 (2Z,4Z-hexa-2,4-diene).**

### Final Answer
The correct reactant (A) is **4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one**, and the reactivity order of the dienes is **3 > 1 > 2 > 4**. This matches **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
