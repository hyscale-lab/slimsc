Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, wait. Let me read the question again. Oh, right, the operator P is given, and I need to find the eigenvector for a specific eigenvalue. Hmm. The operator P is a vector operator, with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

So, the operator P is a vector operator, meaning P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z. So in terms of matrices, P would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding unit vector. But wait, no—the components themselves are matrices. So P as an operator would be P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, but wait, each component is given as (ħ/2) times a Pauli matrix.

Wait, let's think. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So looking at the given P components:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] which is exactly (ħ/2) σ_x.

Same for P_y: (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]] which is (ħ/2) σ_y.

P_z is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]] which is (ħ/2) σ_z.

So the operator P is equal to (ħ/2)(σ_x x + σ_y y + σ_z z) ... Wait no, that's not right. Wait, no, the operator P is the vector operator, but in this case, the components are given as the matrices. So the operator P is the sum of P_x x_hat + P_y y_hat + P_z z_hat. But wait, no, because each component is already a matrix.

Wait, perhaps P is a vector operator whose components are the given matrices. So each component P_i is (ħ/2) σ_i.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The operator they're referring to is P · n, where n is the direction vector. Because the operator in the direction n would be the component of P along n, which is P · n.

So the operator we're interested in is P · n, where n is in the x-z plane. So n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π, perhaps? Wait no, the x-z plane is the y=0 plane, so the angle φ is either 0 or π. Wait, no, actually, the x-z plane is where y=0, so the direction vector n would have components (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1. So n can be written as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

Wait, but the problem says the direction is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so n could be (cosθ, 0, sinθ), with θ varying from 0 to π/2 for x-z plane? Or perhaps θ is measured from the x-axis? Hmm, maybe it's better to just denote n as (a, 0, b), where a² + b² =1.

But perhaps for solving the problem, the specific direction isn't needed because the eigenvector is determined by the spin-1/2 system. Since the operator is a spin operator.

Wait, given that P is a spin operator, the eigenstates are spin-up and spin-down along the direction n. The eigenvalues would be ±ħ/2.

The question asks for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we need to find the normalized eigenvector for the operator P · n.

So P · n is (P_x a + P_z b) since n has components (a, 0, b). So the operator is (a P_x + b P_z).

So substituting the given matrices:

P_x = (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P · n = (ħ/2) [ a [[0,1], [1,0]] + b [[1,0], [0,-1]] ]

Which simplifies to (ħ/2) [ [b, a], [a, -b] ]

So the matrix for the operator is (ħ/2) * [[b, a], [a, -b]]

Wait, let me recheck:

a P_x + b P_z = a*(ħ/2)σ_x + b*(ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)(a σ_x + b σ_z)

Which becomes (ħ/2) * [ [b, a], [a, -b] ].

So yes, that's correct.

The eigenvalues of this matrix are ± (ħ/2) sqrt(a² + b²), but since a² + b² =1 (because n is a unit vector), the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which makes sense.

We're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So to find the eigenvector, we set up the equation:

( (ħ/2) [[b, a], [a, -b]] ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Divide both sides by (ħ/2) to get:

[[b, a], [a, -b]] |ψ> = |ψ>

So, the matrix equation is:

b ψ₁ + a ψ₂ = ψ₁
a ψ₁ - b ψ₂ = ψ₂

Wait, no, more accurately, the matrix multiplied by the vector [ψ₁; ψ₂] equals the same vector multiplied by 1.

So:

b ψ₁ + a ψ₂ = ψ₁
a ψ₁ - b ψ₂ = ψ₂

Let me write the equations:

Equation 1: (b -1) ψ₁ + a ψ₂ = 0
Equation 2: a ψ₁ + (-b -1) ψ₂ = 0

Hmm, wait, let me correct that. Let's write the matrix equation:

[ [b, a], [a, -b] ] [ψ₁; ψ₂] = [ψ₁; ψ₂]

So each component:

b ψ₁ + a ψ₂ = ψ₁ → (b -1) ψ₁ + a ψ₂ = 0 → equation (1)
a ψ₁ - b ψ₂ = ψ₂ → a ψ₁ + (-b -1) ψ₂ = 0 → equation (2)

So from equation (1): (b-1) ψ₁ + a ψ₂ = 0
From equation (2): a ψ₁ + (-b-1) ψ₂ = 0

So we can write this as a system of linear equations. Let's denote ψ = [ψ₁; ψ₂], and the system is M ψ = 0, where M is the matrix:

[ (b-1)    a      ]
[ a        (-b-1) ]

The eigenvectors are non-trivial solutions, so the determinant of M must be zero. But wait, that's only when the matrix is singular, but in this case, I'm solving for the eigenvector, so I can pick one equation and express one variable in terms of the other.

Taking equation (1): (b-1) ψ₁ + a ψ₂ =0 → ψ₂ = [(1 - b)/(a)] ψ₁

But a and b are components of the unit vector, so a² + b² =1. Let's see if this condition holds.

Let me express ψ₂ in terms of ψ₁: ψ₂ = [(1 - b)/a] ψ₁

This gives us the ratio of ψ₂ to ψ₁, which will determine the direction of the eigenvector.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [1; (1 - b)/a ] multiplied by some normalization factor.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to parameterize the direction vector n. Since n is in the x-z plane, let's say n = (cos θ, 0, sin θ), where θ is the angle from the x-axis towards the z-axis. So a = cos θ and b = sin θ.

Wait, no, if θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, then a would be sinθ and b cosθ. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the direction vector as (a,0,b), where a = cosθ and b = sinθ, making the angle θ from the z-axis. Or the other way around. Well, in any case, the components a and b satisfy a² + b² =1.

Wait, perhaps for the sake of solving, I can choose n as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), so then a = cosθ and b = sinθ.

So substituting into the expression for ψ₂:

ψ₂ = [ (1 - b) / a ] ψ₁ = [1 - sinθ] / cosθ * ψ₁.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1; (1 - sinθ)/cosθ ]

Wait, that's for the case where n is (a,0,b) = (cosθ, 0, sinθ). Hmm. Let me see if this makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I should simplify this expression. Let's see:

(1 - sinθ)/cosθ = [ (1 - sinθ) ] / cosθ.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sinθ):

(1 - sin²θ) / [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ) ]

Which is (cos²θ) / [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ) ] → cosθ / (1 + sinθ )

So (1 - sinθ)/cosθ = cosθ/(1 + sinθ).

So the ratio ψ₂/ψ₁ = cosθ/(1 + sinθ).

Hmm, but perhaps another approach is to rotate the spin state into the direction of n. The eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along n, which can be represented by spherical harmonics or using the rotation matrices.

Another approach is to use the fact that the eigenstates of S·n are |+> and |->, which can be written in terms of the eigenstates of S_z.

The eigenstates for spin-up along direction n (theta from z-axis) are given by:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓>

But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi (the azimuthal angle) is 0. So phi =0, so e^{i phi} =1.

So the spin-up state along n is:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + sin(theta/2) |↓>

Expressed as a vector, this is [ cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, that's the standard expression for the spin-up state along a direction making an angle theta from the z-axis.

So the normalized eigenvector would have elements cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), right?

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but wait, the answer options have different structures.

Option C: ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ) which matches exactly.

Wait, but looking at the problem statement, the operator is P, which is the spin operator, so the eigenvector is indeed the spin-up state, which is as I described.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the components of P are given as (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which matches with the spin-1/2 system.

So the spin-up state along n is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which would be the normalized eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue ħ/2.

So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Looking at the options, option C is exactly this: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So the answer should be option C.

But wait, let me double-check. The problem states that the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi is 0. So when I write the spin-up state, it's indeed [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So yes, option C is correct.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is a spin operator, with components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ given as $(\hbar/2)$ times the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$, respectively. The direction $\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, so it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\cos\theta, 0, \sin\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \cos\theta \sigma_x + \sin\theta \sigma_z \right).
\]

Substituting the Pauli matrices, this becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \sin\theta & \cos\theta \\ \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This simplifies to the system of equations:

\[
\left( \sin\theta - 1 \right)\psi_1 + \cos\theta \psi_2 = 0, \quad \cos\theta \psi_1 + \left( -\sin\theta - 1 \right)\psi_2 = 0.
\]

From the first equation, solving for $\psi_2$ in terms of $\psi_1$ gives:

\[
\psi_2 = \frac{\cos\theta}{1 - \sin\theta} \psi_1.
\]

The eigenvector can be written as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \end{bmatrix} \propto \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{\cos\theta}{1 - \sin\theta} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Simplifying further, using trigonometric identities, the normalized eigenvector for the spin-up state along $\vec{n}$ is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches the standard form of the spin-up state along a direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.**
