Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think this through. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are A to D, each being 1 over plx to some power.

Wait, what's parallax? Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to Earth's orbit around the Sun. The closer the star, the larger the parallax. So, parallax (in arcseconds) and distance (in parsecs) are inversely related: plx = 1/distance.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So if we have a range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range?

Since stars are uniformly distributed, I guess it means that their number density in space is uniform, right? So more stars would be in larger volume regions, but their distribution is uniform in space, not necessarily on the sky.

Wait, but the question is about per unit range of parallax. So I need to relate the number of stars in a certain range of parallax to the parallax itself.

Let me think about how distance relates to parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So as plx increases, the distance decreases. So higher parallax means closer stars.

If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n is constant. So the number of stars in a volume V would be N = n * V.

But how does the volume relate to parallax? Let's imagine a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr. The volume of that shell is 4πd² dr. But wait, since the parallax is plx = 1/d, dr is the change in distance. Let me express dr in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign is because as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're dealing with absolute volumes, perhaps the sign doesn't matter here.

So the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2) ). Wait, let me double-check. If d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting, the volume is 4π (d)^2 dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² dplx). The negative just indicates direction, but since we're considering the magnitude, it's 4π (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recast it. The volume between plx and plx + dplx would correspond to the distance d = 1/plx. The shell's volume is 4π d² dr. But dr is the change in d when plx changes by dplx. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting d=1/plx, dr =
