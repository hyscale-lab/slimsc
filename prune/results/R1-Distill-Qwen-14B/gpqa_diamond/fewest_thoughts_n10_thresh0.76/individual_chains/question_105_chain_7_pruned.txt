Alright, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, okay, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects its brightness variations, which could mimic an exoplanet. I need to find the radius of a hypothetical planet that would cause the same brightness change as these spots.

The given data: the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so Rstar is the same as R_sun. The star's effective temperature is 6000K. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000Kâ€”so their temperature is 5000K, right?

The problem says that when one hemisphere is spotty, the photometric observations show brightness variations due to rotation. But if the star wasn't spotted, what planet radius would cause the same signal in the light curve? So I'm comparing the brightness dip from a planet transit to the brightness dip from the spots.

Wait, but how does the brightness dip from spots work? Oh, right, when a spot is on the visible side, it makes the star appear slightly dimmer because the spot is colder. But the spot is only on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spot comes into view and then goes away. 

But wait, the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into and go out of view, modulating the brightness. So the maximum variation would be when the spots are fully visible or hidden. Since the filling factor is 20%, which is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. Oh, right, the filling factor (f) is the area of the spots divided by the total area of the star.

Wait, the star's one hemisphere is covered. No, wait, the question says one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the total area covered by spots is 20% of the star's surface area? Or 20% of half the star's surface? Hmm, wait, filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface area that is covered by spots. So a filling factor of 20% means 20% of the entire star's surface is covered by spots. But since it's one hemisphere, maybe the
