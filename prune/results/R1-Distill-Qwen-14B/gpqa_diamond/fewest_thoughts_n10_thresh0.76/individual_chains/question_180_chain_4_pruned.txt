Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because electrostatics isn't my strongest suit, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about calculating the minimum energy of an isolated system of charges. Let me read it again. There are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Twelve of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system correct to three decimals.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Since like charges repel, the energy will be positive. But wait, wait. The problem says 13 charges. Twelve are at 2 meters from P, and one is at P. So, the 13th is fixed at P. So, the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P.

Wait, but wait—since all 12 are at 2 meters, are they arranged in a way that each is 2 meters from P, but what about their mutual distances? Because if they're all at 2 meters from P, maybe they're arranged on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters. So, the distance between any two of them would depend on the angle between them, but perhaps for the minimal energy, we can assume that their mutual distances are such that the potential energy from their interactions is minimized? Or wait, no. Wait, since all the charges are positive (each is 2e), they would repel each other. So, arranging them as far apart as possible would minimize the potential energy. But wait, in this scenario, the charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, so their mutual distances can't be changed—they are fixed. So, the minimum energy configuration would be when they are placed as far apart as possible given the constraints, but perhaps in this problem, their positions are fixed, so we can't change the mutual distances. So, the system's potential energy is only from the interactions between the charges at 2 meters and the one at P, plus the interactions among the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says the system is
