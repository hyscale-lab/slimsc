Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the setup is about two planets orbiting a star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is transiting its star. The star's radius is 1.5 times that of the Sun. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. Now, there's a second planet with a radius of 2.5 Earth radii, and we need to find the maximum orbital period it can have so that it also transits and occults, assuming it's in the same orbital plane and has a circular orbit.

Hmm, wait. Transiting means the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, and occultation would be when the planet is behind the star, so we can't see its light. But for both events to happen, the planet's orbital plane must be aligned such that we see these events. But the question says they share the same orbital plane, so that part is satisfied.

The key here is about orbital periods. I remember that planets farther from the star have longer orbital periods (Kepler's third law). So, the second planet could be either closer or farther than the first. But since the first has a 3-day period, the second's period must be longer than that if it's farther, or shorter if it's closer.

Wait, but the question is asking for the maximum possible period for the second planet to still have both transit and occultation events. So I think the maximum period would be when the second planet is just at the point where it can still both transit and be occulted. But how do transits and occultations affect the period?

Wait, maybe it's about the Hill sphere or something related to orbital stability. No, maybe not. Another thought: For a planet to transit, it has to pass in front of the star, so the orbital plane must be edge-on. But the problem states they share the same orbital plane, so the second planet's orbit is also edge-on. So, the question is about the maximum period such that the second planet can transit.

Wait, but the second planet has a larger radius (2.5 Earth radii) compared to the first (1 Earth radius). How does that affect anything? Maybe the transit depth is larger, but the question is more about orbital periods.

Wait, perhaps this is
