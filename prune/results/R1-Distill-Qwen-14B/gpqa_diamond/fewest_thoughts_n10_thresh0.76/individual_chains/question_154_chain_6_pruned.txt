Okay, so I've got this problem here where a chemist found an unnamed white solid, and I need to figure out what it is using the spectral data provided. The options are four different compounds: A, B, C, D. Let me go through each piece of data step by step and see what I can deduce.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, molecular ions with higher m/z than the main peak usually make me think of adducts or maybe isobars, but given that the molecular formula might have a chlorine, because the options include chloro compounds. Wait, chlorine has an atomic mass of about 35.5. Let me think: if the molecular ion is at 156, and there's a peak at 158, that's 2 mass units higher. Chlorine has an isotope Cl-35 and Cl-37. So maybe the main peak is the M (Cl-35) and the M+2 is Cl-37? So the molecular formula probably includes one Cl atom. Let me check the options. All options except maybe A and B? Let's see. Option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That would have a Cl. Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Cl in that as well. C is Phenyl chloroformate. Also has Cl. D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid, which also has Cl. So all options except perhaps any without Cl, but looking at the options, all have Cl except maybe I'll check.

Wait, the molecular ion is 156. Let me think about the molecular formulas. Let me calculate the molecular weight for each option.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is Cl attached to the benzene ring at position 3, hydroxyl at position 2, and a formyl (CHO) group. So molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: C=12*7=84, H=5=5, Cl=35.5, O=2*16=32. So 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. Hmm, the molecular ion is 156. So maybe this is the M+ peak? Wait, because Cl has an average atomic weight around 35.5, so the exact mass of M would be 156.5, but in mass spec, usually the integer masses are considered. So if the molecular ion is at 156, and another at 158, that would fit with Cl being present because the Cl-35 is 35, Cl-37 is 37. So the M for Cl-35 would be 156.5, but in mass spec, it's rounded to 157 maybe?
