Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure out the steps.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 could be either propene or propyne or maybe cyclopropane? Wait, but the reaction sequence might help. It undergoes bromination in CCl4 to form Compound B. Oh, right, bromination in CCl4 is a typical addition reaction for alkenes. So if A is C3H6 and it's reacting this way, then A must be propene (propylene), because propene would add bromine in a di addition. Because cyclopropane wouldn't react the same way, and propyne would undergo a different kind of addition, maybe a substitution or something else. So A is propene, so its structure is CH2=CH2CH3? Wait, no: propene is CH2=CHCH3, right. So when you add bromine (Br2 in CCl4), it would undergo an addition reaction. So the double bond would open, adding Br across it. So Compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, propene has three carbons. So when Br2 adds, it would give 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, no. Wait, wait: propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, no: the structure of propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds across the double bond, it would add on the two central carbons. So the product would be CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Or wait, no, maybe the addition is across the double bond, so the two middle carbons each get a Br. So the structure would be CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, wait: wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When Br2 adds, each of the two carbons in the double bond gets a Br. So the product would be CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Wait no, that canâ€™t be right. Because adding Br2 to propene would give 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, the initial structure is CH2=CHCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Adding Br2 would add across C1 and C2, so the structure would be CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, that would be 1,2-dibromopropane. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so this is likely an elimination reaction. So 1,2-dibromopropane would lose two HBr molecules. Wait, but wait, 1,2-dibromopropane has Br on adjacent carbons. So when KOH (alcoholic) is added, it should cause dehydrohalogenation. Let me think: the reaction would likely eliminate HBr twice. Each Br could be removed, leading to
