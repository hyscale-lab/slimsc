Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. It looks like two separate reactions, and I need to find out what the major products A and B are. Then, choose the correct option from the given choices.

The first reaction is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH, and then H+. Hmm, I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH is a strong base, like a source of alkali metal. So, this must be some kind of elimination or maybe a ring-forming reaction.

Wait, the starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro means two rings connected by a single atom, right? So the molecule has a 5-membered ring and a 3-membered ring? Or wait, the spiro is [3.5], so one ring is 3 carbons and the other is 5. Let me draw it mentally. The 1-vinyl group is attached to the spiro atom. So, the structure is a spiro compound with a double bond as well.

When you treat an alcohol with a strong base like KH, which is potassium hydride, it's typically deprotonated. But wait, in this case, the alcohol is a 1-ol, so the hydroxyl is on a carbon adjacent to a double bond. Maybe it's more about an elimination. Because when you have an alcohol, especially a secondary or tertiary one, and you have a strong base, it can lead to elimination reactions, forming alkenes or maybe other structures.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the base abstracts the hydroxyl proton, making an alkoxide, which could then undergo some kind of ring-forming process. Since the molecule is a spiro compound, perhaps a Cope elimination or some kind of electrocyclic reaction? Or maybe a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement?

Wait, another thought. The structure has a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the spiro atom. So, when you deprotonate the alcohol, you make an alkoxide. Then, maybe that leaves, leading to a carbocation? But wait, the molecule is in a spiro arrangement, so any ring strain might influence where the reaction occurs.

Wait, the reaction is done with THF, which is a good solvent for such reactions. Then, after the base, they add H+. So, maybe
