Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when light moves through different media, its speed changes based on the refractive index. But wait, the glass is also moving relative to the lab frame. Oh right, that's probably where the complication comes in.

So the setup is this: there's a glass with index of refraction n, and it's moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving toward the observer as well. Wait, no, the beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, no. The glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is propagating through it in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So the light is going through the glass, and the glass is moving towards the observer. So let's clarify: the glass is moving in the direction of the light beam, but I think the problem says the glass is moving toward the observer, but the beam is in the same direction as the glass's velocity. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

"A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory." Hmm, wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and toward the observer. That's a bit conflicting. Oh wait, perhaps it's moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light beam is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is also moving towards the observer, but the beam is passing through the glass that is itself moving towards the observer.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of frames of reference. So the lab frame is where the glass is moving at velocity v. The glass is a medium with refractive index n. The light is moving through this glass in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, but in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light would be c/n
