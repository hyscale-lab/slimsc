Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the product formed when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me start by analyzing the given data.

First, the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which is a broad range, probably indicating O-H or N-H stretches. But since the other IR peaks are around 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm⁻¹, I think the 3400-2500 is more likely an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid or maybe an alcohol. The 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 might be aromatic C=C stretches.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 1H). A peak around 10 ppm is usually indicative of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are around 9-10. Also, a broad peak might suggest exchange with water, but another possibility is a carboxylic acid - the -COOH proton. Wait, but carboxylic acids are usually broader and maybe a bit downfield, but it's possible. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton like from an aromatic ring with substituents, but that's less likely. So maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) look like a pair of doublets, which suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The integration is 2H each, so it's probably a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other. The coupling in each is doublet, so perhaps it's a para substitution, like two substituents on the benzene, each with their own coupling.

The next peak is at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That might be a methylene or methine proton next to an electronegative group. Maybe a CH adjacent to a carbonyl, like in a ketone or ester. Or perhaps a CH in an isopropyl group or something similar.

Then, 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) suggests maybe a CH2 group next to something else, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl or another CH group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of three hydrogens, maybe a methyl group attached to something else, like a CH(CH3). Wait, a doublet with 3H is a CH2-CH3 perhaps, but wait, doublet for 3H would typically be a methyl adjacent to a CH, like in (CH2)2CH3? Or maybe a geminal group, like in isobutyl. Wait, 1.4 ppm is a bit upfield for a CH2CH2CH3 group, but maybe it's a methyl group attached to a CH that's part of a branch.

The last NMR peak is at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which is a triplet, probably a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain. So maybe a CH2CH3 at the end of a longer chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group (from the IR 1720 cm⁻¹) and a chain. The IR also has a peak around 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ which are indicative of aromatic ring stretching, so the compound has an aromatic ring.

Wait, the IR also has a broad peak between 3400-2500 cm⁻¹. If it's a carboxylic acid,
