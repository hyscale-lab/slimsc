Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky because it involves both acids and a base. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe I should first calculate the moles of each acid and base and see how much of each is left after neutralization.

Let me start by writing down the given information. There's 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, which is acetic acid. Then, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, which is a strong acid. Lastly, 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? Because group 2 hydroxides like Ba(OH)2 are typically strong bases. So when we mix all these together, the HCl and Ba(OH)2 will react, and then the excess will react with the acetic acid. But I need to handle this step by step.

First, I should calculate the moles of each component. Moles are calculated as Molarity multiplied by Volume in liters. So let's do that.

For CH3COOH (acetic acid):
Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L
Molarity = 0.1 M
Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl:
Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L
Molarity = 0.2 M
Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2:
Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L
Molarity = 0.3 M
Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 dissociates into BaÂ²+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

So the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely into H+ and Cl^- ions. So moles of H+ from HCl are 0.08.

The reaction between H+ and OH- will produce water. The neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)2 is a neutralization reaction.

So the H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react. Let's figure out which is in excess.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08
Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18
So OH- is in excess. The excess OH- will determine the basicity of the solution, but wait, maybe I should consider all
