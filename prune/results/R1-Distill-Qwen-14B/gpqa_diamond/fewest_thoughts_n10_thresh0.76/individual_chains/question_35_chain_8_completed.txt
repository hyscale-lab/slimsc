Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem states that Ay is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So, let me write that down.

So, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. And Ay = c * S, with c = h/(4π). So, substituting c, Ay would be (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] which is [[0, -i h/(4π)], [i h/(4π), 0]]. 

Wait, but what's the point of this? Oh right, because I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Eigenvalues are the possible results you can get when measuring the Y-component of angular momentum for a muon.

So, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue. So, I need to solve this equation. Alternatively, since S is given, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues of S first and then scale them by c.

Wait, because Ay = c * S. So, if λ is an eigenvalue of S, then a = c * λ is the eigenvalue of Ay. So, perhaps I should first find the eigenvalues of S.

To find the eigenvalues of S, I can compute the trace and determinant. The trace of S is 0 + 0 = 0. The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i²) . Wait, i squared is -1, so -i² is 1. So determinant is 1. 

The characteristic equation for a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]] is λ² - (a+d)λ + (ad - bc) = 0. So for S:

λ² - (trace) λ + det = 0 → λ² + 1 = 0 (since trace is 0, and det is 1). So λ² = -1 → λ = ±i. 

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues of S are i and -i. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c * (i) and c * (-i). Since c is h/(4π), that gives a = i h/(4π) and a = -i h/(4π). 

Wait, but the options are talking about real and imaginary parts. So, for the eigenvalues of Ay, a is purely imaginary. So, a = i (h/(4π)) → the real part is zero, and the imaginary part is h/(4π). Similarly, the other eigenvalue has imaginary part -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. The options A and B are talking about the eigenvalues having both real and imaginary parts. But according to my calculation, the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So options A and B can't be correct because they say the eigenvalues have both real and imaginary parts. So, that rules out A and B.

So then, looking at options C and D. Let me think about what each says.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the square of the angular momentum (A^2) commutes with each component. So, if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it must also be an eigenstate of A^2. But does it have to be an eigenstate of Az? No, because Ay and Az don't commute. So, a state can't be an eigenstate of both Ay and Az simultaneously. So, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C says the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az. That sounds correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the basis functions would typically be the eigenvectors. So, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis for the operator. But wait, the matrix is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis. So, any vector can be expressed as a combination of these eigenvectors. So, in that sense, the eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator. So, option D seems to be correct as well.

Wait, but I'm not sure. The statement says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Well, the matrix operator Ay is 2x2, and its eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So, any vector in that space can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors. So that would make D correct. But I thought C was correct as well.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct? Or am I missing something?

Wait, let me think again. The question is, during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Since A^2 commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A^2. So that statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. Wait, the matrix Ay is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis for the 2-dimensional space. So yes, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions of the operator. So D is also correct.

Hmm, that's confusing. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, the operator is 2x2, so it's acting on a 2-dimensional space. The matrix S is like the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by a factor. So, the eigenvectors of S (and hence Ay) would form a basis for this space. So, option D is correct.

But wait, the question is about the correctness during the calculation. So perhaps D is correct because when you diagonalize Ay, the eigenvectors form the basis.

But I'm a bit confused. Let's think about other aspects.

Wait, another approach: For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors can form a basis. So, if Ay is diagonalizable, then the space is the direct sum of the eigenspaces. So, in this case, since it's 2x2 and has two distinct eigenvalues (i and -i leading to a = i c and a = -i c), it is diagonalizable. So the eigenvectors form a basis. So, D is correct.

But then, what about C? If the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A^2, which they are because A^2 commutes with Ay, so yes, same eigenfunctions. So, C is correct.

Wait, so the options C and D seem both correct. But the question gives only one correct option. So perhaps my analysis is wrong.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the operator is represented by a matrix in that basis. So, if you have a basis of eigenvectors, then the matrix in that basis would be diagonal. So, yes, the eigenvectors form the basis for the operator. So D is correct.

Now, looking at the options again, perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options only allow for one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalues. Let me recalculate S's eigenvalues.

The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The trace is 0. The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - ( - (-1) )? Wait, (-i)(i) is -i^2 = -(-1)=1. So determinant is 0 - ( (-i)*(i) ) = 0 - (1) = -1? Wait, wait a second.

Wait, no. Let's compute the determinant properly. For S, the (1,2) element is -i, and (2,1) is i. So determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i * i) = 0 - (-i²). i squared is -1, so this is 0 - ( - (-1) )? Wait, no.

Wait, (-i)(i) = (-1)(i^2) = (-1)(-1) = 1. So determinant is 0 - (1) = -1? Wait, earlier I thought it was +1, but that's incorrect.

Wait, no, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - [ (-i) * i ] = 0 - [ (-i^2) ] = 0 - [ (- (-1) ) ] → 0 - (1) → determinant is -1.

Wait, so that flips the calculation. So the characteristic equation is λ² - (trace)*λ + det = 0. Trace is 0, so equation is λ² + (-1) = 0 → λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

Wait, that's a big mistake I made earlier. So the eigenvalues of S are 1 and -1.

Wait, that changes everything. So, then, the eigenvalues of Ay, which is c*S, would be c*1 and c*(-1). Since c is h/(4π), that gives a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

So, the eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π). Both are real numbers, no imaginary parts. So, real eigenvalues.

Wait, so then looking back at the options.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2π h, real parts ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real here. So A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. Also wrong, because our eigenvalues are real and proportional to h/(4π).

So options A and B are out.

Now, option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az. But since A^2 is the square of the angular momentum, and it commutes with Ay, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A^2. But they can't be eigenfunctions of Az, since Ay and Az don't commute. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. I'm not so sure. Because the basis functions for a matrix are any set of vectors that span the space. The eigenvectors of Ay would form an orthogonal basis if they are distinct. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are indeed the basis for the operator. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So which of C and D is correct.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, the eigenvalues of S are ±1, so Ay has ± c as eigenvalues.

So, the eigenfunctions of Ay are vectors in 2D space. So, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis (if they are distinct, which they are here). So, D is correct.

So, the question is, which of the options is correct?

Wait, but the matrix S I thought earlier had a determinant of 1, but now I think it's -1. Let me compute S's determinant again.

Wait, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - ( (-i)(i) ) = 0 - ( -i² ) → i² is -1, so this is 0 - ( -(-1) ) → 0 - (1) → determinant is -1. So, I was wrong earlier, determinant is -1, so the eigenvalues are sqrt(1) → ±1. So, eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

So, the eigenvalues of Ay are c*1 and c*(-1), which are c and -c. Since c = h/(4π), then a = ± h/(4π). So, the eigenvalues are real. So, the eigenfunctions are real? Not necessarily, but the eigenvalues are real.

Now, for the eigenvectors. Let's find them.

For eigenvalue λ = 1 of S: solving (S - I) v = 0.

S - I = [[0-1, -i], [i, 0-1]] → [[-1, -i], [i, -1]].

We can write the equations:

-1*v1 - i*v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ -i, 1 ].

Similarly, for λ = -1: S + I = [[1, -i], [i, 1]].

Equations: 1*v1 -i v2 =0 → v1 = i v2.

Eigenvector is [i,1].

So, the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [i, 1 ].

Wait, but these are eigenvectors for S. So, for Ay, which is c*S, the eigenvectors are the same since scaling the operator doesn't change the eigenvectors, just the eigenvalues.

So, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are these vectors. So, any vector can be expressed in terms of these eigenvectors, so they form a basis. So option D is correct.

So, the correct statements are C and D? But the options only have one correct answer.

Wait, the question says which statement is correct. So, perhaps both C and D are correct, but maybe only one is.

Let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az. So, A^2 and Ay commute, so yes. Az and Ay don't commute, so eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So, the basis functions are the eigenvectors, which are the eigenfunctions. So D is correct.

Wait, but if the question allows only one correct option, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me read the options again.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So, the matrix operator is represented in the basis of its eigenfunctions. So, yes, because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So, D is correct.

But then both C and D are correct. That can't be, because it's a multiple-choice question. So, perhaps I'm missing something in the options.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the operator is Ay = c * S. So, S is given, and Ay is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvectors of Ay are the same as those of S, since c is a scalar. So, the eigenfunctions are the same. So, the statement in D is correct.

Now, let's reevaluate the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A². Yes, because A² commutes with Ay, so an eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So, C is correct.

Hm, so both C and D are correct statements. But the options don't allow that. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the statement in D is incorrect. Because, in quantum mechanics, the basis functions are the position eigenstates or something else, depending on the representation. But in this case, the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form the basis. So, D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the basis of the operator, not the space. Wait, the operator is a matrix, so its basis is the standard basis. But if the eigenvectors are the basis, then D is correct.

Wait, perhaps the actual correct answer is C. Because, the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

So, the correct options are C and D, but I can only choose one. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps during the calculation, the correct statement is that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator (D), because the eigenvectors form the basis in which the operator is diagonal. So, in that case, D is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about each option.

Which of the options is correct?

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not Az.

Yes, because A^2 commutes with Ay, so same eigenfunctions. But Az and Ay don't commute, so they can't share eigenfunctions.

So, option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So, the operator is represented by the matrix in that basis. So, in the eigenbasis, the matrix is diagonal. So, the eigenvectors are the basis, so D is correct.

Wait, but the question says which statement is correct during the calculation, so perhaps both are correct, but the options don't allow that. So, perhaps I have to look for which option is correct.

But the options given are A, B, C, D. Let's read the options again.

The options are:

A) Eigenvalue imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π).

B) Eigenvalue imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1.

C) Eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

D) Eigenfunctions φ are basis functions of Ay.

So, since I found the eigenvalues are real (±h/(4π)), options A and B are out.

Between C and D, both seem correct. But perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, another angle: the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So, let's see each option based on the eigenvalue and eigenvector calculation.

Wait, from the calculation, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which are real. So, the eigenfunctions are real? No, wait, the eigenfunctions for S are [ -i, 1 ] and [i, 1 ], which are complex. So, the eigenfunctions are complex vectors.

But the eigenfunctions can be normalized, perhaps. But the point is, the eigenfunctions are not real.

So, in option D, the statement is that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So, the matrix in that basis would be diagonal. So, yes, that's correct. So, D is correct.

I think I'm getting stuck between C and D. But perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps option C is correct because it's talking about A^2 and Az, which are different components.

But I think the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D.

I'm a bit confused, but I think the correct answer is C.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix with the first row \( (0, -i) \) and the second row \( (i, 0) \). The eigenvalue equation is \( A_y \phi = a \phi \), where \( a \) is the eigenvalue and \( \phi \) is the eigenfunction. The task is to determine which statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( A_y \) is correct.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( S \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is given as:
     \[
     S = \begin{bmatrix}
     0 & -i \\
     i & 0
     \end{bmatrix}.
     \]
   - The trace of \( S \) is \( 0 \), and the determinant is \( -1 \) (computed as \( (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = -1 \)).
   - The characteristic equation is \( \lambda^2 - (\text{trace})\lambda + (\text{determinant}) = 0 \), which simplifies to \( \lambda^2 - 1 = 0 \). Thus, the eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \lambda = \pm 1 \).

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are scaled by \( c \). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are:
     \[
     a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
     \]
   - These eigenvalues are real, not complex, which eliminates options \( A \) and \( B \), as they incorrectly describe the eigenvalues as having both real and imaginary parts.

3. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - For \( S \), the eigenvectors corresponding to \( \lambda = 1 \) and \( \lambda = -1 \) are found to be proportional to \( [-i, 1] \) and \( [i, 1] \), respectively.
   - These eigenvectors are also the eigenvectors of \( A_y \), as scaling the operator by a constant does not change the eigenvectors.

4. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option \( C \):** The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).  
     - \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This statement is correct.
   - **Option \( D \):** The eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \).  
     - The eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the \( 2 \)-dimensional space in which \( A_y \) acts. Thus, this statement is also correct.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - Both \( C \) and \( D \) are correct statements. However, since the question asks for the correct statement during the calculation, and \( C \) directly addresses the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), it is the most relevant choice.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and the other components of the angular momentum operator.

Answer: C
