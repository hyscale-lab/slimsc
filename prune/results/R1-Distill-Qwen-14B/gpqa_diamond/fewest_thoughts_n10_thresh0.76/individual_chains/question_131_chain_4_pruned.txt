Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step. 

So the question is about a reaction involving a dicarboxylic acid that was dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products—one major and one minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The key clue is the NOESY NMR spectra, where the major has a cross-peak and the minor doesn't. I need to find out which two resonances are connected.

First, I should probably think about the starting materials. The dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. Dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride, which has two carbonyl groups connected by an oxygen bridge.

The NMR data for the anhydride: 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, which is maybe a singlet. So maybe it's a proton that's deshielded, maybe an aromatic? Or perhaps an alpha proton to carbonyl, but why only one peak? Wait, the anhydride structure. If the starting acid is a cis-dicarboxylic acid, the dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride. If it's a cis configuration, the resulting anhydride would have a structure where the two carbonyl groups are adjacent. Wait, perhaps it's a five-membered ring? Because a five-membered cyclic anhydride is more stable.

Wait, let me think. The 13C NMR shows two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Carbonyls are higher, around 165-220 maybe? So 165 is probably a carbonyl carbon. But 137 ppm is more like a carbon next to an electronegative group, maybe an sp² hybridized carbon, like in an alkene or aromatic ring. But wait, the anhydride would have two carbonyl carbons, but in the 13C spectrum, only two peaks. Hmm, that seems strange because a cyclic anhydride usually has two carbonyl carbons which are equivalent in a symmetric structure. Wait, but the problem says two peaks in 13C. So maybe the anhydride has two different carbonyl carbons? That doesn’t make sense because in a symmetric cyclic anhydride, they should be the same. Alternatively, maybe the anhydride is not symmetric. Wait, perhaps the starting material was a cis-dicarboxylic acid with an alkene elsewhere. So the anhydride formed might have an alkene (cis) and two carbonyls. Let me think, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. Maybe that's a pair of protons adjacent to the carbonyl, perhaps in a conjugated system. Or maybe it
