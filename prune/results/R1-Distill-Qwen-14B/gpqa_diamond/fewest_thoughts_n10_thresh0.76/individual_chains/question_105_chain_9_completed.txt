Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem, and I need to figure out the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere. Hmm, let's break it down.

The star has the same radius as the Sun. So Rstar = R_sun. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. Now, one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots, right? So 20% of half the star is covered. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface area covered. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the total surface area of the star. Wait, but the spots are only on one hemisphere, so the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. Or wait, no, the total spots cover 20% of the entire star's surface area. Because the problem says "covering one hemisphere" but the filling factor is 20% for the entire surface? Wait, the way it's phrased is: one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So maybe the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. So the total area covered is 0.2 * (4πR² / 2) )? Because a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So 0.2 times that. Alternatively, perhaps the total area of spots is 20% of the whole star's surface. Because the filling factor is usually the fraction of the entire visible surface. Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read again.

"One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the spots make up 20% of the hemisphere's area. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². Because the surface area of a sphere is 4πR², so a hemisphere is 2πR². 20% of that is 0.4πR².

The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spot temperature is Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K. Because the star's Teff is 6000 K. Or wait, maybe the spots are cooler, so Te_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

Now, when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing the observed brightness to dip. Similarly, an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would block some light, causing a dip. The question is, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spotted star's variation.

First, I need to calculate the change in brightness when the spots are visible. The star's brightness is modulated as the spots rotate into and out of view. The maximum variation would be when the spots are all facing us (and then when they're not). So the photometric variation would be the difference between the star's normal brightness and when the spots are covering the hemisphere we see.

But wait, the star's brightness is a combination of its normal (unspotted) areas and the spots. Since the spots are cooler, they emit less flux. So when the hemisphere with spots is facing us, the total flux is less than when the other hemisphere (without spots) is facing us.

Wait, but the star is only spotted on one hemisphere. So as it rotates, the total flux emitted towards us will vary based on which hemisphere is visible. When the spotted hemisphere is visible (like when the star is rotating such that the spotted side is towards us), the flux is lower. When the other hemisphere (unspotted) is visible, the flux is higher.

Wait, no, I think I got that backwards. The unspotted hemisphere has higher flux because the spots are cooler. So when the star shows the unspotted side, the flux is higher, and when it shows the spotted side, the flux is lower. Wait, but the star is a sphere, so the unspotted hemisphere is the same as the other hemisphere. Oh wait, no, the star is a single sphere. The spots are on one hemisphere, so when the spotted side is facing us, we see the spots, which are cooler, so less flux. When the other side is facing us (the unspotted hemisphere), we see higher flux.

So the variation in brightness is due to the difference between the maximum and minimum flux. The amplitude of the variation is the difference between these two.

Now, the flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4.

But when part of the star is cooler, the total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spotted areas. Let me think about this.

The unspotted hemisphere's flux would be: (2πR²) * σ Teff^4. Because the area is 2πR², and each point emits σT^4.

The spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² (since the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere), and their T is 5000 K.

So the flux from the spotted areas is 0.2 * 2πR² * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, but when the spotted hemisphere is entirely facing us, the total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted (other) hemisphere and the spotted hemisphere. Or wait, the entire star's surface is either spotted or not, but the spotted area is part of one hemisphere.

Wait, no. The star's surface is a sphere; one hemisphere (half the sphere) has spots covering 20% of its area. So when the star rotates, the hemisphere that has spots is sometimes facing us, sometimes not.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's model this.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible to us, the total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part of that hemisphere and the spotted part. Wait, no, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire hemisphere is visible. So the flux from that hemisphere would be the sum of the unspotted area and the spotted area.

Wait, no. The hemisphere facing us would have some spots and some unspotted regions. But the other hemisphere (the one not facing us) is entirely unspotted, as the spots are only on one hemisphere.

Wait, no, perhaps the spotted area is only on one of the two hemispheres. So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are in view; when the star rotates 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us.

Wait, that's correct. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots; when the other is facing, we don't.

So the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is higher than when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

So the maximum flux, F_max, is the flux from the unspotted hemisphere, which is 2πR² * σ * (6000)^4.

The minimum flux, F_min, is the flux from the spotted hemisphere, which is 2πR² * σ * (6000)^4 minus the area covered by spots, which is 0.2 * 2πR². So the flux from the spotted hemisphere is (1 - 0.2) * 2πR² * σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 * 2πR² * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, let me calculate that. The spotted hemisphere's flux is:

= (fraction_unspotted) * Teff^4 * area + (fraction_spotted) * T_spot^4 * area.

So,

F_spotted_hemisphere = (1 - 0.2) * 2πR² σ (6000^4) + 0.2 * 2πR² σ (5000^4)

= 0.8 * 2πR² σ (6000^4) + 0.2 * 2πR² σ (5000^4)

Similarly, the unspotted hemisphere's flux is F_unspotted_hemisphere = 2πR² σ (6000^4).

The flux variation is the difference between F_max and F_min. So, the amplitude is (F_max - F_min) / 2, but I think in this scenario, the amplitude would be (F_max - F_min) because when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, that's the maximum flux, and when the spotted is visible, that's the minimum.

Wait, no. Let me think. When the star is viewed such that the unspotted hemisphere is visible, F is F_unspotted_hemisphere.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, F is F_spotted_hemisphere.

So the variation from F_unspotted to F_spotted is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

Which is 2π R² σ (6000^4) - [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4)] * 2π R² σ.

Let me factor that out.

= 2π R² σ [ 6000^4 - (0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4) ]

= 2π R² σ [ 6000^4 (1 - 0.8) - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [0.2 *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

Factor out 0.2:

= 2π R² σ * 0.2 [6000^4 - 5000^4 ]

= 0.4 π R² σ [6000^4 - 5000^4 ]

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 ). 

Wait, but the star's total flux when not spotted is F_total = 4π R² σ (6000^4 ), but in this case, the star has spots, so when the spotted hemisphere is visible, we're seeing less flux. So the variation is between F_unspotted (when the other hemisphere is visible) and F_spotted (when the spot hemisphere is visible). So the amplitude would be (F_unspotted - F_spotted) as I calculated.

But wait, no. The star's usual flux (without any spots) would be F_0 = 4π R² σ (6000^4 ). But when a hemisphere is spotted, the observed flux varies between F_unspotted (which is 2π R² σ (6000^4 )) and F_spotted (which is lower). So the net variation is between F_unspotted and F_spotted. So the amplitude of the variation is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

Now, what about the exoplanet scenario? The exoplanet would cause a dip in brightness when it transits in front of the star. The dip is given by the area of the planet's disk divided by the area of the star's disk. Because the planet blocks that much light.

So the dip (ΔF) is (R_planet^2 / R_star^2) * F_total, where F_total is the star's flux without any planet.

Wait, in the exoplanet case, the dip is (Area_planet / Area_star) * F_total. Because the planet blocks that area's worth of flux.

So when the planet transits, the observed flux drops by (R_planet^2 / R_star^2) * F_total.

Wait, but in the star's case, the variation is F_unspotted - F_spotted, and in the planet case, the dip is (R_p^2/R_s^2) * F_total.

We need these two variations to produce the same amplitude. So F_unspotted - F_spotted = (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * F_total.

Wait, but let me clarify: the maximum variation in the star's flux is F_unspotted (max) minus F_spotted (min). So the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotted). The exoplanet would cause a dip of (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * F_0, where F_0 is F_total without any spots. Hmm, but wait, the star's F_0 is 4π R² σ T^4. But in the spotted case, the star's flux isn't uniform. So perhaps I need to compare the flux variations.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the fractional change in brightness for both scenarios and set them equal.

In the star's case, the fractional change is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_0, where F_0 is the star's normal flux (without any spots). Because when there are no spots, the flux is F_0=4πR²σTeff^4.

Wait, no. The star's flux varies between F_unspotted and F_spotted. So the maximum flux is F_unspotted (when the unspotted hemisphere is visible), and the minimum is F_spotted (when the spotted hemisphere is visible). So the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotted), and the average flux is (F_unspotted + F_spotted)/2. So the fractional change would be [(F_unspotted - F_spotted)/2] / average flux.

Wait, but maybe it's better to compute the maximum and minimum flux and then find the amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the difference in flux between when the spotted and unspotted hemispheres are visible.

Let me compute F_unspotted and F_spotted in terms of F_0.

F_0 = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

F_unspotted = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

Which is (2π/(4π)) F_0 = (1/2) F_0.

Wait, that's because F_0 =4π R² σ Teff^4. So F_unspotted is 2π R² σ Teff^4 = (1/2) F_0.

Similarly, F_spotted is:

F_spotted = 0.8 * 2π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 * 2π R² σ (5000)^4.

Which is (0.8 * (6000^4) + 0.2 * (5000^4)) ) * (2π R² σ )

So,

F_spotted = [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4)] * (2π R² σ )

= (2π R² σ) [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4) ]

But F_0 =4π R² σ (6000^4 ), so 2π R² σ = F_0 / 2. So,

F_spotted = [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4)] * (F_0 / 2 )

Hmm, let me compute the numerical value of [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4)].

Compute each term:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So,

0.8 * 1.296e15 = 1.0368e15.

0.2 * 6.25e14 = 1.25e14.

Add them together: 1.0368e15 + 1.25e14 = 1.1618e15.

So,

F_spotted = (1.1618e15) * (F_0 / 2 )

F_0 is 4π R² σ (6000^4 ), and F_0's numerical coefficient is 4π R² σ * (6000^4) = 4π R² σ * 1.296e15. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of F_0 = 4π R² σ T^4, so  F_0 = 4π R² σ (6000^4).

So, F_unspotted is (2π R² σ (6000^4)) = (F_0/2).

F_spotted is [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4)] * (2π R² σ) = [1.1618e15] * (F_0/2) / (6000^4).

Wait, perhaps I can express F_spotted in terms of F_0.

Wait, 6000^4 is T^4, so 0.8 *6000^4 +0.2*5000^4 =0.8 T^4 + 0.2 (5000)^4.

Wait, but to express F_spotted as a fraction of F_0:

F_spotted = (0.8 T^4 + 0.2 (T - 1000)^4) ) * (2π R^2 σ )

But F_0 =4π R² σ T^4.

So,

F_spotted = [0.8 T^4 + 0.2 (T-1000)^4 ] * (2π R² σ )

= [0.8 T^4 + 0.2 (T-1000)^4 ] * (F_0 / 2 )

So,

F_spotted = (0.8 T^4 + 0.2 (T-1000)^4 ) * F_0 / 2.

Then,

F_unspotted = F_0 / 2.

So the variation amplitude is F_unspotted - F_spotted = (F_0/2) - [ (0.8 T^4 + 0.2 (T-1000)^4 ) * F_0/2 ]

= [1 - (0.8 T^4 + 0.2 (T-1000)^4 ) ] * (F_0/2 )

= [ 1 -0.8 T^4 -0.2 (T-1000)^4 ] * (F_0/2 )

Hmm, but this seems a bit complicated. Maybe plugging in the numbers would help.

Given T =6000 K,

0.8 *6000^4 =0.8 * (6^4 *1e12) = 0.8 *1296e12 = 1036.8e12.

0.2 *5000^4 =0.2 * (5^4 *1e12) = 0.2 *625e12 =125e12.

So their sum is 1036.8e12 + 125e12 = 1161.8e12.

So,

F_spotted = 1161.8e12 * (F_0 / 2 )

Wait, but F_0 =4π R^2 σ *6000^4= 4π R^2 σ *1.296e15.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the ratio.

(F_unspotted - F_spotted) = (F_0/2) - [ (1161.8e12 ) * (2π R^2 σ) ]

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused with units. Let me try to compute the fractional change.

The flux variation amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotted).

F_unspotted = F_0 / 2.

F_spotted = (0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ) * (2π R^2 σ )

= (1161.8e12) * (2π R^2 σ )

But 2π R^2 σ = (F_0) / (2 *6000^4 ) * (2π R^2 σ ) ?

Wait, perhaps another approach: express everything in terms of F_0.

F_0 =4π R^2 σ T^4.

So,

F_unspotted = 2π R^2 σ T^4 = F_0 / 2.

F_spotted = [ (0.8 T^4 + 0.2 (T-1000)^4 ) ] * (2π R^2 σ )

= [0.8 T^4 + 0.2 (T-1000)^4 ] * (F_0 / 2 ) / T^4.

Wait, because 2π R^2 σ = (F_0)/(2 T^4) )? Wait, no.

Wait, 4π R² σ T^4 = F_0 → 2π R² σ = F_0/(2 T^4) * (T^4) )? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me see:

F_0 =4π R^2 σ T^4 → 2π R^2 σ = (F_0)/(2 T^4) * T^4 )? No, perhaps I should think of 2π R² σ as (F_0) / (2 T^4) ) * (T^4 ), but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, let me compute F_spotted in terms of F_0.

F_spotted = [0.8 T^4 + 0.2 (T-1000)^4 ] * (2π R^2 σ )

But 2π R^2 σ = (F_0)/(2 T^4) ) * T^4 → F_0/(2) ) ?

Wait, wait, no. F_0 =4π R^2 σ T^4 → 2π R^2 σ = F_0/(2 T^4) * T^4 → F_0/(2) * (T^4 / T^4) ) → F_0/2.

Wait, no. Let me think:

F_0 =4π R² σ T^4 → 2π R² σ = F_0/(2 T^4) * T^4 → F_0/2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because 2π R² σ is a flux term, not a ratio. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Alternative approach: compute F_spotted as a fraction of F_0.

F_spotted = [0.8 T^4 + 0.2 (T-1000)^4 ] * (2π R^2 σ )

But 2π R^2 σ = (F_0 )/(2 T^4) ) * T^4 = F_0 /2.

Wait, that's because F_0 =4π R^2 σ T^4 → 2π R^2 σ = F_0/(2 T^4) → No, because 4π R^2 σ T^4 = F_0 → 2π R^2 σ = F_0/(2 T^4) ) * T^4 = F_0/(2) * (T^4 / T^4 ) → F_0/2.

Wait that can't be right because 2π R^2 σ has units of W/m², while F_0 has units of W/m² * m² → W.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute the numerical value of F_unspotted and F_spotted in terms of F_0.

F_unspotted = (2π R² σ T^4 ) = (F_0 / 2).

F_spotted = [0.8 T^4 + 0.2 (T-1000)^4 ] * (2π R² σ )

= [0.8 T^4 + 0.2 (T-1000)^4 ] * (F_0 / 2 ) / T^4.

Because 2π R² σ = (F_0) / (2 T^4) → because F_0 =4π R² σ T^4.

So,

F_spotted = [0.8 T^4 + 0.2 (T-1000)^4 ] * (F_0 / 2 T^4 ) * T^4.

The T^4 terms cancel out:

F_spotted = [0.8 + 0.2 ( (T-1000)/T )^4 ] * (F_0 / 2 )

Because,

[ (T-1000)^4 ] / T^4 = ( (T-1000)/T )^4.

So,

F_spotted = [0.8 + 0.2 * ( (6000-1000)/6000 )^4 ] * (F_0 / 2 )

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4.

0.8333^2 ≈ 0.6944, so square again: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So,

0.8 + 0.2 * 0.4823 =0.8 +0.09646 =0.89646.

So,

F_spotted ≈0.89646 * (F_0 / 2 ) = 0.44823 F_0.

Wait, that seems off because F_unspotted is F_0/2 = 0.5 F_0.

So F_spotted is 0.44823 F_0, which is less than F_unspotted.

So the variation is F_unspotted - F_spotted = 0.5 F_0 - 0.44823 F_0 = 0.05177 F_0.

So the amplitude is approximately 0.05177 F_0.

Now, the exoplanet would cause a dip of (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * F_0, where R_s is the star's radius (same as Sun's).

We want this dip to be equal to the star's variation amplitude of 0.05177 F_0.

So,

(R_p^2 / R_s^2 ) * F_0 = 0.05177 F_0.

Canceling F_0,

R_p^2 / R_s^2 = 0.05177 → R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, but wait, I thought the exoplanet dip is (R_p/R_s)^2 * F_0. Because when the planet transits, the blocked area is (π R_p^2) / (π R_s^2) ) = (R_p/R_s)^2. So the fraction of flux blocked is (R_p/R_s)^2. So yes, the dip is that fraction of F_0.

So,

(R_p / R_s)^2 =0.05177 → R_p ≈ sqrt(0.05177) R_s ≈ 0.2275 R_s.

Looking at the options, the closest option is option A) ~0.39, but that's much larger. Option C is 0.11, which is smaller than 0.2275. Option D is 0.32, also larger.

Wait, that's a problem. Because 0.2275 is not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

I found that the star's flux variation is F_unspotted - F_spotted = 0.05177 F_0.

But perhaps I made an error in computing F_spotted.

Wait, let's go back.

F_spotted = [0.8 T^4 + 0.2 (T-ΔT)^4 ] * (F_0 / 2 )

Wait, where ΔT is 1000 K, so T =6000, T-ΔT=5000.

So,

F_spotted = [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4 ] * (F_0 /2 ) / (6000)^4.

Wait, no, I think I confused the earlier steps.

Wait, in the correct approach, F_spotted is:

F_spotted = [0.8 * (6000^4) + 0.2 * (5000^4) ] * (2π R² σ )

But F_0 =4π R² σ (6000^4 ) → 2π R² σ = F_0/(2 *6000^4) * 6000^4→ F_0/2.

Wait, no, 2π R² σ = F_0/(2 *6000^4) ) *6000^4 → F_0/(2) * (6000^4 /6000^4) ) → F_0/2.

So,

F_spotted = [0.8*6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ] * (F_0/2) /6000^4.

So,

F_spotted = (0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4 ) * (F_0/ 2 )

As (5000^4 /6000^4 )= (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈0.4823.

So,

F_spotted= (0.8 +0.2*0.4823 ) * F_0/2 = (0.8 + 0.09646) * F_0/2= 0.89646 * F_0/2 ≈0.44823 F_0.

So F_unspotted is F_0/2=0.5 F_0.

So the difference is 0.5 F_0 -0.44823 F_0=0.05177 F_0.

So the amplitude is 0.05177 F_0.

So the exoplanet dip should be equal to this amplitude.

The dip is (R_p^2/R_s^2) F_0 =0.05177 F_0 → R_p^2/R_s^2=0.05177 → R_p/R_s= sqrt(0.05177)= ~0.2275.

But looking at the options, I don't see this value. The options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, none of these options are close to 0.2275. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the filling factor. Let me check.

The problem says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the total area covered is 20% of the hemisphere.

Wait, the star's total surface area is 4π R². A hemisphere is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 *2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the spots cover 0.4 π R².

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the flux.

F_unspotted = 2π R² σ (6000^4 ) → this is when the other hemisphere is visible.

F_spotted = (2π R² -0.4 π R²) * σ (6000^4 ) + 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 )

= [ (2π R² -0.4 π R² ) * (6000^4) + 0.4 π R² (5000^4) ] * σ

Factor out π R²:

= π R² [ (2 -0.4) 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ] * σ.

= π R² [ 1.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ] * σ.

So,

F_spotted= π R² [1.6 *6000^4 +0.4 *5000^4 ] σ.

F_unspotted= 2π R² *6000^4 * σ.

So the variation is F_unspotted - F_spotted = 2π R² σ 6000^4 - π R² σ [1.6 *6000^4 +0.4 *5000^4 ].

Factor out π R² σ:

= π R² σ [ 2 *6000^4 - 1.6 *6000^4 -0.4 *5000^4 ]

= π R² σ [0.4 *6000^4 -0.4 *5000^4 ]

= 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Which is the same as earlier.

But let's compute the numerical value.

Compute 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 1.296e16 (Wait, 6^4=1296, so 6e3^4=1296e12=1.296e15).

Wait, 6^4=1296; 6e3^4= (6*1e3)^4=6^4 * (1e3)^4= 1296 * 1e12=1.296e15.

Similarly,5e3^4=625e12=6.25e14.

So,

6000^4 -5000^4 =1.296e15 -6.25e14 =6.71e14.

So,

Amplitude =0.4 π R² σ (6.71e14 )

But F_0 =4π R² σ (1.296e15 )

So,

Amplitude = (0.4 π R² σ *6.71e14 ) = (0.4 *6.71e14 ) / (4*1.296e15 ) ) * F_0.

Wait, compute:

0.4 *6.71e14 =2.684e14.

Denominator:4*1.296e15=5.184e15.

So,

Amplitude = (2.684e14 /5.184e15 ) * F_0 = (0.0517) F_0.

So same as earlier, 0.0517 F_0.

So the exoplanet dip should be 0.0517 F_0.

So,

(R_p/R_s )^2 =0.0517 → R_p/R_s =sqrt(0.0517 )≈0.2275.

Hmm, none of the options match this. The closest options are B)0.07 and C)0.11, which are smaller, and D)0.32, which is a bit larger. Option A is 0.39, which is much larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake by considering the entire hemisphere as either hemisphere, but perhaps the star is such that the spots are in a single location, not half the star. Or perhaps I should model it differently.

Wait, another thought: the variation in the star's brightness occurs as the star rotates. The maximum occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

So the variation is (F_unspotted - F_spotted )= 0.0517 F_0.

The exoplanet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p/R_s )^2 F_0.

So I set (R_p/R_s )^2 =0.0517 → R_p/R_s ≈0.2275.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star's brightness variation differently. When the star is spotted, the total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part. But perhaps the problem is that the star's spots are only on one hemisphere, which may affect the overall brightness when that hemisphere is visible.

Wait, perhaps the average flux from the star, considering both hemispheres, is F_avg = (F_unspotted + F_spotted )/2.

The amplitude would then be (F_unspotted - F_spotted )/2.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the star's brightness would vary between F_unspotted and F_spotted, so the average is (F_unspotted + F_spotted )/2, and the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation divided by 2.

So the amplitude would be (F_unspotted - F_spotted )/2.

Hmm, that changes things.

So in that case, the amplitude is (0.5 F_0 -0.44823 F_0 )/2 → (0.05177 F_0 )/2 → 0.025885 F_0.

So the dip would be 0.025885 F_0.

Wait, but the exoplanet's dip is (R_p/R_s )^2 F_0.

So,

(R_p/R_s )^2 =0.025885 → R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.025885 )≈0.1608.

Still not matching any of the options.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the amplitude is the difference between F_unspotted and F_spotted, which is 0.0517 F_0. But the exoplanet's dip is 0.0517 F_0. So R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.0517 )= ~0.2275.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated F_spotted.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the ratio of F_spotted to F_unspotted, and then find the dip as a fraction of F_unspotted.

Wait, when the star is in the unspotted state, the flux is F_unspotted = 0.5 F_0.

When in the spotted state, the flux is F_spotted =0.44823 F_0.

So the dip is F_unspotted - F_spotted =0.05177 F_0.

But the exoplanet dip is (R_p/R_s )^2 F_0.

So,

(R_p/R_s )^2 F_0= 0.05177 F_0 → R_p/R_s= sqrt(0.05177 )= ~0.2275.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the star is not emitting uniformly. The spots are on one hemisphere, so perhaps the effective temperature isn't as straightforward. Wait, another approach: calculate the fraction of the star's surface that is cooler, and then compute the total flux.

The star's total flux without spots is F_0 =4π R² σ (6000)^4.

With spots, the star's total flux would be F_total = (1-0.2)*4π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 *4π R² σ (5000)^4.

Wait, no, that's if the spots cover 20% of the entire star. But in this case, the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, so 10% of the entire star's surface (since a hemisphere is half the surface).

Ah! Here's the mistake. The problem says, "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² =0.4 π R². The total area of the star is 4π R². So the total filling factor (relative to the entire star) is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R² )= 0.1 → 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

So, in that case, the star's total flux is:

F_total = (1 - 0.1) * F_0 + 0.1 * F_spot.

Where F_spot is the flux per unit area of the spot, which is σ (5000)^4.

So,

F_total = 0.9 *4π R² σ (6000)^4 +0.1 *4π R² σ (5000)^4.

But that's the average flux when the star is viewed from any angle. But when the star rotates, the observed flux varies because we see either the unspotted or spotted hemisphere.

Wait, no. Because the spots are on one hemisphere. When the star rotates, the spotted side may face us, but the unspotted side is the opposite.

Wait, but the star emits uniformly from all its surface. So when the star is viewed from the direction of the unspotted hemisphere, the entire unspotted hemisphere is visible, and the spotted hemisphere is not. But when the star is viewed from the direction where the spotted hemisphere is visible, the other hemisphere is not. So it's more accurate to model the brightness when the spotted hemisphere is facing us and when the unspotted is.

So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us: F_unspotted = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

The minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us: F_spotted =2π R² [ (1-0.2) σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 σ (5000)^4 ].

So,

F_spotted = 2π R² σ [ 0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ].

So,

F_unspotted - F_spotted =2π R² σ [6000^4 - (0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ) ]

=2π R² σ [ 6000^4 (1-0.8) -0.2 *5000^4 ]

=2π R² σ [ 0.2 *6000^4 -0.2 *5000^4 ]

=0.2 *2π R² σ [6000^4 -5000^4 ]

=0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

As before.

But now, perhaps the average flux is (F_unspotted + F_spotted )/2.

So,

Average flux = [ F_unspotted + F_spotted ] /2.

The amplitude would be (F_unspotted - F_spotted )/2.

So,

Amplitude = (0.05177 F_0 ) /2 = 0.025885 F_0.

So the dip caused by the exoplanet would be (R_p/R_s )^2 F_0 = amplitude → R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.025885 )= ~0.1608.

Still not matching the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the dip as a fraction of F_0.

The dip in the star's brightness is (F_unspotted - F_spotted )/F_0.

Which is 0.05177 F_0 / F_0 =0.05177.

The exoplanet's dip is (R_p/R_s )^2.

So,

(R_p/R_s )^2 =0.05177 → R_p/R_s= sqrt(0.05177 )= ~0.2275.

So the exoplanet's radius is approximately 22.75% of the star's radius. But the options don't have this.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 0.11, which is about half of that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the star's flux variation is (F_unspotted - F_spotted )/F_0. But perhaps it's (F_unspotted - F_spotted )/(F_unspotted + F_spotted ), which would be the fractional variation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness isn't just varying between F_unspotted and F_spotted, but when the spots are on the visible side, the observed flux is lower, and when it's the other side, it's higher.

Wait, perhaps the maximum flux is F_unspotted, and the minimum is F_spotted.

So the amplitude of the variation is (F_unspotted - F_spotted )/2.

Wait, no, the amplitude is typically the peak-to-peak variation divided by 2. So if the maximum is F_unspotted and the minimum is F_spotted, the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotted )/2.

So, the dip would be (F_unspotted - F_spotted )/2.

Which would be 0.025885 F_0.

So,

(R_p/R_s )^2 = 0.025885 → R_p/R_s= ~0.1608.

Again, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the exoplanet's transit produces a dip of (R_p/R_s )^2, whereas the star's variation is a modulation of (F_unspotted - F_spotted )/F_0.

Wait, but the problem states: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?"

So, the amplitude of the light curve variation is the same for both the star with spots and the exoplanet transit.

So, for the star with spots, the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotted ) =0.05177 F_0.

For the exoplanet, the amplitude is (R_p/R_s )^2 F_0.

Set them equal: (R_p/R_s )^2 F_0 =0.05177 F_0 → R_p/R_s= sqrt(0.05177 )=0.2275.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem asks for the planet's radius to produce the same amplitude as the star's variation, but considering the star's rotation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fluxes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the change in brightness as a dip of (spotted area fraction) * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of fluxes differently. The flux from the star when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spotted = [ (1 - filling factor ) * T_eff^4 + filling factor * T_spot^4 ] * ( area per hemisphere ).

But the area per hemisphere is 2π R².

So,

F_spotted = (1 -0.2 ) * (6000^4 ) +0.2 * (5000^4 ) ) * (2π R² σ )

= (0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ) *2π R² σ.

As before.

Hmm, I'm stuck because my calculation doesn't match any of the options. Perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the star's brightness variation is due to the spots being on only one side, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip. The amplitude of this dip would be the same as the planet's transit dip.

So, the dip amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotted )/F_unspotted.

Which is (0.05177 F_0 ) / (0.5 F_0 ) ) =0.10354, or about 10% dip.

The exoplanet's dip is (R_p/R_s )^2.

So,

(R_p/R_s )^2 =0.10354 → R_p/R_s= ~0.3217.

Wait, that's approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Ah! That makes sense. Because when calculating the fractional dip, it's (F_unspotted - F_spotted ) / F_unspotted, which is the relative change in brightness.

So,

Dip_fraction = (F_unspotted - F_spotted ) / F_unspotted = (0.05177 F_0 ) / (0.5 F_0 )=0.10354.

Which is approximately 10.35% dip.

The exoplanet's dip is (R_p/R_s )^2 =0.10354 → R_p/R_s= sqrt(0.10354 )≈0.3217, which is approximately 0.32, option D.

That must be the correct approach. So the answer is option D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve as the spotted hemisphere, we analyze the brightness variation caused by the spots and compare it to the dip caused by an exoplanet transit.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - Spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Flux Calculations**:
   - The total flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
     \[
     F = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
     \]
   - When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotted}} = 2 \pi R^2 \sigma (6000)^4
     \]
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = (0.8 \cdot 6000^4 + 0.2 \cdot 5000^4) \cdot 2 \pi R^2 \sigma
     \]

3. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux:
     \[
     \Delta F = F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for \( F_{\text{unspotted}} \) and \( F_{\text{spotted}} \):
     \[
     \Delta F = 2 \pi R^2 \sigma \left[ 6000^4 - (0.8 \cdot 6000^4 + 0.2 \cdot 5000^4) \right]
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \Delta F = 2 \pi R^2 \sigma \cdot 0.2 \cdot (6000^4 - 5000^4)
     \]

4. **Fractional Brightness Variation**:
   - The fractional change in brightness is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = \frac{F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_{\text{unspotted}}}
     \]
   - Substituting \( F_{\text{unspotted}} = 2 \pi R^2 \sigma (6000)^4 \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = 1 - \frac{F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_{\text{unspotted}}}
     \]
   - Numerically:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = 1 - \frac{0.8 \cdot 6000^4 + 0.2 \cdot 5000^4}{6000^4}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = 1 - \left( 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = 1 - \left( 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot 0.4823 \right)
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = 1 - 0.8965 = 0.1035 \, \text{(or 10.35%)}.
     \]

5. **Exoplanet Transit Dip**:
   - The dip caused by an exoplanet transit is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \text{Dip} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - To match the brightness variation amplitude:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately **0.32**. This corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
