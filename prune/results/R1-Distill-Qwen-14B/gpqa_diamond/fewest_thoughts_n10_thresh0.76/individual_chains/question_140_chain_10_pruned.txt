Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, wait, 277 K is 4°C because 273 is 0°C, so 4°C is pretty close.

So, I need to figure out what these substances are. Let's think about each part.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Violent reactions could be things like metals reacting with acids, maybe something like magnesium reacting with sulfuric acid. Or maybe something more vigorous like a reaction that produces a lot of gas quickly.

Gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecule's composition must be such that each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think about possible gases. For example, hydrogen gas is H2, but each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So no, that doesn't fit.

Wait, what about CO2? No, that's a gas, but each carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (if it's 12C) but oxygen is 8 protons and 8 neutrons (16O). So CO2 would have 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44. But each molecule's atoms would have different protons and neutrons. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the gas is something like CH4? No, that's not a product of something reacting violently. Or maybe something like H2 or O2. Hmm. Let me think differently.

Wait, if the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons, perhaps the molecule is something like D2O? No, that's heavy water, but it's a liquid. Or maybe it's like NH3, but NH3 has 14 (N) and 1*3 (H). So N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (assuming it's 14N). H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So each molecule would have 7 (from N) + 1*3 (from H) for protons, and 7 (N) + 0 (H) for neutrons. So no, that's not equal. Hmm.

Wait another angle: what if the gas is something like O2 or N2? O2 has 8 protons each, and 8 neutrons each (if it's 16O). So each O has 8p and 8n. So O2 has 16p and 16n. So the total protons and neutrons are equal. That might fit. So W could be O2.

But wait, when metals react with acids, they usually produce H2 gas, not O2. So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else.

Wait, another possibility: what about methane (CH4)? No, because each C has 6p
