Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question is about a proton and an antiproton annihilating into two particles, A+ and A-. The setup is that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of particle A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, so the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−. Since both A+ and A− are produced in pairs, I guess they must have some symmetry here. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh, right, when particles move slowly, their kinetic energy is much less than their rest mass energy, so maybe we can approximate their motion as non-relativistic? Or perhaps their speed isn't too close to the speed of light, making relativistic effects negligible. Hmm, but the options are all in terms of c, so maybe we need to consider relativistic effects after all.

The given mass of A is 300 MeV. I'm pretty sure that in particle physics, the masses are often given in terms of their rest mass energy. So the rest mass energy of A is 300 MeV. But what's the rest mass of the proton? Protons are about 938 MeV/c² each.

Wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The proton has rest mass m_p, and the antiproton also has m_p. But since the antiproton is moving slowly
