Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons and angular momentum. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Wait, p orbitals have l=1, right? So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. So l is 2, and m is -1. 

Now, the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for both electrons. They want to know the probability that both measurements give -Ä§. 

Wait, orbital angular momentum components. Oh right, each electron's orbital angular momentum is L1 and L2. So L1z and L2z are the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum. 

But wait, the state given is a coupled state. That means it's a combination of the individual states. So I think the coupled state |l1, l2, l, m> is formed by combining the individual |l1, m1> and |l2, m2> states. So the total m is m1 + m2.

In this case, the total state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total m is -1. Now, the individual m's (m1 and m2) must add up to -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

But each m1 can be -1, 0, or +1 because l=1. Similarly for m2. So possible pairs (m1, m2) that sum to -1 are:

(-1,-0) would sum to -1. Wait, no, let me think: For m1=0 and m2=-1: 0 + (-1) = -1. 

Wait, no, that's m1=0, m2=-1. Another possibility: m1=-1, m2=0. Both sum to -1.

Wait, wait: m1 can take values -1, 0, +1, same for m2. So possible pairs are:

m1 = -1, m2=0; sum is -1.

m1=0, m2=-1; sum is -1.

m1=1, m2=-2: but m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can only be -1, 0, 1. So that's not possible.

So only two possibilities: (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1).

So the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> would be a linear combination of these two states. Wait, how exactly is the coupling done? Oh right, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients come into play here. The state |l1, l2, l, m> is a combination of the product states |l1, m1> |l2, m2> where m1 + m2 = m.

So for l=2 and m=-1, the possible m1 and m2 pairs are (0, -1
