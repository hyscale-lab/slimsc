Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the question gives me some spectral information:

Mass Spectrometry (MS): Molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%), and another peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, the molecular ion is at 156, which suggests the molecular weight is 156 g/mol. The 158 peak is 32% abundance. Wait, molecular ion plus 2? That might indicate the presence of a chlorine atom because Cl has an atomic weight of about 35.5. So, the M+2 peak is common in compounds with Cl because of the natural abundance of Cl isotopes. So, the molecular formula probably includes Cl.

IR Spectrum: A broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in this region usually suggest O-H or N-H stretches. But O-H is more likely here, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That peak is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. But wait, the sharpness might suggest it's not an aldehyde (which usually has a strong peak around 2820 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, which I don't see mentioned here). So maybe a carboxylic acid or ester? Wait, another thought: the sharp peak could also be from an acid chloride, which typically has a strong carbonyl around 1770-1800 cm^-1. Hmm, 1720 is a bit lower than that. Alternatively, maybe a ketone. But the broad peak in IR suggests an O-H group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

11.0 ppm (s, 1H) - That's a pretty downfield shift. A singlet. What's at 11 ppm? Usually, that's a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH), which is a broad peak, but wait, here it's a singlet and sharp. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm, but 11 is higher. Maybe an aromatic aldehyde? Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton from something else. Wait, if it's a singlet, that could be an exchange process, but in D2O it might disappear. Or maybe it's an aldehyde. Wait, another possibility: an aromatic -OH group, but that's usually broader. Alternatively, perhaps a carboxylic acid. Wait, but sometimes in NMR, the carboxylic acid proton can appear as a broad peak, but sometimes as a singlet if it's deuterated or under certain conditions.

Wait, the 11 ppm is a singlet. Another thought: maybe it's the aldehyde proton. But I thought aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But maybe if it's in a more deshielded environment, like attached to an electronegative atom, it can be downfield. Or perhaps it's an acidic proton like in a phenol, but I thought phenols are up around 5-7 ppm.

Moving on, the other NMR signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.72 (d, 2H). These look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest coupling between two sets of protons. So maybe para-substituted. So if it's para substituted, like two substituents on a benzene ring, each having two protons. Wait, the two doublets could be two sets of adjacent protons, like in a para-substituted benzene where each substituent is on the opposite side, leading to two doublets each integrating to 2H. So that would make a pattern like two doublets each with 2H, which is typical for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta-substituted, but that would give a more complex splitting.

So putting together the aromatic region: two doublets integrating to two protons each. That suggests two substituents on the benzene ring, para to each other. Each substituent affects the neighboring protons, leading to the splitting.

Now, the IR had a carbonyl peak. So, the molecule has a carbonyl group. Let's consider the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be a benzaldehyde with Cl at position 3 and OH at 2. Wait, but the numbering is a bit tricky. Alternatively, the structure would have a benzaldehyde group (CHO) at position 1, Cl at 3, OH at 2? Wait, the formula would be Cl in position 3, OH in 2, CHO in position 1? No, benzaldehyde is position 1, so if you have substituents at 2 and 3, but then the NMR might show different patterns. Also, this compound would have an aldehyde proton, which is usually around 9-10 ppm. But the given NMR has a peak at 11 ppm, which is higher. Plus, it would have an -OH group, which in the IR would give a broad peak, which it does. The aldehyde's C=O would show up around 1700, but the IR peak here is 1720. Hmm. Also, this compound has a Cl, which would account for the M+2 peak.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is benzene ring with Cl at position 4 and a COOH group at position 1. The benzoic acid would have a COOH group, so the NMR would show a broad peak for the COOH proton. But wait, the NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm, which could be the COOH. But wait, carboxylic acids' protons are usually broad singlets, but in deuterated solvents, maybe they appear as sharp? Not sure. Also, the IR would show a strong O-H stretch (broad) and a strong C=O (around 1700 cm^-1, which matches the 1720 given. Wait, benzoic acid's C=O is around 1680-1720, so 1720 is plausible. Also, the M+2 peak is present because it's Cl.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is OClCO-O-phenyl. Wait, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-phenyl. The molecular formula would be C8H7ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: C is 12*8=96, H is7=7, Cl ~35.5, O2=32. So total is 96+7+35.5+32=170.5. But the molecular ion is 156, so this doesn't fit. So probably not option C.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is benzene with Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. Then, the aromatic protons would be in ortho and para positions. The NMR would have aromatic protons. Let me think: if the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl), then the H in position 3 would couple with H in position 4, and H in position 5 and 6. Wait, that might produce more complex splitting, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are para, leading to the two doublets observed. Wait, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B), the substituents (Cl and COOH) are in para positions. So the ring would have two substituents opposite each other. Then, the remaining two protons (on carbons 2 and 6, and 3 and 5) would each be adjacent to substituents. Let me sketch this.

In para-substituted benzoic acid (option B), the ring has COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4. Then, the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to COOH, and the protons at 3 and 5 adjacent to Cl. Wait, but with substituents in para positions, would the adjacent protons be equivalent? For example, in para-substituted rings, the protons ortho to the substituents are equivalent. So in benzoic acid, the ring is:

COOH at position 1, Cl at position 4.

Then, positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, and positions 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are para. So the aromatic protons would be split into two sets: those ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) and those ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5). Each set would be a doublet because each would have only one neighboring H. So in the NMR, we'd see two doublets: one around 8.02 ppm (2H) and another around 7.72 (2H), which matches the data given. So that fits.

Now, the NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm. If this is a carboxylic acid proton, it's possible. Benzoic acid's COOH proton typically appears as a broad singlet around 10-12 ppm. But in the NMR, it's a singlet, which makes sense for a single proton. So that fits.

The IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700, which would be the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. The strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 matches the C=O of the carboxylic acid.

The molecular ion at m/z 156: let's calculate the molecular weight. For option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid: C7H5ClO2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, replacing a H with Cl). Wait, wait, the formula for benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl would replace one H, so it's C7H5ClO2.

Calculating the molecular weight: 7*(12) =84, 5*(1)=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. So 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. So the molecular ion at 156 would be the M peak. Wait, but the molecular ion is 156 (100%), and the M+2 is 158 (32%). Since Cl has a natural abundance of about 75% for Cl-35 and 25% for Cl-37. So the molecular ion would have peaks at 156 (Cl-35), 157 (Cl-36? No, Cl is only 35 and 37. Wait, wait, if the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2, the M is 156.5. But in mass spec, the molecular ion is usually the most abundant peak. The M+2 would be for Cl-37: 156 +2=158. So the M+2 peak is 32%, which fits with Cl's 25% abundance (because 75% Cl-35, 25% Cl-37). So the M peak is 100% (Cl-35), M+2 is 25% of M, but the question says M+2 is 32%. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, molecular weight of C7H5ClO2: C:7*12=84, H:5=5, Cl:35.5, O:32. Total is 84+5+35.5+32 = 156.5. So M is 156.5. In mass spec, the molecular ion would be at m/z 156 (the integer part). The M+2 would be 158. The abundance of M (Cl-35) is 75%, and M+2 (Cl-37) is 25%. So the ratio of M to M+2 should be 75:25, which is 3:1. But the question says M is 100%, and M+2 is 32%. Wait, 32% of M is about 25% (since 100% is M). So that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula includes more Cl, but the options don't suggest that.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is different. Let me check option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Its formula is also C7H5ClO2, same as option B. So same molecular weight. So the same issue applies. So why is M+2 at 32%? Because M is 156, M+2 is 158. If the molecular ion is 156, and Cl is 35.5, then M is 156.5, so the M peak would be at 156 and 157? Hmm, perhaps the software rounds it. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula isn't just with one Cl. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach. Let me look at the molecular ion. The molecular ion is 156, so the molecular weight is 156. Let's see which options fit that.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Same as B and D. So same molecular weight. So same issue.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Molecular formula is C8H7ClO2. So 8*12=96, 7=7, 35.5=35.5, 16*2=32. Total is 96+7+35.5+32=170.5. So molecular weight 170.5. So the molecular ion would be 170, not 156. So option C is out.

Wait, but the question says molecular ion at 156. So option C can't be correct, since its molecular weight would be higher.

So, back to options A, B, D.

Now, let's think about the NMR again.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The aromatic protons would be in two sets: ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent) and ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5). Each of these would be a doublet, as each proton is adjacent to only one other proton. So in NMR, we'd see two doublets. The one closer to the COOH might be more deshielded, so higher ppm. So 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm. Let's see: the COOH is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so the ring protons ortho to it would be more deshielded and appear upfield or downfield? Wait, more deshielded (downfield). So the protons ortho to COOH would be higher ppm than those ortho to Cl. So in the NMR, the higher ppm would be the ortho to COOH, and the lower would be ortho to Cl. So in the data, 8.02 and 7.72. So the 8.02 is for the ortho to COOH, and 7.72 for ortho to Cl.

That fits.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is COOH at position 1, Cl at position 2. Then, the ring protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. The substituents are in ortho positions. So the aromatic protons would be in a different pattern. The protons adjacent to both substituents might be more deshielded. Let me think: in this case, the ring would have substituents at 1 and 2 positions. So the ring would have H at 3,4,5,6. H3 and H6 would be adjacent to Cl, and H4 and H5 would be adjacent to COOH. Wait, no, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the ring protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. H3 is adjacent to Cl (position 2) and H4. H4 is adjacent to H5, which is adjacent to H6, which is adjacent to COOH (position 1).

Wait, maybe in this case, the H3 would be ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. H4 would be para to Cl and ortho to COOH. H5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl, and H6 would be ortho to COOH and meta to Cl.

This might complicate the splitting. H3 and H5 would each be next to one H (H4 and H6, respectively), leading to doublets. H4 and H6 would each be next to two H's (H3 and H5, or H5 and H7? Wait, no, in this case, it's a benzene ring, so each H is next to two others. So perhaps the splitting would be more complex. Alternatively, perhaps it would show as two doublets. But I think in the para-substituted benzoic acid (option B), the aromatic protons are more straightforward.

Alternatively, let's think about the downfield shift of the aromatic protons. The COOH group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the adjacent protons, making them appear downfield. So in option B, the protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more downfield than those ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5). So in the NMR, 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) would be those ortho to COOH, and 7.72 (d, 2H) ortho to Cl.

Now, the peak at 11 ppm is probably the COOH proton. But wait, why is it a singlet? Because in the NMR, a singlet suggests no neighboring protons. COOH has one proton, so it would be a singlet. But in reality, the COOH proton is usually broad, but in the question, it's a sharp singlet. Hmm, perhaps because it's in a deuterated solvent, or the peak is integrated but not broad? Or maybe it's an exchange process that's not being captured.

Another point: the IR shows a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. A benzoic acid's C=O is around 1700, but 1720 is a bit higher. Could it be an acid chloride? But option B is a benzoic acid, not an acid chloride. Acid chlorides have higher C=O stretching, around 1770-1800. So 1720 is more in line with a carboxylic acid. So that fits.

Now, looking back at the options, the only other option with Cl and a COOH group is option B and D. Option A has an aldehyde, which would require a different NMR and IR.

Wait, let me think about option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is benzaldehyde with Cl at position 3 and OH at position 2. The aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm. But the NMR shows a peak at 11 ppm. That's higher. So unless there's some other effect, maybe that's not it. Also, the IR would show a strong C=O peak around 1720 cm^-1 for the aldehyde, but also a broad O-H peak for the phenol (the OH group). So in this case, the IR would have both a broad peak (OH) and a strong C=O (aldehyde). But the 1H NMR would have an aldehyde proton, which is usually around 9.5-10.5 ppm, but as a triplet because of coupling with adjacent protons? Wait, no, aldehyde protons are usually singlets because there's no adjacent H (since it's R-CHO). So a singlet at ~10 ppm.

But in the given data, the singlet is at 11.0 ppm, which is a bit higher than typical for aldehydes. Also, the IR's C=O for an aldehyde is around 1700-1720, which fits the given data. But the aldehyde would also have a strong absorption around 2820 cm^-1 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, which isn't mentioned in the IR data. So maybe the IR data doesn't show that? Or perhaps the question doesn't mention all the peaks. But the given IR only mentions a broad peak and a sharp peak. So perhaps the aldehyde's C-H is not highlighted, but the C=O is.

But then, the NMR would have an aldehyde proton around 10 ppm, but the data is at 11. So maybe that's a stretch.

Alternatively, considering option B: the COOH proton is at 11 ppm as a singlet. That's plausible. Benzoic acids can have their COOH proton appear downfield, especially if it's in a more de-shielded position. Also, the IR's broad peak would correspond to the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid.

So, putting it all together, the data fits option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

But wait, let's double-check the molecular weight.

Option B: C7H5ClO2.

Carbon:7*12=84, Hydrogen:5=5, Cl:35.5, O:16*2=32. Total is 84+5+35.5+32=156.5. So M is 156.5, so the molecular ion is at 156. The M+2 is 158, which would be 25% of the total. But the question states M+2 is 32% of M, which doesn't align exactly. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula includes another Cl, but that doesn't fit any of the options.

But looking at the options, all the Cl-containing options (A, B, D) have a single Cl. So, the M+2 peak should be 25% of the M peak. But the question says M+2 is 32% of M. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is at 156, so the molecular weight is 156. So let's calculate the exact formula.

Wait, if M is 156, and the formula is C7H5ClO2, the exact mass would be 7*12 +5*1 +35.5 + 2*16 = 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. So M is at 156 (rounded down), and M+2 would be 158 (with 35.5 +2 =37.5? No, wait, Cl-35 is 35, Cl-37 is 37. So +2 would be Cl-37, so M+2 is 156 +2 =158. So the abundance ratio of M (Cl-35) to M+2 (Cl-37) would be 75:25. So the M peak is 75% of the total, and M+2 is 25%. But the question states M is 100% and M+2 is 32%. That doesn't align. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe the compound isn't a benzoic acid but something else with Cl. Let me reconsider.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Formula is C8H7ClO2. Molecular weight is 8*12 +7 +35.5 +32=96+7=103+35.5=138.5+32=170.5. So M would be 170. But the question says M is 156, so option C is out.

So back to A, B, D.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecular ion is at 156, but the actual molecular weight is 156. So perhaps the formula is different. Let's see:

Option B: C7H5ClO2 = 156.5. If the exact mass is 156.5, the molecular ion would be at m/z 156 and 157. But the question says M is 156 (100%), and M+2 is 158 (32%). So if the M is 156, M+2 is 158, which would imply the Cl is present. But then the calculation doesn't align with the abundance.

Hmm, maybe the compound has two Cl atoms. But none of the options have two Cls. So perhaps I'm getting stuck on the mass spec data. Let me think about other data points.

The 1H NMR has 11 ppm (s, 1H). If that's a COOH proton, which is a singlet, that fits. The aromatic protons as two doublets, which fits a para-substituted ring with two substituents. So looking back, the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong C=O, likely from a carboxylic acid. The broad peak in IR suggests an O-H.

So despite the mass spec possibly not aligning perfectly, the other data points more strongly suggest option B.


The question involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Here's the analysis of the given information and the options:

### Spectral Data Analysis:
1. **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**  
   - Molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** (100%) suggests a molecular weight of 156 g/mol.  
   - A peak at **m/z = 158** (32%) indicates the presence of chlorine (Cl), as the M+2 peak is due to the natural abundance of Cl-37.  

2. **IR Spectrum:**  
   - A **broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** suggests an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.  
   - A **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.  

3. **¹H NMR:**  
   - **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** is consistent with the proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH), which typically appears as a sharp singlet in the downfield region.  
   - **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** indicate two sets of aromatic protons, suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring.  

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
  This compound contains a benzaldehyde group, an aldehyde proton, and an -OH group. However, the aldehyde proton typically appears around 9-10 ppm in the NMR, not 11 ppm. Additionally, the IR spectrum would show a strong C-H stretch for the aldehyde, which is not mentioned. This option does not fit the data.

- **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic Acid**  
  This compound has a benzoic acid group (-COOH) and a chlorine atom in the para position. The **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** in the NMR corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton. The **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** match the aromatic protons of a para-substituted benzene ring. The IR spectrum aligns with the O-H stretch (broad peak) and the C=O stretch (sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹). The molecular weight of 156 g/mol matches the molecular ion peak, and the M+2 peak at 158 fits with the presence of chlorine. This option is consistent with all the data.

- **Option C: Phenyl Chloroformate**  
  The molecular formula of phenyl chloroformate is **C8H7ClO2**, giving a molecular weight of 170.5 g/mol. This does not match the molecular ion peak at 156, so this option is eliminated.

- **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic Acid**  
  This compound has a benzoic acid group and chlorine in the ortho position. The NMR pattern would differ from the given data because the aromatic protons would not produce two distinct doublets. Instead, the splitting would be more complex due to the proximity of the substituents. This option does not fit the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular ion peak, IR, and NMR, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The para-substitution pattern, the presence of a carboxylic acid group, and the molecular weight all align with this compound.

**Answer: B**
