Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of interpreting spectroscopy data. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about identifying an organic compound with the formula C9H11NO2. The data given includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different compounds, all of which seem to have a benzene ring and some substituents attached. Let's start by analyzing each piece of data.

First, the IR data. The medium to strong bands are at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. These are in the range of N-H stretching. Strong bands here usually indicate the presence of either amine or amide groups. Wait, but in amides, the N-H is usually a broad peak. Oh, right, in amides, the N-H stretch is usually around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹ and is often broad because of hydrogen bonding. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). So, looking at the options, all of them have a carbonyl except maybe one? Let me check the options again.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide would have a carbonyl, so yes, that fits the IR.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide also has a carbonyl.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is an ester, so the carbonyl would be from the ester. So yes, that should have a peak around 1720.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Benzoate ester has a carbonyl, so that also fits.

So all options have a carbonyl. Now, looking at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR shows several signals:
- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, likely from a CH2CH3 group. The triplet suggests coupling with a neighboring CH2, which is common for an ethyl group. So perhaps an ethyl ester or ethoxy group.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad singlet might indicate some exchange or perhaps an NH group, but wait, the IR suggested N-H. Alternatively, if it's an ethyl group attached to something else, like an oxygen, maybe an ethoxy group. Wait, but in ethoxy, the CH2 would be around 4.0-4.2 as a quartet, but this is a singlet. Hmm, maybe it's an NH group. But I thought the IR showed N-H.

Wait, the IR has strong bands at 3420 and 3325. If the compound has an amide, the N-H would be a broad peak. Alternatively, if it's an amine, like in option D (4-aminobenzoate), the NH would appear as a broad peak. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. That's confusing because amines typically have protons around 1-5 ppm, but more upfield. Wait, maybe it's something else.

Then, looking at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, integrating for 2H. Quartet with 2H suggests a -OCH2CH3 group. Because in an ethoxy group, the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm. Wait, but here it's at 4.5. Hmm. Alternatively, if it's a carbonyl adjacent group, like in an ester. Wait, in an ester, the structure is R-O-CO-R'. The OCH2CH3 would be split into a quartet
