Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, meaning it's kind of like a sphere but stretched along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. The problem is about the radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone. This power depends on a function f that's a function of λ and the angle θ measured from the z-axis. The question is asking about two things: the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at θ=30 degrees, and what form the function f takes.

The options given are A to D, each providing a fraction and a λ dependence. I need to choose the correct option.

Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation, and the radiation pattern depends on the geometry of the charge distribution and the oscillation. For a spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, I think it would have a certain radiation pattern. Maybe it's similar to a dipole radiator but more symmetric?

Wait, dipole radiation usually has a radiation pattern that peaks along the axis (θ=0 and 180 degrees), but perhaps for a spheroidal distribution, the pattern is different. Alternatively, maybe it's more like a quadrupole or something else, but no, spheroidal suggests it's symmetric around the axis.

Wait, the charge distribution is oscillating, so it's an accelerating charge. The power radiated by an accelerating charge depends on the acceleration and the properties of the charge distribution. I think the power radiated in electromagnetic waves from an oscillating charge is given by the Larmor formula, but that's for a point charge. Here, it's a distribution, so maybe it's similar but scaled.

The Larmor formula is P = ( (e^2 a² ) / (6πε₀ c³) ), where a is the acceleration. But when considering a distribution, perhaps the total power would be different, but the angular distribution would depend on the multipole expansion.

Wait, but the problem is about the angular dependence of the radiated power. In the radiation zone (which is far away from the source), the fields are dominated by the radiation fields, and the angular distribution can be determined by multipole expansion. For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern falls off as (
