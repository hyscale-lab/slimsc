Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

Compound A is C3H6. Hmm, that's either propene or propane. Wait, propene is C3H6, and propane is also C3H8. Oh wait, no, propene is C3H6 (alkene), and propane is C3H8 (alkane). So A must be propene because it's C3H6. Propene is also known as propylene.

Then, it undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. I remember that bromination in CCl4 is a free radical addition, usually adding across double bonds. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add bromine. Wait, but propene is CH2CH2CH3? Wait no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when bromine adds, it would add across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) plus Br2 would form 1,2-dibromopropane? Or maybe it's 1,1-dibromopropane? Wait, no, the addition of Br2 to an alkene typically adds across the double bond, leading to vicinal dibromide. So for propene, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3). So compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, often used for elimination reactions (E2). So when a vic-dibromide reacts with a strong base, it can eliminate to form an alkene. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating HBr from adjacent carbons would form propene again. Wait, but wait, depends on where the H is abstracted. So the reaction would produce propene (CH2=CHCH3) as compound C. So C is propene again? But wait, if you have 1,2-dibromopropane and eliminate, the possible alkenes could be 1-propene or 2-propene, but in this case, I think it's just propene as the major product because the structure is symmetric. So C is propene.

But wait, another possibility: when you have 1,2-dibromide, elimination can give 1-propene or 2-propene. Wait, 1-propene is CH2=CH2CH3, and 2-propene is CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, 2-propene would be CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that's the same as propene. Oh wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me think again. The structure of B is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Or wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, giving CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So when this reacts with KOH (alcoholic), it would eliminate two HBr molecules. The possible products would be either 1-propene or 2-propene, but wait, in propene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So when you eliminate from 1,2-dibromide, you can form either the same double bond or perhaps a different position. Wait, perhaps that's not possible. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCHBrCH3? No, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3, so adding Br2 would add to the double bond. So the structure would be CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, adding Br2 to CH2=CHCH3 would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So the molecule is BrCH2CHBrCH3? No, I think for propene, adding Br2 across the double bond gives
