Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question says that the supernova ejecta and the Galaxy are both inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Oh wait, that makes sense because in the ejecta's frame, it's stationary, and everything else is moving the opposite way.

Wait, the problem is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So I need to find the distance in the Galaxy's reference frame, not the ejecta's.

I remember that when dealing with different reference frames, especially with high speeds like a significant fraction of the speed of light, time dilation and length contraction come into play. But wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so maybe those factors aren't needed here.

So, the ejecta sees the Galaxy moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second for easier calculations, but maybe I don't need to since the answer is in km. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Wait, but the speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 6e4 is 0.2 times c. So v = 0.2c. That's a significant speed
