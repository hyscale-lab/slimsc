Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these synthesis questions can get tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. So the substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. That's a bulky group, which might be relevant for some reaction mechanism, but I'll note that.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. Hmm, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and elevated temps probably indicate some elimination or substitution.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Let me visualize that. So the cyclohexene has substituents at carbons 5 and 6, each being a dibromomethyl group. So each of those positions has two bromines attached to a methyl group. So the structure is like two CH2Br2 groups attached to adjacent carbons in a cyclohexene ring.

I think the reaction here might be a Diels-Alder reaction. Because the starting material is a diene (the bicyclo compound has two double bonds, but wait, no, wait. Wait, hepta-2,5-diene has two double bonds? Wait, no, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane which has a bridge, right? So the structure has two double bonds? Or is it a single conjugated diene?

Wait, no, wait. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dieneâ€”so positions 2 and 5 are double bonds. So that's a conjugated diene in the norbornene system. So it's a diene. And the other molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. That's a dienophile because cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the dienophile is the molecule with a double bond that can react in Diels-Alder. But in this case, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene: the main part is a cyclohexene with substituents (dibromomethyl) at positions 5 and 6. So the double bond is between 1 and 3? No, wait, 1,3-diene would be positions 1-2 and 3-4 as double bonds? Hmm, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, making it a conjugated diene. Wait, but 1,3-diene would imply a single isolated diene? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction. The starting material is a diene (norbornene derivative), and the other molecule has two dibromomethyl groups attached; perhaps the reaction is a Diels-Alder between the norbornene's diene and the cyclohexene's dienophile.

Wait, but wait: in Diels-Alder, the diene is the conjugated diene, and the dienophile is a molecule with a double bond (like a ketone, or another dienophile). Alternatively, the other molecule might have a triple bond, but in this case, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has a conjugated diene. Wait, that would imply that the dienophile is the cyclohexene diene? No, that doesn't make sense because the Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile which is a single double bond. So perhaps the 5,6
