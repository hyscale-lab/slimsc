Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the probability of measuring a particular observable. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem states that the system's state at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that doesn't look normalized. Oh right, quantum states need to be normalized vectors, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of their components should be 1. So I should probably first normalize this state vector.

Let me compute the norm. The components are -1, 2, 1. So the squares are 1, 4, and 1. Adding those gives 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6), right? So the normalized state vector would be each component divided by sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Next, the observable is represented by the matrix operator P. Let me write down P again. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So it's a 3x3 matrix.

Wait, the question is about the probability of measuring 0 when we measure this observable. In quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P because those are the possible results when measuring the observable. Then, if 0 is an eigenvalue, the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

Alternatively, maybe I can diagonalize P to find its eigenvalues. Alternatively, perhaps P is already diagonal in some basis, but I'm not sure. Let me try to compute the eigenvalues of P.

Wait, let's see what P looks like. Let me write it down:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

Hmm, that looks like a symmetric matrix, which is good because symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues and are diagonalizable. So, the eigenvalues of P are real.

To find the eigenvalues, I'll have to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

But maybe there's a smarter way, considering the structure of P. Let me see if it's a tridiagonal matrix, which it is. Maybe I can find the eigenvalues by looking for patterns or using some properties.

Alternatively, perhaps I can guess the eigenvalues. Let me think: possible eigenvalues could be, considering the structure, maybe 1, 0, and -1? Because the matrix seems to have elements that are 1/sqrt(2), which suggests that the eigenvalues might be ±1, but let me check that.

Wait, perhaps I can make a smarter approach. Let me look for eigenvectors. Let me try to find if there's an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

So, for P |v> = 0.

So, (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

Let me write down the equations:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → (v1 + v3)/sqrt(2) = 0 → v1 = -v3.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → same as row 1: v2=0.

So the system reduces to v2=0, and v1 = -v3. So any vector of the form (a, 0, -a) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

So 0 is indeed an eigenvalue, and the eigenspace is two-dimensional? Wait, no, because when we have v2=0 and v1 = -v3, the solution is a vector (a, 0, -a), which is a one-dimensional eigenspace. So the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 is 1, I think. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the matrix is 3x3, and the equations lead to two constraints. Let me see:

Wait, the equations are:

From row 1: v2=0.

From row 2: v1 + v3 =0.

From row 3: v2=0.

So the only constraints are v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So the eigenvectors are any vector where v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So the eigenspace is two-dimensional? No, because the third equation is redundant. Wait, the system has three variables, but only two independent equations. So the eigenspace for λ=0 is two-dimensional? Let me see.

Wait, the rank of the matrix (P) when λ=0 is 2? Because P has two linearly independent rows. Let me see:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2}, 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: same as row 1.

Wait, row 3 is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], same as row 1. So rank is 2 because rows 1 and 2 are linearly independent. So the null space has dimension 3 - 2 =1. So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional. So the algebraic multiplicity of λ=0 is 1.

Wait, that's confusing, but perhaps I should proceed.

Now, the possible eigenvalues are 0, 1, and something else. Let's check for λ=1.

Wait, maybe I can instead compute the trace. The trace of P is the sum of the diagonals. So the diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So the trace is 0. The trace is the sum of the eigenvalues. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So if one of them is 0, the other two must add to zero. So possible eigenvalues are 0, a, -a.

Wait, let me think about the determinant. The determinant of P is the product of the eigenvalues. Let me compute the determinant of P. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant.

The matrix P is:

0   (1/√2)   0

(1/√2) 0   (1/√2)

0   (1/√2) 0

Hmm, computing determinant for a 3x3 matrix. Let me use the first row to expand.

The determinant is:

0 * det(minor) - (1/sqrt(2)) * det(minor) + 0 * det(minor).

So only the middle term contributes.

The minor for the (1,2) element is the 2x2 matrix formed by removing row 1 and column 2.

So that's:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) → columns 1 and 3 are 1/sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(2).

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 → columns 1 and 3 are 0 and 0.

So the minor matrix is:

[1/sqrt(2) , 1/sqrt(2)]
[0         , 0         ]

The determinant of this is (1/sqrt(2)*0) - (1/sqrt(2)*0) ) = 0.

So the determinant of P is 0 * 0 - (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + 0 * ... = 0. So determinant is 0.

So the eigenvalues include 0, and the product of the other two eigenvalues (a and -a) would be 0 as well. Wait, no, the product of eigenvalues is determinant, which is 0, so at least one eigenvalue is zero, which we've already established.

But for the other eigenvalues, let's try to find them.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by considering the matrix's structure. Another approach: maybe the matrix P can be written in terms of some other operators, or perhaps it's a tensor product or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can look for eigenvalues by assuming some eigenvectors. Let me try a vector with all components equal. Let me pick v = (1, 1, 1). Let's see what P does to it.

P * v:

Row 1: 0*1 + (1/√2)*1 + 0*1 = 1/√2.

Row 2: (1/√2)*1 + 0*1 + (1/√2)*1 = (1 +1)/√2 = 2/√2 = sqrt(2).

Row 3: 0*1 + (1/√2)*1 + 0*1 = 1/√2.

So P*v = [1/√2, sqrt(2), 1/√2]^T.

Hmm, that doesn't look like a scalar multiple of v. So maybe that's not an eigenvector.

Let me try another approach. Suppose an eigenvector v = (a, b, a), because in the previous case for λ=0, v2 is zero, and v1 and v3 are negatives. So perhaps symmetry can be exploited.

Wait, for another approach, perhaps I can make a guess that the eigenvalues are 1 and -1, but let's check for λ=1.

So for λ=1, the matrix P - I is:

Row 1: -1, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Row 2:1/sqrt(2), -1, 1/sqrt(2).

Row 3:0, 1/sqrt(2), -1.

We can try to see if there's a non-trivial solution to (P - I) v = 0.

Let me set up the equations:

- v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 → v1 = (1/sqrt(2)) v2.

(1/sqrt(2)) v1 - v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0.

(1/sqrt(2)) v2 - v3 = 0 → v3 = (1/sqrt(2)) v2.

Wait, substituting v1 and v3 in terms of v2. Let's see:

From first equation: v1= v2/sqrt(2).

From third equation: v3= v2/sqrt(2).

Now substitute into the second equation:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (v2/sqrt(2)) ) - v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) * (v2/sqrt(2)) ) = 0.

Simplify each term:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (v2/sqrt(2)) = v2/(2).

Similarly, third term is same, v2/(2).

So equation becomes:

v2/(2) - v2 + v2/(2) = 0.

Let me compute:

v2/(2) + v2/(2) is v2. So v2 - v2 = 0 → 0=0.

So the equations are consistent. So any vector of the form (a, a*sqrt(2), a) where a is a scalar, is an eigenvector with λ=1.

Wait, because v1 = v2/sqrt(2) → v2 = v1 * sqrt(2).

Wait, no, earlier we have v1 = v2 / sqrt(2) → v2 = v1 * sqrt(2).

So if I choose v1 = a, then v2 = a*sqrt(2), and v3 = a.

So the vector is (a, a*sqrt(2), a). So that's an eigenvector for λ=1.

Similarly, perhaps there's another eigenvalue, say λ=-1.

Let me check if (a, -a*sqrt(2), a) is an eigenvector for λ=-1.

Apply P - (-1) I = P + I.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute P*v and see if it's -v.

Let v be (1, -sqrt(2), 1).

Compute P * v:

Row 1: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-sqrt(2)) + 0*1 = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-sqrt(2)) = -1.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*(-sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2))*1 = (1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2)) )= 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

Row 3: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-sqrt(2)) + 0*1 = (1/sqrt(2))*(-sqrt(2)) )= -1.

So P*v = [ -1, sqrt(2), -1 ]^T.

Hmm, that's not equal to -v, which would be [ -1, sqrt(2), -1 ]? Wait a minute, v is [1, -sqrt(2), 1], so -v is [-1, sqrt(2), -1], which matches P*v. So yes, this vector is an eigenvector with eigenvalue λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 1, -1, and 0.

So when you measure the observable P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.

The question is asking for the probability of measuring 0.

In quantum mechanics, the probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 in the state vector.

Wait, but wait. The state vector is a column vector (state vector), and the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis if they are orthogonal. So the state can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenvectors, and the coefficients (amplitudes) give the probabilities.

So, the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

We need to find the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace corresponding to λ=0.

Earlier, we found that the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form (a, 0, -a). So any such vector is in the eigenspace.

Let me pick a specific eigenvector for λ=0. Let's take a=1, so the eigenvector is |e0> = (1, 0, -1)^T. But we need to normalize this, right? Because eigenvectors are only defined up to a scalar.

The norm of |e0> is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Earlier, when solving for λ=0, the equations gave v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So the eigenvector is any vector of the form (a, 0, -a). So for a=1, it's (1,0,-1). But let's normalize it, so |e0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Now, the probability of measuring 0 is |<e0|ψ>|^2.

Compute the inner product <e0|ψ>:

= [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] · [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]

= (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

Third term: (-1) * (1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )= same as first term, so (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

So sum of these terms: (-1)/(2√3) + 0 + (-1)/(2√3) = (-2)/(2√3) = (-1)/√3.

The absolute value squared is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the answer should be C.


To calculate the probability of measuring 0 for the observable represented by the matrix operator \( P \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Normalize the state vector
The given state vector is \( \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). The norm is computed as:
\[
\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]
Thus, the normalized state vector is:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/\sqrt{6} \\ 2/\sqrt{6} \\ 1/\sqrt{6} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Identify the eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is given by:
\[
P = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\
1/\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\sqrt{2} \\
0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). By analyzing the structure of \( P \), we determine that the eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 1, -1, 0 \).

### Step 3: Find the eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector satisfies \( P|v\rangle = 0 \). Solving the equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_3 = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0,
\end{cases}
\]
we find that \( v_2 = 0 \) and \( v_1 = -v_3 \). A normalized eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is:
\[
|e_0\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1/\sqrt{2} \\ 0 \\ -1/\sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the probability of measuring 0
The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of \( |e_0\rangle \) in \( |\psi\rangle \). The inner product is:
\[
\langle e_0 | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 & -1/\sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -1/\sqrt{6} \\ 2/\sqrt{6} \\ 1/\sqrt{6} \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
\langle e_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
The absolute value squared is:
\[
|\langle e_0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
