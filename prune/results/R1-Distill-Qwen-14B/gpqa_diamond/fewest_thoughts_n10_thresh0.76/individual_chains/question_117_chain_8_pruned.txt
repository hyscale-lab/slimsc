Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Let me try to think through it step by step. I remember that optical isomerism, also known as enantiomerism, occurs when a compound has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. This makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image, leading to the possibility of enantiomers.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which ones exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, this sounds a bit complex. So, it's a biphenyl structure with substituents. The substituents are nitro groups on the 6 positions of each benzene ring and carboxylate groups on the 2 positions. Each benzene ring is connected to a methyl ester group. Wait, but does this molecule have a chiral center? I'm not sure. Let me visualize it. Each benzene is connected at the 1 position, so the biphenyl is like two benzene rings linked. The substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6. In the case of the carboxylate groups, each is attached to a methyl ester. But wait, on each benzene ring, let's see: the positions are 2, 6, and the connection (1). So, for each phenyl group, there's a COOCH3 group at 2, nitro at 6, and the biphenyl at 1. But wait, does that create a chiral center in the biphenyl system? Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself can have axial chirality. Oh right, biphenyls can exhibit a form of chirality if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule isn't flat. So if the substituents on each benzene are in positions that can't be superimposed on their mirror images, the molecule might be chiral. In this case, the substituents are on 2 and 6 of each ring. Wait, does that lead to a possibility of axial chirality? Because in biphenyls, when you have substituents on each ring in positions that are not symmetrical, the arrangement around the central bond can be
