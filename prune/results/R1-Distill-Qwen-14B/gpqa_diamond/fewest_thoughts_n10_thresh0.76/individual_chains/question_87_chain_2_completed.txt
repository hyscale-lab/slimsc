Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound that has a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm, let's break this down. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, right? So the benzene ring has two substituents. The molecule has a total of 8 carbons. Benzene itself has 6 carbons, so the substituents add up to 2 more carbons. Wait, but wait, each substituent could be more than one carbon. Oh wait, no, because if it's di-substituted, each substituent is possibly a group attached to the ring. So let me think.

Wait, the total number of carbons is 8. Benzene is 6, so substituents contribute 2 carbons. But each substituent could be a group with multiple carbons. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and another is an aromatic halogen. Wait, in the IR, there's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are likely a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen, right?

Wait, but wait: aromatic halogen. So one substituent is a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, etc.), and the other substituent is a carbonyl group, perhaps as an acyl group attached to the ring. Wait, but the ring is 6 membered, so the substituents could be in para, meta, or ortho positions. Since it's di-substituted, that's two substituents.

So substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Let's think about the possible structures.

Wait, but the carbonyl group is likely part of a larger substituent. For example, maybe a substituent like an acetyl group (COCH3) and a halogen. But wait, let me count the carbons.

Wait, the ring has 6 carbons. The substituents would each be a group that adds their own carbons. If the substituents are -X (like Cl) and -CO-R, then let's see. For example, if one substituent is a Cl (no carbons) and the other is a carbonyl-containing group like -COCH3 (which has two carbons: the carbonyl carbon and the CH3). So that would add 2 carbons, making the total 6 + 2 = 8. Yes, that fits.

Wait, but wait, the substituent could be another structure. For example, maybe a ketone substituent like -COCH2CH3. That would add three carbons, but then the total would be 6 +3 =9 which is more than 8. So that can't be. So perhaps the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group or something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached directly, like a ketone. So the substituent would be, say, a COCH3 group. So that's two carbons. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3, making the total 6 + (0 + 2) =8.

Wait, another possibility: one substituent is a carbonyl group, say a ketone (like -CO-) but that's just one substituent. But no, wait, I have two substituents: one is a halogen (like Cl), and the other is a carbonyl-containing group. So perhaps one substituent is a halogen (Cl, Br, etc.), and the other is a group like -COCH3, which adds two carbons. So that would make the total 6 + (0 + 2) =8.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with two substituents: one Cl and one COCH3. Let's think about the positions. Since it's di-substituted, they could be para, meta, or ortho.

But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl group and a halogen. So that's correct.

Now, looking at the NMR options, we can analyze each one.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s).

Hmm. A singlet at 9.9 ppm is quite upfield. That's a strong shift, perhaps an aldehyde proton? But wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But in this case, if the substituent is a COCH3, there's no aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton, but that's less likely. Wait, but wait. Wait, if there's a carbonyl group, maybe it's an acetylene, but no, that's probably not. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an aromatic aldehyde, but then the ring would have a substituent with an aldehyde group, which would require another substituent for the di-substitution. Hmm, but in that case, the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (aldehyde) + perhaps another substituent, but perhaps not.

Wait, but the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. So if the substituent is a COCH3 group, then in the NMR, the CH3 would be a singlet around 2.1 ppm (if it's COCH3), but option A doesn't have that. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a ketone, but that has no protons attached.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group in a different position. Wait, maybe one substituent is a COCH2Cl, but that's adding more carbons. Wait, but the total is 8. Let me count again: benzene (6) + substituent 1 (Cl, 0) + substituent 2 (COCH3, 2) = 8. That works.

In that case, the substituents are Cl and COCH3. So where are they attached? If they're para, then the substituents are opposite each other. Otherwise, meta or ortho.

But the NMR would show signals from the aromatic protons, the CH3 group in COCH3, and any other protons.

Looking at option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). That 2.3 ppm singlet suggests a CH3 connected to something deshielded, like a carbonyl. So the 3H singlet would be from a CH3 attached to a carbonyl, like in COCH3. The aromatic signals are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests para substitution, because in para substitution, each pair of aromatic protons would be in a doublet, as each is coupled to two adjacent Hs. Or wait, in para substitution, each aromatic H would have two substituents, but perhaps the coupling is between the two sets.

Wait, if substituents are para, the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets. For example, if you have two substituents para to each other, the ring would have two sets of aromatic Hs, each as a doublet. So in the NMR, you'd see two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches option C.

But wait, in option C, the 2.3 ppm is a singlet integrating to 3H, which would fit the COCH3 group. So in that case, the substituents are Cl and COCH3, which together account for 8 carbons.

Wait, but wait, the substituent COCH3 contributes 2 carbons (CO and CH3), and the Cl adds nothing. So 6 + 2 =8. Correct.

So in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be in two doublets. Let's think about the structure: the benzene ring with Cl and COCH3 in para positions. The aromatic protons would be in two sets. For example, the protons adjacent to Cl would be in one doublet, and those adjacent to COCH3 in another. Each set would be a doublet because each H is next to two others.

Wait, but another possibility: the substituents are para, so the H's across from each other would be equivalent. So each set of H's would be a doublet. So the NMR would show two doublets, each 2H. That's what option C has: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). Also, the COCH3 group would give a singlet at around 2.3 ppm for the CH3.

So that seems to fit. So option C would be the correct NMR.

But wait, let me check the other options.

Option A: 9.9 ppm is a singlet (maybe an aldehyde, but why would there be an aldehyde here?), 7.8 and 7.6 as doublets. Then 3.7 ppm as 2H singlet. That would imply a CH2 group next to something. Maybe an OCH2 group? Like a methoxy group attached to something else. But in our case, the substituents are Cl and COCH3, so OCH2 wouldn't be part of it.

Option B: 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are doublets. These are around the region for protons adjacent to oxygen, like in an ether or something. Then 1.3 ppm as a singlet, maybe a CH3 group attached to something. Not sure how this fits. The substituents we're considering don't have such groups, so probably B is not correct.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 1H singlet at 6.9 is in the aromatic region, but a singlet suggests no neighboring Hs. But in a di-substituted benzene (para), the aromatic Hs are in two doublets, so D doesn't match that. Plus, the 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are likely for some CH2 groups, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen, but again, not matching our substituents.

So, back to option C: the NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic protons, and a singlet for the COCH3 group. So the structure would be p-chloroacetophenone (or something similar), where the substituents are Cl and COCH3 para to each other.

Another thing: the IR shows an aromatic-halogen bond, which is a C-X bond (like C-Cl). So that's correct.

So, the correct option is C.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (C-X). This suggests the substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (e.g., Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group, such as -COCH3. The total carbon count is consistent: 6 carbons from the benzene ring, 0 from the halogen, and 2 from the -COCH3 group, summing to 8 carbons.

The NMR data must reflect this structure. The aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring with -Cl and -COCH3 would split into two sets of doublets, as each set of aromatic protons is coupled to adjacent protons. The -COCH3 group would contribute a singlet for its methyl protons (3H) at around 2.3 ppm. Additionally, the aromatic protons would appear in the range of 7.6â€“7.8 ppm as two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which is inconsistent with the expected structure (no aldehyde group is present). Additionally, the 3.7 ppm singlet (2H) does not match the -COCH3 group. This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Contains signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are characteristic of protons adjacent to oxygen (e.g., in ethers or alcohols). These are not consistent with the substituents in the expected structure. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Shows two doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H), consistent with the aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. A singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H) corresponds to the methyl group of the -COCH3 substituent. This option matches the expected structure.
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H), which is inconsistent with the para-substituted benzene ring (aromatic protons should appear as doublets). Additionally, the signals at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm suggest protons adjacent to oxygen, which are not part of the expected structure. This option is incorrect.

The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, which matches the structure of a para-substituted benzene ring with -Cl and -COCH3 groups.

Answer: C
