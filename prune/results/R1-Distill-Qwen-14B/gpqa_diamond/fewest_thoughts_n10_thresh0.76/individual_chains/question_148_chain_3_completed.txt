Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these types of questions. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. The problem describes various substances A1 through A5 and some reactions they undergo. My goal is to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Hmm, I think I should break down the information given for each substance. Let's go one by one.

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So, A1 is probably a strong oxidizing agent.

Wait, what's a bright-red compound with fluorine? I'm trying to think. Oh! I remember that potassium permanganate (KMnO4) is dark purple, but maybe something like manganese in a higher oxidation state? Or perhaps another element. Wait, fluorine is involved, so maybe A1 is a fluorinated compound.

Wait, another thought. Let's think about the decomposition. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2 (fluorine gas). So the reaction would be something like A1 → A2 + F2. Since fluorine is a product, maybe A1 has F in a lower oxidation state than A2. Because decomposition could mean releasing F2, which is in a higher oxidation state than if it were part of a compound.

Wait, but fluorine is an element, so perhaps A1 is something like YF3? No, wait, if it decomposes into Y... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a compound that, upon decomposition, releases F2. For example, if A1 is YF, which upon decomposition forms Y and F2. But then F2 is a product, but I don't think that's typical.

Wait, another approach. Since A1 oxidizes xenon, which is a noble gas, that suggests A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon is usually unreactive, so the oxidizing agent must be strong enough to react with it. What about fluorine? Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, but in its elemental form, it's F2. So maybe A1 isn't F2 itself but another compound.

Wait, another angle: let's think of known red compounds. KMnO4 is dark purple, but MnO2 is black. Maybe Y is manganese? Because Mn can form multiple fluorides. Let's consider Y as Mn.

So, if Y is Mn, what are the possible binary compounds with fluorine? MnF2, MnF3, MnF4, Mn2F5, MnF6? Hmm, wait, I might be getting that wrong. Alternatively, I think Mn can form MnF2, MnF3, MnF4, Mn2F5, etc. But I'm not sure about the colors.

Wait, but the decomposition of A1 produces A2 and F2. So, if A1 is MnF2, maybe when it decomposes, it releases F2. But MnF2 is greenish, I think. Alternatively, maybe A1 is MnF3, which is a different color. Wait, but what's the color of MnF3? I'm not exactly sure, but I'm trying to think which Mn fluoride is red.

Wait, maybe it's not manganese. Another element that forms multiple fluorides and has colored compounds. Chlorine? No, Cl is a halogen. Wait, maybe Y is another element like iodine, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something else.

Wait, another thought: A1 is a bright-red compound that upon decomposition releases F2. When I think of fluorine compounds that release F2 upon decomposition, I might think of a fluorinated oxide. Wait, no, perhaps it's a fluorinated peroxide? Or maybe a compound that, when heated, breaks down into F2.

Wait, but peroxides decompose to release O2, so maybe something similar. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a compound like YF5, which upon decomposition gives YF3 and F2. For example, if Y is boron? No, boron trifluoride is colorless, I think.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the oxidation states. Let's see: when A1 decomposes, it produces F2. So A1 must have F in a lower oxidation state than in F2. Because when compounds decompose into elements, the elements are in their standard states. F in F2 is 0. So if A1 has F in a -1 state (like in many fluorides), then decomposition would mean F being oxidized to 0. Wait, no, that's probably not right. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a compound where F is in a higher oxidation state, and decomposition releases F2.

Wait, another idea: perhaps A1 is a compound like YF5, which upon heating decomposes into YF3 and F2. Let me think about that. For example, if Y is phosphorus, PF5 is a compound that might decompose. But PF5 is colorless, I think. Alternatively, maybe Y is chlorine, but that's a halogen, and ClF3 is a thing, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible substances step by step. Let's go back to the question.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 is likely YF. Or perhaps YF2, YF3, etc., depending on the valency of Y. But without knowing Y, it's tricky.

Then, A4 is a solution—probably a compound in solution. When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated colorless solution of A4, A5 is obtained. Then, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances.

Wait, the colorless concentrated solution—maybe it's a solution of YF5? Because some fluorides are colorless. Alternatively, maybe A4 is an acid, like HFO (but that's not a common compound). Or perhaps A4 is something else.

Wait, let's consider another approach. Let's think about the possible A5. When A5 decomposes in water, it forms two substances. So perhaps it's a decomposition into an acid and another compound. For example, maybe A5 is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces H+ ions and another component, like a gas. Or perhaps it breaks into two elements or simple compounds.

Wait, another thought: if A4 is a solution and adding Y (in 1:1 molar ratio) gives A5, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. For example, if A4 is HFO (hypofluorite?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a fluoride salt. For example, if A4 is NaF, but adding Y (maybe another Na salt?) doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF3, and adding Y in solid form may not change much. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, let's think about the decomposition of A5 in water. If A5 is a fluoride, adding water could lead to hydrolysis. For example, CaF2 is insoluble in water, but maybe some other fluoride would hydrolyze.

Wait, perhaps A5 is a metal fluoride that hydrolyzes to form a weak acid and a base. For example, something like CF2Cl2 might not be, but let's think of NaF. NaF in water doesn't decompose; it just dissociates into Na+ and F-.

Wait, maybe A5 is an acid fluoride. For example, if A5 is something like SiF4, which in water would hydrolyze to produce HF and another product. Let me think: SiF4 + 2 H2O → H2SiO3 + 4 HF. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe A5 is another type of compound. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the decomposition of A1. If A1 is a compound that upon decomposition gives A2 and F2, and A1 oxidizes xenon, which is a strong oxidizer.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A1 is a compound like KClO3, which decomposes into KCl and O2 upon heating. But in this case, it's F2 being released. So maybe A1 is a compound like YF5 that decomposes into YF3 and F2.

Wait, if Y is phosphorus, then YF5 is PF5. PF5 is a colorless liquid, but wait, the problem mentions a bright-red substance. Hmm, maybe PF5 isn't red. Alternatively, could it be something else?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the other parts. A3 can also interact with xenon. So A3 is a compound that reacts with xenon, probably acting as an oxidizing agent or something.

Wait, another idea: perhaps A1 is a compound like YF4. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me consider the possible Y element. Since there are five binary compounds with fluorine, Y must have multiple oxidation states. For example, phosphorus can form PF3, PF5; chlorine forms ClF, ClF3, ClF5. Manganese can form MnF2, MnF3, MnF4, etc.

Wait, the number of binary compounds is five. Let me think about elements that form five binary fluorides. Hmm, chlorine forms ClF, ClF3, ClF5, but that's three. Wait, no, maybe I'm misremembering. Alternatively, perhaps Y is phosphorus, which can form PF3, PF5, maybe others. Or perhaps Y is oxygen? No, oxygen's compounds are O2, but that's not a binary compound with F.

Wait, another angle: the decomposition of A1 gives A2 and F2. Let's write the equation. Suppose A1 is YFn. Then, upon decomposition, it produces A2 (YFm) and F2. So the reaction would be something like YFn → YFm + F2. Let's balance that.

Wait, for example, let's say YF5 → YF3 + F2. The balanced equation would be YF5 → YF3 + F2. To balance fluorine atoms, let's see: YF5 → YF3 + F2. On the left, 5 F atoms. On the right, (3 + 2*2) = 7 F. Wait, that doesn't add up. So maybe 2 YF5 → 2 YF3 + F2. Let's check: 2*(5) =10 F on the left, 2*(3) + 2 =8 on the right. No, that's not balanced.

Alternatively, maybe another stoichiometry. Let's try YF2 → Y + F2. Then, the equation would be YF2 → Y + F2. Balancing fluorine: 2 F on left, 2*1 on right. So it's balanced as YF2 → Y + F2. But in that case, decomposition would produce Y and F2. But the problem says A2 is produced, so perhaps A2 is Y, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the oF for A2 is 31.96%. Oh! That's the percentage of fluorine by mass. Wait, so A2 is a compound where F is 31.96% by mass. Let me calculate the possible formula.

Let's let the formula of A2 be YF_x. The percentage of F is (atomic weight of F * x) / (atomic weight of Y + x*atomic weight of F) ) * 100 = 31.96%.

Atomic weight of F is about 19 g/mol. Let's suppose Y has an atomic weight of M. Then,

(19x)/(M + 19x) * 100 = 31.96.

Let me solve for possible x and M.

Divide both sides by 100:

(19x)/(M + 19x) = 0.3196.

Cross-multiplying: 19x = 0.3196 * (M + 19x)

19x = 0.3196 M + 0.3196 *19x

Bring terms with x to left:

19x - (0.3196 *19 x) = 0.3196 M

Factor x:

19x (1 - 0.3196) = 0.3196 M

Calculate (1 - 0.3196) = 0.6804.

So,

19 * 0.6804 x = 0.3196 M.

Compute 19 * 0.6804 ≈ 12.9276.

So,

12.9276 x = 0.3196 M

Divide both sides by 0.3196:

M = (12.9276 / 0.3196) x ≈ 40.5 x.

So M ≈ 40.5 x.

Looking for x and M where x is an integer (since it's a binary compound), and M is the atomic weight of Y.

So let's consider possible x values and compute M:

x=1 → M≈40.5 g/mol. Possible Y candidates with ~40 g/mol: titanium (Ti, ~48), maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps Y is calcium (40). Wait, x=1 would give M=40.5. Close to Ca (about 40). So Y could be Ca, and A2 is CaF.

But wait, CaF is not a stable compound; it's more likely that Ca forms CaF2. Hmm, maybe x=2.

x=2 → M ≈81 g/mol. Hmm, 81 is close to the atomic weight of Y being around that. But that's higher than most elements. Wait, Y is likely a lighter element, as fluorine compounds are more common with lighter elements.

x=3 → M ≈121.5 g/mol. That's way too high. Unlikely, as most elements have lower atomic weights.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check the math again.

Equation:

(19x) / (M + 19x) ) = 0.3196

Cross-multiplying:

19x = 0.3196 M + 0.3196 *19x

Bring terms together:

19x - 0.3196 *19x = 0.3196 M

19x (1 - 0.3196) = 0.3196 M

19x * 0.6804 = 0.3196 M

So,

M = (19x * 0.6804) / 0.3196

Compute numerator: 19 *0.6804 ≈ 12.9276.

So,

M = (12.9276 x) / 0.3196 ≈ 40.5 x

So same result as before.

So x must be such that M is a reasonable atomic weight. Let me try x=1 again. M=40.5. Possible Y is Ca (40), but CaF is not a common compound. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, another approach: perhaps Y is phosphorus. Phosphorus has an atomic weight around 31. Let's see if that fits.

If Y is P (atomic weight ~31), then for A2 (YF x), the fluorine percentage is 31.96%.

So,

(19x)/(31 +19x) = 0.3196

Multiply both sides by denominator:

19x = 0.3196 * (31 + 19x)

19x = 0.3196*31 + 0.3196*19x

Calculate 0.3196 *31 ≈ 9.8976

0.3196 *19 ≈ 6.0724

So,

19x = 9.8976 + 6.0724 x

Bring terms with x to left:

19x -6.0724x =9.8976

12.9276 x ≈9.8976

x ≈9.8976 /12.9276 ≈0.765. Hmm, x is not an integer, which is a problem because x should be an integer. So maybe Y isn't phosphorus.

Alternative approach: perhaps Y is chlorine. Chlorine's atomic weight is about 35.5.

Wait, let's try Y is Cl (atomic weight ~35.5).

So,

(19x)/(35.5 +19x )=0.3196

Multiply both sides:

19x =0.3196*(35.5 +19x )

19x = 0.3196*35.5 + 0.3196*19x

Calculate 0.3196*35.5 ≈11.3402

0.3196*19 ≈6.0724

So,

19x =11.3402 +6.0724 x

19x -6.0724x =11.3402

12.9276 x =11.3402

x=11.3402 /12.9276 ≈0.880. Not an integer again.

Hmm, this isn't working. Let me think of another element. Maybe Y is oxygen? No, it's atomic weight is ~16.

Wait, but Y must form five binary compounds with F, which suggests it has multiple oxidation states. Let me think of elements that have multiple possible charges. For example, nitrogen can form NF3, NF5? Wait, but I'm not sure about NF5. Alternatively, perhaps Y is sulfur. Hmm, S can form SF2, SF4, SF6, but I'm not sure if that's five.

Wait, but if A2 has a fluorine content of 31.96%, perhaps I should look for a compound where that percentage makes sense.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the molecular weight of A2. Let me assume A2 is YF_x. The percentage of F is 31.96%.

So,

(M_F * x) / (M_Y + M_F * x) ) =0.3196

M_F is 19, so,

19x =0.3196 (M_Y +19x )

19x=0.3196 M_Y + 6.0724 x

19x -6.0724 x =0.3196 M_Y

12.9276 x =0.3196 M_Y

So,

M_Y = (12.9276 / 0.3196) x ≈40.5 x

So M_Y is approximately 40.5 times x.

Hmm, possible x values and M_Y that would make sense.

If x=1, M_Y≈40.5. That suggests Y is calcium (about 40).

If x=2, M_Y≈81. No, that's too high; no element is around 81 for x=2.

Wait, perhaps Y is calcium, and A2 is CaF.

But CaF isn't a stable compound; it's more likely to form CaF2. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element with M_Y around 40.5 for x=1.

Wait, perhaps Y is titanium (atomic weight ~48). No, that would be x=1 gives M_Y=40.5, which doesn't fit Ti.

Hmm, another thought: maybe I made a mistake in the percentage calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the oF is 31.96% for A2. So,

(F's mass) / (A2's molar mass) =0.3196.

So,

(19x)/(M_Y +19x) =0.3196.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps x=2 gives M_Y=81. That would be too high. Alternatively, maybe Y is an element with a higher atomic weight, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong, and A2 isn't YF_x. Maybe it's something else. Alternatively, could it be that A2 is a diatomic molecule or something else?

Alternatively, perhaps A2 is F2 itself. But that wouldn't make sense because the decomposition is of A1 into A2 and F2. So A2 can't be F2, because then both products would be F2, but the problem says A2 is produced along with F2.

Wait, maybe I'm on the wrong track trying to find Y based on A2. Let me think about A1 and the decomposition.

A1 is a bright-red compound. I'm trying to think of fluorine compounds that are bright red. Wait, maybe it's MnO2? No, MnO2 is black. Another thought: maybe it's a fluorinated oxide of another element.

Wait, another approach: think about common fluorinated compounds. For example, ClF3 is a compound, but I'm not sure about its color. Alternatively, perhaps Y is chlorine, and A1 is ClF3. ClF3 is a greenish-yellow liquid, I think, not bright red.

Wait, another possibility: A1 is a compound that upon decomposition gives F2. For example, if A1 is YF5 and decomposes into YF3 and F2. Let's say Y is boron. Boron trifluoride (BF3) is a gas, but I'm not sure about its color. Alternatively, Y could be nitrogen; but nitrogen trifluoride is colorless.

Wait, maybe Y is oxygen. But O's fluorides are O2F2, which is a pale yellow liquid. Not red.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on this part. Let me try to think about the other given information.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 is YF_x. And A3 can interact with xenon. So perhaps it's a strong enough oxidizing agent to react with xenon, which is usually inert.

Wait, perhaps A3 is ClF3, which is a strong oxidizing agent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is chlorine, and A3 is ClF3. ClF3 is a strong oxidizer and can react with noble gases under certain conditions.

Wait, another angle: when adding Y to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, they form A5. So perhaps A4 is a solution of YF5, and adding Y in 1:1 ratio produces another compound.

Wait, if A4 is YF5, and Y is added, maybe it reacts as follows:

YF5 + Y → YF2 ?

But that would require a reaction like 2 YF5 + Y → 2 YF3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF3, and adding Y metal would displace F to form YF2 and YF (but not sure).

Wait, another thought: perhaps A4 is a solution of a higher fluoride, and adding Y forms a lower one. For example, adding Y to YF5 solution might produce YF3 and release F2 gas. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of a salt, and adding Y (as metal) displaces another ion. For example, if A4 is NaF, adding Y (like K?) wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF5, and adding Y metal in 1:1 molar ratio would produce YF3 and F2 gas.

But I'm not sure about that. Let me think: YF5 + Y → YF3 + F2.

Let me balance that:

YF5 + Y → YF3 + F2.

On the left: 1 Y, 5 F, and another Y (total 2 Y, 5 F).

On the right: 1 Y, 3 F, and 2 F atoms in F2.

So, let's balance Y first: 1 Y on each side? No, because left has 2 Y (from YF5 and Y), and right has 1 Y. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is 2 YF5 + Y → 2 YF3 + 5 F2.

Let me count:

Left: 2 YF5 → 2 Y, 10 F.

Plus Y → 1 Y, 0 F.

Total: 3 Y, 10 F.

Right: 2 YF3 → 2 Y, 6 F.

Plus 5 F2 → 10 F.

Total: 2 Y, 16 F.

Hmm, not matching. Maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different. Maybe A4 is a solution of YF3, and adding Y metal produces YF.

Wait, YF3 + Y → 2 YF.

But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is YF6, but I don't know any element that forms a YF6 compound except maybe sulfur (SF6), but that's a different element.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that A5 is a compound that decomposes in water into two substances. Maybe it's a fluoride that hydrolyzes. For example, if A5 is CaF2, which is insoluble in water, so it wouldn't decompose. Alternatively, if A5 is NaF, but that's soluble.

Wait, another thought: maybe A5 is a compound like SiF4. SiF4 in water hydrolyzes to produce HF and SiO2. So the decomposition would be:

SiF4 + 2 H2O → 4 HF + SiO2.

In this case, A5 is SiF4, which upon decomposition (maybe when heated) gives HF and SiO2.

But then, how was A5 formed? It was formed by adding Y to a hot concentrated solution of A4. So perhaps A4 is a solution of something that reacts with Y to produce SiF4.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is silicon, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps Y is silicon. Let's see: silicon can form several fluorides like SiF2, SiF4, SiF6. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact compounds.

Another approach: perhaps the molecular weight of A4 falls into one of the given ranges. The options are A)140-160, B)220-240, C)160-180, D)110-130.

So I need to figure out what A4 is and calculate its molecular weight.

Wait, going back to the problem: when adding Y in 1:1 molar ratio to A4's solution, A5 is formed. So the reaction might be:

A4 + Y → A5.

If A4 is a solution of YF5, then adding Y metal could produce YF3 and release F2 gas.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a salt, like YF4, and adding Y metal produces YF2 and F2.

Wait, another idea: perhaps A4 is a solution of YF5, and adding Y metal (in 1:1 ratio) leads to the formation of YF3 and F2 gas. Let's write the equation.

YF5 + Y → YF3 + F2.

Balancing:

Left: 2 Y and 5 F.

Right: 1 Y, 3 F, and 2 F atoms in F2.

Wait, let's balance fluorine first. YF5 has 5 F per molecule. If I have one YF5 and one Y:

(YF5) + Y → YF3 + F2.

On the left: 5 F.

On the right: 3 F + 2*2 =7 F. So that's 7 F on the right and 5 on the left. Not balanced.

Maybe 2 YF5 + Y → 2 YF3 + F2.

Left: 2 YF5 → 2 Y, 10 F. Plus Y → 1 Y. Total Y:3, F:10.

Right: 2 YF3 → 2 Y, 6 F. Plus F2 → 2 F. Total F:8.

So 3 Y and 10 F on left, 2 Y and 8 F on right. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe I should think of A4 as another type of compound.

Wait, another thought: the problem mentions that A3 can also interact with xenon. If A3 is YF3, perhaps it's a strong enough oxidizing agent to react with xenon.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress. Let me try to consider each part again.

A1 is a bright-red compound that decomposes into A2 and F2. Let's think of A1 as YF5, which upon heating decomposes into YF3 and F2. So, YF5 → YF3 + F2.

Wait, but YF5's decomposition would require balancing. Let's try:

YF5 → YF3 + F2.

Fluorine atoms: 5 on left, 3 +2*2=7 on right. So need to balance:

Let's say 2 YF5 → 2 YF3 + F2.

Now, left: 2 Y, 10 F.

Right: 2 Y, 6 F + 2 F =8 F. Still not balanced.

Hmm, maybe 3 YF5 → 3 YF3 + F2.

Left: 3 Y, 15 F.

Right:3 Y,9 F +2 F →11 F. No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: 2 YF5 → 2 YF3 + F2.

Let me subtract fluorine: 2*5=10 → 2*3=6 + 2 →8. So 10→8. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps this decomposition isn't possible. So maybe Y isn't forming YF5 as A1. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is another fluoride.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A1 is YF3, which upon decomposition gives YF and F2. But then, the decomposition would require breaking YF3 into YF and F2.

Another approach: perhaps A1 is a perfluoride, like YF6. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is oxygen, but that's unlikely because O forms O2F2, which is a pale yellow liquid, not bright red.

Wait, perhaps the bright-red substance is MnO2, but that's not a fluoride. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the bright-red substance is a compound of fluorine with another element. Wait, maybe it's chromium(VI) fluoride, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is manganese. Let's think: Mn can form MnF2, MnF3, MnF4, Mn2F5, MnF6. So five binary compounds, which fits the question.

MnF6 is a thing? I'm not sure, but let's proceed.

If Y is Mn, then A1 could be MnF6, which is bright red. Upon decomposition, it could form MnF4 and F2.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the color of MnF6. Alternatively, perhaps MnO2 is dark purple, but that's not a fluoride.

Alternatively, think of MnF3. I'm not certain about its color.

Wait, another angle: the oF of A2 is 31.96%. Let me consider Y as Mn (atomic weight ~55).

So, for A2, YF_x.

(19x)/(55 +19x )=0.3196.

Calculate:

19x =0.3196*(55 +19x).

19x =0.3196*55 +0.3196*19x.

0.3196*55≈17.578.

0.3196*19≈6.0724.

So,

19x =17.578 +6.0724x.

19x-6.0724x=17.578.

12.9276x=17.578 → x≈1.36. Not an integer. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps Y isn't Mn.

Wait, let me think of Y as chlorine. Atomic weight of Cl is ~35.5.

So,

19x/(35.5 +19x ) =0.3196.

19x =0.3196*(35.5 +19x).

19x =0.3196*35.5 +0.3196*19x.

Calculate 0.3196*35.5≈11.34.

0.3196*19≈6.0724.

So,

19x =11.34 +6.0724x.

19x-6.0724x=11.34 →12.9276x=11.34 →x≈0.88. Not integer.

Hmm, not working.

Wait, another element: perhaps Y is sulfur (atomic weight ~32).

So,

19x/(32 +19x )=0.3196.

19x=0.3196*(32 +19x).

19x=0.3196*32 +0.3196*19x.

0.3196*32≈10.2272.

0.3196*19≈6.0724.

So,

19x =10.2272 +6.0724x.

19x-6.0724x=10.2272 →12.9276x=10.2272 →x≈0.794. Not integer.

Hmm, not working.

Wait, perhaps Y is titanium (atomic weight ~48).

So,

19x/(48 +19x ) =0.3196.

19x=0.3196*(48+19x).

19x=0.3196*48 +0.3196*19x.

0.3196*48≈15.3408.

0.3196*19≈6.0724.

So,

19x=15.3408 +6.0724x →19x-6.0724x=15.3408 →12.9276x=15.3408 →x≈1.187. Still not integer.

Wait, perhaps Y is calcium (atomic weight ~40).

So,

19x/(40 +19x )=0.3196.

19x=0.3196*(40 +19x).

19x=12.784 +6.0724x.

19x-6.0724x=12.784 →12.9276x=12.784 →x≈0.989. Close to 1, but not integer.

Hmm, perhaps x is 1, and M is about 40.5, as before. So Y would be close to 40.5, which is calcium (40). So Y is Ca.

So, A2 would be CaF (x=1). But CaF isn't a common compound; it's more likely to form CaF2.

Wait, but perhaps in this problem, A2 is CaF. So, let's proceed with that.

So Y is Ca.

Now, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, meaning Ca + F2 → CaF_x.

So A3 could be CaF2 (calcium fluoride), which is a stable compound. Calcium fluoride is a white solid, but the problem states that A3 can interact with xenon. Hmm, I'm not sure about that.

Wait, but the problem states that both A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon. So perhaps both are strong oxidizing agents. Calcium fluoride isn't a strong oxidizing agent, so maybe Y isn't calcium.

Hmm, perhaps I went wrong somewhere. Let me try to approach this differently.

Alternative approach: Let's think about A4.

When Y is added to a hot, concentrated colorless solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

Suppose A4 is a solution of YF5. When Y metal is added, perhaps a displacement reaction occurs, producing YF2 and F2 gas. So:

YF5 + Y → YF2 + F2.

Let me balance this.

The reaction would be:

2 YF5 + Y → 2 YF2 + 5 F2.

Wait, let's check:

Left: 2 YF5 → 2 Y, 10 F.

Plus Y → 1 Y. Total Y: 3, F:10.

Right: 2 YF2 → 2 Y,4 F.

Plus 5 F2 →10 F. Total F:14.

Wait, that doesn't balance. Hmm. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

YF5 + Y → YF + F2.

But YF is not a common compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces YF3 and F2.

So, YF5 + Y → YF3 + F2.

Balancing:

Left: 1 Y (from YF5) + 1 Y (added) → 2 Y, 5 F.

Right: 1 Y,3 F. Plus F2 → 2 F atoms.

So,

2 YF5 + Y → 2 YF3 + F2.

Let's check:

Left: 2 YF5 → 2 Y,10 F.

Plus Y → 1 Y. Total Y:3, F:10.

Right: 2 YF3 →2 Y,6 F.

Plus F2 →2 F. Total F:8.

Not matching. So perhaps this isn't the right reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF3. Adding Y metal could produce YF and F2.

So,

YF3 + Y → YF + F2.

Balancing:

Left: YF3 →1 Y,3 F. Plus Y →1 Y. Total Y:2, F:3.

Right: YF →1 Y,1 F. Plus F2 →2 F. Total F:3.

So,

YF3 + Y → YF + F2.

Check Y: 2 on left, 1 on right. So, need another Y on product side.

Wait, perhaps 2 YF3 + Y → 2 YF + 3 F2.

Let me check:

Left: 2 YF3 → 2 Y,6 F. Plus Y →1 Y. Total Y:3, F:6.

Right: 2 YF →2 Y,2 F. Plus 3 F2 →6 F. So F:8 on right. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe I should consider that A4 is a different compound.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A4 is a solution of YF4. Adding Y metal could produce YF2 and release F2.

So,

YF4 + Y → YF2 + F2.

Balancing:

Left: YF4 →1 Y,4 F. Plus Y →1 Y. Total Y:2, F:4.

Right: YF2 →1 Y,2 F. Plus F2 →2 F. Total F:4.

So, the equation would be:

YF4 + Y → YF2 + F2.

Which balances:

Y: 2 on left, 1 on right (YF2) + none in F2. So, need another YF2.

Wait, perhaps 2 YF4 + 2 Y → 2 YF2 + 2 F2.

Now,

Left: 2 YF4 →2 Y,8 F. Plus 2 Y →2 Y. Total Y:4, F:8.

Right: 2 YF2 →2 Y,4 F. Plus 2 F2 →4 F. Total F:8.

Yes, that balances.

So, according to this, when Y is added to YF4 solution, we get YF2 and F2 gas.

So, A4 is YF4, and A5 is YF2.

Now, when A5 (YF2) is placed in water, it decomposes into two substances.

Wait, for Y being a metal, YF2 would hydrolyze in water. For example, if Y is Ca, CaF2 is insoluble in water, so it doesn't decompose. But if Y is a transition metal, perhaps it reacts.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggested Y could be Ca, but that didn't fit the oxidation with xenon. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another metal.

Wait, let me think. If A5 is YF2, and in water it decomposes into two substances, perhaps it's a metal fluoride that reacts with water to produce HF and the corresponding hydroxide or oxide.

For example, if Y is calcium, CaF2 is insoluble and doesn't decompose. But if Y is a group 1 metal like Na, NaF is soluble and would just dissociate into Na+ and F-.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is magnesium. MgF2 is soluble in water? Wait, no, I think MgF2 is insoluble.

Hmm, perhaps Y is aluminum. AlF3 is soluble in water and can hydrolyze to form Al(OH)3 and HF.

So, AlF3 + 3 H2O → Al(OH)3 + 3 HF.

Thus, A5 would be AlF3, which is formed from Al reacting with A4 (which would be AlF4? But Al typically doesn't form AlF4. Al usually forms AlF3).

Hmm, perhaps Y isn't aluminum. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps Y is sodium. NaF is soluble, but NaF in water doesn't decompose. It just dissociates.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is potassium. KF is soluble and doesn't decompose.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A5 is NaF2, but I'm not sure sodium forms such a compound.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track again. Let me think about the molecular weight of A4.

If A4 is YF4 and Y is, say, calcium (atomic weight 40), then YF4 would have a molecular weight of 40 + 4*19 =40 +76=116 g/mol. That would fall into option D (110-130). Alternatively, if Y is manganese (55), YF4 would be 55 +76=131, which is also in option D. If Y is titanium (48), YF4 would be 48 +76=124, also in D.

But earlier calculations suggested Y is around atomic weight 40.5 when x=1, which would fit Y as calcium.

So, if A4 is YF4, and Y is calcium, then A4's molecular weight is 40 +4*19=116, which is within option D (110-130).

Thus, the correct option would be D) 110-130.


The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of substance A4 based on the given reactions and properties of the compounds. Here's the analysis:

1. **Substance A1**: A1 is described as a bright-red compound that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine gas (F₂). Additionally, A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating it is a strong oxidizing agent. This suggests A1 is likely a high-valent fluoride compound.

2. **Substance A2**: The decomposition of A1 produces A2, and the fluorine content in A2 is 31.96% by mass. Using the formula for percentage composition, the molecular weight of A2 was calculated. Assuming A2 is YFₓ, the analysis suggests Y could be an element with an atomic weight close to 40.5, such as calcium (Ca, atomic weight ~40). This aligns with A2 being CaF.

3. **Substance A3**: A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y and can also interact with xenon. This suggests A3 is a reactive fluoride compound, likely YF₃ or YF₄, depending on the oxidation state of Y.

4. **Substance A4**: A4 is a hot, colorless, concentrated solution. When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to A4, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. Based on the reactions, A4 is likely a higher-valent fluoride, such as YF₄. For Y as calcium (Ca), A4 would be CaF₄.

5. **Molecular Weight of A4**: If Y is calcium (atomic weight ~40), the molecular weight of CaF₄ is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Molecular weight of CaF₄} = 40 + 4 \times 19 = 116 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]
   This value falls within the range of 110–130, corresponding to option D.

Thus, the molecular weight of A4 is in the range of 110–130.

Answer: D
