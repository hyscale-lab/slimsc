Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about expectation values. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says we have a spin-half particle in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And the operators involved are 10σz +5σx. I need to find the expectation value of this operator.

Wait, expectation value... right. The expectation value of an operator is like the average outcome if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. So for an operator A, it's ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩.

So the operator here is A = 10σz +5σx. I can break this down into two parts: 10σz and 5σx. The expectation value of A would be the sum of the expectation values of each part. So E[A] = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

I need to compute ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for the given state. Let's start with σz because I remember that σz has eigenstates |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So for σz, the expectation value should be straightforward.

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is typically (1, 0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1), ψ would be [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Wait, let me compute that. 0.5 squared is 0.25 and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. 0.25 +0.75 =1. So the state is normalized, which is good.

Now, σz is the Pauli z matrix, which is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So σz|↑⟩ = |↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -|↓⟩.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is ψ† σz ψ. Let's compute that. Alternatively, since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates, I can just take the coefficients.

In the state ψ, the amplitude for |↑⟩ is 0.5 and for |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2. So ⟨σz⟩ is (0.5)^2 * 1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let's compute that.

0.5^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. So 0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now moving on to σx. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Its eigenstates are not the same as |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so I can't directly use the eigenvalues. I need to compute ⟨σx⟩.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ψ† σx ψ. Let me compute this.

Alternatively, since ψ is a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], let's compute ψ† σx ψ.

Compute σx multiplied by ψ: σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by σx would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Then, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so the product is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Wait, let me recheck that. Matrix multiplication: σx |ψ⟩ would swap the components. So σx |ψ⟩ = [sqrt(
