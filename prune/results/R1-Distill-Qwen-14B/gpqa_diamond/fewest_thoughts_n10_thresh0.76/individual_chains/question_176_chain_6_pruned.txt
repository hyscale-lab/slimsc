Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's see.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, hold on. Oh, wait, that's a column vector, right? So the state vector is probably a three-component vector, which makes sense because the operators P and Q are 3x3 matrices.

The first thing I need to do is probably normalize this state vector because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, meaning their length (or norm) is 1. So let me calculate the norm.

The vector is (-1, 2, 1), so the norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2. That's 1 +4+1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) multiplied by each component. But wait, the problem says the state is (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, maybe the state isn't normalized, which is possible, but when we compute probabilities, we'll have to consider that. Hmm, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized. So perhaps the given state is not normalized, and we have to normalize it before proceeding. Let me note that down.

So the initial state vector is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1)^T. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(6), so the normalized vector is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) (-1, 2, 1)^T.

Next, the operators P and Q are given. Let's write down their matrices.

Operator P's matrix has:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Operator Q's matrix is diagonal:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -
