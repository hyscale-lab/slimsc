Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits discovered via the TTV method. The equilibrium temperature ratios are given. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So, the temp ratios are 1.4 and 2.3. Then, the mass ratios are given: Planet1 to Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. The albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth. The question is, by what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than Planet1?

Hmm. So, the goal is to find the ratio Period3 / Period1.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = [ (L * (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ) ]^(1/4), where L is luminosity, a is albedo, D is distance, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But wait, since all three planets are around the same star, L is the same for all. The albedo is given as the same for all (0.3), so a is constant. So the temperature ratio would depend on the distance from the star.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula can also be written as T ∝ sqrt(L) / (D)^(1/2). Because when you take the formula, T is proportional to [ (L (1-a) ) / D² ]^(1/4). Which is the same as (L/D² )^(1/4) multiplied by (1-a)^(1/4). Since L and (1-a) are same for all, the T ratio between two planets would be [ (D2 / D1) ]^(-1/4). Because if T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(-1/4), because T1 is proportional to D^-0.25.

Wait, let's clarify the formula. Let me write it out:

T = [( L (1 - a) ) / (16πσ D²)]^(1/4)

Since L, a, and σ are same for all planets, T is proportional to (1/D²)^(1/4) = D^(-1/2).

So, T ∝ 1 / sqrt(D) → D ∝ 1 / T.

Wait, but when comparing two planets, say Planet1 and Planet2, their temperatures ratio is T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2), because:

T1 / T2 = [ (D2 / D1) ]^(-1/4) → no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, correct formula: T ∝ sqrt( L (1 - a) / (4π
