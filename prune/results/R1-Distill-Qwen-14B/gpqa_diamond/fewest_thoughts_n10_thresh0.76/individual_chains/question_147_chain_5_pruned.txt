Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let me read it again. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D with different c fractions.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I think this involves conservation laws. Since it's an annihilation process, probably energy and momentum are conserved. Oh, and the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. That could simplify things.

Let me think about the system before and after the annihilation. Before, we have a proton and an antiproton. Wait, but wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. So the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton, right? Because the proton is at rest? Or wait, maybe the proton is moving? No, wait, the question says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is initially at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it with low velocity.

Wait, but in particle reactions, usually both particles are moving, but if the antiproton's speed is much lower than the speed of light, perhaps we can treat it as non-relativistic. Wait, but in high-energy physics, even low speeds can be significant because of the masses involved. Hmm, maybe not. Let's proceed with the assumption that the velocity is low, so we can use non-relativistic approximations where possible.

Wait, but this is annihilation. So the proton and antiproton are annihilating and producing two A+ and two A-. So perhaps the total energy of the system (proton and antiproton) is converted into the rest mass energy of the created particles, plus any kinetic energy. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the kinetic energy is small compared to the rest mass energy.

Wait, but the rest mass of the proton is about 938 MeV/c². And the antiproton has the same mass. So the total rest mass would be 2*938 = 1876 MeV. The product particles are four A particles, each of mass 300 MeV. So four times 300 is 1200 MeV. But wait, 1200
