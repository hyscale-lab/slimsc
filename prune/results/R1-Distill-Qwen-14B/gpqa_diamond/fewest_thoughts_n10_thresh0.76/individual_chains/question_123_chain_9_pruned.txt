Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see.

The problem says that a supernova occurs, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in their own inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. That must mean the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at the same speed in the Galaxy's frame, right? Because if I'm in the ejecta, I see the Galaxy coming towards me at that speed.

Now the question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh wait, so time is different in each frame. Because of time dilation in special relativity. So I need to figure out how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

I remember that time dilation is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But wait, what's v here? Since the speed is 60,000 km/s, I should convert that to meters per second to make it easier since the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. Oh wait, 60,000 km is 6e4 km. So 6e4 km/s is 6e7 meters per second. But c is about 3e8 m/s. So v is 0.6 times c? Because 6e7 is 0.6 of 1e8? Wait, 3e8 is 300 million meters per second. 6e7 is 60 million, so yeah, 6e7 is 0.6 * 3e8. So v = 0.6c.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2). Let me compute that. 0.6 squared is 0.36. 1-0.36 is 0.64. The square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So time dilation factor is 1.25.

Wait, but which frame's time is which? The problem says 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So we need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame. Because from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving towards it, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 0.6c. So in the Galaxy's frame, the time experienced is longer. Because moving clocks run slower.

So in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. So the Galaxy's frame would see that duration as longer. The relationship is that t_galaxy = gamma * t_ejecta. So 1.25 * 50 s = 62.5 seconds.

Wait wait, no. Wait, time dilation is such that a moving clock runs slower
