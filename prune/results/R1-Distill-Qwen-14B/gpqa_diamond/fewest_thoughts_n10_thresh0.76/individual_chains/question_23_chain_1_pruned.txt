Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about a reaction between a specific compound and hydrogen bromide. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Wait, I should draw that structure to visualize it better.

So, the structure is benzene with an ether group (O-) attached. The other part of the ether is a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group. Let me break that down. But-3-en-1-yl means a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the third carbon. Wait, but that's the same as the second position? Because but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but but only has four carbons, so numbering might be off. Wait, maybe I should think of but-3-en-1-yl as CH₂CH₂CH=CH₂? No, wait, but that can't be right because but has four carbons. Oh wait, maybe it's CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂-O- attached to benzene?

Wait, no, wait. 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group. So the structure is CH₂-O-benzene attached to a CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH2? No, wait. Let me draw it step by step.

But-3-en-1-yl: the first carbon is attached to O. So carbon 1 is the -O- connected to CH₂. Then, the next carbon (2) is CH₂, then a double bond at position 3, so between carbons 3 and 4. So, the group is CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂? No, that doesn't make sense because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between 3 and 4? Wait, that can't be right because that would be a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the third carbon, but but has only four carbons. So, but-3-en-1-yl is actually CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ with the double bond starting at the third carbon, but that's impossible because that's beyond
