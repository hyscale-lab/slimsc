Okay, so I have this question about a quasar's spectrum and figuring out its comoving distance. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

So, the question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at around 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. Below that, the flux drops a lot. Wait, I think that's about the Lyman-alpha forest or something related to quasar emission lines. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet, but if the quasar is at a high redshift, that line would be redshifted into the optical or near-infrared.

Wait, the peak is at 790 nm. Lyman-alpha is normally around 121 nm. So if it's redshifted to 790, the redshift z would be (790 / 121) - 1. Let me calculate that. 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.5289. Subtract 1, so z is about 5.5289. So roughly z â‰ˆ 5.5.

But wait, the question isn't directly asking for redshift. It's asking about the comoving distance. Oh right, comoving distance is calculated using the redshift and the parameters of the universe (like H0, matter density, dark energy, etc.). The model given is Lambda-CDM with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m=0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Omega_total=1).

So the comoving distance, sometimes called the light travel distance, is given by the integral of c/(a H) da from a=0 to a=1/(1+z). Or wait, no, the comoving distance is the integral from a=0 to a=1/(1+z) of da/(a^2 H). Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I remember that for a flat universe, the distance is D_c = (1+z) * the integral from 0 to z of dz' / H(z'), where H(z') is the Hubble parameter at that redshift.

Wait, no, the comoving distance is actually the integral from a=0 to a= a_source of da / (a^2 H(a)). Alternatively, since a = 1/(1+z), and H
