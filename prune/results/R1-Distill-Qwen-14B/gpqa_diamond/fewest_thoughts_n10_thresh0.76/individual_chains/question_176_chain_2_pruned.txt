Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, the question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that would be a 3x1 matrix, right? So the state vector is |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. Wait, but I should check if this is a normalized state because probabilities depend on that. Let me compute the norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Oh, so the state isn't normalized. Maybe I should normalize it first. Wait, but when making probability calculations, we probably need the normalized state. So I'll have to normalize |ψ> by dividing each component by sqrt(6). So the normalized state is |ψ> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Next, the operators P and Q are given. The operator P has a matrix with first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, I'm trying to think about what kind of matrix this is. It looks like a symmetric matrix, which is good because observables are represented by Hermitian operators. Let me check symmetry. The element (1,2) is 1/sqrt(2), same as (2,1). Similarly, (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2), same as (3,2). So yes, it's symmetric, so Hermitian.

Operator Q is given by a diagonal matrix: first row (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. That makes sense, as diagonal matrices are easy to work with.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. Wait, no, I think the measurements are done in the order P first, then Q. So the process is: measure P, get outcome 0, then measure Q and get outcome -1.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. When you measure one observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So the first measurement is P, and the outcome is 0. Then the state collapses into an eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, the second measurement is Q on this new state, looking for outcome -1. So I need to compute the probabilities for each step.

Alternatively, the question might be asking for the joint probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1 when measuring in that order. So the overall probability would be the product of the probability of getting 0 in the first measurement and then, given that, the probability of getting -1 in the second.

So step 1: Find the possible eigenvalues of P and their corresponding eigenvectors.

First, let me find the eigenvalues of P. The matrix P is:

[ 0         1/sqrt(2)    0        ]
[1/sqrt(2)  0         1/sqrt(2) ]
[0         1/sqrt(2)    0        ]

Hmm, finding eigenvalues of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tricky. The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So let's write P - λ I:

[ -λ       1/sqrt(2)      0        ]
[1/sqrt(2)  -λ         1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0        1/sqrt(2)    -λ        ]

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))^2 ] - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps a better approach. Alternatively, maybe I can look for symmetry or possible eigenvectors.

Wait, looking for eigenvectors, perhaps. Let me consider a vector [a, b, a]^T, because the matrix P seems symmetric in a way that might make this a possible eigenvector. Let's plug into (P - λ I) v = 0.

So for a vector v = [a; b; a], we have:

( -λ a ) + (1/sqrt(2)) b + 0
