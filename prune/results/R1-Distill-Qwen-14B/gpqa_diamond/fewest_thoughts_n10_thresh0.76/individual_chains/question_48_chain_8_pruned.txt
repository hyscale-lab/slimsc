Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. Hmm, let me start by breaking down each step carefully.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. So, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first step is treating it with bromine (Br2) to form product 1. I remember that when ketones react with bromine, it's usually a type of addition reaction. Oh wait, bromine adds to the carbonyl group. So cyclohexanone would undergo a bromination. The carbonyl becomes a bromide, but wait, how? Let me think—bromine would add across the carbonyl. So cyclohexanone has a ketone, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? Or wait, maybe it's an enol bromination. No, wait, ketones don't typically enolize that much under those conditions. Oh wait, wait—if the reaction is in a non-polar solvent, maybe it's a different mechanism. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromohydrin formation? No, I think more likely it's the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl, converting the ketone into a di-substituted bromide. So the product would be cyclohexane-1,2-diol dibromide? No, wait. Alternatively, adding Br2 to the carbonyl in a ketone would lead to the formation of a
