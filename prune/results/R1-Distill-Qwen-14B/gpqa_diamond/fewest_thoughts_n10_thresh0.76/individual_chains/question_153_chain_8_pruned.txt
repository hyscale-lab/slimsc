Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question gives a scenario about α-β unsaturated carbonyls being electrophilic and reacting with nucleophiles in the Michael reaction. The question then provides three separate reactions and asks about the products.

Let me break down each part.

Reaction (A): Dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH.

I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The Michael donor (the nucleophile) is usually an enolate, and the Michael acceptor is the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, in this case, is the dimethyl malonate the donor or the acceptor? Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. So I think dimethyl malonate would donate its enolate to attack the acceptor.

The structure of dimethyl malonate is something like CH2(CO2Me)2. So the enolate would be at the β position, right? So when it attacks the acceptor, which is an acrylate with a p-tolyl group, the attack would happen on the β carbon of the acrylate.

The acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=CH- (something). Wait, the structure is more like CH2CH(CO2Me), but with the substituent. Wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. But wait, the substituent is at the 3-position. So the structure would be CH2=CH- with a p-tolyl group attached to the CH2? Hmm, perhaps I should draw it.

Alternatively, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the double bond is between C2
