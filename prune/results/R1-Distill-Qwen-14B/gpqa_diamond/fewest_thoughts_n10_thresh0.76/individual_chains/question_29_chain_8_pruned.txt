Okay, so I've got this genetics question about barley and mutations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and found some mutations in the first exon. We need to figure out which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, the goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That probably means we need to disrupt the gene's function. So, the mutation needs to cause a loss of function. How do mutations cause loss of function? Well, typically, it could be a premature stop codon, a frameshift that messes up the protein from that point on, or a missense mutation in a critical region that changes the protein's function.

Looking at the wild-type and mutant sequences. The wild-type starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... The mutants have changes in the first exon area.

Let me compare each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So the first part is a little different. Original is TTTCTCGCT. In Mutant 1, it's TTCTACGCT. Let me write the changes.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...
Mutant1: ATG TTCTACGCT ... Wait, let me see each nucleotide.

Wait, maybe I should line them up.

Wild: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ... TGA-3’
Mutant1: 5’-ATG TTT C T ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ... TGA-3’ Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the exact changes.

Wait, the initial part of the wild type is 'ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA'.

Mutant1: 'ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA'

So in the first part, looking at the first few nucleotides. Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC ...

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for where the changes are.

Looking at the first part, after the ATG start codon. Wild is TTTCTCGCTGGTACT... Mutant1 has TTCTACGCTGGTACT.

Wait, the wild is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT. So that's exons and introns?

Wait, no, the gene has 5 exons and 4 introns. The region in question is the first exon. So the mutations are in the first exon. So any change in the exon can affect the protein
