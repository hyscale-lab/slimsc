Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The question says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant (K) is 5x10^10. They want the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA form the complex. So the reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or maybe the charge is different, but I think the formula is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-). The K for this would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem gives the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. So initially, I think the complex is 0.02 M, and we need to find the free Ca²+ concentration. 

Hmm, in such a scenario, the complex is in solution, and it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. But wait, EDTA is a chelating agent, and when it's in a 1:1 ratio with a metal ion, the complex is stable if K is large. Since K is 5e10, which is a big number, the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low.

Wait, but how do I approach this? Maybe I should set up an ICE table. Let's denote the initial concentrations. Let me think: the complex is 0.02 M. So initially, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. And [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are both zero? Or wait, no, because in reality, when the complex dissociates a tiny bit, some Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are released.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider the dissociation. Let me denote x as the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So:

At equilibrium,
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small because K is large)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

Then the formation constant expression is:

K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}) = (0.02)/(x^2) 

Set that equal to 5e10.

So,

5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-14.

Wait wait, let me calculate that again. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 equals (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13? No, wait, 2e-2 over 5e10 is 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12. 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13. Then x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6. So sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4e-13) = (sqrt(4)) * (sqrt(1e-13)) )= 2 * (1e-6.5) )? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2? Wait, 1e-13 is 10^-13. The square root is 10^(-6.5) ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7.

So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7. That must be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Wait, when the complex dissociates, is EDTA^4- the only EDTA species? Well, in solution, EDTA exists in different protonated forms, but the problem states that the pH is ideal, so I think we can assume that the EDTA is present as EDTA^4-.

So, yes, the calculation seems correct. The free calcium concentration is about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant expression:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, \( K = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the initial concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\). At equilibrium, the dissociation of the complex releases small amounts of \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\), which we denote as \(x\). Thus, at equilibrium:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting these into the formation constant expression:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
