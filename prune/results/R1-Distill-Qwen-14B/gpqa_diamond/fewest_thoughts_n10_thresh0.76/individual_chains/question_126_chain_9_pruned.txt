Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Each reaction uses a different starting material and a different reducing agent, and then the products are combined. The chemist then runs these combined products on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral stationary phase. The question is about the number of peaks observed in each case.

First, let's outline what each reaction does.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

I think I'll need to figure out the products of each reaction first. Let's start with Reaction I.

Reaction I:

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure would be CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3, with the configuration at the chiral center being S.

LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the ketone group (C=O) at position 3 should be reduced. Wait, no, the starting material is 3-one, so it's a cyclohexanone derivative? Or wait, hexan-3-one is a straight-chain six-carbon compound with a ketone at C3.

So, the structure is: CH2CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH3? Let me get that right. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, the structure would be CH2CH2CH(OCH3)COCH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps it's better to draw it. Hexan-3-one is O=C at position 3. So positions 1 to 6: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one would have the structure:

CH2CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, no, that's not
