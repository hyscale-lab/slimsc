Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's see what each step does and what the products are.

First, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure. When it's heated with excess KOH, this is probably an elimination reaction. Wait, KOH is a strong base, so it's likely an E2 mechanism. With two bromine atoms, maybe we lose two equivalents of HBr. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination would lead to forming a double bond. So the product 1 should be an adamantylene or something similar. Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. I think when two bromines are eliminated, we get an alkene. So product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe 1,3-diene structure in adamantane. 

Looking at the NMR spectrum of product 1: the peaks are at 4.79 (2H), which is probably an OCH2 group since that's around where OCH3 appears, but 4.79 is a bit higher. Wait, maybe it's an epoxide? No, because the IR has an absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe it's a ketone. Wait, but how? Let me think again. 

Wait, if you have 1,3-dibromoadamantane and treat it with KOH, perhaps it's a di-elimination, leading to a conjugated diene. But wait, elimination would form a double bond, but wait, two eliminations would form two double bonds? Or perhaps it's a single elimination, but with two Brs, maybe forming a bridge. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think about the reaction conditions.

Heating with KOH in excess could lead to a double dehydrohalogenation. So, each Br would kick out a H to form a double bond.
