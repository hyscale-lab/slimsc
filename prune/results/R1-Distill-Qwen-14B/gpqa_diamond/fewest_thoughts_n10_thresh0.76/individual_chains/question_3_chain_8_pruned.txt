Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Right, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the state's wavefunction.

So, the operator is 10σz plus 5σx. To find the expectation value ⟨10σz +5σx⟩, I can use the linearity of expectation values. That means I can split this into 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I just need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ separately.

Let's start with σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz for any state in this basis is straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. The state is a linear combination, so the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ would be the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

The given state is ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2. Wait, I should check if this is normalized. Let's compute |a|² + |b|². So 0.5² is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, which is 0.75. Adding those gives 1, so yes, it's normalized. That's good because the expectation value is computed correctly.

So, ⟨σz⟩ = |a|²*(+1) + |b|²*(-1) = (0.5)^2 *1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let's compute that: 0.25 *1 is 0.25, and 0.75 * (-1) is -0.75. Adding those gives 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now, the next part is ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its expectation value isn't as straightforward because the given state isn't necessarily an eigenstate of σx. The eigenstates of σx are (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/√2 and (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/√2. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute using matrix representation.

Alternatively, I remember that for spin-½ particles, the expectation value of σx is given by 2 times the probability of measuring spin-up in the x direction minus 1. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for expectation value in terms of the state coefficients.

Wait, another approach: the spin matrices. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, to compute ⟨σx⟩ for the state ψ, I can represent ψ as a column vector and compute ψ† σx ψ.

Let me write the state ψ as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1), ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So, ψ† is the row vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. The matrix σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, σx multiplied by ψ is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Then, ψ† multiplied by σx ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

So, that's 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5). Let me compute that:

0.5*sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3))/4. Similarly, the second term is the same, so total is (sqrt(3)/4)*2 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check the matrix multiplication. ψ is [a, b] = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. When I compute σx acting on ψ, it's σx * ψ. So:

σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]], so multiplying by ψ:

First component: 0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2.

Second component: 1*0.5 +
