Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the density matrix given by ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is a way to represent the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|), but mixed states are statistical ensembles, so their density matrices are convex combinations of projectors.

Wait, the given ρ looks familiar. Let me write it down again. ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. So that's ½ |0⟩⟨0| + ½ |1⟩⟨1|. Oh, right! That's a completely mixed state for a single qubit. Because |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthonormal basis states, and each has a probability of 1/2.

But the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit confused about what that means. I think it refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh yeah, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, it's a point on the surface of the sphere, and for a mixed state, it's inside the sphere.

So for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented in terms of the Bloch vector r. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space. The components of r determine the position on the Bloch sphere.

Wait, let me get that formula right. The density matrix can be expressed as:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2

Where I is the identity matrix, and σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices. The vector r has components (r_x, r_y, r_z), and its magnitude determines whether the state is pure or mixed. If r is a unit vector, then ρ is a pure state. If |r| < 1, it's a mixed state.

In this problem, the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute this. Let's write out the matrices.

The |0⟩⟨0| matrix is [[1, 0],[0, 0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2) * I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

Wait, so ρ = (I)/2. Comparing this
