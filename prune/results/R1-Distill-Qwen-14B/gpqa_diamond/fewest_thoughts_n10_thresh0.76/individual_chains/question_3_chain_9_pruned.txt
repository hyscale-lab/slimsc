Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The options are given, and I need to calculate it up to one decimal place.

Hmm, expectation values. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that quantity many times on the system. For a given state, the expectation value of an operator A is ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. I can split this into two parts: 10σz and 5σx. The expectation value would then be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ because expectation is linear, so expectation of a sum is the sum of expectations.

So first, I need to find the expectation values of σz and σx for the given state.

The state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Wait, let me check: 0.5 squared plus (sqrt(3)/2) squared should be 1, right? 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. Yep, that's correct.

Now, σz eigenstates. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz is easy. Because the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates, the expectation value is just the coefficient-wise product squared times the eigenvalues.

Wait, σz has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So for |ψ⟩, the expectation value of σz is (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1).

Calculating that: 0.25 * 1 = 0.25, and (3/4) * (-1) = -0.75. So adding 0.25 and (-0.75) gives -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

So then, 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, what about σx? Hmm, that's the tricky part. Because σx is the Pauli X matrix, whose eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Instead, σx has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

Wait, but I can compute ⟨σx⟩ directly. The expectation value of σx in state |ψ⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me write this out. |ψ⟩ is a column vector. Let's represent |↑⟩ as (1,0) and |↓⟩ as (0,1). So |ψ⟩ is [0.
