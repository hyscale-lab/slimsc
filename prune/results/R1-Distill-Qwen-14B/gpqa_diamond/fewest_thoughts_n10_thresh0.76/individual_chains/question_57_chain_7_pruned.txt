Okay, so I have this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. The general formula I recall is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l + 1) * Pl(cosθ) ] summed over all the angular momenta l involved. But wait, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which I think corresponds to θ = 0 degrees. Oh right, because the beam is along the initial direction, so the scattering angle θ is zero.

At θ=0, the Legendre polynomial Pl(cosθ) becomes Pl(1). I remember that Pl(1) is 1 for any l. So that simplifies things. Also, the scattering amplitude f(0) should be the sum over the contributions from each l, each with (e^{2iδ_l} -1) multiplied by (2l+1)/(2ik). But wait, since it's the imaginary part, maybe I can find Im[f(0)] directly.

Let me think about the expression for the imaginary part. The term e^{2iδ_l} can be written as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). So e^{2iδ_l} -1 would be [cos(2δ_l)-1] + i sin(2δ_l). The imaginary part of this term is sin(2δ_l). So when I take the imaginary part of f(0), each term contributes (sin(2δ_l) * (2l+1)) divided by (2k), since 1/(2ik) has a 1/i which is -i, but when taking imaginary parts, I think the factors will work out.

Wait, let me write it out. f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) Pl(cosθ) ]

At θ=0, Pl(1)=1. So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) *
