Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Then, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Another part mentions that the product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

First, let's list out the clues:

1. Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y. Violent reactions often involve things like acid-base reactions, or perhaps something like the reaction of metals with acids.
2. Gas W is released, with equal protons and neutrons in each molecule. Hmmm. Equal protons and neutrons. So the molecular formula of W is something where for each molecule, the total protons and neutrons are the same. Wait, but each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons? Or each atom? Wait, the question says the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So total protons in the molecule equals total neutrons. For example, H2O has H=1 proton each, O=8, so protons: 2, neutrons: 8*8=8? No, wait, no. Wait, each molecule's total protons and total neutrons are the same.

Wait, maybe it's each molecule of gas W has equal number of protons and neutrons. So for example, H2O would have 2 protons and 8*8=8? No, wait, no. Each molecule of gas W has total protons equal to total neutrons. So for example, CO2 would have 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons, and the neutrons would be (how? depends on isotopes, but maybe the question is assuming the common isotope. Alternatively, maybe it's a molecule like CO where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Or perhaps another molecule.

Wait, maybe the simplest is H2. H2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (each H is H-1, which has 0 neutrons
