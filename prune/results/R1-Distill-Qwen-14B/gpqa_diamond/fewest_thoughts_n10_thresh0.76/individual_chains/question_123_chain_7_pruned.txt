Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. That probably means we can use special relativity here, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, relativistic effects come into play.

Wait, the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 6e4 km/s. But the question is about how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, right. So we have two frames: the Galaxy frame (let's call it S) and the ejecta's frame (S'). In S', the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So the relative velocity between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. But wait, in special relativity, the relative velocity is the same in both frames but in opposite directions, right? So in S, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s.

Wait, no, actually, in the S frame (Galaxy), the ejecta is moving towards the center at v. From the problem statement, in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, so in the S frame, the ejecta must
