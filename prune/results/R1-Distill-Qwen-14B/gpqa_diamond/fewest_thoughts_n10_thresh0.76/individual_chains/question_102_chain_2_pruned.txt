Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving gene expression vectors and Cre/Lox systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to break it down.

Alright, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They're using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive? And upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. Oh wait, IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which means the receptor can be expressed as a separate transcript after the ligand. So ligand and receptor are co-expressed but as separate proteins.

Wait, the vector has stop cassettes. The ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between its ORF and mCherry. Similarly, the receptor has lox2272-stop-lox2272 before eGFP. So without Cre, the stop cassette would prevent expression beyond the stop. But with Cre, the lox sites would be recognized and the stop cassette would be excised, allowing expression.

So, the setup is probably using different Cre strains to excise different cassettes. Oh, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, and they crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development, I think. So the Cre would be expressed under SOX10's control, which is in neural crest cells. That would mean that in those cells, Cre would excise the stop cassettes, allowing ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But when they look under the confocal, there's no green signal. eGFP is the marker for the receptor. So why isn't the receptor-eGFP being expressed?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Hmm, paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cells, I think. If they were paracrine, maybe the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells. But the problem is about expression in the same cells, like the neural crest. Not sure if this is the issue.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. If the protein isn't properly trafficked, maybe it doesn't get to the cell surface. But the Western blot was positive, right? They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. Oh wait, the Western blot uses total proteins, so maybe the expression is fine. But if the GFP isn't properly localized, the confocal wouldn't pick it up. So possible.

Option C: Enhancer missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. Maybe the enhancer is needed for proper expression. Wait, the construct includes the CBA promoter for the ligand, so perhaps the issue is with the receptor expression. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is a weaker system. Or maybe without the stop cassette being excised, the receptor isn't expressed. So if the Cre wasnâ€™t active, the stop would remain, and eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, they crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in neural crest cells. So why no eGFP? Let's think about the selection.

The vector is a bicistronic construct, but each gene has its own stop cassette. So when Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassettes. So in the case of the receptor, the lox2272 cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So the Cre (from SOX10-Cre) would need to recognize lox2272 sites to excise that stop. But wait, in the ligand's cassette, it's loxP, and the receptor's is lox2272. Different lox sites, so different Cre recombinases? Or same?

Wait, the standard Cre is for loxP. lox2272 is a variant. So if the Cre used is only for loxP, it won't cut the lox2272 sites. Oh wait, the SOX10-Cre mouse has Cre that can recognize loxP sites, but not lox2272. So in the ligand's case, the loxP cassette would be excised, allowing mCherry to
