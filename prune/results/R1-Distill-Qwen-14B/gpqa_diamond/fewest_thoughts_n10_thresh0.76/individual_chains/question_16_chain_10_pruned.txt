Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but let me try to think this through.

The question lists seven compounds and asks how many of them will exhibit optical activity. The options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4. I need to figure out each compound one by one.

Let me go through each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Wait, but-1-ene has a double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents are Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. For a molecule to have optical activity, it needs a chiral center. But wait, the structure here is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but substituting. Let's draw it: structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So, the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, I think that's not correct. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So the structure is Cl-C(H)=CH-CH2CH3? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but wait, that's if it's butane, but with a double bond starting at position 1. Wait, maybe I should think of the structure as Cl attached to the first carbon of but-1-ene.

Wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, so the structure would be Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, that can't be because it's but-1-
