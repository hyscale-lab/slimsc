Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB. Hmm, I need to figure out the energy at which a gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process. The question says that gamma-rays annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

Wait, I remember something about photon-photon interactions and pair production. The process is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. But for this to happen, the gamma-ray must have enough energy when it interacts with a CMB photon. I think the threshold energy for this process is when the center-of-mass energy is just enough to create the electron and positron pair.

Oh right, the energy required to produce an electron-positron pair is at least twice the rest mass of an electron, because each has a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV. So the threshold energy is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. But wait, that's in the center-of-mass frame. How does that translate to the energy of the gamma-ray in the lab frame?

I think the formula involves the energies of both photons. Let me think about the condition for pair production. The condition is that the product of the photon energies (E1 * E2) must be at least equal to (m_e c²)^2 / 4, because in the center-of-mass frame, the combined energy is sufficient. Or wait, maybe the condition is E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / (4 * c^4) or something? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the invariant quantity.

Wait, the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since photons are massless, their momenta are E/(c) in magnitude. For two photons moving head-on, their momenta are opposite, so p1 = -p2. So the invariant s would be (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1/(c) - E2/(c))^2 c². Hmm, maybe I should calculate that.

Alternatively, I've heard that the condition for pair production from two photons is that the product of their energies must be at least (m_e c²)^2. Let me check: for two photons, the threshold occurs when they are moving in opposite directions, and their combined energy is just enough to produce the rest mass of the pair. So the condition is E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / (4) because each photon contributes half the energy in their frame. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: When two photons collide head-on, the energy and momentum must satisfy conservation. The minimum energy occurs when the resulting particles (e+ and e-) are at rest in the center-of-mass frame. So in that case, the total energy in the center-of-mass is 2 m_e c².

The energy in the center-of-mass frame is sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 ). For photons, since E = p c, so p1 = E1/(c), p2 = E2/(c). But since they're moving in opposite directions, the momentum vectors are opposite. So (p1 c - p2 c) becomes (E1/(c) c - E2/(c) (-c)) ) ? Wait, no, the momenta are vectors, so if one is in +x and the other -x, then p1 = E1/(c) * direction, p2 = E2/(c) * (-direction). So their sum is (E1/(c) - E2/(c)) * direction.

Wait, let me get the invariant s squared: s^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2. Since p1 and p2 are in opposite directions, p1 c - p2 c = (E1/(c) * c) - (E2/(c) * (-c)) )? Wait, no, I think more accurately, p1 is E1/(c) in direction +x, p2 is E2/(c) in -x. So in terms of vectors, p1 = E1/(c) * \hat{x}, p2 = - E2/(c) * \hat{x}. So the sum is (E1/(c) - E2/(c)) ) * \hat{x}.

But when computing (p1 c - p2 c), wait no, the invariant is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2? Or is it (p1 c + p2 c)^2? Wait, no, the invariant s is (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2. So sum E = E1 + E2. Sum p = p1 + p2. So sum p c = c (p1 + p2).

But for photons moving in opposite directions, p1 = E1/(c) in +x, p2 = E2/(c) in -x. So p1 + p2 = (E1/(c) - E2/(c)) ) \hat{x}.

So the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - [ (E1 - E2)/c * c ]^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2.

Expanding that: (E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - (E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) ) = 4 E1 E2. So s = 4 E1 E2. Oh wait, no, s squared would be (4 E1 E2)^2? Or is s = sqrt(4 E1 E2) ?

Wait, s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. So s would be (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2. Which, from the calculation, equals 4 E1 E2. So s = 4 E1 E2.

At threshold, the center-of-mass energy is 2 m_e c^2, because that's the minimum energy needed to produce the pair. So s = (2 m_e c^2)^2 =4 (m_e c^2)^2.

Setting s equal to 4 E1 E2 gives:

4 E1 E2 = 4 (m_e c^2)^2 → E1 E2 = (m_e c^2
