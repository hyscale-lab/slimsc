Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what it's asking. 

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the energy due to the magnetic field interacting with the electron's magnetic moment) with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The setup is that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a small value m (the orbital magnetic quantum number) and B is 1 Tesla. 

Hmm, wait, no—the problem says "small values of m", but m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh wait no, wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is usually denoted by l, but m is the z-component of the angular momentum. Or maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: the orbital magnetic quantum number is actually l, which can be 0,1,2,...n-1, and m can be -l, ..., +l. But the problem says "small values of m", so maybe m is small like m=0, 1, or something.

Wait, but the problem says that B is 1 Tesla. So we have a paramagnetic effect—so the energy due to the magnetic field interacting with the magnetic moment of the electron. 

The transition energy ΔE is given with a wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm. Oh, that's the Balmer series in hydrogen, like the transition from n=2 to n=1, but wait, 0.486 μm is the wavelength of the H-alpha line, which is n=3 to n=2, right? Wait, no, H-alpha is 656 nm, which is longer than 0.486 μm (which is 486 nm). Oh, wait, 0.4861 μm is 486.1 nm. That's the Balmer-alpha line, the transition from n=4 to n=2. Or maybe n=3 to n=2? Wait, let me think. The Balmer series is transitions down to n=2. So Balmer-alpha is n=3→n=2, which has a wavelength of about 486 nm. Yep, that's right.

So the energy ΔE is the energy difference between two levels in hydrogen, and we can calculate that using the Rydberg formula or just using the energy levels formula.

So the question is, what's the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term compared to ΔE.

So first, I need to find expressions for both terms.

The paramagnetic term, which I think comes from the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is H_Zeeman = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m (but wait, wait, the magnetic moment is proportional to the angular momentum). Wait, no, the orbital magnetic moment is given by μ = (μ_B) * L_z / ħ, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Wait, but in the Zeeman effect, the energy shift is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ·B. Hmm, but let
