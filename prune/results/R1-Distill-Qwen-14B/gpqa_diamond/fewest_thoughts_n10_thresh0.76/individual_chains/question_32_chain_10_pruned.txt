Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Lithium normally has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, I think. Because Lithium's atomic number is 3, so 3 protons and 3 neutrons gives a mass number of 6. So X is ^6Li.

I remember that in particle accelerators, the energy given to the particles depends on their relativistic gamma factor. The formula for the total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is mc², where m is the rest mass. 

The problem gives the speed as 0.96c, so I need to find the gamma factor corresponding to that speed. Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that.

So v = 0.96c. Plugging into the gamma formula:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)² / c²) 
= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²)
= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216)
= 1 / sqrt(0.0784)

What's sqrt(0.0784)? Let me think. 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 1 divided by 0.28, which is the same as 100 / 28. Let's see: 28 * 3 is 84, 28 * 3.5 is 98, so 3.5714 (since 28 * 3.5714 ≈ 100). So yes, gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the ^6Li nucleus. The rest mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. Wait, but wait, actually, the mass of the nucleus is a bit less than the sum due to binding energy (mass defect), but for this calculation, maybe we can approximate it as the sum of the individual masses. Or perhaps the problem expects us to use the atomic mass unit and then convert to GeV.

Wait, another approach: the mass of ^6Li can be found using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Lithium-6 is about 6.013 atomic mass units (u), but I'm not exactly sure about the precise value. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to know that the mass of ^6Li is approximately 6 times the mass of a nucleon. Wait, a nucleon is a proton or neutron, and each has a mass of about 938 MeV/c². So 6 nucleons would give 6 * 9
