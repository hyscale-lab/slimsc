Okay, so I have this NMR question in front of me, and I need to figure out which two compounds are present in the mixture. Let me think through this step by step.

The molecular formula is C10H14 for both compounds. That suggests each is a substituted benzene ring with methyl groups. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to check. Benzene has 3 double bonds (or one ring and three double bonds), and each methyl is a single group. So for C10H14, the formula is C10H14. The general formula for an aromatic compound would be CnH2n-6, wait no—benzene is C6H6. Each substituent affects the hydrogen count. Alternatively, the degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For C10H14: (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2=4. So four degrees of unsaturation— that's a benzene ring (3) plus one double bond or ring, but I think it's a benzene with substituents.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6, so each compound has four substituents (if each is a methyl, for example). Because C6H6 has 6 carbons, adding four methyl groups (each is -CH3) would give 6 +4*1=10 carbons. Each methyl adds 3 hydrogens, but they also take away a hydrogen from the ring. Let's see: Benzene has 6 H. Each methyl group adds 3 H but replaces one H from the ring. So four methyl groups: 4*(3) =12 H added, but 4 H removed from ring, so 6-4=2 H on the ring. So total H would be 12 +2=14. Which matches C10H14. So each compound is a tetramethylbenzene, which is a benzene ring with four methyl groups attached.

So the two compounds in the mixture are each tetramethylbenzenes. The options given include different substitution patterns of four methyl groups on benzene.

The NMR spectrum has two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each a singlet. And three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, the NMR description says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. So each contributes their own NMR signals, but the peaks are at certain ratios.

Let me think about the aromatic region first. The aromatic protons in a tetramethylbenzene would depend on their substitution pattern. In some cases, the ring may have equivalent protons, leading to fewer signals.

Looking at each possible compound:

Option A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (that's what I'll call for now, but wait, 1,2,3,4 positions are adjacent, forming a square around the ring. Wait, no—on benzene, numbering those positions would
