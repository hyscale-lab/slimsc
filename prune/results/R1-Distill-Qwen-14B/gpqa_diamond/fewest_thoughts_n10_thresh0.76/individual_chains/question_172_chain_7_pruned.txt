Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I need to think about what I remember from my studies. Let's see.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as in star_2. Oh wait, excited in a specific energy level. I remember something about the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of energy levels to temperature. Right, the equation is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, but wait, ΔE is between two energy levels. So for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So if I consider the ratio of excited atoms to the lower level atoms, star_1 has a higher ratio.

Wait, let's think. Let's call the excited state population as n_1 and the lower as n_0. For star_1, n_1/n_0 is 2 times that of star_2. So n1/n0 for star1 is 2*(n1/n0 for star2). So n1_1 / n0_1 = 2 * (n1_2 / n0_2).

But according to the Boltzmann equation, n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)). Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars (same element, same levels), then the ratio depends only on the exponential term. So for star 1 and star 2:

(n1_1 / n0_1) = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
(n1_2 / n0_2) = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Given that (n1_1/n0_1) = 2*(n1_2/n0_2), so:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Because the g_i/g_j terms are the same and cancel out when taking
