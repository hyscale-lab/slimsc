Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The measured phase shifts are given as δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. I'm supposed to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. The goal is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, which are all numbers with units of fm, which I think stands for femtometers.

Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using partial waves, each associated with a phase shift δ_l. The formula I recall is something like:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l) ) / (1 - e^{-2iδ_l}) ) ] * (e^{i l θ} + e^{-i l θ} ) 

Wait, no, maybe that's not exactly right. Let me think. Oh wait, the scattering amplitude can be written as a sum over l of the partial wave amplitudes, each multiplied by a spherical harmonic or something. But perhaps for this problem, there's a simpler approach.

Wait, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh, right, along the beam direction would mean θ=0°, since that's the direction of the incident particle.

So when θ is zero, the cosine of θ is 1, and the other terms might simplify. Let me think about how the scattering amplitude looks in terms of the phase shifts.

The general expression for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is the sum over l of ( (2l+1) / (k) ) * [ ( sin δ_l ) / (1 - cos δ_l ) ) ] * e^{i l θ} 

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Another approach: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, Im f(θ), can be found using the phase shifts. I think each partial wave contributes to f, and the imaginary part is the sum of
