Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm. Let me start by recalling what I know about relative velocity in special relativity. I remember that velocities don't just add up normally when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light. There's this formula that gives the relative velocity between two objects moving at speeds u and v relative to a common frame.

Wait, right! The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, which way are the astronauts moving? They're both moving in the positive x-direction, but one is faster. So, astronaut 1 is 2m moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 is 3m at 0.5c. So the relative speed of astronaut 2 from astronaut 1's frame would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Wait no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no. If astronaut 1 is moving at u (0.6c), and astronaut 2 is moving at v (0.5c) in the same direction, then from astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2's speed would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Because when you change frames, the velocities transform like that. So substituting u=0.6c and v=0.5c, that would be (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. But speed is a magnitude, so 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c.
