Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me think through each step.

First, I remember the question gives info about the brightness limits. ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than V magnitude 17. HIRES can see brighter than 16. So a star must be brighter than 16 (since 16 is the higher limit, but wait, waitâ€”wait, the limits are "brighter than," which is confusing. Wait, apparent magnitude, lower numbers are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag in V for ESPRESSO, meaning it's magnitude is less than 17. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag (so apparent V magnitude less than 16).

So, a star that can be seen by both must have apparent V magnitude less than 16 because HIRES can't see beyond 16. So the apparent magnitude has to be less than 16.

Now, looking at each star:

Star1: Absolute magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc. The formula to find apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 +5 log10(d) , where d is distance in parsecs.

So m = 15.5 +5 +5*log10(10). Log10(10)=1, so 5*1=5. So m = 15.5 +5 +
