Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to break it down. I'm going to take it step by step.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five of them. So Y is some element that forms five different compounds with F. Hmm, I remember that elements in the periodic table form a certain number of compounds, so maybe Y is in a group that tends to have multiple oxidation states. For example, maybe Group 17, but wait, that's halogens. Or maybe Group 16, like sulfur? Or perhaps a transition metal? Wait, let's think about elements that commonly form multiple fluorides. Oh, like chlorine has several, but wait, the compounds are binary, so each is Y and F only.

Let me see. The problem describes several substances A1 to A5. Let's go through each clue.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is about room temperature, 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so being oxidized by another substance means that the substance is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so maybe A1 is a compound containing F in a high oxidation state.

When A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. So the decomposition reaction might look like A1 → A2 + F2. Or wait, A1 is decomposing into A2 and F, but the way it's written, it's ɷF=31,96%. Wait, ɷ is usually the notation for the mole fraction or sometimes the mass fraction, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's the mole fraction of F in A2? Or perhaps 31.96% is the percentage of F in A2 by mass? Hmm, but 31.96% is close to 32%, which is about the mass of fluorine in some compounds. Let me think about the possible formula.

If A2 has 31.96% fluorine by mass, and knowing that fluorine's atomic weight is about 19 g/mol, maybe the formula is YF3 or something. Let me calculate. Suppose it's YF3.

The molecular weight of YF3 would be Y + 3*19 = Y +57. If fluorine is 31.96% of that, so (57) / (Y+57) = 0.3196. Let's solve for Y.

57 = 0.3196*(Y +57)
57 = 0.3196 Y + 0.3196*57
0.3196*57 is approximately 18.177. So,

57 - 18.177 = 0.3196 Y
38.823 ≈ 0.3196 Y
Y ≈ 38.823 / 0.3196 ≈ about 121.5. So Y would be around 12
