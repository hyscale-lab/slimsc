Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed, v_max, of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The options are A, B, C, D. I remember that in the classical case, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal, v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things get more complicated.

Relativistically, the energy isn't just kinetic; it includes the rest mass energy. So the total energy E is gamma times mc². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). In the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. But wait, in relativity, the potential energy is a bit different. Oh right, for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential is usually taken as V(x) = (1/2)kx², similar to the classical case, but the kinetic energy is relativistic, so it's not (1/2)mv² anymore.

So the total energy E = K + V. At maximum displacement, the oscillator is at rest momentarily, so all the energy is potential. That's when x
