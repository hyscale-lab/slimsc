Okay, let me try to figure out which of these compounds show optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds have chiral centers, right? So, they can't be superimposed on their mirror images, leading to enantiomers which are non-superimposable mirror images. 

Let's go through each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl compounds can have stereoisomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral. The substituents here are at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. Wait, each benzene ring is attached to another, but does the arrangement allow for a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are in positions that don't allow for a plane of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral. Let me visualize: if the substituents are on opposite sides, maybe? Like, if the two nitro groups are on opposite ends, but also the two carboxylate groups. So, if the arrangement leads to no plane of symmetry, then the molecule could have optical isomers. So I think this one might have optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me draw the structure. The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxy would have the OH on the second carbon. So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes HOCH2CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait, methyl ester would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Hmm, but wait, the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the OH is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, maybe it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's see: the hydroxy group is on the second carbon of the propanoate chain. So the structure is O

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the molecule. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be OMe-O-C(O)-CH2-CHOH-CH3? No, I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would have an OH on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that's a straight chain. So the molecule would be CH3CH2COOCH2CH2OH? No, no: it's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the ester is OMe attached to the carboxy group, which is attached to a CH(OH)CH3. Wait, no: the propanoate is three carbons. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, maybe. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Let me think: the parent is propanoate, which is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COO-. As an ester, it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH3CH2COOCH2CH2OH? No, wait, no. Wait, the ester is formed from the acid and an alcohol. So, the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH of the acid becomes OMe. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. The central carbon (the second carbon) has four different groups: an OH, a CH2COOCH3, two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the first carbon is CH2(OH), second is CH2, third is COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not
