Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, the question is about the orbital periods of three exoplanets. Let me see what I remember from my studies.

Alright, the problem gives me the equilibrium temperature ratios between the planets and their mass ratios. The TTV method was used to discover them, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variations. But maybe that's just the method of discovery and not directly relevant to the calculations here.

The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. That means Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by a factor of 1.4. Then the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3, so Planet2 is hotter than Planet3 by that factor. So Planet3 is even cooler than Planet2.

The mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.15, so Planet2 is a bit more massive than Planet1. And between Planet2 and Planet3, the mass ratio is 1.35, so Planet3 is more massive than Planet2. Wait, but the problem says the ratio of masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15. Oh, so Planet1's mass over Planet2's is 1.15? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the question says the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15. Hmm, I think that means Planet1's mass is 1.15 times Planet2's. No wait, maybe it's the other way around. Because sometimes ratios can be confusing in which direction they go. Let me think: if the ratio is 1.15, and it's Planet1 to Planet2, then Planet1 is 1.15 times Planet2's mass. So Planet1 is more massive than Planet2. Then the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35, so Planet2's mass is 1.35 times Planet3's. So Planet2 is more massive than Planet3. So Planet1 is more massive than Planet2, which is more than Planet3. So the masses go Planet1 > Planet2 > Planet3.

But wait, does the mass of the planets affect their orbital period around the star? I thought orbital period is more about the distance from the star and the star's mass. But wait, Kepler's third law says that the orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed over the mass of the star. Oh wait, in the case where the star's mass much larger than the planet's, which it is, the planet's mass doesn't significantly affect the orbit. So the orbital period is mainly determined by the distance from the star and the mass of the star. But in this problem, I don't think the star's mass is given, so I guess we're assuming it's the same for all three planets. So the orbital period depends on the semi-major axis (distance from the star) and the star's mass. Since the star's mass is the same for all, the period depends on the distance.

Wait, but equilibrium temperature is given. So equilibrium temperature relates to the distance from the star because it's based on the incoming stellar flux. The equilibrium temperature formula is something like T = T
