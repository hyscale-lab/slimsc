Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read the question again carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They've given the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal, which I think means that the pH doesn't affect the EDTA's ability to form complexes with Ca²+ ions. So, no need to worry about the protonation states or anything like that.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, and it forms complexes with metal ions. The formation constant, Kf, is a measure of the stability of the complex. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex. So in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is quite stable because K is 5e10, which is a large number.

The problem states that the solution contains a 0.02 M concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, I think the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

Wait, I think this involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- (or the conjugate base, but since pH is ideal, maybe it's fully deprotonated). The reaction would be something like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

The formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, I got the formula right? Yes, because Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

But wait, in this scenario, we have the complex already present. So, the reverse reaction is happening: the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, the dissociation constant, Kd, would be the inverse of Kf. Because Kd = 1/Kf. Since Kf is 5e10, Kd is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. So, for the dissociation:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ +
