Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear physics here. It's a bit tricky for me, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The emitted particle has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, and there's this condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I need to figure out which partial wave isn't permitted.

First, I remember that in nuclear reactions, conservation laws like angular momentum and parity must hold. Also, Pauli's exclusion principle plays a role here, especially with the statistics of the particles involved.

The initial state is 1S0. Let's parse that. The notation is (2S+1)L(J), so for 1S0: S=0 (since 2S+1 =1 implies S=0), L is S (so L=0), and J=0. So the initial state has spin S=0, orbital angular momentum L=0, and total angular momentum J=0.

The system emits a particle X. Let's think about the implications. The initial NN system is in a state with certain quantum numbers, and after emitting X, they end up in another state. So, the emitted particle X must carry away some angular momentum and possibly change the isospin and other quantum numbers of the NN system.

The question provides four options, each showing an initial state 1S0 decaying into another state plus a particle (p, f, s, etc.). Wait, no, looking again, the options are labeled as 1S0 → something plus p, etc. Hmm, maybe I should make sense of what the options represent.

Wait, the options are like 1S0 → 7D1 + p, etc. So the final NN state is the first part (like 7D1) and the emitted particle is X. So for each option, after emission, the NN state is in a certain state, and X is emitted as p (like proton) or another particle.

But wait, the problem statement says that the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So X is a particle with parity -1, which would be a pseudoscalar? Or maybe something else. Well, parity is -1, so that's important for the overall parity conservation.

Now, the Pauli statistics condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. I think this is about the total isospin (T) of the NN system, the total spin (S), and the orbital angular momentum (L). The condition says that T equals S plus L plus 1 modulo 2.

Wait, but how are these related? I remember the Pauli exclusion principle imposes that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange of identical fermions. Since the NN system consists of two identical nucleons (protons or neutrons), their combined wavefunction must be antisymmetric. The wavefunction is a product of spin, spatial (orbital), and isospin parts. So, the product of these parts must be antisymmetric.

The total wavefunction's symmetry is determined by the product of the spatial (orbital angular momentum) part, spin part, and isospin part. For two identical fermions, the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. So, if the spatial (L) part is symmetric, then the product of spin and isospin must be antisymmetric, and vice versa.

The spin state S: if S is even (like S=0, which is symmetric), then the spatial and isospin parts must be antisymmetric. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The spin part of the wavefunction for two particles is symmetric under exchange if the spin state is symmetric. For two spin-1/2 particles, the triplet states (S=1) are symmetric, and the singlet (S=0) is antisymmetric. Similarly, the isospin part: for two nucleons, the isospin can be T=0 (antisymmetric) or T=1 (symmetric).

So, the combination of spin and isospin symmetry determines the symmetry of the spatial part. The overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric, so the product of the three parts (spin, isospin, spatial) must be antisymmetric. So, symmetry of spatial is determined by the product of spin and isospin.

If S is symmetric (like S=1), and T is symmetric (T=1), then their product is symmetric, so the spatial part (L) must be antisymmetric. Spatial wavefunctions are symmetric if L is even (0, 2, ...) and antisymmetric if L is odd (1, 3, ...). So, L must be odd.

Similarly, if S is antisymmetric (S=0) and T is antisymmetric (T=0), their product is symmetric, so L must be even.

Wait, but in the question, the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, so spin symmetric? Or antisymmetric? Wait, no. S=0 is the singlet state, which is antisymmetric under exchange. Because for two spin-1/2 particles, singlet (S=0) is antisymmetric and triplet (S=1) is symmetric.

So, initial state: S=0 (antisymmetric), L=0 (even, symmetric), T=... Well, the initial state must have T and L that combine to make the overall wavefunction antisymmetric. Wait, the initial state is 1S0, but what's the isospin T for the initial state? Hmm, not sure.

But the question says that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, after emission, the NN system has T=0. Let's focus on the final state.

The Pauli condition is T = S + L + 1 (mod 2). So, T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum (even or odd). Let me plug in T=0.

0 = S + L + 1 mod 2.

Which implies S + L = 1 mod 2.

So, S and L must be of opposite parity: one even, one odd.

Now, in the final state, the NN system has certain S, L, and J values.

The emitted particle X has certain angular momentum. Because of angular momentum conservation, the initial state's angular momentum must equal the sum of the final state's angular momentum and the angular momentum carried away by X.

Wait, but the initial state before emission must have certain angular momentum. The initial NN state is 1S0, so J=0. After emitting X, the total angular momentum should be conserved. So, the initial total angular momentum (J_initial) is 0, and the final state (NN) has J_final, and X has l (its orbital angular momentum). So, J_initial = J_final + l (in terms of vectors, but since they're in states, perhaps just scalar addition if aligned). But because they are vectors, it's more complicated. However, in these problems, we're probably considering that the orbital angular momentum of X is the state's L.

Wait, the problem says, for each option, the final NN state is in a certain angular momentum state. For example, option A: 7D1. So, in the final state, the NN has orbital angular momentum D=2 (since D is L=2). And the spin part is S, but the state is 7D1. Wait, the notation is (2S+1)L(J), so for 7D1: 2S+1=7 → S=3, L=D=2, and J=1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because S is the total spin, which for two nucleons can be 0 or 1. Because each is spin-1/2, combining to S=0 or 1. So, 2S+1 can be 1 (S=0) or 3 (S=1). So how can 2S+1 be 7 for a state? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the notation is different. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the notation.

Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)LJ, where S is the total spin, L is the orbital angular momentum, and J is the total angular momentum (vector sum of S and L). So, for each state like 7D1, the first number is 2S+1, so S must be (7-1)/2 = 3. But wait, for two nucleons (each spin-1/2), the maximum S is 1. So, 2S+1 can be 1 or 3. So, a state with 2S+1=7 would imply S=3, which is impossible for two spin-1/2 particles. Therefore, that option must be invalid. But that can't be right because the question gives that option as a possibility.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation in the options. Maybe the option is not the state of the NN system, but the state of the emitted particle X? No, the options are labeled as 1S0 → 7D1 + p, etc., which suggests that 7D1 is the state of the NN system after emission, and p is the emitted particle.

But that would imply the NN system has S=3, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps the term symbol in the options is not for the NN system but for the emitted particle. No, because the question says the partial wave is denoted by the angular momentum state of X. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me reread the question.

The question says: "where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X." So the options show the final
