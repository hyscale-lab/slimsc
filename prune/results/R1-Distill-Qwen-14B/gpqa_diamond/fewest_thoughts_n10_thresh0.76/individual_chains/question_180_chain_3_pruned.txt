Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. It's about an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A through D.

Hmm, energy in an electrostatic system. I remember that the potential energy between point charges is involved here. For a system of charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. Since potential energy is a property of the system, I have to calculate the energy for all the interactions.

Wait, but how many interactions do I have here? Let me think. There are 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at P. The other 12 are each at a distance of 2m from P. Wait, but each of the 12 is at 2m from P, but what about their distances from each other? Oh, wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So they're all on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P, but their exact positions relative to each other aren't specified. Hmm, but for calculating the potential energy, it might depend on their distances. But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So I need to arrange them such that the potential energy is as low as possible.

Wait, but for a system of like charges, the potential energy is minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible. Because the potential energy between two positive charges is positive and increases as they get closer. So to minimize the energy, each pair of charges should be as far apart as possible.

But in this scenario, since the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P. So each of the 12 is 2m away from the 13th. But their mutual distances (between the 12) can vary. To minimize the total potential energy, the 12 should be placed as far apart as possible. So if they're all on the surface of a sphere, the configuration that minimizes the potential energy is when each charge is as far as possible from every other. That would be when they form a regular dodecahedron or something like that on the sphere's surface, but I'm not sure about the exact arrangement. Wait, but maybe for the purpose of this problem, I don't need to calculate their mutual distances because the problem might only consider the energy due to the 13th charge and the other 12, not the energy between the 12 themselves. Or is that the case?

Wait, no. The potential energy includes all pairs. So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So let's break it down.

Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th charge (fixed at P). So each of these 12 contributes a potential energy term with the 13th. So that's 12 pairs each of (2e)*(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2m) ?

Wait, no, because the 13th charge is fixed. So each of the 12 charges has a potential energy due to the 13th. But wait, potential energy in a system is calculated as the work required to assemble the charges, bringing each from infinity and placing them in the field of the others. Alternatively, the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r.

So the 13th charge is fixed. Let's think of the 12 charges being placed one by one at 2m from P. So the first charge placed would have the 13th charge at P. The potential energy for that first charge would be U1 = (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e * 2e) / (2m). Each subsequent charge would have a similar potential energy due to the 13th, but also their own potential energies due to the charges already placed.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their mutual distances could be anything as long as each is 2m from P. But that's not possible because if they all are 2m from P, they can't all be 2m apart from each other. For example, in 3D space, you can have a maximum of 12 points on a sphere such that each is equidistant from each other, but that's a very specific and symmetric arrangement.
