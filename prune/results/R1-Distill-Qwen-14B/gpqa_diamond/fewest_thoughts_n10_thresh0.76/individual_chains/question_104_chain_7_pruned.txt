Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity technique detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star move. 

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits, which probably means their motion is simpler to model without eccentricity effects.

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does this shift relate to the orbital period of the planet? 

I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's gravitational pull. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/2). Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, the formula I remember is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 * P ) ) )^(1/3) multiplied by some other constants, but maybe I should think about the relationship between the velocity and the period.

Wait, another approach. Since the stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), the velocity semi-amplitude K should be inversely related to the orbital period. Because K is proportional to (M_p)/(M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)), perhaps? 

Wait, let's get the formula correctly. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P ) )^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But because the planets are in circular orbits, e is zero, so that term is 1. Also, since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Sun-like stars and Neptune has a mass less than Earth's, so negligible compared to the star), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_star^2) )^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3 )

Wait, but M_p is in the numerator. So K is proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) ) multiplied by some constants. But wait, let's think in terms of the ratio between the two planets.

Both stars have the same mass, M_star. Both planets have similar masses, M_p. So M_p for both is roughly the same. So the ratio of K1 to K2 would be ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) ) * ( (P2 /
