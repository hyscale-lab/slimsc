Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Let's see if I can figure this out. Hmm, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

The given data includes the masses of the stars, but I don't think mass affects the elemental ratios directly here since the question is about photospheric composition. The abundances are given in terms of logarithmic scalesâ€”so [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, and [Fe/H]_1 and [Mg/H]_2 are both 0. 

Wait, what do these brackets mean again? Oh right, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithmic abundance relative to the Sun. 

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5, which I think translates to log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, Mg is 7, so log10(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5. So nMg/nH is 10^-5. 

But how does that help me find the ratio of silicon in the two stars?

Let me break this down step by step.

First, for Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. That means log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 minus the solar value is 0.3. Wait, the solar ratio is (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log10(n_Si_1/n_Fe_1) - log10(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) = 0.3.

So, log10( (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) = 0.3. Therefore, (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Fe/H] = log10(n_Fe/n_H) - log10(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) =0. So n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun. 

Wait, but how is hydrogen in the star's atmosphere? So, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, meaning the iron abundance is the same as the Sun relative to hydrogen. So the iron abundance is solar. 

So, in Star_1, n_Fe_1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun). Wait, but [Fe/H] is the logarithm of n_Fe/n_H relative to the solar ratio. So [Fe/H] = log(n_Fe_1/n_H_1) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) )= 0. So n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun. So the ratio of Fe to H is same as the Sun. 

Hmm, but what about in terms of the overall composition? Maybe I need to express n_Si_1 in terms of n_H_1. 

Wait, let's think about Star_1. I know [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

But I need n_Si_1 / n_H_1. Let's see. 

From [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. So [Si/Fe] is the log of (n_Si /n_Fe) in the star minus the solar ratio. 

So, log( (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

Which implies, (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But I also have that n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1. 

So, substituting that in:

n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3 * n_Fe_1

But n_Fe_1 is (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

So, n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) *10^0.3 * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1 

The n_Fe_sun cancels out, so:

n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * 10^0.3 * n_H_1.

But (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) is the solar ratio. So, n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * 10^0.3 * n_H_1.

So, the ratio n_Si_1 / n_H_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * 10^0.3.

But wait
