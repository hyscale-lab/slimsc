Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the number of protons corresponds to the splitting. So, a triplet would be a peak split into three parts, and a quartet into four.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. That's a common region for methyl groups attached to something, maybe CH3 groups next to another CH2. And the quartet at 1.3 with 4H probably comes from a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. So maybe something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2? No, wait, the counts don't add up. Let me think again.

Actually, the triplet for 6H suggests two sets of three protons each, perhaps as two equivalent CH3 groups. And the quartet for 4H could be a single CH2CH2 group. Wait, but quartet implies two neighboring groups, each with two protons. So if a CH2 is next to another CH2, that would make sense. So maybe it's (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, the NMR would have more signals then. Or perhaps a di-substituted alkane.

Wait, another thought: the triplet at 0.9 for 6H could be two CH3 groups attached to a central CH2. Like (CH3)2CH2. But that doesn't explain the quartet.

Oh wait, maybe it's a cyclopropane structure? No, not sure. Alternatively, think about the splitting. The triplet for 6H would be two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2. Because if each CH3 is attached to a CH2 that is next to another CH2, each CH3 would couple with the adjacent CH2's protons, leading to a triplet. Wait, but each CH3 would split into a triplet if adjacent to a CH2 with two protons. So maybe the structure is something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2 something.

Wait, but the quartet is at 1.3
