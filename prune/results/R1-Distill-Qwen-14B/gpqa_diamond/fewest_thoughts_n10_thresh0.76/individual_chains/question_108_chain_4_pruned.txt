Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's see.

The setup is a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis, and they mention small values of m (the orbital magnetic quantum number). The magnetic field is 1 Tesla, which I know is a pretty strong field, but I'm not sure how that plays into this. 

The problem asks me to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic coupling term) with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers. Oh wait, that's the Balmer series wavelength for hydrogen, right? That corresponds to the transition from n=2 to n=1, emitting a photon in the Lyman series? Or wait, no, Balmer is n=2 to n=1? Wait no, Balmer is from higher states to n=2, like n=3 to n=2, which is about 656 nm. Oh wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486 nm, which is the Balmer-alpha line, corresponding to n=3 to n=2. So the energy difference ΔE is the energy of that photon, right?

So first, I need to compute ΔE. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by the formula E_n = - (13.6 eV) / n². So for n=3 and n=2, the energy levels would be E3 = -13.6/9 ≈ -1.511 eV, and E2 = -13.6/4 = -3.4 eV. So the transition energy ΔE is E2 - E3? Wait no, because when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon with energy equal to the difference. So from n=3 to n=2, ΔE = E2 - E3. Wait, wait, no, because E3 is less negative than E2. So E2 is lower (more negative), so E3 is higher (less negative). So when it drops from 3 to 2, ΔE would be E2 - E3 = (-3.4) - (-1.511) = -1.889 eV. But since energy is positive when emitted, the magnitude is 1.889 eV. So the photon energy is 1.889 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. Oh right, paramagnetism arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of electrons and an external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, the Hamiltonian simplifies to H = -μ_B B m, but wait, I think it's actually H = -μ · B = μ_B B m, because I'm a bit fuzzy on the signs. Wait, the magnetic moment is μ = -g μ_B (L + 2S)/(something), but for electrons, the orbital part is μ_L = (μ_B m_l)/ħ? Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, the paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian for an electron in a magnetic field is H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = - (e/(2m_e)) S, but wait, more accurately, μ = -g_s μ_B S, where g_s is the electron g-factor (~2), μ_B is the Bohr magneton. But for orbital angular momentum, it's μ_L = (μ_B / ħ) L. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, for paramagnetism, the coupling is often considered as H = μ·B, but the magnetic moment μ has components depending on orbital and spin angular momentum. However, the problem states that the magnetic field is along Oz, so the relevant component is m, the z-component of the orbital angular momentum.

Wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is m_l, which can take values -l, ..., +l. So the paramagnetic term would involve m here. Since the field is along Oz, the energy shift would be proportional to m.

The paramagnetic coupling energy is given by H = -μ·B. For orbital angular momentum, μ_L is proportional to L (or more precisely, μ_L = (e/(2m_e c)) L_z * something. Alternatively, the Hamiltonian is H = (μ_B B m) / something? Wait, let me think again.

The Bohr magneton μ_B is defined as (eħ)/(2 m_e c), where e is electron charge, ħ is hbar, m_e is electron mass, c speed of light. The magnetic dipole moment due to orbital angular momentum is μ_L = (μ_B/(ħ)) L. So perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = -μ_L · B. Since B is along Oz, H = -μ_L_z B. So H = - (μ_B/(ħ)) L_z B. But L_z in terms of quantum numbers is ħ m, so L_z = ħ m. So substituting, H = -μ_B/(ħ) * ħ m B = -μ_B m B.

Wait, that's simplifying to H = -μ_B m B. So the expectation value would be <H> = -μ_B m B. So the magnitude is |<H>| = μ_B |m| B.

But the problem says small values of m. Since m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, for a given l, m can be -l, -l+1,...,0,..., l. So small m would imply m is near 0.

Wait, but even so, for a given state, m can vary. But the problem says "small values of m", so perhaps we can take m as approximately 0. But wait, if m is small, then the paramagnetic term is small. But let me compute the magnitude.

μ_B is approximately 9.274 × 10^-24 J/T. B is 1 T. So μ_B * B = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J. Then, multiplied by |m|. But if m is small
