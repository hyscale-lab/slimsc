Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. The options are given in millions of kilometers, so I'll need to calculate correctly.

Hmm, okay. Since both are inertial frames, I think this involves special relativity. Because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, but wait, 60,000 km/s is what? Let me check: the speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 20% of that. That's pretty fast, so relativistic effects might come into play, like time dilation or length contraction.

Wait, the question is about how much distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So I need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, which is the rest frame, right?

Wait, no. Let me think. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center, perhaps? Or is it the other way around?

Wait no, no. If in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s, that means in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy. Because if two objects are approaching each other, their velocities are mirror images in each other's frames, but only for speeds much less than light. Wait, but since they're inertial frames, the velocity transformation would apply.

Wait, but in special relativity, velocities don't simply add. Oh wait, no, the question says that both are inertial frames, but it doesn't tell us which is moving relative to the other. It says from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,
