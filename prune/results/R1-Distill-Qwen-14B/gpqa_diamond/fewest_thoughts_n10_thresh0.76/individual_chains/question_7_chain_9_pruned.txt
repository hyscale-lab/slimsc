Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, which fills the universe. The question is about how high-energy gamma-rays annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The process is gamma-gamma → e+ e-.

The question asks at what energy a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe would be limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are all in the GeV range, which are really high energies.

I think this has to do with the photon density and the interaction cross-section. Oh right, when particles interact, their mean free path determines how far they'll travel before interacting. If the mean free path is short, the particle's lifetime is limited by the interaction.

So, the idea is that for high-energy gamma-rays, the probability of interacting with a CMB photon becomes significant. Once they reach a certain energy, these gamma-rays can't travel too far without annihilating, so their lifetime is limited by this process.

I remember that the cross-section for this process (gamma + photon → e+ e-) depends on the energy of the gamma and the photon. The cross-section increases rapidly with energy. But how?

The cross-section probably scales with some power of the gamma's energy. I think it's proportional to the square of the logarithm of the energy ratio or something like that. Wait, more accurately, the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- goes as σ ~ (E_γ)^2 (since each photon's energy contributes to the cross-section in a certain way). Or maybe it's proportional to the product of the two energies, but since one is much higher, it's roughly proportional to E_γ squared.

Another approach: the interaction rate depends on the photon density, the cross-section, and the speed. The mean free time τ is 1/(n * σ * v), where n is photon density, σ is cross-section, and v is velocity (maybe approximated as c for gamma-rays).

The lifetime must be compared to the age of the universe. If the mean free time τ is less than the age, then the gamma-rays are quickly annihilated, so their lifetime is limited.

But wait, the problem says the lifetime is limited by this process, so τ ≈ Hubble time or something
