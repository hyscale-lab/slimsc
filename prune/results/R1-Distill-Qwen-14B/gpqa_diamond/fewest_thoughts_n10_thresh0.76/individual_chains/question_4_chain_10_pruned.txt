Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a hypothetical universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our real world, magnets always have both poles—like how a magnet has a north and a south end. But wait, why is that? Oh right, it's because of a symmetry in Maxwell's equations. Or maybe it's due to some of the equations that dictate the behavior of magnetic fields.

Wait, Maxwell's equations consist of four laws. Let me think. The first one is Gauss's Law for electric fields, which relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed. The second is Gauss's Law for magnetism, which says that the magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero. Oh, right, that's why you can't have isolated north or south poles in our universe—because the divergence of the magnetic field is zero everywhere, meaning no magnetic monopoles.

So in this parallel universe, if magnets can have isolated poles, that means the conditions for magnetic monopoles must be possible. That would change the magnetic version of Gauss's Law. Because normally, the divergence of B is zero. But if magnetic monopoles exist, the divergence of B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, similar to how electric charge works with the divergence of E.

So Maxwell's equations in our world are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ (Gauss's Law for E)
2. ∇·B = 0          (Gauss's Law for B)
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t   (Faraday's Law)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t (Ampère-Maxwell Law)

In the scenario where magnetic monopoles exist, equation 2 would change. So equation 2 would become ∇·B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. But wait, what about the other equations? Do they change too?

Faraday's Law, equation 3, might also change. Because if there's a magnetic current (like a current made of moving magnetic charges), then the curl of E might have a term related to that. Oh right, in the real world, the curl of E is the negative rate of change of B. But with magnetic currents, I think there would be an extra term. So equation
