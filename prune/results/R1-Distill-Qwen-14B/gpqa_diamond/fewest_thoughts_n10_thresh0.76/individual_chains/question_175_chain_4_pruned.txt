Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me think through it step by step. The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. It radiates at a certain wavelength, and we're supposed to find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle and the form of the power function f in the radiation zone.

Hmm, right, I remember that oscillating charges radiate electromagnetic waves. The problem mentions the radiation zone, which I think is the region far from the source where the fields behave like plane waves. In that region, the radiated power per unit solid angle must depend on the wavelength and the angle theta.

Wait, the question says the function f is a function of lambda and theta. So f = f(lambda, theta), and the power per unit solid angle is given by this function. The maximum power is A, and we're looking for the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and also the form of f, which is either some power of lambda, like -3, -4, etc.

I think I remember something about the radiation pattern for a dipole antenna. Oh wait, yeah, for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern in the far zone (radiation zone) is such that the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (sin theta)^2. Or wait, was it proportional to (sin theta)^2? Or maybe (sin theta) or something else.

Wait no, I think for a dipole radiator, the radiation intensity is maximum at theta = 90 degrees, and it decreases as you go towards the poles (theta=0 and 180). The formula I think is (sin theta)^2, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. Oh wait, in terms of the directionality, the maximum occurs perpendicular to the dipole axis, so that makes sense. So if the symmetry is along the z-axis, the maximum intensity is at theta=90 degrees.

But in this problem, the maximum power A is given as the maximum, so perhaps when we talk about the fraction at a certain angle, we're comparing the power at that angle to the maximum. So for theta=30 degrees, what is the fraction?

Wait, but wait. The function f depends on lambda and theta. So f would also have a dependence on the wavelength, right? Because the radiation has a wavelength lambda, and the
