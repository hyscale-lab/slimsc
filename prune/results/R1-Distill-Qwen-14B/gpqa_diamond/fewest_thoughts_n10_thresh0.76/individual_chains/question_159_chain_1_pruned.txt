Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and their observations in the near infrared and optical spectra. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The question says that there's a peak at about 790 nm and that the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that in quasars, emission lines can be broad and there might be a peak due to certain emission features. But wait, when the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, that sounds familiar. Oh right! It could be due to the Lyman-alpha forest or maybe the Lyman-alpha emission line itself, which is usually around 121 nm. But wait, 790 nm is much longer than that. Oh wait, no, wait—actually, that's in the near-infrared. Wait, Lyman-alpha is in the UV. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let me think. The Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV. But the peak here is at 790 nm, which is near infrared. That's much longer than 121 nm. So perhaps this is something else. Or maybe it's about the observed wavelength being redshifted. Oh wait, because quasars are at high redshifts, their emitted UV light would be shifted into longer wavelengths due to the expansion of the universe.

So if the emitted Lyman-alpha is at 121 nm, but in our observation it's at 790 nm, that must be due to redshift. Let me calculate the redshift. The formula is observed wavelength = emitted wavelength * (1 + z). So z = (observed / emitted) - 1. So that's 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.5. So 6.5 minus 1 is 5.5. So redshift z is approximately 5.5.

Wait, but wait a second. The peak is at 790 nm. But is that the Lyman-alpha emission line? Because if the quasar emits in the UV, but the intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshifts can absorb a lot of the UV flux except for some windows. Oh, right, the so-called "Lyman-break" galaxies. The Lyman-break occurs when the IGM absorbs light below a certain wavelength. So if you see a drop in flux below a certain wavelength, that's the
