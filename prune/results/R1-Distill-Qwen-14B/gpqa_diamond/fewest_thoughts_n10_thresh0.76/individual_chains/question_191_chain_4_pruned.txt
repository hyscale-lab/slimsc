Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. That's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. So, cyclohexanone with substituents on carbons 3 and 5. Carbon 3 has a hydroxymethyl group, which is a CH2OH, right? And carbon 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as isopropenyl, right? So that's a CH2 group attached to a double bond, like CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(=CH2)-, so it's a substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So the group is CH(CH2) attached via the middle carbon, making it an allyl group but substituted. Hmm, maybe it's more like (CH2)2C=CH2 but connected in a different way. Wait, no. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is (CH2)2C=CH2 isn't correct. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2- but attached from the middle? Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So it's CH2-C(=CH2)- as a substituent. So attached to the cyclohexane ring, carbon 5 has a group that's CH2-C(=CH2)-, but wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2CH2, but that's not right. Maybe I should draw it. Let's see: propene is CH2=CHCH3. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, so the group is CH2-CH2- but the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the substituent is attached to C2. So, the group is CH2-C(=CH2)-, but I'm a bit confused. Maybe it's (CH2)2C=CH2? Wait, no. No, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2- but attached from the middle carbon. So, wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2- but the point of attachment is the middle carbon, so the structure is CH2-CH2- with a double bond between the first and second carbons, and the substituent is on the second carbon. So it's CH2-C(=CH2)- as a substituent. So the group is CH2-C=CH2, but connected via the central carbon. Hmm. So, the substituent on carbon 5 is an allyl group, perhaps.

So the
