Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh wait, no, wait—that's probably a vector, but in quantum mechanics, states should be normalized, right? So I think I should check if this vector is normalized first. But maybe the problem assumes it's already normalized, or maybe I need to normalize it before proceeding.

Wait, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1) as a column. Let me calculate its norm. The norm squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So to make it a unit vector, I need to divide each component by sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T. Hmm, but wait, maybe the problem is written in a way where the state is given without being normalized, but I think the observable measurement probabilities depend on the normalized state. So I should proceed with the normalized state.

Next, the observable is represented by matrix P. Let me write down matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, wait. So the matrix P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

P = [
    [0, 1/√2, 0],
    [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
    [0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Hmm, I'm a bit confused about what exactly P represents. Observables are Hermitian matrices, right? So I should check if P is Hermitian. The matrix is symmetric across the diagonal because the element at (1,2) is equal to (2,1), and (1,3) would be, but wait, the first row
