Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is about Michael additions, which I remember are nucleophilic additions to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Let me try to break down each part.

The problem has three separate reactions labeled (A), (B), and (C), and I need to determine the major products for each. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction (A):
The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. I think NaOEt is a strong base, so it's likely deprotonating something here.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a diethyl malonate derivative. It has the structure CH2(CO2Me)2. When it reacts in a Michael addition, it donates an enolate. The other compound is the acceptor, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of that would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3, but wait, actually, it's methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=CH-CO2Me attached to the p-tolyl group? No, wait. The structure is probably CH2-C(=O)OCH3 attached to a CH2 group, but no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me draw it:

The acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the structure should be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with the p-tolyl group on the β carbon. Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, that would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group at the 3 position. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Maybe it's (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)prop-2-enoate? So the
