Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR question. Let me read through it again.

The question says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. Their 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

The options are different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures first.

The molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene rings with substituents. Let's see:

Each benzene (C6H6) with substituents. For example, if substituents are methyl groups, each adds CH3. So for a tetramethylbenzene, the formula would be C10H14. Because benzene is C6H6, four methyl groups add 4*(CH3) = 4*3=12 H, but each substitution replaces an H in the ring. Hmm, wait no, wait.

Wait, benzene has 6 H. Each substitution (like a methyl) replaces one H. So for four substituents, it would become C6H6-4 + 4 CH3. So the molecular formula would be C6 +4 C = C10. H: 6-4=2 (from benzene) plus 4*3 (from CH3) = 14, so C10H14. Yes, so all the options are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which has diethyl groups.

Option C is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Diethyl is two ethyl groups, each C2H5. So for two ethyl groups: 2*(C2H5) = C4H10. The benzene would then be C6H6 - 2 H, so C6H4. So total is C6 + C4 = C10, and H: 4 (from benzene) + 10 (from ethyl) =14. So that also fits C10H14. So all options are possible.

Now, looking at the NMR data.

First, the aromatic signals
