Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can remember.

The question is about an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I know that |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis. That probably means I can treat them as basis vectors in a two-level system, like a qubit in quantum computing.

The first part of the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, so A is a 2x2 matrix? Let me write that out.

Matrix A would look like:
[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0   ]

Because when i≠j, the elements are hbar/2, and the diagonal elements are 0. So this is an anti-diagonal matrix with hbar/2 in the off-diagonal positions. Hmm, I think this is related to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply that by hbar/2, we get A. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are usually used in spin-1/2 systems, so this operator must be proportional to the X (sigma_x) operator.

So the operator in question is (hbar/2) * sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates that the problem is referring to. To find the probabilities, I need to find these eigenstates and then project |alpha> onto them.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Since the operator is proportional to sigma_x, its eigenstates are the same as those of sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |−x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Alternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize matrix A to find its eigenstates. But given that A is (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], then the eigenvalues would be ±hbar/2, and the eigenvectors would be the same as for sigma_x.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think. The eigenstates of the operator are the eigenvectors of matrix A. Because A is a real symmetric matrix (since A_ij = A_ji), its eigenvectors are orthonormal. So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenvectors and compute the square of the amplitudes.

Alternatively, since A is a multiple of sigma_x, perhaps the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, which I can write in terms of |up> and |down>.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, let me double-check that. Actually, sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when multiplied by (hbar/2), the eigenvalues become (hbar/2) and -(hbar/2). But for finding the eigenstates, the structure is the same.

So, to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, I need to write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>, then the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients.

Wait, but |alpha> is given in the |up> and |down> basis. So perhaps I can compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |−x>, then square the magnitudes for probabilities.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to first normalize |alpha> because the question says it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So I should find the normalization factor.

Let's compute the norm of |alpha>. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. The inner product is (1+i)(1−i) + (2−i)(2+i). Because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

Calculating each term:

(1+i)(1-i) = 1^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.
(2−i)(2+i) = (2)^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) =5.

So the norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, to find the probabilities, I need the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x> (the eigenstates of A). Let's express |+x> and |−x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, to find the coefficients c_+ and c_- such that:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>

Substituting the expressions for |+x> and |−x>:

|alpha> = c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

Grouping the terms:
