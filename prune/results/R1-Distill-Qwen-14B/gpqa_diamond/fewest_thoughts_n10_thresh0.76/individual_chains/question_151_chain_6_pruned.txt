Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a particular value for an observable. Let me see what I remember from my studies.

Wait, so the system's state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh right, that's a state vector. And the observable is represented by the matrix P. I think P is a Hermitian operator because observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, right?

The question asks for the probability that measuring P will yield 0. So I think this involves finding the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then projecting the state vector onto that eigenspace. The probability would be the square of the norm of that projection.

But wait, how do I find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0? Oh, right, you solve (P - 0*I) v = 0, so P v = 0. Let me look at the matrix P:

P is a 3x3 matrix. First row is (0, 1/√2, 0), second row (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), third row (0, 1/√2, 0).

Hmm, let me write it out:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

So to find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0, I need to solve P v = 0.

Let me represent that as a system of equations. Let v be a column vector (a, b, c).

Equation 1: 0*a + (1/√2)*b + 0*c = 0 → (1/√2) b = 0 → b = 0.

Equation 2: (1/√2) a + 0*b + (1/√2) c = 0 → (a + c) / √2 = 0 → a + c = 0 → c = -a.

Equation 3: 0*a + (1/√2) b + 0*c = 0 → same as equation 1, so again b=0.

So the eigenvector must satisfy b=0 and c = -a. So the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are all vectors where v = (a, 0, -a) = a*(1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1).

Wait, but does that make sense? Because if the system's state is given, maybe I should normalize that vector first.

Wait, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let me compute its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1). Or maybe I can work without
