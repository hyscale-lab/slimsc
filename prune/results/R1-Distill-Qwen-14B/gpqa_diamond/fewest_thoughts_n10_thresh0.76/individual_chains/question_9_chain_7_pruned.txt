Okay, so I've got this question about symmetry in molecules, and I need to figure out which one has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules refers to the different ways a molecule can look the same after being rotated or reflected. The notation C3h sounds familiar. I think the 'C' stands for a cyclic group, and the subscript number refers to the order. So C3 would be a three-fold rotation axis. The 'h' probably stands for a horizontal mirror plane. So C3h symmetry means the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis.

Wait, no, I think the notation can vary. Some sources say that 'h' refers to a horizontal mirror plane, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should check what C3h actually includes. I think C3h is part of the dihedral groups. Dihedral groups have rotations and reflections. For C3h, there are three-fold rotations and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation around the axis and also have a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis. 

Looking at the options, I have four molecules to consider: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo-something, and triphenyleno-something. Let me go through each one.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. I think it's a molecule with a central structure and three substituents. Wait, the name suggests three rings attached, maybe. Triphenyleno implies three phenylene groups attached. The structure might have a central part with three substituents arranged symmetrically. If it's arranged with three substituents around a central point, maybe like a trigonal planar arrangement, that could allow for C3 symmetry.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. So this is a benzo-fused trifuran. I'm not super familiar with this structure, but benzo implies a benzene ring fused to something. Trifuran has three furan rings? Or maybe it's a tricyclic structure with three furan-like rings. Wait, maybe it's a compound where three furan rings are attached in a symmetric way. Alternatively, perhaps benzo refers to a benzene ring fused to a trifuran system. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, maybe it has C3 symmetry. But I'm not sure if the substituents would be in the right positions for that.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate is a molecule where boron is connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a -CH(CH3)2 group. So the structure would have three identical substituents around a central boron atom. Boron typically has a trigonal planar geometry when bonded
