Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So it's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which means there's an O-CO-O group somewhere. Ester groups usually have a carbonyl peak around 1700 cm^-1, and an O-H stretch around 2500â€“3300 cm^-1 if it's an ester with an alcohol part, but wait, esters don't have O-H unless it's part of a hemiacetal or something. Oh right, esters have a strong absorption around 1730-1760 for the C=O and a medium one around 1100-1250 for the C-O. So that's a good clue.

Now looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals. Let me break it down: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet, one doublet of quartets), and two -CH3 groups. No signals for -CH2, so the molecule doesn't have any methylene groups.

Wait, the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so how are the protons arranged? A di-substituted benzene usually has two substituents in positions that determine the number of unique aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. But if they are ortho or meta, the number of signals could vary.

But wait, the NMR shows two signals for aromatic protons. That suggests that each set is equivalent. So maybe the substituents are in positions that lead to a certain symmetry. Let's think: if the two substituents are in para positions, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Each substituent would cause the adjacent protons to split, but if the substituents are para, the two adjacent protons on each substituent would be equivalent. So that would give two signals for the aromatic protons.

But wait, the substituents are themselves more complex because the other signals are for vinyl and methyl groups. So perhaps the substituents are ester groups or other groups that
