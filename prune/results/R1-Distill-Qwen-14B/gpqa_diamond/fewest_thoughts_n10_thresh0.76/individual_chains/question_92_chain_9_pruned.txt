Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, enthalpy of formation usually refers to the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I think I need to use the bond energies provided to calculate this.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. It looks like a molecule with two double bonds. Each double bond is between carbons, and there are several methyl groups attached. So, each of those double bonds is a C=C bond, right?

The problem gives me some bond energies. Let me jot those down:

Enthalpy of atomization of carbon: 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, wait, atomization is the energy required to break a C atom from its standard state, which is graphite, into a gaseous atom. So, that's different from bond energies between atoms.

Bond energies:
- H-H: 100 kJ/mol
- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ/mol
- C-H: 400 kJ/mol

I remember that when calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies, we calculate the energy required to break all bonds in the react
