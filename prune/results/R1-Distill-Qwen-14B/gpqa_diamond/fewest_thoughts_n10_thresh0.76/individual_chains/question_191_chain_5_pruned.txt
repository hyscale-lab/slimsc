Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The question starts with 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me try to visualize that structure. So, it's a cyclohexanone ring. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (so a CH2OH attached), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like a vinyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH2) something? Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C=CH2? No, wait, propene is CH2=CH-CH3. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, so the structure is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, maybe I'm mixing that up.

Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the substituent at C2. So the group would be CH2-C=CH2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 where there's a double bond between 1 and 2. No, wait, perhaps it's CH2-C=CH2 attached via the middle carbon. So the structure would be CH2-C=CH2, but attached at the middle carbon (position 2). So actually, it's isopropenyl. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is isopropenyl group. So the substituent is -(CH2)C=CH2? Or perhaps it's CH2-C(CH2)-? Maybe I should draw this.

So the starting compound is a cyclohexanone ring with a hydroxymethyl at C3 and an isopropenyl group at C5. So, the ring is cyclohexan-1-one, so the ketone is at position 1.

Then, the first reaction is treatment with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1. Sodium hyd
