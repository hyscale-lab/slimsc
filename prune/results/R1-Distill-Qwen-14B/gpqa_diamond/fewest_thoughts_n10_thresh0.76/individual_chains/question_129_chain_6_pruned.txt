Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are some hints given, so I need to pay attention to those.

First, let's outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are:

a) Compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. So, the Wittig reaction forms alkenes. Let me think: the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So, the ylide must have added a propenyl group or something similar. The structure of the product implies that the ylide had a propyl group, perhaps. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is the same as isopropenyl group, right? So, the cyclopentane has substituents at positions 1, 2 (two methyl groups?), and 4 (an isopropenyl group). Wait, the formula is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So, the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups on carbons 1 and 2, and an isopropenyl group on carbon 4.

Wait, let me draw this mentally. Cyclopentane ring, carbon 1 has a methyl, carbon 2 has a methyl, and carbon 4 has an isopropenyl substituent. So, the substituents are at positions 1,2, and 4. So, this is the product of a Wittig reaction between compound A and the ylide. Therefore, compound A is the aldehyde or ketone that reacts with the ylide. Wittig reactions typically convert aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So, the structure of compound A must be such that when it reacts with the ylide, it forms the given product.

So, the starting material (compound A) is probably a cyclopentanone or cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Let me think: the product of the Wittig has a double bond where the carbonyl group was. So, if compound A is a carbonyl, like cyclopentanone with substituents, then the Wittig would convert the carbonyl into a double bond, adding the ylide's R group.

Looking at the product structure: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The double bond is at the propan-2-ylidene group, which is a substituent on the cyclopentane ring. So the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5 (assuming the numbering). Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or is it (CH3)2C=CH- as a substituent?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is (CH3)2C=, as a ylidene group. So in the product, the cyclopentane has a substituent at C4 which is a propenyl group attached via the double bond. So, the ylide would have been (CH3)2C=P... something. The Wittig reaction replaces the carbonyl with the R group (from the ylide) and a double bond.

So, if compound A is a ketone, say, 1,
