Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually used for the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride to a carboxylic acid, but wait, isn't that more like H2O with red P? Or maybe it's something else. Oh wait, no. Another reaction I recall is the reaction of an alkyne with HI to form a diiodide. Alternatively, maybe it's about the hydrolysis of a nitrile? Or perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

But wait, let's look at the data given. The IR and NMR spectra of compound X will help determine its structure first, and then we can think about the reaction.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably due to O-H stretching (like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol) or maybe N-H. But wait, another possibility is that it's an alkyne C-H stretch, which is usually around 3300 cm-1 and appears as a sharp peak, but I'm not too sure. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretching. So, considering that, perhaps the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents, a carbonyl group, and maybe an alcohol or something else.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let's break them down:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton. In carboxylic acids, the OH proton appears around 10-12 ppm. So that could mean a carboxylic acid group. Wait, but in alcohols, the OH is broad too. But let's think about the other signals.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is usually aromatic protons. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring
