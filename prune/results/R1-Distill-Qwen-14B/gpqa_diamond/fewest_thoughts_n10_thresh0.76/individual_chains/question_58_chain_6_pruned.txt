Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a process used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, right? Divergences are those infinities that pop up in calculations, making the math go haywire. So regularization helps make those calculations finite and manageable.

The question is asking which theory doesn't require regularization when you go to high energies. Let's break down each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Wait, string theory is a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics and general relativity. I think it's a candidate for a theory that doesn't have the same issues as other quantum field theories. Oh right, because in superstring theory, the fundamental objects are strings, not point particles. Strings have a minimum size, so maybe that avoids some of the divergences that happen at very small scales or high energies. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Do superstrings require regularization? I think they might not because the theory is background-independent and has a better high-energy behavior, possibly leading to finite results without needing to regularize.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to quantum Yang-Mills. I know that in QCD, things like the running of the coupling constant are calculated using techniques like lattice QCD. But wait, doesn't QCD require renormalization? Because all quantum field theories with divergences need renormalization, which is a form of regularization. Or does regularization come into play during calculations? Like, when you compute loop diagrams, you use a regulator (like a cutoff or dimensional regularization) to handle the divergences. So I think QCD does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-understood, renormalizable theory. But renormalization implies that you have to deal with divergences, which would require regularization. So QED definitely needs regularization because of its loop diagrams leading to infinities. But wait, QED is a renormalizable theory, meaning that the divergences can be handled systematically, but it still requires regularization as part of the process.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, right, classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics. So in classical ED, you don't have divergences
