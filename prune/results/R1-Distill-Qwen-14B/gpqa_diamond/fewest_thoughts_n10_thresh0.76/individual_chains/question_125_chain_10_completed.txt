Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says we have a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². So I know that this is a harmonic oscillator potential because it's quadratic in r. The question is about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy.

Hmm. Wait, I remember that in 3D, the isotropic harmonic oscillator can be solved by considering the 3D system as a combination of three 1D oscillators along each axis. But wait, no, maybe more accurately, the energy levels are quantized based on the quantum numbers in each direction. But since the potential is isotropic, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, no, wait. Maybe I should think in terms of the radial part. Oh right, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be expressed in terms of a quantum number n, where n = nx + ny + nz + some constants maybe. Or wait, I think each direction contributes a quantum number, so the total energy depends on the sum nx + ny + nz.

Wait, the 1D harmonic oscillator has energy levels given by E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is 0,1,2,... So in 3D, each direction contributes, so the total energy would be E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω. Because each direction adds (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding all three gives (nx + ny + nz)/2 + 3/2 multiplied by ħω? Wait, no, that can't be right.

Wait no, let me think again. For each direction, the energy is (n_i + 1/2) ħω. So for 3D, it's E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω. Yes, that's right. So the total energy is (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = nx + ny + nz. So each energy level is determined by the value of n = nx + ny + nz.

Wait, but in 3D, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers. So the ground state is when n=0, so E = (0 + 3/2) ħω. Then the first excited state would be when n=1, then n=2, etc.

But wait, the question is about the third excited state. So I need to figure out what n is for that state.

Wait, the ground state is n=0. The first excited state is n=1 (with one quantum in any of the directions). The second is n=2, third would be n=3. Oh wait, no, wait. Because the ground state is n=0. The first excited state is the first state above that, which would be n=1. The second excited state is n=2, and the third excited state would be n=3.

Wait, so the third excited state is n=3. So the energy would be (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's the first part of the question answered.

Now the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to this energy eigenvalue. So we need to find the degeneracy, the number of states with the same energy. The degeneracy comes from the number of ways to have nx + ny + nz = 3.

Wait, because for a given n, the number of possible (nx, ny, nz) triplets that sum to n is the number of non-negative integer solutions. So for n=3, the number of solutions is (3 + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) ) = (5 choose 2) =10. So the degeneracy is 10. So the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

So looking at the options: option A says (9/2) ħω and 10 eigenfunctions. That matches. Option C has 3 eigenfunctions, which doesn't make sense for n=3. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the excited states.

Wait, the ground state is n=0, E = 3/2 ħω. First excited is n=1, E=5/2 ħω. Second excited state is n=2, E=7/2 ħω. Third excited state is n=3, E=9/2 ħω. So yes, the energy is (9/2) ħω, and the degeneracy is 10. So the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ moving in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels of the system are determined by the quantum numbers $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ associated with the 1D harmonic oscillator in each spatial direction. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the sum of the quantum numbers. The degeneracy of each energy level corresponds to the number of ways to distribute $n$ quanta among the three directions, which is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{n + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{n + 2}{2}.
\]

For the third excited state, the quantum number $n$ is determined as follows: the ground state corresponds to $n = 0$, the first excited state to $n = 1$, the second excited state to $n = 2$, and the third excited state to $n = 3$. Substituting $n = 3$ into the energy formula:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy for $n = 3$ is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, 10.**

Answer: A
