Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions, and the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum, and there are four options to choose from.

Hmm, right. So I remember that in two dimensions, the potential can sometimes be solved using polar coordinates because of the r and θ dependence. The form of the potential here is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me try to simplify that expression.

Wait, I can factor out kr² from both terms. So that's kr² times (1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ). Let me compute that. 1/2 plus 3/2 is 2, so (1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ) = (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2. So V = (kr²/2) (1 + 3 cos²θ). Hmm, okay.

Wait, maybe I can write this as a sum of terms. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the potential in terms of angular components. So let me think about whether this potential can be separated into radial and angular parts that can be solved independently.

I remember that in polar coordinates, the Schrödinger equation separates into radial and angular parts when the potential depends only on r. But here, the potential depends on θ as well because of the cos²θ term. So maybe the potential cannot be separated in the usual way, but perhaps it can be rewritten in a way that allows separation.

Wait, cos²θ is a function of θ, so perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of cos(2θ), because I remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me substitute that in.

So, V(r,θ) = (kr²/2) [1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 ].

Let me compute that. 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 is 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ. So adding 1 gives 1 + 3/2 = 5/2, and the other term is (3/2) cos2θ.

So V = (kr²/2) [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ].

Hmm, that can be written as V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Wait, but how does this help? Maybe I can think of this as a sum of terms, one depending only on r, and the other on cos2θ. Alternatively, perhaps this is a perturbation to a harmonic oscillator potential, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the first term is (1/2) kr². So in the absence of the second term, the potential would be a simple harmonic oscillator in two dimensions. But with the cos²θ term, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think
