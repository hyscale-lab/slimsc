Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about determining which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound exhibits optical isomerism.

First, let's tackle part A. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to figure out which of these doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism? Oh right, tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a double bond from one position to another, resulting in different isomers. So, it's about whether the structure can shift in a way that changes the position of double bonds or hydrogens.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which typically has two ketone groups connected by a benzene ring. Quinones can have tautomerism. I remember that quinones can exist in two forms, like the keto and enol tautomers. For example, in para-benzoquinone, the structure has two carbonyl groups opposite each other. If one of the carbonyls becomes an enol, the structure can shift, right? So benzoquinone does show tautomerism.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That structure has three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5 of a cyclohexane ring. Wait, but three ketones on a six-membered ring. Let me visualize it. Each ketone is at every other carbon. So, positions 1,3,5 are all carbonyls. Would this allow for tautomerism? Tautomerism usually requires adjacent carbonyl groups or some conjugation that allows for a shift.

Hmm, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyl groups are all spaced apart. Each is meta to the others. Maybe they can't engage in tautomerism because there's no adjacent hydrogen to shift. For tautomerism, you usually need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group that can move. Wait, but in a trione, each carbonyl is at 1,3,5 positions. So each is two carbons apart. So each carbonyl is at a position where the adjacent carbons are also carbonyls. Wait, no. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So 1,3,5 would be every other carbon. So each of those carbons is a ketone. So, each of those carbons is connected to two other carbons. Are any of those adjacent to each other? Let's see: 1 is next to 2 and 6; 3 is next to 2 and 4; 5 is next to 4 and 6. So, for each ketone, the adjacent carbons are CH2 groups? Wait, no, because if positions 1,3,5 are carbonyls, then positions 2,4,6 are CH2. So each ketone is at a position where the adjacent carbons are CH2, meaning each has a hydrogen.

Wait, but for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl. So each of these ketones in the trione has adjacent hydrogens. But can they shift? Alternatively, maybe the structure isn't conjugated enough. Let me think about whether the trione can tautomerize.

Wait, in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is adjacent to another. So maybe tautomerism is possible because the shift can involve moving a hydrogen from one position to another, causing the double bond to move. But in the trione, each carbonyl is separated by two single bonds. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize because there's no conjugated
