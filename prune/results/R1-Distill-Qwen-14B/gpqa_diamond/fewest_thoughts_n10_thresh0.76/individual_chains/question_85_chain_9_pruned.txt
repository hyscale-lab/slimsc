Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Both planets have circular orbits. 

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. They detected both using transit and radial velocity methods. Oh wait, the shifts they cause are given—Planet1 shifts the [OI] line by 0.03 Å, and Planet2 by 0.04 Å. But wait, the question is about equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, how does that tie in?

Equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were perfectly radiating energy and absorbing it according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), but since they have the same albedo, that part cancels out. So the ratio of their temperatures depends on the star's temperature, their orbital distances, and the star's radius.

Wait, but how do I find the orbital distances (a) for each planet? Because the RV method gives the mass of the planet and its distance from the star in
