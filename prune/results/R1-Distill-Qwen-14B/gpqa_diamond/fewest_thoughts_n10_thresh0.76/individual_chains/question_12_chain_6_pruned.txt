Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. 

First, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total momentum of the decay products must be zero because momentum is conserved. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That means their magnitudes of momentum are the same, but their directions are opposite.

The masses given are:
- Pi(+): 139.6 MeV/c²
- Mu(+): 105.7 MeV/c²

Wait, the neutrino's mass is considered negligible, right? So the neutrino is treated as massless. That might simplify things.

The rest mass of the neutrino is zero, so its energy would be equal to its momentum times c, but since c is a big number, but in these units (MeV), probably c=1, so E = p for the neutrino.

Now, let's think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion because it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is all kinetic because its rest mass is zero.

So, total energy after decay:
E_total = (m_mu * c²) + K_mu + E_nu
But also, E_total must equal the initial energy, which is m_pi * c².

So:
m_pi c² = m_mu c² + K_mu + E_nu

Since E_nu = p_nu c, and for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )

But wait, because the pion is at rest and the muon and neutrino have opposite momenta, p_mu = p_nu. So p_nu = p_mu, and since E_nu = p_nu c, that would be E_nu = p_mu c.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum (same as neutrino's momentum).

So E_nu = p * c.

Now, the muon's total energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

Putting this into the energy conservation equation:

m_pi c² = m_mu c² + (E_mu) + E_nu
But E_mu is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ), and E_nu = p c.

So substituting in:

m_pi c² = m_mu c² + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c

Let me write this equation without the c's for simplicity, since we're working in units where c=1. So then:

m_pi =
