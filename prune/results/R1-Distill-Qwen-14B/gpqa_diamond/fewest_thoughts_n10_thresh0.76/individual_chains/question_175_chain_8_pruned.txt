Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution that radiates power. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that oscillating charges can emit electromagnetic radiation. The question is a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

Alright, the setup: the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped, and the axis of symmetry is along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. The question is about the radiated power in the radiation zone, which depends on λ and the angle θ measured from the z-axis.

The problem states that the maximum power is A, and we need to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and the possible form of the function f, which is the power per unit solid angle as a function of λ and θ.

Hmm, I think I need to recall some formulas related to dipole radiation. Oh right, for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) has a specific angular dependence. The power radiated per unit solid angle, I think, depends on the cosine of the angle. Wait, let me think. The radiation pattern for a dipole is maximum along the axis (θ=0) and decreases as you move away from the axis.

The formula for the power per unit solid angle (intensity) for a dipole is something like I = (constant) * (sin²θ)/(something with λ). Oh wait, another approach: For a dipole, the intensity pattern is given by I proportional to (p^2) * (sin²θ) / (c^2 r^2 λ^4), but wait, maybe the exact dependence is different. Alternatively, the intensity is proportional to (sin²θ), and the total power is the integral over all solid angles.

Wait, the total power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by P = (some constant) * (d^3) / (c^3), where d is the dipole moment. But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.

The key here is the angular dependence of the intensity. I remember that for a dipole, the intensity is maximum at θ = 90 degrees (perpendicular to the axis) and zero along the axis (θ=0 and θ=180). Wait, no, wait: No, that's not right. Wait, for an electric dipole, the
