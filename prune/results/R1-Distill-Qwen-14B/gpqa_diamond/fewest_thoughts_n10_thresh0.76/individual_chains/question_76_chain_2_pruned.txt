Okay, so I've got this question about creating a mouse embryonic chimera using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Hmm, let me try to break it down. So the setup is that they're injecting these iPSCs into a blastocyst at the 32-cell stage. Then, they're tracking them over time, specifically looking at the fate of these cells and their co-localization with apoptotic events.

Wait, iPSCs are derived from somatic cells, right? So they're pluripotent but not exactly embryonic stem cells. When you inject them into a blastocyst, they can potentially integrate into the embryo and contribute to various tissues. But I'm not entirely sure how that process works exactly. Oh right, in chimeras, the injected cells can differentiate into different cell types alongside the host's cells.

The iPSCs are labeled with mRaspberry under a lineage-specific promoter. Oh, I think that means each cell type's iPSCs have a specific promoter driving the expression of mRaspberry. So mRaspberry is a fluorescent protein, probably red. So each cell type (like maybe neurons, muscles, etc.) will show a red signal specific to their lineage.

Then they're doing TUNEL-FITC staining every 12 hours. TUNEL is a technique used to detect apoptosis. It labels the DNA fragments in cells undergoing apoptosis, so the green signal from FITC would indicate apoptotic cells.

The question is, when they look under the confocal microscope, what's the first thing they notice? The options are about signals and their localization.

So, considering that, in the early stages after injection, the iPSCs are probably starting to differentiate. But wait, during the process of integrating into the blastocyst, the embryo is developing. So what happens when iPSCs are introduced into a blastocyst?

I remember that when you inject cells into a blastocyst, they can either contribute to the inner cell mass (which will form the embryo) or the trophectoderm (which becomes the placenta). But in this case, since it's a 32-cell stage blastocyst, maybe the injected iPSCs are more likely to contribute to the inner cell mass.

Now, when the iPSCs start differentiating, they should express their specific lineage markers, so their mRaspberry should be expressed in those cells. So the red signal would indicate where those cells are. The TUNEL-FITC would show any apoptosis nearby.

Wait, but when you inject foreign cells into an embryo, there's a chance of rejection. Like, maybe the host's immune system would attack the injected cells. But wait, the embryo's immune system isn't very developed at the blastocyst stage. So maybe the iPSCs won't be rejected, but perhaps there's some stress that leads to apoptosis in the injected cells.

Alternatively, I'm not sure. Another possibility is that during the process of reprogramming into iPSCs, the cells may have some stress or damage, making them more prone to apoptosis. Or maybe the process of integrating into the blastocyst could cause some stress leading to cell death.

So when they label the iPSCs with m
