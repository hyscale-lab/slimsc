Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't use the classical velocity addition formula. Right, I remember that the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different.

So the formula for the relative velocity v_rel when two objects are moving with velocities u and v relative to the same frame (like the rest frame) is given by (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, which direction is which? Oh, both are moving in the positive x-direction. So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So from astronaut 2's frame, what's the speed of astronaut 1?

Wait, no—wait: relative speed is how fast one is moving from the other's perspective. So if astronaut 1 is moving at u = 0.6c in the same direction as astronaut 2, who is at v = 0.5c, then in astronaut 2's frame, astronaut 1's speed would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. Let's say the rest frame is the one where both astronauts are moving. But if we want the relative speed, perhaps we should calculate how fast astronaut 1 is moving relative to astronaut 2.

So astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c in the positive x-direction. From astronaut 2's perspective, what is astronaut 1's speed?

In that case, u is the velocity of astronaut 1 in the rest frame (0.6c), and v is astronaut 2's velocity (0.5c). So the relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)).

Plugging in the numbers: u=0.6c, v=0.5c.

So numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator is 1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. That would match option C or D, which have 0.14c.

Wait, but looking at the options, both C and D have 0.14c for v_rel. So need to check the energy part.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy includes their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy, but in relativity, the total energy of a moving object is given
