Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

So, there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure how that affects this problem, maybe it's just background info.

The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So, T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. That means T1 is hotter than T2, and T2 is hotter than T3. 

Also, the masses have their ratios. Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So M1/M2 = 1.15 and M2/M3 = 1.35. That means Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2, which is a bit more massive than Planet3. 

The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. The options are A to D, and I need to find the factor by which Planet3's period is larger. 

Wait, all the planets have the same albedo (0.3), which is similar to Earth's. So albedo won't affect the equilibrium temperature equation in this case.

I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ) ]^(1/4), or something like that. Alternatively, the simplified version when comparing planets might be T ∝ sqrt( L / D² ), because the other factors are the same for all planets. Wait, but L is the star's luminosity, which I don't think is given here. Hmm, maybe the ratio of temperatures is related to the square root of the inverse of the distance squared, so T ~ (1/D)^0.5.

Wait, but wait. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)} ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Oh, right, but in our case, the albedos are the same for all planets, so the (1 - a) term is the same. And the star's properties (R_star and L) are the same for all three planets, assuming they're orbiting the same star. So the ratio of T's between planets should depend on their distances.

So, T1 / T2 = sqrt( ( (1 - a) ) / (1 - a) ) * sqrt( D2 / D1 ), but wait, no, because T is inversely proportional to D^0.5. Let me get this right. 

The equilibrium temperature is given by T = T_eff * sqrt( R/(2D) ), where T_eff is the star's effective temperature. So, if two planets have equilibrium temperatures T1 and T2, their temperatures are proportional to sqrt( R/(2D1) ) and sqrt( R/(2D2) ), respectively. So, T1 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 ), because when you take the ratio, ( sqrt(R/(2D1)) ) / ( sqrt(R/(2D2)) ) ) = sqrt( D2 / D1 ). 

Wait, no, because T is proportional to (1 / sqrt(D)) ). So T1 = k / sqrt(D1), T2 = k / sqrt(D2), so T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Oh, right, that's correct. So the ratio of their temperatures is the square root of the inverse of the ratio of their distances. 

So, given that, T1/T2 is 1.4. So sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4. Squaring both sides, D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 = 1.96 * D1
