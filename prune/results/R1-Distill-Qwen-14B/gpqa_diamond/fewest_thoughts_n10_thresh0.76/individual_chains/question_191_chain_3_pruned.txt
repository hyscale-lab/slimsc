Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me try to walk through each reaction and see what's happening.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (that's a CH2OH group), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2-C(CH2?) No, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group attached at the 2nd carbon, right? So it's CH2-C=CH2? Or wait, maybe it's CH2-CH(CH2-)... Hmm, maybe I should draw it. So the prop-1-en-2-yl group is actually CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? No, wait, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2- but the substituent is at position 2. Wait, maybe it's CH2-C(=CH2)-. Hmm, maybe it's a vinyl group attached to a CH2. Alternatively, perhaps it's more accurately (CH2)CH2-C=CH2? No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2- but the substituent is on the middle carbon. Wait, perhaps it's (CH2)CH2-C=CH2? No, wait, maybe it's a substituent like CH2-C=CH2. Wait, maybe it's actually the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2-) with a double bond. Hmm, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, but the substituent is on C2. Hmm, perhaps it's CH2-C(=CH2)-, but I think I'll get back to that once I start the reactions.
