Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. When X reacts with liquid Y, it releases a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to form a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Hmm, I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A to D, which are numbers like 31, 29, etc.

Let me start by figuring out what each part means. Let's take it one piece at a time.

First, the reaction: X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. B's melting point is about 277 K. 277 K is roughly 4°C, so what melts around there? Maybe something like water ice (0°C), but that's too low. Wait, maybe something else. B's melting point is 277 K, which is 4°C. I remember that B could be a solid at room temp, maybe paraffin or some other compound. Or perhaps B is a metal. Wait, maybe B is a metal that's solid at room temp and has a melting point around there. Alternatively, B could be a basic oxide or something else.

Wait, maybe B is a solid that's a byproduct of a reaction. Let's think about the other parts.

Gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, if W is a molecule, like CO2 or something else, but wait, the molecule's atom(s) would have same number of protons and neutrons. Alternatively, it's a diatomic gas. Let me think: possible diatomic gases where each atom has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's see, Xe is a noble gas, but that's monoatomic. O2: each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since O is usually 16, which has 8 each). So O2 would fit. Or maybe H2, but H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so that doesn't fit. Or maybe N2: each N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (if it's ^14N, but wait, the most common is ^14N, which is 7 protons, 7 neutrons. So each N atom has equal protons and neutrons. So N2 would fit. Or Cl2: but Cl usually has 35 and 37 as isotopes. So for Cl, if it's Cl-35, that would be 17 protons and 18 neutrons, which isn't equal. So that doesn't fit. So possible that W is O2 or N2.

Wait, in the reaction with X and Y, what
