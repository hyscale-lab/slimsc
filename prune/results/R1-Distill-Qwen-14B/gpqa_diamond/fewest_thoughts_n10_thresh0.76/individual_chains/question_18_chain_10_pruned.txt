Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down. Alright, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses. But wait, mass might not directly affect this particular calculation since I think the question is about their elemental compositions. 

The given data includes the [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] for each star, along with [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. Oh, right, these are logarithmic abundance ratios. The photospheric composition of the Sun is also provided for Fe and Mg relative to H.

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, [Si/Star_2] divided by [Si/Star_1], or the other way around? Wait, no, the ratio is Si_1 over Si_2, right? Because it's the ratio of silicon atoms in each star's photosphere.

Hmm, let's get the notation right. The notation [X/Y] is log10(n_X/n_Y) – 12, I think. So, for the Sun, n_X is abundance of element X relative to hydrogen.

Wait, no. The standard notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) – 12. So if [Fe/H] is 0 for Star_1, that means the Sun has the same Fe abundance relative to H as Star_1. Because [Fe/H] = 0 implies n_Fe,Star_1 / n_H,Star_1 = n_Fe,Sun / n_H,Sun. Since the Sun's photosphere is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, so log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5) for the Sun.

Same for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so nFe,1 / nH,1 = nFe,Sun / nH,Sun. So their Fe to H ratio is the same. Same for Mg and H in Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

Wait, let me clarify. Each star's [X/H] tells us how their X abundance compares to the Sun. If [X/H] is 0, then X abundance is same as Sun. If it's positive, X is more abundant; negative, less.

But the question is about the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Si in Star_2. So I need to find n_Si,1 / n_Si,2.

Given that, let's list the information:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So, log10(n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) = 0.3 + 12? Wait,
