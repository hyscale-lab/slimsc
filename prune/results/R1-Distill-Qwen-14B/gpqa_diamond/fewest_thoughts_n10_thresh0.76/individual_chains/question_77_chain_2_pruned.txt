Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction, and I need to select the correct major products from the given options.

So, looking at the first part of the reaction: the starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Then, it's treated with BuLi (butyllithium) followed by H+ (protonation). The product is labeled A.

Wait, what's BuLi do in such reactions? I remember that BuLi is a strong base, often used to deprotonate compounds, especially in conjugated systems. Maybe it's abstracting a proton somewhere here.

The starting material is a benzene ring with a substituent that's (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy and then a methyl group. Let me draw this structure. So, the benzene ring is connected to an oxygen (O), which is connected to a CH2 group. Then, the other side of O is a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me write that structure down.

The 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait no, wait. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with substituents. Wait, no. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2? Wait, butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3 for 1-butene, so 2-butene is CH3CH=CHCH3. Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl would be like CH2-CH=CH-CH2-? No, wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would have the structure CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, I'm getting
