Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think through it.

The problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is approaching at that speed. Wait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s as well? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. The question says part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. But in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Oh wait, that's the same speed, just opposite frames.

Wait, but according to the problem, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So I think that's the relative speed. But I'm a bit confused about the frames here.

Wait, when you switch frames, velocities don't just add linearly, right? Because you have to consider special relativity. Oh wait, but wait—this problem doesn't mention anything about acceleration or time dilation or length contraction. So maybe we can just use classical mechanics here? Hmm, but wait, 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is about 20% of that. So relativistic effects might matter.

Wait, but the question is about how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, so we have to consider time dilation. Because in different reference frames, time passes at different rates.

Wait, no, because the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So we need to find out how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame during those 50 seconds, and then multiply by the speed to get the distance.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about it. The ejecta's frame sees the Galaxy moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the relative velocity is 60,000 km/s. But from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy.

So the frames are moving relative to each other at 60,000 km/s. So we have to calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's clock says 50 seconds.

Wait, this is a problem involving time dilation in special relativity. The time experienced in the moving frame (Galaxy's frame) would be different from the ejecta's frame.

But wait, the problem asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So let's map this out.

In the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. During that time, how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame? Because the ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy, there's time dilation. But to find the distance, it's speed multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but the speed would be the same as the relative speed, right? Because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s.

So the distance the ejecta travels is v * t_galaxy, where t_galaxy is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

So first, we need to find t_galaxy when t_ejecta is 50 seconds.

But how? Because time dilation depends on the relative velocity. The time experienced in one frame is the other frame's time multiplied by gamma, but only if the events are moving relative to each other. Wait, but in this case, which frame is moving?

Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v=60,000 km/s. So from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving, so the Galaxy's clock would be running slower. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, time dilation says that a moving clock runs slower. So if the Galaxy is moving relative to the ejecta, then in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's clock is ticking slower.

So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame?

Wait, the formula for time dilation is t' = gamma * (t - (v x)/c²), but in this case, the events are the same point in the ejecta's frame, so x=0. So t' = gamma * t, but which way?

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is that the proper time (the time measured in the rest frame of the events) is what's smaller. So if the Galaxy is moving at velocity v relative to the ejecta, then for events happening at the same place in the ejecta's frame (like two events at the ejecta's location), the Galaxy's frame will measure a longer time.

Wait, no. Let me think. Proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events happen at the same place. So in the ejecta's frame, two events (start and end) occur at the same point, so tau is t_ejecta. The Galaxy's frame, which is moving relative to the ejecta, will see these events as happening in different places, so the time between events is longer.

Wait, so the time in the Galaxy's frame (t_galaxy) is longer than the time in the ejecta's frame (t_ejecta = 50 s).

So tau = t_ejecta is the proper time. So t_galaxy = tau * gamma, where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, no, because from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the ejecta's clock is running slow. So if the Galaxy measures t_galaxy, then the ejecta's clock would have measured t_ejecta = t_galaxy / gamma, because moving clocks run slow.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the Lorentz transformations.

The Lorentz transformation for time when moving from the ejecta frame (S') to the Galaxy frame (S) is:

t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² )

But in the ejecta's frame S', the two events (start and end) happen at x' = 0 and x' = v * t', but wait, no. Wait, no, in S', after 50 seconds, the ejecta has moved—wait no. Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the ejecta is stationary, so it doesn't move. The Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at speed v=60,000 km/s. So let's say at t' = 0, the Galaxy is at some point, and at t' = 50 s, it has moved closer. But the problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves a distance v * t_galaxy, where t_galaxy is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

But how do we find t_galaxy when t_ejecta is 50 s.

Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at speed v.

So the time between two events (e.g., when the ejecta starts moving and when 50 s pass) in the ejecta's frame is t' = 50 s.

In the Galaxy's frame, the time between these events is t = gamma * t'.

Because in the Galaxy's frame, the events are not at the same place (since the ejecta is moving), so the time is longer.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute v in km/s: 60,000 km/s.

Speed of light c is approximately 300,000 km/s.

So v = 6e4 km/s.

v² = (6e4)^2 = 3.6e9 (km/s)^2.

c² = (3e5)^2 = 9e10 (km/s)^2.

v² / c² = 3.6e9 / 9e10 = 0.04.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) is approx 0.98.

So gamma = 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0204.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.0204 * 50 s ≈ 51.02 s.

So the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer by a factor of approximately 1.0204.

Now, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * t.

v is 60,000 km/s.

t is approximately 51.02 s.

So distance = 60,000 * 51.02 = 60,000 * 51.02.

Let me compute that.

60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km.

60,000 * 1.02 = 61,200 km.

So total is 3,000,000 + 61,200 = 3,061,200 km.

Wait, but wait, the approximate gamma was 1.0204, so t is about 51.02 s.

So 60,000 * 51.02 is 3,061,200 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Closest to that. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

v = 6e4 km/s.

v^2 = 3.6e9.

c^2 = 9e10.

v²/c² = 0.04.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

So gamma = 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

Then t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 = 51.03 s.

So distance is 60,000 * 51.03 = 60,000 *51.03 = 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 + 60,000 *1.03 = 60,000 *1=60,000 + 60,000 *0.03=1,800 → 61,800. So total 3,061,800 km.

But the options don't have that exact number. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 2,940,000 km.
B) 3,000,000 km.
C) 2,880,000 km.
D) 3,060,000 km.

Hmm, 3,060,000 is option D, which is 3.06e6 km.

Wait, but I calculated about 3,061,800 km. So the option is 3,060,000, which is close but not exact. But perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the proper time is in the Galaxy frame. Wait, no, the question says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So the proper time is in the ejecta's frame, so the Galaxy's time is longer.

Wait, another approach: using the velocity addition formula. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think about the distance in the Galaxy's frame as v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is t_galaxy = t_ejecta * gamma.

So the exact calculation is needed.

Let me compute gamma more precisely.

v = 60,000 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s.

v = 0.2 c. Because 0.2 *3e5 = 6e4.

So v = 0.2 c.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 -0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).

Compute sqrt(0.96): Let's compute it accurately.

0.96 = (0.98)^2 is 0.9604. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

So gamma ≈ 1.0206.

t_ejecta =50 s → t_galaxy = 50 * 1.0206 ≈51.03 s.

So distance = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s =6e4 *51.03 = 6e4 *50 is 3e6, and 6e4 *1.03 is 61,800. So 3,061,800 km.

Hmm, but that's not an option. The closest is option D, which is 3,060,000. So maybe the precise calculation gives something closer to 3,060,000.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Compute sqrt(0.96) accurately.

Using a calculator approach: 0.96 is between (0.9798)^2 which is about 0.96.

Wait, perhaps a better approximation.

Compute gamma = 1/sqrt(0.96).

Let me compute 0.96 = 24/25.

So sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5.

sqrt(24) ≈4.89898.

So sqrt(24)/5 ≈0.9797959.

So 1/sqrt(0.96) ≈1.02062.

So gamma is approximately 1.02062.

So t_galaxy = 50 * 1.02062 = 51.031 s.

So distance =60,000 km/s *51.031 s = 60,000 *51.031= 3,061,860 km.

Hmm, that's 3,061,860 km. The options have D as 3,060,000, which is 1,860 km less. So maybe the figure is rounded, but perhaps the problem expects us to ignore relativistic effects and just use classical mechanics, which would give a much larger error.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to use gamma but without considering the precise value. Let me see what each option would be.

Wait, if I use gamma=1, which is the non-relativistic case, then t_galaxy =50 s. So distance is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that can't be right because the problem involves speeds where relativity is significant.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the time experienced in the Galaxy's frame is the same as the ejecta's frame. That would be a mistake, but perhaps that's what the problem expects us to do.

Wait, but the problem clearly states that both frames are inertial and says to ignore gravity and rotation, so perhaps it's intended to consider time dilation.

Alternatively, maybe I've approached the problem incorrectly. Let me re-express the situation.

In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is t_galaxy = t_ejecta * gamma.

Wait, no. Because in the ejecta's frame, the time is t_ejecta=50 s. But in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer, so the distance is v * t_galaxy.

But another approach: the problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 s pass in the ejecta's frame.

So perhaps the correct formula is:

distance_galaxy = v * t_galaxy.

And t_galaxy = t_ejecta * gamma.

So distance_galaxy = v * t_ejecta * gamma.

But wait, that would be 6e4 *50 *1.02062 = 6e4 * 51.031 = 3,061,860 km.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to not consider time dilation, and just calculate the distance as v * t_ejecta, but that would be 6e4 *50=3,000,000 km, option B. However, that would only be correct in the non-relativistic case.

Wait, but the problem says that both frames are inertial. So if the speed is 6e4 km/s, which is 20% of c, the relativistic effects should be considered.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to use the time in the Galaxy's frame as t_galaxy = t_ejecta * (1 + v/c), but I don't think that's correct. Or perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the distance from the point of view of the Galaxy, but using the proper time of the ejecta.

Wait, no, the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the distance in the ejecta's frame, but that doesn't make sense because the question states it's the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, perhaps I've confused the direction. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta covers distance v * t_galaxy.

But what's t_galaxy? It's the time that passes in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's frame experiences 50 seconds.

So t_galaxy = gamma * t_ejecta.

So it's definitely gamma times 50, so the distance is v * gamma * t_ejecta.

Hmm, I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the Earth's frame, but no, the problem states to consider the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma exactly.

Let me compute gamma precisely.

v = 6e4 km/s = 0.2c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96).

Using a calculator, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9797958971.

So gamma = 1 / 0.9797958971 ≈ 1.02062.

So t_galaxy = 50 * 1.02062 = 51.031 s.

So the distance is 6e4 km/s *51.031 s = 6e4 *51.031 = 3,061,860 km.

But the options don't have this exact number. So perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02, which gives t_galaxy=50 *1.02=51 s.

So 6e4 *51 = 3,060,000 km. Which is option D.

Ah, that's why option D is 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the problem expects to use gamma=1.02, leading to option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \)). The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) pass in the ejecta's frame. Due to relativistic time dilation, the time in the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)) is longer than the time in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)).

### Step 1: Relating times in the two frames
The relationship between the times in the two frames is given by:
\[
t = \gamma t'
\]
where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
\]
Thus:
\[
t = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculating the distance in the Galaxy's frame
The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is:
\[
\text{Distance} = v \cdot t
\]
Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t \approx 51.03 \, \text{s} \):
\[
\text{Distance} = 60,000 \times 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
\]

### Step 3: Comparing with the options
The closest option to the calculated distance is \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \), which corresponds to option D. This slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding \( \gamma \) to \( 1.02 \) in the problem setup.

### Final Answer
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when \( 50 \, \text{s} \) pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).

Answer: D
