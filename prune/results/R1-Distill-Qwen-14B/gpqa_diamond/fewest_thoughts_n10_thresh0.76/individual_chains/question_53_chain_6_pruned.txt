Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully. 

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The FTIR shows ester groups, which makes sense because esters have specific absorption peaks. The NMR data gives more clues about the structure.

So, the FTIR has peaks indicating an ester group. Ester groups typically show strong absorption around 1700 cm^-1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Also, the O-H stretch from the ester would be around 2500-3300 cm^-1, but sometimes they can be broad or absent if the ester is not very acidic. But I think the main point here is the presence of an ester, so the compound probably has a structure where an oxygen is connected to both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring, perhaps as a substituent.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let me parse that. Two signals are for aromatic-H, which suggests that the aromatic ring isn't symmetrical. Wait, di-substituted rings can have different substitution patterns. For example, in a para substitution, the aromatic Hs would be equivalent, but in ortho or meta, they might not be. Wait, but in the NMR, there are two signals for aromatic-H. Hmm. That suggests maybe two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps because of the substituents. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is something else, leading to two different types of aromatic Hs.

Then, two signals correspond to vinyl-H. Vinyl groups are CH2=CH- or similar. The NMR shows one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Wait, doublet might suggest coupling with one neighbor, while doublet of quartets indicates coupling with two groups each having two protons, perhaps. Alternatively, it could be a more complex coupling scenario, but I'm not sure yet.

Two signals for –CH3 groups. So there are two different methyl groups in the molecule. And importantly, there are no signals for –CH2 groups. So the molecule has methyl groups but no methylene (CH2) groups. That suggests maybe the ester is connected in a way that doesn't have any CH2 chains. For example, maybe the ester is linked directly to the aromatic ring.

Wait, let me think about the possible structure. The aromatic ring is di-substituted. One substituent is an ester group, which could be an aryl ester or an alkyl ester. Since the molecule has methyl groups, perhaps the ester is a methyl ester. So maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a methyl ester (like OCOCH3) and another substituent, which is another group.

Wait, but then where does the vinyl come in? Because the NMR shows vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are on a double bond, like in an alkene or perhaps as part of an aromatic substituent. Maybe the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring, like a substituent
