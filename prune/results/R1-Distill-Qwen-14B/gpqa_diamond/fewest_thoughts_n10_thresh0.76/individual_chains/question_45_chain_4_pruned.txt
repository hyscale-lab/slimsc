Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question says to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The energy E is given as E = (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²). So each particle's energy levels are quantized based on their quantum numbers.

Wait, but since these are identical particles, I need to consider the Pauli exclusion principle. Spin-1/2 particles are fermions, so each can have a unique set of quantum numbers. In a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² E), right? Because E scales with n squared.

So for a single particle, the energy levels are E_1, E_2, E_3, etc. But since there are four particles, I have to figure out how they fill up the energy levels without violating the Pauli exclusion. Each energy level can hold a certain number of particles based on their spin states.

In a 1D well, each energy level n can hold two particles because each has a spin up and spin down state. So for n=1, it's two particles (m_s = +1/2 and -1/2), same for n=2, etc.

So with four particles, how do they fill the levels?

Ground state: The lowest energy configuration.
First excited state: The next possible arrangement after the ground.
Second excited state: The next after that.

Let me think about the ground state first. The ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible energy levels with the lowest possible quantum numbers, considering the Pauli exclusion.

Each level can hold two particles. So for four particles:

- n=1 can hold 2 particles.
- Then n=2 can hold 2 more.

So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 (each with opposite spins) and two in n=2. So the total energy would be 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2) = 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, wait. Wait, the formula for each particle is E_n = n² E. So for the ground state, each n=1 and n=2 would have two particles each.

So ground state energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, no. Wait, each particle in n=1 contributes E_1 each, but since two are there, 2E_1. Similarly, two in n=2: 2E_2. So yeah, 2E + 8E = 10E.

But wait, the question is about the system's energy. So that's the ground state.

Now the first excited state. The first excited state would be the next possible arrangement. So perhaps moving one particle from a lower state to the next available.

Wait, in the ground state, we have all the lowest possible filled. But wait, maybe the particles can be arranged in higher states, but that would require higher energies.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible states.

In a system with identical fermions, the ground state is the lowest possible energy with the particles filling the lowest levels, each with their spins.

So for four particles, the filling is n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). So the ground state is when all four are in n=1 and n=2.

Now, the first excited state would be when one of the particles is promoted to the next available level. But wait, all the n=1 and n=2 are filled. So the next available is n=3. So in the first excited state, perhaps one particle is in n=3, and the others are as low as possible.

Wait, but wait, no. Because to get the first excited state, we can't have any higher energy than
