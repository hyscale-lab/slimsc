Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering electrons and phase shifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives me some phase shifts, δ₀ to δ₄, each measured in degrees. The values are 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13°. And it says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are in units of fm, which I think stands for femtometers, a unit of length.

Wait, right, scattering amplitude in the context of quantum mechanics... Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) in the case of elastic scattering can be expressed using the phase shifts. I remember that the formula for the scattering amplitude involves a sum over all the angular momentum states, each contributing a term with the phase shift for that state.

The formula I think is f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (e^{iδ_l} - 1) * (2l + 1) * P_l(cosθ), where the sum is over l from 0 to some maximum, and P_l is the Legendre polynomial. Oh wait, but when considering the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0, so cosθ=1. Because the incident beam is along, say, the z-axis, so θ=0.

Wait, wait, let me think. The scattering amplitude f is a complex quantity. The imaginary part of f is related to the total cross-section, I think. Because the total cross-section σ is 4π|f|^2, but wait, no, more accurately, the forward scattering amplitude's imaginary part is used in something like the optical theorem, which connects it to the total cross-section.

Wait, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. So θ=0, so cosθ=1. So for each l, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 because P_l(1) = 1 for all l. So the sum simplifies to the sum over l of (e^{iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) * 1, multiplied by 1/(2ik).

Wait, but wait, the formula is f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_l [ (e^{iδ_l} - 1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ) ] e^{i l φ}.

But in this case, since we're looking along the incident beam, θ=0, so cosθ=1, and φ=0 as well (since the beam is along, say, the z-axis and we're looking in the direction of the beam). So for φ=0, the e^{i l phi} term becomes e^0=1.

So the amplitude f(0,0) is (1/(2ik)) * sum_l [ (e^{iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) * 1 ] * 1.

But wait, the question says to ignore phase shifts beyond δ₄, so l goes from 0 to 4.

So the sum is l=0 to 4.

So f(0,0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 [ (e^{iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) ]

But wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So we need Im(f(0,0)).

Wait, let me compute the sum first. Each term in the sum is (e^{iδ_l} -1) multiplied by (2l+1). Let me compute each term individually.

First, for each l, compute e^{iδ_l} -1. Since δ_l is given in degrees, I need to convert them to radians to compute the exponential.

Let me list the phase shifts again:
δ0 =90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°.

Wait, but wait, in the formula, I think the phase shifts are in radians, yes. So I need to convert degrees to radians.

But maybe I can remember that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So e^{iθ} -1 = (cosθ -1) + i sinθ.

So for each term, (e^{iδ_l} -1) = (cos(δ_l) -1) + i sin(δ_l).

So the sum becomes:

sum [ (cosδ_l -1) + i sinδ_l ) * (2l+1) ]

Which can be split into real and imaginary parts. Since the overall expression for f is multiplied by 1/(2ik), which is a complex
