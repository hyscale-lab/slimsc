Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. Let me see what I can recall about these.

The question has three parts—A, B, and C—each involving different starting materials and conditions, and I need to match them to the correct products from the options. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different structures for A, B, and C.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat. Hmm. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CHCH2OH, right? Or wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be like CH2CH2(OH)CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH2-OH? No, wait but numbering. But-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C3 and C2. No, wait, but butenol. Let me draw it. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2(OH)CH2? No, wait, but but is four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH. Wait, no, but that's but-2-en-1-ol. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2, but that's only three carbons. Oh wait, but but has four carbons, so perhaps it's CH2CH2(OH)CH3? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, maybe but-3-en-2-ol is actually (CH2)2CH-OH with a double bond? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's (CH2)2CHOH with a double bond at position 3? Oh, wait, but but can only have up to position 3. Wait, no, but butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So but-3-en-2
