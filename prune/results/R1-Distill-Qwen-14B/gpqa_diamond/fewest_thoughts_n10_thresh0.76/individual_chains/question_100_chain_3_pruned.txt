Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

So, the starting compound is Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, I remember that C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane. But wait, the first reaction is bromination in the presence of CCl4. Oh right, that's a typical addition reaction for alkenes. So if A is C3H6 and it's undergoing addition bromination, it must be propene. Because cyclopropane would probably undergo a substitution or something else, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, cyclopropane is a ring, adding bromine might not do much. So I think A is propene, which has a double bond.

So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) reacting with bromine in CCl4 would add Br across the double bond. So Compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Or maybe 1,1-dibromopropane? Wait, wait. Propene is CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When Br2 adds, it adds across the double bond. So the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Right, because the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so this is probably an elimination reaction. The dibromide would undergo dehydrohalogenation. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, when it reacts with alcoholic KOH, it would lose two HBr molecules and form an alkene. Which alkene? The most substituted one, according to Zaitsev's rule.

1,2-dibromopropane has Br on C1 and C2. Removing H from either C1 or C2, but wait, wait, let me think. When you eliminate two HBr, you're removing two Brs. Wait, noâ€”each elimination is one H and one Br. So for 1,2-dibromopropane, you can lose two HBr, but that might form a diene? No, wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination, but that doesn't sound right because the starting material is a vicinal dibromide.

Wait, vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromides) when treated with alcoholic KOH typically undergo dehydrohalogenation twice, leading to the formation of an alkene. So for 1,2-dibromopropane, losing two HBr would give propene again. Wait, but propene is the starting material. That can't be right. Or wait, maybe it's a different structure. Let me draw this out.

The structure of B is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give CH2BrCHBrCH3, right? Because the Br adds across the double bond. So when you treat CH2BrCHBrCH3 with KOH (alcoholic), it'll eliminate HBr twice. So possible eliminations:

First elimination: from CH2Br and CHBr. Let's say you take a hydrogen from the second carbon (the middle one) and eliminate a Br, forming a double bond. The possible products would be either 1-propene or 2-propene (but wait, propene can only be 1-propene, which is CH2=CHCH3). Wait, but wait, when you eliminate two HBr from 1,2-dibromopropane, you can form either 1-propene or maybe another isomer, but for propane, the only possible alkene is 1-propene (since propane only has three carbons). So compound C would be propene, which is CH2=CHCH3.

Wait, that's the same as compound A. So why would
