Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure this out.

Alright, the question says that 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. And I need to find the enthalpy change, right?

I remember that when acids and bases neutralize each other, they form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually measured per mole of acid reacting with a base. But wait, I think for strong acids and bases, it's around -57 kJ/mol, assuming they're fully dissociated. But sometimes it can vary a bit, but maybe in this problem, we can take that value.

First, I need to figure out how much of each acid and base is present. Let's break it down into the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. So moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume (in liters). The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. So 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. So that's 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. It's a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. The first dissociation is complete, giving 2 H+ per molecule. Wait, but wait, does all of it dissociate? I think for the purpose of neutralization, each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+. Let's calculate the moles: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. Each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

So total H+ from both acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base is Ba(OH)2. It's a strong base and it dissociates completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. Let's find moles: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2. So OH- is 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, wait. Neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the moles of H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio.

So let's see, which one is in excess. H+ is 0.28 moles. OH- is 0.2 moles.

So the OH- will be the limiting reactant, and the H+ in excess will be 0.08 moles. Wait, no, wait. Wait,
