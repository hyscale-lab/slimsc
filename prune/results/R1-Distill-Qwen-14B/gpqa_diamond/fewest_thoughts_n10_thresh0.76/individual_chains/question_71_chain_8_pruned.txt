Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says there are five exoplanets with circular orbits found using the TTV method, and they're in orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We need to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. And all planets have the same albedo, which probably means we don't have to worry about that factor affecting the calculation.

Alright, so I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

T = T₀ * ( (L / (16π² D²)) )^(1/4)

Wait, wait, maybe another way. Oh right, the formula is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. Because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, and the planet's emission depends on its temperature to the fourth power. So rearranging, T is proportional to (L/(16πσ D²))^(1/4). But wait, another way to think is that T is proportional to sqrt( (L/(16πσ D²)) ), but no, wait, the formula is T = ( ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) )^(1/4 ), where a is the albedo. But since the albedo is the same for all planets, it cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the key here is that the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of the star's luminosity and inversely on the square root of the orbital distance. But since all planets are orbiting the same star, L is the same for all. So the temperature ratio between two planets will depend only on their distances.

So the formula for equilibrium temperature is:

T ∝ (1 / D)^(1/2)

Because T is proportional to sqrt(1/D). So if Planet A is at distance D_A and Planet B is at D_B, then T_A / T_B = sqrt( D_B / D_A )

Wait no, wait, I think I messed up. Let me clarify. The formula is T = T₀ * ( (1 / D) )^(1/2 ), where T
