Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength for a black body is determined by its temperature, so that must mean both stars have the same temperature. Interesting.

They also measured the radial velocities: Star_1 is stationary (0 km/s), and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity—so that's the velocity along the line of sight. But wait, how does radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, Doppler shift. If a star is moving towards us, its light gets blueshifted; moving away, redshifted. But wait, the peak wavelength they observed for both stars is the same. Hmm, maybe I need to correct the temperature based on Doppler shift. Or perhaps the star's actual temperature is affected.

Wait, the problem says they computed the luminosity assuming the stars radiate as black bodies. So I think the key here is to calculate the luminosity using the black body formula. The luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But wait, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. The peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature. Because for a black body, λ_max * T = constant (Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant). So if both have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Or is that after accounting for Doppler shift?

Wait, no. Because the star's motion can cause a Doppler shift, which would affect the observed wavelength. So the actual temperature of the star would be different if it's moving. Because the observed temperature would be T_observed = T_actual * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, but when a star is moving away, the observed light is redshifted, so the observed temperature would be lower. Because λ is longer, so T is lower (since λ_max is longer). But the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is same for both, meaning that their actual temperatures (unshifted) would differ because of their velocities.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the actual temperatures of each star before any Doppler shift. Let's think: the observed peak wavelength (λ_obs) is the same for both stars. So for each star, the observed λ is λ_obs = λ_actual * (1 + v_r / c), assuming v_r is positive when moving away. Wait, no, the Doppler formula is a bit more precise. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_actual * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is positive when moving away from the observer, negative when moving towards.

Wait, but in that case, if Star_1 has v_r = 0, then λ_obs (Star_1) = λ_actual1. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Assuming it's moving away? Because the radial velocity is positive if moving away. So then λ_obs (Star_2) = λ_actual2 * (1 + 700e3 / c). But wait, the observed λ for both stars is the same.

So λ_obs1 = λ_actual1 = λ_obs2.

So λ_actual1 = λ_obs (since Star_1 isn't moving), and λ_actual2 = λ_obs / (1 + v_r2 / c).

Wait, but λ_actual2 would be λ_obs / (1 + 700e3 / c). Hmm. Let's denote c as the speed of light, which is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 km/s is much smaller than that, so v_r/c is about 0.002333.

So for Star_2, λ_actual2 = λ_obs / (1 + 700e3 / 3e5) = λ_obs / (1 + 700/300000) = λ_obs / (1 + 0.0023333) ≈ λ_obs * (1 - 0.0023333), using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x for small x.

But maybe more accurately: 1/(1.0023333) is approx 0.997667.

So λ_actual2 ≈ 0.997667 * λ_obs.

So λ_actual2 is slightly less than λ_obs. Which would imply that Star_2's actual peak wavelength is shorter than Star_1's, meaning Star_2 is hotter. Because for Wien's law, T = b / λ_max. So a shorter λ_max implies higher T.

Wait, but Star_1's observed λ is the same as Star_2's observed λ. So if Star_2 is moving away (v_r positive), its actual λ is shorter, so higher T. So Star_2 is hotter than Star_1?

But I thought earlier that if the observed λ_max is same, then actual temperatures would be same, but that's only if there's no Doppler shift. But since Star_2 is moving, we need to correct for that.

So let me model the observed λ_max. Let λ
