Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take a deep breath and try to break it down.

The problem says: We have an annihilation process where a proton and an antiproton collide to produce two A+ and two A- particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of particle A is given as 300 MeV. The question is asking for the velocity of particle A.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, annihilation processes often involve conservation laws like conservation of energy and momentum. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can consider it at low speed, so relativistic effects might not be too significant. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe its speed is much less than the speed of light. That would mean it's non-relativistic. But wait, in particle physics, even low speeds can imply high energies because particles like protons and antiprotons can have energies comparable to their rest mass. Or maybe not? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem gives the mass of A as 300 MeV/c², I guess. Because in particle physics, masses are usually expressed in MeV/c², but sometimes just given as MeV when the units are understood. So m_A c² is 300 MeV.

The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So the products are two A+ and two A-. Since they're opposite charges, maybe they're moving in opposite directions or something.

Wait, the initial particles are a proton and antiproton. Let's think about their rest frames. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can consider the center-of-momentum frame. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the initial state as the proton being stationary and the antiproton moving towards it. Or perhaps the initial state is in the lab frame where the antiproton is moving slowly.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving." That makes me think that its velocity is much less than c, so maybe non-relativistic. But in that case, the kinetic energy would be small compared to the rest mass energy. Hmm.

Wait, but the initial particles are a proton and antiproton, each with rest mass about 938 MeV/c².
