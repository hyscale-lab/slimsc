Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question involves a series of reactions leading to a final product, and I need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in that product. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7. Hmm.

Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The first part: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Wait, sodium iodide and dibromomethyl groups... Oh right! That sounds like an elimination reaction or perhaps a substitution. Wait, no, more likely a dehydrohalogenation. Because when you have dihalides and you use a base, it can lead to elimination. But wait, here it's sodium iodide, which is a source of iodide ions. Oh, wait, actually, in such contexts, sodium iodide is often used as a nucleophile in substitution reactions. Hmm.

Wait, the starting material is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the 5 and 6 positions has a dibromomethyl group. So that's two CH2Br2 groups attached to the cyclohexadiene ring at positions 5 and 6.

So when we react this with sodium iodide (a good nucleophile) under elevated temperatures, perhaps we're undergoing an SN2 substitution where the iodide replaces the bromide. But wait, each of those CH2Br2 groups would have two bromides on each CH2. So each CH2Br2 would have two leaving groups.

Wait, but sodium iodide is in a polar aprotic solvent maybe, and perhaps the reaction is an elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alkylation where the dihalide acts as a leaving group.

Wait, another thought: when dihalides are treated with a base, they can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But in this case, the starting material is already a diene. So maybe we're adding more double bonds.

Wait, but wait, the starting cyclohexadiene is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. That means the ring has double bonds at 1,3, and the substituents are at 5 and 6. Each substituent is a CH2Br2 group.

So when we treat this with sodium iodide and heat, perhaps each of the CH2Br2 groups undergoes elimination, losing H and Br, forming a double bond. Because, for each CH2Br2, if it loses two Brs, maybe each substituent becomes a CH2 group, but more likely, each CH2Br2 would eliminate HBr to form a double bond between the 5 and 6 positions, but wait, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene already has double bonds at 1 and 3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substitution is happening. Let me think: each CH2Br2 group is a geminal dihalide. So when treated with iodide, perhaps the first substitution occurs, replacing one Br with I. But wait, if you have two Brs on a CH2, perhaps the iodide could substitute both. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is a leaving group for a coupling reaction.

Wait, another angle: the initial bicyclo compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That structure sounds familiar—it’s similar to norbornene. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So it's a norbornene derivative with an ether group.

Wait, combining this with 2 equivalents of the dihalide. So perhaps the dihalide is acting as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction? But wait, the starting diene is norbornene, which is a diene. Alternatively, maybe the diene is the dienophile.

Wait, but the dihalide is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each substituent is a CH2Br2 group. Now, when you have a dihalide and a diene, sometimes they can react via a ring-opening or alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the iodide replaces the bromide on the dihalide. But each CH2Br2 has two Br atoms. So each CH2Br2 could lose two Br atoms as Br- and gain two I atoms, becoming CH2I2. But that doesn’t seem very helpful.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is undergoing elimination. Each CH2Br2 could lose two HBr molecules to form a double bond between the two adjacent carbons. So for each substituent, CH2Br2 → CH2 after losing two HBr. Wait, but then each substituent would be a CH2 group, but that would lead to a single bond. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide upon elimination forms a new double bond, extending the conjugated system.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of the overall process. The first reaction forms product 1, which is treated with H2SO4 to form product 2. Then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, which sounds like a sulfonation or perhaps a sulfonamide formation. Wait, SO3 is used in sulfonation reactions—like adding a sulfonic acid group.

Then product 3 is heated at 150°C to form product 4. The question is about the number of chemically distinct H atoms in product 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is an alkylation of the norbornene derivative. The norbornene has an ether group, and perhaps the dihalide is acting as an alkylating agent.

Wait, another approach. Let me try to outline each step.

Step 1: The bicyclo compound (let's call it compound A) is reacted with two equivalents of the dihalide (compound B) and sodium iodide. The product is 1.

Step 2: Product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4 to form product 2.

Step 3: Product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3.

Step 4: Product 3 is heated at 150°C to give product 4.

The question is the number of distinct H atoms in product 4.

I think I'll need to figure out what each step does.

Starting with step 1: A is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene.

B is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

Reaction of A with two equivalents of B and NaI under elevated temperature.

Hmm. Sodium iodide is a source of I- ions. The dibromomethyl groups in B are CH2Br2. So perhaps in the presence of I-, each CH2Br2 undergoes substitution, replacing Br with I.

So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2. But that may not be the main point. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide (CH2Br2) is a good leaving group, and the reaction is an alkylation.

Wait, but in an alkylation, maybe the tert-butoxy group in A is acting as a leaving group. But tert-butoxy is a poor leaving group unless activated. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is attacking the norbornene structure.

Wait, norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene) is a strained molecule and can undergo various reactions. Maybe here, the dihalide is adding across the double bond via a Diels-Alder-like reaction, but with a dienophile.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about other possibilities. The dihalide has two Br atoms on each substituent. Perhaps the reaction is a coupling, like a Heck reaction or a Suzuki coupling, but those require specific conditions and catalysts which are not mentioned here. So maybe it's not a coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is undergoing elimination, forming a new double bond. So each CH2Br2 in compound B becomes a CH2 group with a new double bond adjacent to it, leading to a conjugated diene. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought. The starting material is a diene; when dihalides are treated with a base, they can lose HX and form alkenes. So perhaps each CH2Br2 group in B is eliminating HBr to form a double bond.

So each CH2Br2 → CHBr=CHBr? No, that can't be right. Wait, if you have a CH2Br2 group attached to a cyclohexadiene, perhaps the Brs are on adjacent carbons. So for each substituent, perhaps the Brs are on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond between those carbons.

Wait, but the starting substituent is at positions 5 and 6 on the cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of those positions has a CH2Br2 group, meaning the structure is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two CH2Br2 groups at 5 and 6.

If each CH2Br2 loses two HBr molecules, perhaps each substituent becomes a double bond between the adjacent carbons. So each CH2Br2 → CH2? No, because losing two HBr would require each CH2Br2 to lose two Brs and form a double bond. So each substituent would become a double bond between the adjacent carbons, meaning the cyclohexa-1,3-diene would become a cyclohexa-1,3,5,6-diene? That's possible, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2Br2 substituent loses HBr to form a new double bond within the substituent. So each CH2Br2 becomes a CH with a double bond, but that would require more than just elimination.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the tert-butoxy group in A is being alkylated. So the dihalide B is acting as an alkylating agent. Since A has a tertiary oxygen (tert-butoxy), perhaps it can undergo alkylation.

Wait, the reaction is between two equivalents of B and one of A. So perhaps each dihalide B is adding an alkyl group to A.

Wait, but A is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So the structure is a norbornene ring with a tert-butoxy group at position 7.

If B is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, then each substituent is a CH2Br2 group. So perhaps in the presence of NaI, each CH2Br2 is being substituted by iodide, but I'm not seeing how that would help.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the dihalide is undergoing a dehydrohalogenation to form a new double bond, thereby making a conjugated diene. So each CH2Br2 on B would lose HBr to become a double bond, making the cyclohexa-1,3-diene into a more extended diene.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide B is a dienophile, and the norbornene is the diene. So they undergo a Diels-Alder reaction. But the dienophile is usually something like a diene with electron-withdrawing groups, like a dienophile with two EWG groups. The dihalide B has two CH2Br2 groups attached to a diene. Hmm. The Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene and a dienophile, but I'm not sure if B would act as a dienophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the NaI is acting as a base. If the dihalide is treated with a base, perhaps it undergoes elimination to form a diene. So each CH2Br2 would lose HBr to form a double bond. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene would have two more double bonds at 5,6 positions, leading to a cyclohexa-1,3,5,6-tetraene? But that's a lot of conjugated double bonds.

Alternatively, each CH2Br2 group loses HBr to become a CHBr=CHBr group, but that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is undergoing a double elimination to form a triple bond. But that requires two dehydrohalogenation steps.

Wait, maybe I should think about the overall structure of product 1. Let me think about each step.

Product 1 is formed when A is reacted with two equivalents of B. Then, when product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, it forms product 2.

H2SO4 is a strong acid, perhaps leading to protonation and ring-opening. Or maybe it's a sulfonation step, but product 2 is then treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, which suggests sulfonation.

Wait, but DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent, and SO3 is used for sulfonation. So product 2 must have an activating group that makes it susceptible to sulfonation, perhaps a hydroxyl group or another acidic proton.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol or something similar. Because treating with H2SO4 (aqueous) could lead to diol formation.

Wait, another thought: the initial reaction could be an alkylation. The norbornene derivative (A) has a tert-butoxy group, which is a good nucleophile. The dihalide (B) has two CH2Br2 groups. So perhaps in the presence of NaI, the tert-butoxy group attacks the dihalide, leading to substitution.

Wait, but since there are two equivalents of B, perhaps each dihalide donates an alkyl group to A.

Alternatively, perhaps each dihalide is undergoing a substitution to replace the Br with something else.

Wait, but I'm not very confident about this. Maybe I should think about another approach: the final step is heating product 3 to 150°C to get product 4. Heating can cause various things like elimination, rearrangement, or cyclization.

Let me think about each step again.

Step 1: A + 2B + NaI → 1.

A is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene.

B is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

In NaI, perhaps the Br in B is replaced by I. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2. But then what? How would that react with A?

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide B is a good electrophile, and the tert-butoxy group in A acts as a nucleophile. So the O-t-Bu group could attack the CH2Br, displacing Br-.

But since each substituent has two Brs, perhaps two substitutions occur per substituent. But that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is a di-iodide after substitution, and then the norbornene undergoes some kind of coupling. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene.

Wait, norbornene can undergo ring-opening under certain conditions. For example, with a strong acid or base, it can open into a diradical or a carbocation, leading to various products.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide B is acting as a dienophile, and the norbornene (A) is the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. So the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring with substituents from B.

But considering the structure of A, which is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (norbornene), I'm not sure if it's a good diene for a Diels-Alder reaction. Norbornene is a strained molecule and can react in a Diels-Alder-like fashion, but perhaps it's more likely to undergo other reactions, like electrocyclic ring-opening or [2+2] cycloadditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide B is a dielectrophile, and the norbornene is undergoing a [4+2] cycloaddition.

Wait, but without knowing the exact reaction, perhaps I should think about possible products.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a 1,4-addition of the dihalide to the norbornene.

Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the tert-butoxy group attacks the dihalide.

Wait, another idea: the dihalide B has two CH2Br2 groups; perhaps each can undergo a substitution where one Br is replaced by I. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2BrI. But that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs on each CH2Br2 group are replaced by iodides, making each a CH2I2 group. Then, in the presence of A, perhaps a coupling occurs.

But without a clear picture, maybe I should think about the subsequent steps.

After product 1 is formed, it's treated with H2SO4 (aqueous), which may protonate something, perhaps leading to ring-opening or forming an acid.

Then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, which suggests sulfonation. So product 2 must have an acidic proton, like an -OH group, to which SO3H can be added.

Then, product 3 is heated, which might cause some elimination or rearrangement.

The final product 4 is what we're interested in, and the question is about the number of distinct H atoms.

Wait, perhaps the overall process is forming a larger ring or a fused ring system. For example, the norbornene might be undergoing a ring-opening alkylation to form a larger ring, such as a decalin system.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide B is adding across the double bond of A, leading to a larger structure. Then, the subsequent steps modify functional groups.

Let me try to outline possible structures.

Assume that in step 1, the dihalide B reacts with A to form a bridged bicyclic structure with additional substituents.

Then, in step 2, aqueous H2SO4 might cause some protonation or ring-opening, perhaps leading to a diol if epoxide is formed. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, after step 1, product 1 might be a diether, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution where the tert-butoxy group in A is replaced by a group from B.

Wait, but tert-butoxy is a strong electron-donating group, so it's a good nucleophile. So if A's O-t-Bu attacks the dihalide B, which is a good electrophile, perhaps the O-t-Bu could perform a nucleophilic substitution, replacing Br with O-t-Bu.

But each dihalide B has two Brs, so maybe each substitution occurs twice per substituent.

Wait, but each dihalide is CH2Br2. So perhaps the O-t-Bu attacks one Br, leading to CH2Br-O-t-Bu. But then what happens?

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide B is a diiodide after substitution, making it a stronger electrophile.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the overall structure of product 4 and then work backward.

If product 4 has a certain number of distinct H atoms, perhaps it's a highly symmetrical structure. The options are 4,7,8,10.

Wait, the initial structure is norbornene with a tert-butoxy group. If it undergoes some ring-opening or alkylation, perhaps it's forming a larger ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is a diels-alder reaction. Let's say that product 1 is a Diels-Alder adduct, which upon treatment with H2SO4 becomes something else. Then, sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, and upon heating, a rearrangement occurs.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should consider looking for similar reactions or common mechanisms.

Another approach: think about the possible structures and the number of Hs.

Option B is 4. That's a low number, which suggests a highly symmetrical molecule with few types of Hs.

Option D is 7, which is a medium number. Option A is 8, and C is 10.

The starting norbornene has a certain number of Hs. Let me count the Hs in the starting material.

Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene: The structure is a norbornene. Let me imagine it: norbornene has two double bonds? No, wait, norbornene is a bicyclic compound with one double bond.

Wait, norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So it has a structure with two rings, a bridge, and a double bond. The structure would have several equivalent Hs.

In 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, the structure has a double bond between carbons 2 and 5, and another between 5 and 6? Wait, no, the name is hepta-2,5-diene, so double bonds at 2-3 and 5-6.

Wait, that's a bit more complex. So the molecule has two conjugated double bonds in the norbornene system. Then, the substituent is tert-butoxy at position 7.

The norbornene system is symmetric in certain ways. The substituents at position 7 could be in a position that leads to symmetry.

But without drawing it, it's a bit hard. Let me try to count.

Assuming norbornene has a certain number of H atoms, and the substituent (tert-butoxy) adds more.

But perhaps after the reactions, the molecule becomes more symmetric, leading to fewer distinct Hs.

Wait, perhaps each step adds substituents in a symmetric fashion. For example, adding two groups in equivalent positions.

Wait, perhaps product 4 is a norbornane derivative with substituents that make the molecule highly symmetric.

Alternatively, maybe product 4 is a decalin derivative, which is a fused bicyclic compound, leading to multiple equivalent Hs.

Wait, another thought: the first reaction could be a ring-opening of the norbornene, leading to a diene that undergoes further reactions.

But I'm not getting any further. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, norbornene has several symmetric positions. If product 4 has multiple equivalent groups, it would have fewer distinct Hs.

If the final product is a highly symmetrical molecule with, say, four equivalent groups, perhaps the number of Hs is four? But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has a structure with several identical groups, such as four methyl groups from the tert-butoxy groups, leading to 4 distinct Hs, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a compound with a planar structure, leading to many equivalent Hs.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard. Maybe I should think about the possible answers.

The options are 4,7,8,10. I think the correct answer is either 4 or 7. Because norbornene derivatives can have up to several distinct Hs, but after several reactions, perhaps the number reduces.

Wait, what if the final product is a fully symmetrical structure, like adamantane? Adamantane has a very symmetric structure with all Hs equivalent. But that would be only 1 H, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, if the product has multiple equivalent positions, perhaps 4 distinct Hs.

Alternatively, let's think about each step.

Step 1: A reacts with two equivalents of B. So perhaps two substituents are added to A.

Step 2: Product 1 is treated with H2SO4, perhaps leading to ring-opening or protonation, forming an acid.

Step 3: Product 2 is sulfonated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, adding a sulfonic acid group.

Step 4: Heating product 3 leads to a rearrangement, perhaps elimination or cyclization.

The final product's structure would have a sulfonic acid group and possibly some rings.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a bicyclic compound with a sulfonic acid group and some substituents leading to symmetry, reducing the number of distinct Hs.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a Diels-Alder, making a six-membered ring. Then, the next steps modify the structure, leading to a product with 8 distinct Hs.

Hmm.

Alternatively, considering that the starting material has a tert-butoxy group, which upon substitution could add more substituents, perhaps making the molecule more complex but with some symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the final structure has four distinct Hs, leading to option B)4.

But I'm not confident.

Another approach: think about the possible product structure. Suppose product 4 is a tricyclic compound with several identical substituents.

Wait, let me imagine the product: after the reactions, maybe the structure is a bridged bicyclic compound with substituents that create symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the product ends up as a compound with all substituents in equivalent positions, leading to 4 distinct Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a norbornane derivative with four different substituents, each in symmetric positions, leading to 7 Hs. But I'm not sure.

At this point, I'm going to make an educated guess. Based on the options and the reactions, I think the number of chemically distinct H atoms in product 4 is 7.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (A) and 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene (B). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Reaction of A with B and NaI**: The tert-butoxy group in A may act as a nucleophile, attacking the dihalide groups in B. This could lead to substitution or alkylation, forming product 1. The exact mechanism is unclear, but it likely involves the tert-butoxy group reacting with the CH2Br2 groups in B.

2. **Treatment of product 1 with aqueous H2SO4**: This step could involve protonation, ring-opening, or functional group modification, forming product 2. The acidic conditions might activate certain positions for further reactions.

3. **Sulfonation of product 2 with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO**: This step likely introduces a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) onto product 2, forming product 3. The sulfonation occurs at an acidic proton, such as a hydroxyl group, which was introduced in the previous step.

4. **Heating product 3 at 150°C**: This step could involve rearrangement, elimination, or cyclization, leading to the final product 4. The heating step might finalize the structure by removing functional groups or stabilizing the molecule.

The final product 4 is expected to be a complex bicyclic or tricyclic compound with multiple substituents. The number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms depends on the symmetry of the molecule. Based on the options provided (4, 7, 8, 10), the most plausible answer is **7**, as the reactions likely result in a structure with several equivalent hydrogens due to symmetry, but not all hydrogens are identical.

Answer: D
