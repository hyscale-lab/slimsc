Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and photon momentum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled with the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would switch it to the next lowest energy state. 

Wait, the fundamental state... I think that's the ground state. So, the molecule is in the lowest energy state possible. But what's the next state? Oh, right, in the quantum models, the next state would involve a transition either in rotation, vibration, or both. But the question says the "next state with the lowest possible energy," so probably a single quantum step in one of these modes.

The molecule is made of atoms X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. Oh, and the bond length R is 2 angstroms. The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels come from both rotational and vibrational motions. But the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the selection rules). Wait, for diatomic molecules, the rotational states start at J=0, but the selection rule for rotational transitions is ΔJ = ±1. Oh, but if we're considering a photon being absorbed, it's probably a vibrational transition, or maybe a rotational one?

Alternatively, wait, the question seems to be about moving to the next state with the lowest energy. So perhaps it's a transition in the vibrational mode, because the vibrational energy levels are higher than rotational ones. Or maybe it's a combination of both. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be either the first excited rotational state (J=1) or the first excited vibrational state (v=1). Which of these has a lower energy than the other?

Vibrational energy levels are quantized as Ev = (v + 1/2) ħω. The rotational energy levels are Er = B [ J
