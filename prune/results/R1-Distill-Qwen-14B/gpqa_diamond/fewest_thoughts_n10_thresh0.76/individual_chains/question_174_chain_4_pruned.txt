Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, and the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so first, let me jot down the given data:

- Initial rest-mass energy: 300 GeV. So the rest mass M is 300 GeV/c², but maybe I don't need to worry about the units because everything will be in terms of percentages.

- After fission, two fragments: one is twice as massive as the other. So let me call the masses m1 and m2, where m1 = 2 * m2. Because m1 is larger, it's the more massive fragment.

- The sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Wait, but wait a second. The original nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. That gives us something to work with.

Since momentum is conserved, the total momentum after fission should be zero. So, m1 * v1 = m2 * v2, but with opposite directions, so velocities are in opposite directions. So m1 * v1 = - m2 * v2.

Wait, but actually, since m1 is twice m2, let's say m1 = 2m. Then m2 = m. So m1 + m2 = 3m = 0.99 M. So 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. Therefore, m1 = 0.66 M and m2 =
