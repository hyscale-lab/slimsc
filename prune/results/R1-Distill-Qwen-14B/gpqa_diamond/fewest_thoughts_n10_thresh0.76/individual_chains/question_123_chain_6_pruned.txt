Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see.

The question says that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at the same speed, right? Because in inertial frames, velocities are symmetric. So if the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s, the galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta at the same speed in the ejecta's frame. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, in special relativity, velocity measurements depend on the frame. Oh wait, but the problem states that both are inertial frames. So if the ejecta is moving at v in the galaxy's frame, then in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving at -v (same speed, opposite direction). So their speeds are the same magnitude but opposite directions. So the given 60,000 km/s is the speed in the ejecta's frame, meaning the galaxy's speed relative to the ejecta is 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta.

Wait, the question is about how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So the time is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. I think I need to find the distance
