Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Let's see what the options are and how the spectral data can help me figure it out.

First, looking at the options:
A) 3-ethoxybenzamide
B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide
C) 4-aminophenyl propionate
D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate

I'll start by breaking down the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. The molecular formula can be split into parts. For example, maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is zero here. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation, which could be a benzene ring (3 DoU) plus a couple of double bonds or rings. So likely a benzene ring with substituents.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are likely N-H stretches. Wait, but in amines or amides, the N-H stretches are around 3300-3500. The 1720 cm-1 peak is strong. That's probably an ester or amide carbonyl. So ester C=O is around 1720, amide maybe a bit lower, but depends.

Now the 1H NMR data:
1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something deshielded, maybe an oxygen or a carbonyl.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Could be an amine, maybe an NH2 group, but broad signals could also be from an OCH2 group, but OCH2 would typically be around 3.5-4.5, but depends on the neighboring groups. Alternatively, maybe an ethyl ester's OCH2, but in that case, the OCH2CH3 would have a triplet at around 4.0-4.3, but this is a singlet. Hmm.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring groups, maybe a CH2 next to another CH2. Like an ethyl group where each CH2 is next to another. Wait, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would be a quartet for the OCH2 (if coupled with the adjacent CH3). But here the quartet is at 4.5 ppm for 2H. Alternatively, maybe adjacent to another CH2. Wait, perhaps it's an ester group. Let me think: if it's an ethyl ester, the structure would be O-CO-OCH2CH3. Wait no, ester is R-O-CO-R. For example, ethyl ester would be OCH2CH3 attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, but the NMR shows two different quartets. Let me think again. The triplet at 1.20 (3H) is probably the CH3 of an ethyl group. So the ethyl group is connected to something. The 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) would be the OCH2 in an ethyl ester. So OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet because it's next to the CH3. Wait, no, the OCH2 in ethyl ester is a quartet when the CH3 is next. So the ethyl ester's OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as quartet (coupled with CH3: 3H), and the CH3 as triplet (coupled with OCH2: 2H). So 1.2 ppm triplet for CH3, 4.1-4.3 ppm quartet for OCH2. But in our NMR, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm, maybe it's split differently or perhaps it's a different group.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data again: 4.5 (q, 2H) and 4.0 (bs, 2H). So perhaps the 4.5 is an OCH2 and the 4.0 is something else. Alternatively, maybe it's part of an amide or another group.

The aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and each would be a doublet if there's coupling with adjacent protons. Wait, but in para substitution, the aromatic protons are usually two doublets when there are substituents in the ortho positions. Wait, no, if the substituent is para, then each adjacent position (ortho) would have two protons. Wait, perhaps the structure is para-substituted, and the substituent is attached to the ring in such a way that two sets of doublets appear. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an amino group or an ester group, and the coupling is between the ring protons.

Wait, the aromatic protons in para-substituted benzene derivatives often show as a doublet of doublets or as two separate doublets. For example, in p-methyl, the protons are in two doublets. But in the case where the substituent is electron-withdrawing, like nitro or carbonyl, the protons would be deshielded.

But let's think about the options. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would have a benzoate ester group. The benzoate would have a carbonyl, and the ester oxygen connected to an ethyl group. The amino group is in the para position relative to the ester.

Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That would have a phenyl group with an ethoxy at para, and a formamide group (CONH2) attached to the ring.

Option A is 3-ethoxybenzamide: benzamide with ethoxy in the meta position.

Option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate: that would be a propionyl group attached to the benzene ring via an amide bond, with an amino group in para.

Now, let's consider the IR. Strong band at 1720 cm-1: that's probably an ester or amide carbonyl. Benzamide (option A) would have an amide carbonyl, which typically appears around 1650-1700 cm-1. However, an ester's carbonyl is higher, around 1720-1740. So if the IR is 1720, it's more likely an ester. So that would point towards options D or B or C.

Wait, let's check: formamide's carbonyl is around 1680-1650, I think. So if the IR is 1720, that suggests an ester or maybe an acyl chloride. But probably ester here.

Looking at the options, D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would have an ester (OEt) attached to the carbonyl of benzoic acid. The 4-aminobenzoate would have an amino group in the para position.

So the IR shows the ester carbonyl at 1720, which fits with option D.

Looking at the NMR: the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) would be the OCH2 of the ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) is the CH3 of the ethyl group. Then, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) might be the NH2 group of the amino substituent. But wait, amino protons are usually broad and around 1-5 ppm, but in aromatic amines, they can be downfield. However, in the case of 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is para to the ester. The amino group in benzoate is typically deprotonated, but in the compound, it's a secondary amine if it's 4-aminobenzoate. Wait no, benzoate is the conjugate base, but in the compound, it's the ester. Wait, 4-aminobenzoate would have the structure O=C
