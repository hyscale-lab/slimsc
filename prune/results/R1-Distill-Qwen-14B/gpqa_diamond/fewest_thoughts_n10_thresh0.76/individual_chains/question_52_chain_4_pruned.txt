Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

Astronomers are studying a star with certain parameters. The star has 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500K. So, the spots make the star cooler overall. 

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They've observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, so the ratio drops when spots are present. Let me think about what affects the population of these energy levels. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the star's photosphere has spots. When the spots are present, the effective temperature of the photosphere decreases. Oh, but wait, do the spots themselves have a lower temperature, or does that affect the overall photospheric temperature? The problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the average T is lower when spots are present.

So, the question is about the ratio n1/n2 (since it's level 1 to level 2). Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, n1/n2 is lower. So, when there are no spots, the ratio is higher.

Wait, the question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the ratio is higher without spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = some number.

But wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The ratio n1/n2 is given as something that decreases when the star has spots. So when you have spots, the average T is lower. How does T affect the ratio?

The ratio n1/n2 is the ratio of populations in the two levels. From the Boltzmann equation, n2 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)) * n1. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)).

So, when T decreases, the exponential term ΔE/(k T) becomes larger (since T is smaller). So exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases, so n1/n2 increases. Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. That would mean that n1/n2 is lower with spots. But according to this, when
