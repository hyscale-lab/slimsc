Okay, so I have this genetics question here about gene interactions in white lupine plants. The goal is to figure out which genes are transcription factors and how they interact based on the data provided from their knockout mutants and double mutants. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: We have three genes, G1, G2, G3. Knockout mutants are g1, g2, g3, and double mutants are g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. The experiment measures their resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. The resistance levels are given as percentages of the control (wild-type) plants.

The data is as follows:
- g1: 75% (so 75% of the control's resistance)
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm, I remember that in genetics, the way these mutants perform can tell us about their interactions. Also, the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Transcription factors usually regulate the expression of other genes, so their knockout would affect downstream genes.

So, when a gene is a transcription factor, its knockout (like g2 here) would have a more severe phenotype because it's regulating others. Looking at the data, the g2 single mutant has 0% resistance. That's the lowest, meaning without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. Maybe G2 is a critical transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for resistance.

Let's think about each gene's contribution. When you knock out a transcription factor, the downstream genes it controls won't be expressed properly, which would make the plant more susceptible. So, if G2 is a TF, then without G2, the other genes it regulates (maybe G1 or G3) can't function, leading to no resistance. That fits with the g2 mutant's 0% resistance.

Looking at the double mutants: g1g2 is 0%, g2g3 is 0%. Hmm. If G2 is a TF, then any mutant that lacks G2 (like g1g2 or g2g3) would also show 0% resistance because G2's function is already gone. But what about g1g3? That's 10%, which is even worse than g3's 50%, but not as bad as 0. So maybe G1 and G3 are downstream of G2, but perhaps G1 and G3 also have some interactions.

Wait, but what about the single mutants. g1 has 75% resistance. So without G1, the plant still retains some resistance. Maybe G1 is part of a redundant system. Because 75% is less than wild type, but not zero. Similarly, g3 is 50%—so without G3, resistance is halved.

Hmm, redundancy would mean that two genes can compensate for each other. For example, if G1 and G3 are redundant, knocking out one (g1 or g3) would reduce resistance, but knocking out both (g1g3) would eliminate it. But wait, in our data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are perhaps not redundant but maybe synergistic or something else.

Another possibility is that G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but they might have some independent functions. Let me think about epistasis here. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if G2 is epistatic to G1, that would mean that G2's pathway acts upstream of G1, so without G2, G1's function doesn't matter.

Wait, but in the double mutants, g1g2 is 0%, same as g2. So, in the absence of G2, the other mutations don't matter—so G2 is epistatic to G1. Similarly, g2g3 is 0%—so G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

So, for epistasis, if the double mutant's phenotype is the same as the more severe single mutant, then the gene that's epistatic is the one whose mutation is more severe. So, in g1g2, the phenotype is the same as g2, which has 0% resistance. So G2 is epistatic because without G2, G1's function doesn't matter.

Similarly, the same is true for g2g3. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

But the question is about which genes are transcription factors and how they interact.

So, G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance—since it's a transcription factor, it's likely upstream of other genes. For example, G2 activates G1 and G3. Or perhaps G2 activates another gene that is necessary for resistance, and G1 and G3 are part of that pathway.

Wait, but the data shows that the single mutants of G1 and G3 are not as bad as g2. So perhaps without G2, you can't activate G1 and G3, leading to no resistance. So G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3.

But let's look at the double mutants. 

In the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is
