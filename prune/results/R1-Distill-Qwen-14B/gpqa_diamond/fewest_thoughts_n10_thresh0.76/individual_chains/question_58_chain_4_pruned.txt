Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, first, what's regularization? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or something similar, which you then remove (or renormalize) later.

So, the key here is which theory doesn't need that. Let's go through each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Oh right, classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones because they don't deal with the same kind of infinities. In QED, you have things like the electron self-energy leading to divergences, which is why you need renormalization. But in classical ED, you don't have these divergences in the same way. So maybe classical ED doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. That seems like a possible candidate for the correct answer.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics. QED is a quantum field theory, so it definitely has issues that require renormalization. Like, the calculation of the Lamb shift or the Casimir effect—those involve handling divergences, which would require regularization. So QED needs it.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics. QCD is also a quantum field theory, dealing with the strong force. It has its own set of divergences, especially because of things like asymptotic freedom. I think QCD requires regularization methods like lattice regularization or others. So B is out.

Option A is Superstring Theory. Superstring theory is a type of quantum gravity theory. Wait, but string theories are different because they have a higher number of dimensions. Do they require regularization? I'm a bit confused here. String theories usually work by summing over all possible topologies of strings, but I think they might not have the same divergences as in QFT because the underlying structure is different. Or maybe they don't need the same kind of regularization because of the way they handle high energies. Alternatively, I think that in string theory, certain types of divergences appear, but perhaps they are handled without the same kind of regularization techniques as in QFT. Or maybe they don't require it because the theory is inherently finite? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. I remember that string theory has loop divergences, but maybe those are handled through other methods, like using the string tension or other parameters. Or perhaps they don't require the same kind of ad-hoc regularization because the theory's structure manages it better.

Wait, the question is which theory never requires regularization. So which of these theories doesn't have divergences that necessitate regularization?

Classical Electrodynamics doesn't have these issues because it's a classical theory. So when you calculate, say, the Coulomb potential or electromagnetic fields, you don't get the same divergences as in the quantum case. So for D, the answer would be correct because it doesn't need regularization, unlike the quantum
