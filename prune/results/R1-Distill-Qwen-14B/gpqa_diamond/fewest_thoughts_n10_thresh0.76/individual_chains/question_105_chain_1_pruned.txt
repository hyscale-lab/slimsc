Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow and think through each part.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, but with some spots on one hemisphere. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so Rstar is the same as the Sun's radius. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, so the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so their temperature is 5000K.

The scenario is that when only one hemisphere is spotted, the brightness variations observed as the star rotates (rotational modulation) can look similar to those caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. The question is asking: what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as these spots do?

Hmm, right. So I need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the change in brightness (the dip) is the same when the planet transits as when the spots rotate into and out of view.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the observed brightness variations are due to spots, but if the star didn't have spots, what exoplanet size would cause the same dip. So I need to compare the two scenarios: the spot-induced dip and the planet transit dip.

Let me think about how each affects the observed brightness.

First, the spot effect. The star has spots on one hemisphere, covering 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere. Wait, but the star's surface area is 4πR², so each hemisphere is 2πR². So the spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the total area with spots is 0.2 * (π R²) per hemisphere. Oh wait, no, the filling factor is a fraction of the surface. So the total area covered is 0.2 * (4π R² / 2) ), since one hemisphere is 2π R². So 0.2 *
