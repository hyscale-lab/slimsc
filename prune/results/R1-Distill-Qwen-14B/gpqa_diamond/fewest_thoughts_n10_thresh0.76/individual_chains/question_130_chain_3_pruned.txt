Okay, so I've got this question here about detecting large clouds of neutral hydrogen using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think this through.

So the question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so they can be detected. The clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet range, right? Because Lyman series transitions are for hydrogen and they're in the UV. So, Lyman alpha is 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait a second. 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is UV. So why is the question saying it's about optical telescopes?

Wait, because the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen clouds. So if the cloud has a high redshift, the absorbed wavelength would shift into longer wavelengths. Oh, right, redshift increases the wavelength. So when the quasar's light passes through the neutral hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs at the Lyman alpha wavelength. If the cloud is moving away (which it is, because of the expansion of the universe), the absorption line would be redshifted.

But optical telescopes can't see UV light because the atmosphere blocks it. So if the redshift is such that the absorbed wavelength shifts into the optical range (like visible light, 400-700 nm), then we can detect it from the ground. Because if the wavelength is in the visible, ground telescopes can observe it.

So the Lyman alpha wavelength is 121.6 nm (which is 1216 Angstroms). If the cloud has a redshift z, then the observed wavelength lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z). We want lambda_observed to be in the optical range, which is about 400 nm to 700 nm, I think. So the lower limit would be when lambda_observed is 400 nm. Because if it's longer than that, it's in the visible and detectable. Wait, no: wait, the quasar's light is at the Lyman alpha wavelength when it leaves the
