Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that there's a small peptidic compound synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks right except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. Hmm, that's interesting. So, it's like the same proton is showing up as two separate peaks. But the integral is correctâ€”so together they mean one proton. Spin-spin coupling is ruled out because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that, so it's not like a doublet of doublets or anything where splitting would cause multiple peaks.

Then, looking at the LC-MS. Elevated temperature, two peaks of equal intensity. Same mass spectrum for both, which matches the expected molecule. So, the mass is the same, meaning same molecular weight. If the masses were different, we might think about tautomers or something else, but here it's the same.

Let me think about the options. 

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a different mass. If the MS shows the same mass, that wouldn't fit. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same mass, right? Because they are mirror images. So in LC-MS, if it's a chiral column, they might separate. But if the column isn't chiral, they might not. But the question says both peaks have same mass, which would be the case for enantiomers. However, would the NMR show two peaks for the same proton in that case? Enantiomers would have identical NMR spectra because they're mirror images. So why would there be two peaks? Wait, no. If the sample is a racemic mixture, the NMR would show the same as pure because the peaks would overlap. So maybe this isn't the case. Unless the NMR is run in a way that detects something else, but I don't think so.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, double coupling... Wait, in amide bond formation, like in peptide synthesis, sometimes you can get some coupling issues. But I'm not exactly sure what 'double coupling' refers to. Maybe the reaction didn't go to completion, and some double bonds formed or something else? Or perhaps it's about the formation of two different bonds, leading to two different structures. Alternatively, maybe it's a situation where two different coupling partners happened, leading to two products. I'm a bit fuzzy on this one, but let me think more.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they'd show up as separate peaks in NMR. Since diastereomers have different structures, their NMR peaks can split into different signals. For example, if an -NH group is in two different environments, or if there's a stereocenter, the neighboring protons would be different. But wait, in the NMR, the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So that's confusing. If it's diastereomers, why would the same proton split into two? Unless the diastereomerism is affecting the shift of that proton. But wait, diastereomers have different physical properties, so their same protons may appear at different shifts. But in this case, the shifts are similar and integrals add up. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the diastereomers involve the same environment for that proton, but different elsewhere. I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So it's like the same proton is split into two. How would that happen? If the molecule is in a different conformation, maybe, but that's usually broadening or as a singlet. Alternatively, if there's some coupling with two different sets of neighboring protons. But the question says spin-spin is ruled out because the coupling doesn't fit. So it's
