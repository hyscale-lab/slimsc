Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is the angle between them.

Wait, okay, so Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma equals 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. That means their relativistic masses would be gamma times the rest mass.

But wait, the electron and positron have the same rest mass, right? So the electron's relativistic mass is 4*m_0, and the positron's is 2*m_0. But since they're moving in opposite directions, their velocities are opposite too.

I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. And since the system's total momentum must be conserved, the photons' momenta should add up to the total initial momentum of the electron and positron.

Also, the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So each photon has energy E, which means their momenta have magnitudes E/c each, because for photons, E = pc.

Wait, but since they're photons, their
