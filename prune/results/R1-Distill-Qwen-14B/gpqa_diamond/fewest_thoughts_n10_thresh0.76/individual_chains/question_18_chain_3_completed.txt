Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I'm not sure if that matters for this particular question. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. 

The problem gives some abundance ratios. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Oh wait, I remember that [X/Y] means the logarithm of (X/Y ratio divided by the solar ratio). So, it's log base 10 of (X/Y) minus log base 10 of (X/Y in Sun) equals [X/Y].

Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given. For the Sun, 12 + log(nFe/nH) equals 7.5. Wait, no, wait: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5. So, log10(nFe/nH) would be 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) is 7, so log(nMg/nH) is -5. So nMg/nH is 10^(-5).

Wait, but what exactly are we being asked? The ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars' photospheres. So we need to find (nSi/Star1) / (nSi/Star2) or vice versa? Wait, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think it's (Si in Star_1) divided by (Si in Star_2). Or maybe the other way around? No, the question isn't specific, but the options are numbers, so it's a numerical ratio.

Let me think about the steps. We need to find [Si/Star1] / [Si/Star2]. Hmm, but wait, maybe it's the ratio of their Si abundances compared to the Sun, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we need to compute the ratio of their silicon to hydrogen, and then find the ratio between the two stars.

Wait, I think each star's composition can be determined relative to the Sun, and then we can find the ratio between the two.

So, let's process each star's abundances.

Starting with Star_1:

Given [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So, [Fe/H] is log(Fe/H in Star_1) minus log(Fe/H in Sun) = 0. So Fe/H in Star_1 is equal to solar. So, Star_1 has the same Fe abundance as the Sun relative to H.

But [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. That means log(Si/Fe in Star_1) - log(Si/Fe in Sun) = 0.3. So Si/Fe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times that of the Sun. 

Wait, the Sun's Si/Fe ratio: Let's compute that. From the data, for the Sun, nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5), and nMg/nH is 10^(-5). But what about nSi/nH for the Sun? The problem doesn't directly give it, so perhaps we need to find it.

Wait, no, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is not given. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of each star.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = log( (nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/nFe)_Sun ) = 0.3

So, (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_Sun * 10^0.3

We know [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_Sun.

So (nFe/nH)_1 = 10^(-4.5), same as the Sun.

So, (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nH)_Sun / (nFe/nH)_Sun * 10^0.3

Wait, because (nSi/nFe) = (nSi/nH) / (nFe/nH).

So for the Sun, (nSi/nFe)_Sun = (nSi/nH)_Sun / (nFe/nH)_Sun.

But we don't have (nSi/nH)_Sun. Hmm. Maybe I can express nSi in terms of nFe and the [Si/Fe] ratio.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of the Sun's abundances.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the ratio of [nSi/Star1] to [nSi/Star2] using the given data.

Wait, let's consider that for each star, the [X/Y] ratio is given. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe] = 0.3, which means their Si/Fe is 10^0.3 times higher than the Sun's.

Similarly, their Fe/H is 0, so Fe is same as solar.

So, for Star_1: Si/Fe = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_Sun.

But (Si/Fe)_Sun is (nSi/nFe)_Sun.

How can we find (nSi/nH)_1?

Well, since (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_Sun, as [Fe/H]_1 is 0.

So, (nFe/nH)_1 = 10^(-4.5) as per the Sun's data.

And (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_Sun.

So, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_1 * (nFe/nH)_1.

Which is 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_Sun * (nFe/nH)_Sun.

But (nSi/nFe)_Sun * (nFe/nH)_Sun = (nSi/nH)_Sun.

So, (nSi/nH)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nH)_Sun.

Hmm, so the ratio of Si abundance in Star_1 relative to the Sun is 10^0.3.

Wait, but the problem is to find the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Si in Star_2.

So, I think I need to do the same for Star_2.

Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.

[Mg/H]_2 = 0.

So, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, meaning Mg/H in Star_2 is the same as the Sun. So, (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_Sun = 10^(-5).

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → (Mg/Si)_2 = 10^0.3 * (Mg/Si)_Sun.

So, (nMg/nSi)_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_Sun.

Which can be rearranged as (nSi/nMg)_2 = (nSi/nMg)_Sun / 10^0.3.

But (nSi/nMg)_Sun is 1 / (nMg/nSi)_Sun.

Wait, perhaps better to find (nSi/nH)_2.

Since (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_Sun → 10^(-5).

Also, (nMg/nSi)_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_Sun.

So, (nMg/nSi)_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_Sun.

But (nMg/nSi)_Sun is (nMg/nH)_Sun / (nSi/nH)_Sun.

Wait, let me write that.

(nMg/nSi)_Sun = (nMg/nH)_Sun / (nSi/nH)_Sun.

So, (nMg/nH)_Sun is 1e-5, as given.

So, (nMg/nSi)_Sun = (1e-5) / (nSi/nH)_Sun.

Then, (nMg/nSi)_2 = 10^0.3 * (1e-5) / (nSi/nH)_Sun.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here because I still don't know (nSi/nH)_Sun.

Wait, but in Star_1, I've expressed (nSi/nH)_1 as 10^0.3 * (nSi/nH)_Sun.

So, maybe we can find the ratio of (nSi/nH)_1 to (nSi/nH)_2.

Because the ratio of Si in Star_1 to that in Star_2 is (nSi_1 / nH_1) / (nSi_2 / nH_2) = (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2).

But wait, both stars' H may not be the same, but I think the H abundance is assumed to be the same since it's the photosphere, but actually, [Fe/H] is given. Wait, Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, so Fe/H is the same as the Sun. So, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun.

Wait, but we don't know nH in each star. Oh, wait, but perhaps nH is the same as the Sun's because the overall number density might scale, but relative abundances are what we're after. Or, perhaps the ratio of nH between the stars is 1? I'm not sure. Hmm, maybe I can assume that nH is the same in both stars, but I don't think that's necessarily correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each star has their own H abundance, but the problem provides enough info to compute the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let me think about each star's [X/H] ratios.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so Fe/H is same as the Sun. So, nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

Similarly, since [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, then [Si/Fe]_1 = log( (nSi_1/nFe_1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

So, nSi_1 / nFe_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

But nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun). Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

So, substituting back:

nSi_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * nFe_1
= 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1
= 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * (nH_1)

So, nSi_1 / nH_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nH_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. So, [Mg/Si]_2 = log( (nMg_2/nSi_2) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) = 0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

Also, [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

Substituting into the Mg/Si ratio:

nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 / nH_sun)
So, (nMg_2 / nSi_2) = (nMg_sun * (nH_2 / nH_sun)) / nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun)

Rearranging:

nSi_2 = (nMg_sun * (nH_2 / nH_sun)) / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun))
= (nH_2 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) / (10^0.3)
= (nH_2 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) / (10^0.3)

So, nSi_2 / nH_2 = (nSi_sun / (nH_sun * 10^0.3 )) * (nH_2 / nH_sun) * (nH_2 / nH_sun ?)

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, for the expression:

nSi_2 = [ (nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) ) ] / [ 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) ) ]

Simplify denominator: 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) = (10^0.3 * nMg_sun) ) / nSi_sun

So,

nSi_2 = (nMg_sun * nH_2 / nH_sun) ) * (nSi_sun / (10^0.3 * nMg_sun) )

nMg_sun cancels out:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) / (10^0.3)

So,

nSi_2 / nH_2 = (nSi_sun / (10^0.3 * nH_sun)) ) 

Wait, perhaps it's better to write this as:

nSi_2 / nH_2 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * (1 / 10^0.3 )

Because,

nSi_2 / nH_2 = [ (nSi_sun ) / (10^0.3 * nH_sun) ) ] * (nH_2 / nH_2 ) → No, wait, nH_2 is in the numerator.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the two stars' silicon to hydrogen ratios.

For Star_1: nSi_1 / nH_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nH_sun )

For Star_2: nSi_2 / nH_2 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * (1 / 10^0.3 )

Wait, why? Because in Star_2's calculation, we had:

nSi_2 = (nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) ) / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) )

Simplify:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) / (10^0.3 )

So, 

nSi_2 / nH_2 = (nSi_sun) / (10^0.3 * nH_sun )

Which is (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * (1/10^0.3 )

So, now the ratio (nSi_1 / nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 / nH_2 ) would be:

[10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) ] / [ (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) * 10^-0.3 ]

Wait, because 1/10^0.3 is 10^(-0.3). So,

Ratio = [10^0.3 * a ] / [ a * 10^(-0.3) ] where a = (nSi_sun / nH_sun)

So, a cancels out.

Ratio = 10^0.3 / 10^(-0.3) = 10^(0.3 + 0.3) ) = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 4. So the ratio is about 4.

Wait, but wait. The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2. So, (nSi_1 / nH_1 ) divided by (nSi_2 / nH_2 ) is the ratio of (nSi/nH) in Star_1 to that in Star_2. Because nH in each star could be different, but since the problem doesn't give any other [H] data, perhaps we can assume that the hydrogen is the same in each, or that the ratio of H in each is 1. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is simply (nSi_1 / nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 / nH_2 ), as I did earlier.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio of nSi in Star_1 to Star_2 is (nSi_1 / nSi_2) = [ (nSi_1 / nH_1 ) * nH_1 ] / [ (nSi_2 / nH_2 ) * nH_2 ].

But without knowing the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2, we can't compute this. So maybe the problem assumes that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (nSi_1 / nH_1 ) divided by (nSi_2 / nH_2 ), which I calculated as approximately 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which would be the approximate value of 10^0.6.

So, the ratio is about 4, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another thing: Are we asked about the ratio of silicon atoms, which would be (number of Si in Star_1) divided by (number of Si in Star_2), or the ratio of their Si/H ratios?

The question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So it's about the abundance of silicon in each, so the ratio would be (nSi_1 / nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 / nH_2 ), which is what I calculated as ~4.

So the answer should be option A, ~3.9.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and the Sun's photospheric composition.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex: This means the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is \( 10^{0.3} \) times that of the Sun.
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex: The iron-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex: This means the ratio of magnesium to silicon in Star_2 is \( 10^{0.3} \) times that of the Sun.
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex: The magnesium-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun.

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \), so \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), and \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \), so \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), and \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- Since [Fe/H]_1 = 0, the iron-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun: \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
- From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, the silicon-to-iron ratio in Star_1 is \( 10^{0.3} \) times that of the Sun:  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot}}.
  \]
- Using \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \), we find:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{H}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}}.
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- Since [Mg/H]_2 = 0, the magnesium-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun: \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).
- From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, the magnesium-to-silicon ratio in Star_2 is \( 10^{0.3} \) times that of the Sun:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{Si}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}}.
  \]
- Rearranging, we find:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}} = \frac{n_{\text{H}}}{n_{\text{Mg}}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{Si}}} = \frac{n_{\text{H}}}{n_{\text{Mg}}} \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}}.
  \]
- Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \), we get:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}} = \frac{1}{10^{-5}} \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}} = 10^{5} \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}}.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Abundances:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right)_{\text{Star}_1}}{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right)_{\text{Star}_2}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}}}{10^{-0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}}} = 10^{0.3 + 0.3} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Approximating \( 10^{0.6} \), we find it is approximately **3.9**.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
