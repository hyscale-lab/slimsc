Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are four steps, each converting one compound to the next. Then there are some hints and options to choose from.

First, let's break down the reactions step by step.

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

Also, there are hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different cyclic ketones.

Let me think about each step and what's happening.

Starting with step 1: A + HCN â†’ B.

HCN is a nucleophile. When it reacts with a carbonyl group (like in a ketone or aldehyde), it typically adds to the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, it would form a similar structure.

The IR hint says A has a peak at 1750 cm^-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. So A is a ketone or aldehyde. Then B would be a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached, perhaps.

Wait, but after that, step 2 is reduction with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation. So if B has a carbonyl group (from the cyanohydrin maybe?), that would be reduced. Wait, no, the cyanohydrin is RCH(OH)CN. So that's an alcohol and a nitrile group. Reduction with H2 and Pd would typically reduce triple bonds (like nitriles) to
