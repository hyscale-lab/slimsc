Okay, so I need to figure out which physical theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm. Let me think about each option one by one.

First, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, which are like infinities that pop up in calculations. These divergences can cause problems because they don't give meaningful results. Regularization helps to make these calculations finite so we can work with them.

Option A is Superstring Theory. I think string theory is different from the usual quantum field theories because it's a theory of everything, incorporating gravity. But wait, string theory is a background-dependent theory, right? Or is it background-independent? Oh, wait, no, superstring theory is an extension of string theory that includes supersymmetry. But I'm not sure if it requires regularization. I remember that in string theory, the theory is finite, meaning it doesn't have the same kind of divergences as in other quantum field theories. Because, in string theory, particles are not point-like but are strings, so maybe the way the theory works avoids these divergences. So maybe superstring theory doesn't need regularization. But I'm not entirely sure.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD does require renormalization because, at high energies, the theory becomes non-perturbative and has things like confinement. Wait, but renormalization is a form of regularization? Or is it a separate step? Oh, right, renormalization is a process that deals with the infinities by absorbing them into counterterms. So QCD definitely requires regularization. So option B is out.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that QED does have divergent loop diagrams, especially in higher-order Feynman diagrams. So they use techniques like cutoff regularization or dimensional regularization to handle these divergences. So QED requires regularization. So option C is not the right answer.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones because they don't involve the quantization of fields or particles. In classical electrodynamics, you might have issues like the self-energy of charges leading to infinite charge densities, but those are handled differently. Wait, but regularization is a quantum field theory concept. In classical theories, you don't need regularization because you're not dealing with the same divergent integrals in the same way. So classical E&M doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. But wait, the question is about high energies. Well, classical theories don't really have a notion of high energies leading to regularization because they're not quantized.

So putting it together. The question is which theory never requires regularization at high energies.

Superstring theory (A) might not require regularization because it's supposed to be finite. QCD (B) does require it. QED (C) requires it. Classical E&M (D) doesn't use regularization because it's a classical theory, but the question is about physical theories. Wait, does the question include classical theories as options? Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So which of these theories doesn't have issues that require regularization. So the only theories
