Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The first part says that 3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one is treated with 1 equivalent of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. Two different products are formed in a 1:1 ratio. Then, in a separate vessel, methyl lithium is treated with copper(I) iodide, and the resulting solution is added to the product mixture. I need to name one of the products formed.

Hmm, okay, breaking this down. Let's tackle the first reaction first. The starting material is 3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one. The structure of that must be... let me draw it out.

Hepta means seven carbons. The ketone is at position 4. So positions 1 to 7. The double bonds are at 1,5-diene, so between 1-2 and 5-6? Wait, wait, hepta-1,5-dien-4-one. So positions 1,2 double bond and 5,6 double bond. Also, at position 3 there are two methyl groups, and at 6 another methyl. So the structure is: 

CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-?

Wait, let me correct that. Wait, position 4 is the ketone. So:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7

CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-?

Wait, but the substituents. Let me think again. Hepta-1,5-dien-4-one: the ketone is on carbon 4. The double bonds are between 1-2 and 5-6. So structure:

1      2      3      4      5      6      7
CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2?

Wait, maybe not. Let me number the carbons. Carbon 1 is the first, so:

Carbon 1: CH2=
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: C(CH3)2
Carbon 4: C=O
