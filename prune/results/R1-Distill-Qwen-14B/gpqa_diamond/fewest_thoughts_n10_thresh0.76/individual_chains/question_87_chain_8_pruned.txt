Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically dealing with NMR spectroscopy. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. Hmm, wait, a di-substituted benzene ring with 8 carbons? So benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 more. Di-substituted means two substituents. So each substituent probably adds one carbon each. But wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6, so substituents add 2. So each substituent is a methyl group? No, because two methyl groups would add 2*1 = 2, making 8. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a -CH2CH3 group, but that would be 2 carbons. But then the other substituent would have to add 0, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps each substituent is one carbonâ€”like two methyl groups.

Wait, but wait. Let's think again. The substituents are attached to the benzene ring. Di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. Each substituent could be a group like -CH2COsomething or something else. But the question mentions that the FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the molecule must have a carbonyl and a halide substituent.

So, the two substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. So, possibilities are groups like -COOH, -COOR, -CHO, etc., and a halogen like -Cl or -Br.

Wait, but benzene rings with substituents can have di substitution. So, for example, maybe one substituent is a halogen (like Cl) and another is a carbonyl group. But the carbonyl group would be part of a larger substituent, like an acyl group. Wait, but let's think about the structure.

Wait, the molecular formula isn't given, but the total number of carbons is 8. Benzene is 6 carbons. So substituents add up to 2 more. So each substituent must be 1 carbon each
