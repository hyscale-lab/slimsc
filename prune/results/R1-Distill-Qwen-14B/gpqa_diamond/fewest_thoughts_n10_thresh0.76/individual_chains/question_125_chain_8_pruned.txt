Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a particle of mass m in a three-dimensional isotropic potential given by V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². That's a harmonic oscillator potential, right? Because Hooke's law is F = -kr, and in that case, the potential energy is (1/2)kr². Here, it's written as (1/2)mω²r², which makes sense because for a harmonic oscillator, the angular frequency ω is related to the spring constant k by k = mω². So, this is a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.

The question asks two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that same energy eigenvalue. The options are A to D, each giving an energy and a number.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. I remember that in three dimensions, the energy levels of the quantum harmonic oscillator are quantized. Since it's isotropic, the potential depends only on the radial distance r, and the problem is symmetric in all directions. So, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each direction.

In three dimensions, the energy levels for the isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:

E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)

Wait, no, actually, I think each direction contributes n_i + 1/2, so adding all three would give (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) multiplied by ħω. Alternatively, each direction has energy levels (n_i + 1/2)ħω, so the total energy is the sum for x, y, and z. So E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω.

But wait, another thought: sometimes the energy is expressed in terms of the total quantum number. For a three-dimensional isotropic oscillator, the energy levels can also be considered as E = ħω( n + 3/2 ), where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Here, n is the sum of the three quantum numbers, each being a non-negative
