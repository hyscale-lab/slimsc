Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here. 

The problem says that we have an atom with a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. Now, they want to know the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, no, after the 50 minutes, how much longer are we looking? Oh, the question is asking about the next 150 minutes. But wait, that might not make sense because 50 + 150 is 200 minutes, which is longer than the initial 100-minute half-life or whatever. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the decay constant.

Wait, the given probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability that the atom decays in 100 minutes. So the decay constant λ is such that the probability P is 32% (0.32) in 100 minutes. The formula for radioactive decay probability is P = 1 - e^(-λt). So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). Let me solve for λ.

So rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3857 (since ln(0.5)= -0.693, ln(0.7)=−0.3567, so 0.68 is a bit less, so about -0.3857). So λ ≈ 0.3857 / 100 = 0.003857 per minute.

Now, the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes. So we're looking at the remaining time. Wait, but in radioactive decay, the process is memoryless, so the probability doesn't depend on how much time
