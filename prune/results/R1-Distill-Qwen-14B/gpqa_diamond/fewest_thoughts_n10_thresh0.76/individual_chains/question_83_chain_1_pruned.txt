Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titration and pH. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll go slowly.

The question says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction should form acetate ions and water. The equivalence point would be when all the acetic acid is neutralized by the NaOH.

First, I should probably figure out the initial concentration after dilution. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When you mix it with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be half, right? Because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when moles are constant.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is to find the pH at 25% titration. So, the 25% refers to the volume of NaOH added, I think. So 25% of the equivalence point volume.

Wait, let me think. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So, the moles of acetic acid are 0.001 (from before). Each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed at equivalence point is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

At 25% titration, only 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

So initially, after dilution, we have 0.025 M CH3COOH. The volume is 40 cm³. When we add
