Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about a spin-1/2 particle and how its magnetic moment behaves when the magnetic field changes direction. Hmm.

Alright, so the setup is: we have a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes too. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the Hamiltonian is probably proportional to the dot product of mu and B. Oh right, the energy is mu·B, so H is proportional to that.

Initially, when B is along Z, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = gamma * Sz * B. Since the particle is spin-1/2, Sz has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energy levels are ± gamma B ħ / 2. But wait, wait, actually, mu is gamma times Sz, so maybe the Hamiltonian is mu · B. Oh, that would make H_initial = mu * B in the z-direction. So H_initial = gamma Sz B.

Wait, but mu is a vector, so it's mu = gamma S. So mu · B is gamma S · B. So when B is along Z, H_initial = gamma B Sz.

The particle is initially aligned with the magnetic field, so I think it's in an eigenstate of Sz. So before the field is turned off, the state is |up> along Z or |down> along Z. Since the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian becomes zero for a moment, but then another field is applied along Y.

Wait, but in reality, the system is prepared in an eigenstate of Sz because the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = gamma B Sz. So the eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>, with energies E+ = gamma B (ħ/2), and E- = -gamma B (ħ/2). Then the field is turned off, which I think means the Hamiltonian becomes zero. But then another field is turned on
