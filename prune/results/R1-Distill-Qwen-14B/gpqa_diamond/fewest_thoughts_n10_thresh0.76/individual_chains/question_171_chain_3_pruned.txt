Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrophilic substitution reactions. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine. So, six different benzene derivatives are given, and I need to arrange them based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm, I remember that when a substituent is present on a benzene ring, it directs incoming electrophiles to certain positionsâ€”ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, right. The substituents can be activating or deactivating. Activating groups make the ring more reactive and direct the incoming electrophile to ortho and para positions. Deactivating groups do the opposite, making the ring less reactive and directing to meta, unless they're strong deactivating groups like nitro, which are meta directors.

So each substituent here will influence where bromine adds. But the question is about the weight fraction (yield) of the para-isomer. I think this depends on the substituent's directing effects. For example, if a substituent is a strong activating group, the para position is a major site for substitution, leading to a higher yield of para isomer. Conversely, deactivating groups might reduce the para isomer yield because the ring isn't activated or they direct elsewhere.

Wait, but wait, the substituents might have different directing effects. Let's list each substituent and their effects.

1) C6H5-CH3: The substituent is a methyl group. Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So bromine would add more in para and ortho positions. Since it's a bulky substituent (I think), para is a major site because ortho could be hindered. Or wait, para is usually easier to attack because of less steric hindrance compared to ortho. So methyl should lead to a significant para product.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's a benzoyloxy group? Wait, no, wait. COOEt is an ester group. So the substituent is an ester. Wait, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5? No, wait, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. So the substituent is a phenyl ester? Or wait, no, the structure is attached to the benzene is a COOEt group. So the substituent is O-CO-OEt? Or maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, wait: C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 would be benzoyl ester, but perhaps the group is -COOEt. Wait, wait, the substituent is attached to the benzene as a carbonyl group. So, maybe it's a phenyl ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzoyloxy group. Wait, I think I need to get the structure right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of substituents as the group attached to the benzene. So for each:

1) Methyl (CH3)
2) COOEt (ester group)
3) Cl (chlorine)
4) NO2 (nitro group)
5) C2H5 (ethyl)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

Wait, but the substituents can't all be just -COOEt. Let me re-express each:

1) C6H5-CH3: So benzene with a methyl group (CH3)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: Benzene with a COOEt group. So substituent is COOEt (ester)
3) C6H5-Cl: Benzene with Cl
4) C6H5-NO2: Benzene with nitro group
5) C6H5-CH2CH3: Benzene with ethyl group
6) C6H5-COOH: Benzene with COOH group (carboxylic acid)

Ok, so each substituent is different.

Now, each substituent's activating or deactivating and their directing.

1) CH3: activating, ortho/para director. So para is a possible site. Since it's an activating group, substitution occurs more easily, and para is a major site.

2) COOEt: That's an ester group. Ester is a deactivating group because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl. But wait, the substituent is actually O-CO-OEt? No, wait, COOEt is attached as a substituent. Wait, the group is -COOEt. So the substituent is an ester, which is deactivating (since the carbonyl pulls electrons away from the ring) and meta-directing. Because it's a strong deactivating group, the ring is less reactive, and the incoming electrophile tends to add in the meta position relative to the substituent. So for substitution, the para isomer would be less favored here because the substituent is meta directing.

Wait, but wait. Ester groups are ortho/para directing or meta? Hmm, this is where I might get confused. Wait, ester groups are typically meta directors because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So the substituent is deactivating and meta-directing. So when bromine is added, the major product would be meta, not para. So the para yield would be lower.

3) Cl: Chlorine is a substituent. It is a deactivating group (since it's more electronegative and has an -I effect) but is ortho/para directing. Wait, wait. Because Cl has lone pairs, it can donate electrons through resonance, making it an ortho/para director, but it's deactivating overall. So Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So, substitution occurs at ortho and para positions, but the ring is less reactive than benzene. So the para is possible, but because it's deactivating, the reaction is slower. But compared to other substituents, the para product here would be a significant fraction.

4) NO2: Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So it directs substitution to the meta position. So the para isomer would have a low yield, probably the lowest among all except maybe others that are meta directors.

5) C2H5 (ethyl group): Ethyl is an activating, ortho/para director. So substitution occurs at ortho and para. Since ethyl is an activating group, the para product is a major fraction. But compared to methyl, ethyl is a larger substituent. Wait, does that affect the para product? For example, bulky substituents may favor the para position more because ortho is hindered. So if the substituent is bulky, like a large group, the ortho attack is more difficult, so para has a higher yield.

6) COOH: Carboxylic acid group. COOH is a strong deactivating group, being highly electron-withdrawing. It's a meta-directing group. So substitution occurs mainly at meta positions, so para isomer would have low yield.

So, now, compiling the substituents and the effect on para isomer:

Substituent | Type (activating or deactivating) | Directing | Para yield
--- | --- | --- | ---
1) CH3 | Activating | Ortho/para | High (since activating, and para is favored over ortho due to steric)
2) COOEt | Deactivating | Meta | Low (para is not favored)
3) Cl | Deactivating | Ortho/para | Moderate (since substituent is ortho/para but deactivating)
4) NO2 | Deactivating | Meta | Very low (para not favored)
5) C2H5 | Activating | Ortho/para | High (activating and bulky, so para might be even higher than methyl)
6) COOH | Deactivating | Meta | Very low (para not favored)

Wait, but I'm mixing up the activating/deactivating and the directing effects. Let me think again.

For each substituent:

1) Methyl (CH3): Activating (electron-donating), ortho/para director. So the para product is major.

2) COOEt: Deactivating (electron-withdrawing), meta director. So para product is not formed much.

3) Cl: Deactivating (weakly) but ortho/para director. So para product is possible but lower than in activating groups.

4) NO2: Strong deactivating, meta director. So para is not formed; meta is main product. So para fraction is very low.

5) Ethyl (CH2CH3): Activating, ortho/para director. But being a bulkier group, the para product is more favored than ortho, so higher para yield. Compared to methyl, perhaps higher.

6) COOH: Strong deactivating, meta director. Para product is minimal.

So, the order of para yield (from lowest to highest) would be based on substituent effects.
