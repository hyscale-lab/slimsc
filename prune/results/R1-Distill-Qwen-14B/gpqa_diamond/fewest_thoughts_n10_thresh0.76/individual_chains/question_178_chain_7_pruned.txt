Okay, so I've got this question about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I remember from my QFT class that the mass dimension of coupling constants tells us a lot about whether a theory is renormalizable. Let me think through this step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

First, I should figure out the dimensions of each field and term in the Lagrangian. Remember, in natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the mass dimension of a quantity tells us how it scales with energy.

The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless in four spacetime dimensions. So each term in the Lagrangian should have dimension 4.

Looking at the term: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let's break down each component.

1. ψ is a spinor field. Each ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D, the Dirac equation is (iγ^μ ∂_μ - m)ψ = 0. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1 (since it's d/dx^μ, and x has dimension -1). The mass term mψ must have dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3, but I think I'm mixing terms here. Wait, the Lagrangian has dimension 4, so each term inside it must have dimension 4.

Wait, each field's dimension. Fermion fields ψ have dimension (4-1)/2 = 3/2 because for a Lagrangian term like ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, each derivative is dim 1. So ψ has dim 3/2.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor of electromagnetism or similar. F is derived from the gauge field A. The gauge field A has dimension 1 (since [∂μ] = 1 and A appears in ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so A must have dimension 1). The field strength F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so F has dimension 2 (since each ∂ adds 1 to the dimension of A).

So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Now, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu], which is antisymmetric. It's a product of two gamma matrices, but I think for the purpose of dimension, it's treated as a Lorentz tensor. Wait, but for the dimension calculation, the structure σ_{μν} is part of the operator acting on the spinors. So when considering the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ, each ψ is 3/2 dimensions, so together they contribute 3 dimensions. What about σ_{mu nu}? Since it's a tensor, it's dimensionless? Because gamma matrices are dimensionless. So σ_{mu nu} is like [gamma matrices]^2, so it's dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3.

So the term in the Lagrangian is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F. So (ψ̄ σ ψ) has dimension 3, F has dimension 2. So the product is 3+2=5. Wait, but the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the term κ (σ ψ ψ) F must have dimension 4. So the dimensions would be [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] +5 =4. So [κ] = -1?

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate. The entire term is κ ψ
