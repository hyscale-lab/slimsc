Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the steps.

Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the integration tells us about the number of H's. The triplet and quartet suggest splitting due to neighboring H's. 

So, triplet at 0.9 ppm—0.9 is typically around where CH3 groups appear, especially in something like an ethyl group. Wait, two CH3 groups? Because 6H divided by a triplet—like maybe two equivalent CH3 groups. The quartet at 1.3 ppm—4H, which might be a CH2 group next to another CH2. Like an ethyl group adjacent to another ethyl? Or maybe a butyl group? Wait, no, because 4H as a quartet. Oh, wait, a quartet usually comes from coupling with a triplet, so maybe two adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe it's something like a diethyl ether structure. Because diethyl ether has two CH2CH3 groups. Let me think: each CH3 would be a triplet because they're next to a CH2. The CH2 would be a quartet because they're next to another CH2. Wait, no, the structure is OCH2CH3 on both sides. So each OCH2 would split into a quartet, and the CH3 would be a triplet. So the NMR for diethyl ether would have two triplets, but wait, the question says two signals. Oh, wait, diethyl ether is symmetric, so the two CH3 groups are equivalent, so only one triplet for 6H (since 3H each, two of them: 6H total). And the CH2 groups are equivalent too, so their quartet would be for 4H (each CH2 has 2H, two of them: 4H total). That fits the description of compound A.

So, compound A is diethyl ether, OCH2CH3. Then it undergoes monobromination to form compound B. Monobromination of diethyl ether—how does that happen? Ether can undergo bromination in the presence of a catalyst, but more likely, maybe it's a substitution. Wait, diethyl ether
