Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions usually involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. Enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to produce one mole of water. But wait, the problem gives me three solutions, which is a bit confusing. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out which of these are acids and which are bases. HCl and H2SO4 are acids, right? HCl is a strong acid, and H2SO4 is a strong acid as well. Ba(OH)2 is a base because it's a hydroxide. So the reaction will be between these acids and the base.

Wait, but mixing three solutions together. Hmm. So all the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base. But I also need to consider the stoichiometry because H2SO4 is diprotic. Oh right, each H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions, so that's important.

So the plan is to find out the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base, then see which one is in excess. The limiting reagent will determine how much water is formed, and hence the enthalpy change.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate the moles of each solution:

1. HCl: Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL (which is 0.5 L). Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so 0.1 moles H+.

2. H2SO4: Molarity 0.3 M, volume 300 mL (0.3 L). Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

3. Ba(OH)2: Molarity 0.5 M, volume 200 mL (0.2 L). Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 =
