Okay, so I've got this question here about the color of light absorbed by a textile dye. The question says the dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons and emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

Hmm, I remember that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. Like how neon signs glow different colors based on the gas inside. Oh wait, that's fluorescence or something like that. So the dye absorbs some energy and then emits light at a lower energy, right?

Wait, no, wait. I think the energy of the absorbed photon has to be higher than the emitted one. Because when the molecule gets excited, it loses some energy when it relaxes back to the ground state. So if it emits at 2.3393 eV, the absorbed energy must be higher than that. But how does that relate to the color?

Colors are related to the wavelength of light. I remember the visible spectrum is about 400-700 nm. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. So higher energy means shorter wavelength. Violet is at the lower end (~400 nm), red at the higher end (~700 nm).

Wait, the energy given is 2.3393 eV for the emitted light. So that's the energy of the emitted photon. The absorbed energy should be higher because it's the energy difference between the ground and excited states.
