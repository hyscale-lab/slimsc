Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, the observed brightness changes, which looks similar to an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

The question is asking: To produce the same amplitude in the brightness variation (light curve) as these spots would, what would be the radius of an exoplanet relative to the star's radius? The options are A to D, with values like 0.39, 0.07, etc.

Hmm. So I think I need to compare the brightness dip caused by the spots and the dip caused by an exoplanet transit.

First, let's understand the situation. When a star has spots, as it rotates, the spots come into and out of view. The spots are cooler, so when a spot is on the side facing us, the brightness decreases because that part is darker.

The star's radius is Rstar, same as the Sun, so about 7e5 km or 1.0 solar radii. But maybe I don't need the exact value because everything is relative.

The problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty. Wait, so perhaps the spots are on one side of the star, so when the star rotates, that side comes into view and then goes away. So the brightness variation is due to spots moving in and out of the observed hemisphere.

But the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. So the variation caused by the spots should be compared to the variation caused by a planet transiting in front of the star.

I remember that the change in brightness (the dip) during a transit is given by (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

So for the planet case, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But in the star spot case, it's a bit different. The spots cover part of the star's surface. The brightness is proportional to the area of the spots times their temperature relative to the star. Wait, no. The flux from the spots is less, so when the spots are visible, the total flux decreases.

The star emits flux F = σTeff^4 * surface area. But when spots are present, their flux is σ(Teff - delta T)^4 times the area of the spots.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the fractional change in brightness when the spots are visible.

So the star's total flux without spots is F0 = σTeff^4 * 4πRstar^2. But wait, actually, for a star, the total luminosity is 4πR^2 * σT^4. But when computing the brightness variation, we can think in terms of the area of the spots and their temperature relative to the rest of the star.

The filling factor is 20%, so the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere. Wait, because the problem says one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * 2π Rstar^2, because a hemisphere is 2π R².

Wait, the area of a sphere is 4π R². So a hemisphere is 2π R². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Each spot has a temperature that's 1000K less. Hmm, but wait, the effective temperature of the star is 6000K, so the spots are at 5000K?
