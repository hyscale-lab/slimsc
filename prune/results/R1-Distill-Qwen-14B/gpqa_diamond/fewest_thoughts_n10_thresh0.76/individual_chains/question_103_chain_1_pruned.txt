Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize what's going on. The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. Nitro group at 5, bromine at 3, and then a ketone group (ethan-1-one) attached at the 1 position. Wait, no, wait... wait, ethan-1-one is (CH2)CO. Oh, wait, wait. The structure is a benzene ring connected to a ketone group. So, the benzene is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So, the benzene is at position 1, but wait, I'm a bit confused about the numbering.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the ethanone part is (CH2) attached to the benzene. So, the benzene has substituents at positions 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro), and the ketone is attached at position 1. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: Br at 3, NO2 at 5, and the acetyl group (O=C-CH3) at position 1. Wait, wait, no, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-. So, if it's 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, the structure is benzene with substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5. But wait, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So, positions 1,3,5 would be alternate positions. So, when you have substituents at 1,3,5, they are at meta positions to each other. Wait, no, 1,3,5 are all adjacent in a way that each is two carbons away. So, that would make them meta positions relative to each
