Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are between C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2. Hmm.

First, I remember that the compound has an ester group because the FTIR shows absorption peaks for it. Ester groups typically have strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the formula must include an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Two are aromatic-Hs. So the aromatic ring is di-substituted, and the substituents are such that there are two different types of aromatic protons. That suggests the substituents might be in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two sets. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, but that would give a different splitting. Wait, no—if it's di-substituted, like para, then the aromatic protons might be equivalent, but that would give one signal. Oh wait, di-substituted could be ortho, meta, or para. Wait, but the aromatic signals are two, so maybe two different types of protons.

Wait, the aromatic ring would have two substituents. Let's suppose it's a para-substituted ring. Then the substituents are across from each other. So the ring may have two equivalent protons, giving one signal. But in the NMR, there are two signals for aromatic Hs. So perhaps the substituents are such that the ring isn't symmetric. Like if the substituents are in the ortho positions, but that would lead to maybe a different splitting. Hmm, maybe the substituents are meta, but that would lead to two sets of equivalent protons. Wait, if the substituents are meta, then the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Oh, but wait, the di-substituted ring could have substituents in positions that cause the aromatic Hs to split into two signals. So maybe two different substituents, but I'm not sure
