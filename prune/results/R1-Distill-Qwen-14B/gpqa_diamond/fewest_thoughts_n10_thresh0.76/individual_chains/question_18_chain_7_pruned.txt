Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars compared to each other. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me some data about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I'm not sure if that matters for this particular question. The problem is about elemental abundances, so maybe mass isn't directly relevant here. I'll keep that in mind in case it comes up later.

The elemental abundances given are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, which means that the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is higher than in the Sun by 0.3 dex. Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2. Then, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex, so the iron abundance relative to hydrogen in Star_1 is the same as the Sun. Same with [Mg/H]_2 = 0, meaning magnesium abundance is solar in Star_2.

Wait, but the Sun's photosphere has known compositions. The problem states that for the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Hmm, let's parse that.

So, the formula given is 12 + log10(nX/nH) = some number. So for the Sun, nFe/nH is 10^(7.5 -12) = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, nMg/nH is 10^(7 -12) = 10^(-5). So the solar abundance ratios are Fe/H = 1e-4.5 and Mg/H = 1e-5.

But wait, the [X/H] notation is usually log10(nX/nH) relative to the Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, meaning nFe/nH is the same as the Sun. So in Star_1, nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, in Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so nMg/nH is the same as the Sun: 1e-5.

Now, the problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So we need to find (nSi_1 / nSi_2).

Wait, but how?

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So [Si/Fe] is log10(nSi/nFe) - log10(nSi/nFe)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 means nSi_1 / nFe_1 = 10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun /
