Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So, there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They have a super fast spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 Earth years. They want to come to Earth. The question is about how long the journey would take from the astronaut's perspective. The astronaut is 22 years old when they leave.

Wait, wait. The options are about the time experienced by the astronaut, right? Because it's asking from their point of view. So this is a time dilation problem in special relativity.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when you're moving at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. The moving clock (the astronaut's) ticks slower from the perspective of a stationary observer. But wait, from the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth is contracted, so the trip takes less time.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this mixed up. So, from the astronaut's frame of reference (their spacecraft), Earth is moving towards them at a high speed. So the distance between Earth and their starting point is contracted. So the time they experience is shorter.

But wait, the problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c. That's super close to the speed of light. So the time experienced would be less than what an Earth
