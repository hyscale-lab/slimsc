Okay, so I have this question about the Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the renormalizability depends on the dimensions of the coupling constants. Let me think step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_mu, γ_nu]. Right, because the commutator of gamma matrices gives the antisymmetric tensor, which is related to the sigma matrices used in some interactions, like in the case of spinor fields.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. I remember that in 4-dimensional spacetime (which is standard for these kinds of theories), each field has a specific mass dimension. Let me recall: the fields ψ (fermions) have mass dimension 3/2, because the action is dimensionless, and the Lagrangian density has dimension 4. So each fermion field contributes 3/2, but wait, ψ̄ is the adjoint, which has the same dimension as ψ, right? So ψ̄ ψ would be 3/2 * 2 =3. Then, what about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor, which for a gauge field like electromagnetism is the derivative of the gauge field plus a term. The gauge field A_mu has mass dimension 1, because the covariant derivative is ∂_mu + i e A_mu, and ∂_mu has dimension 1. The field strength F_{mu nu} is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, so F has dimension 2 (since each derivative is dimension 1 and A is dimension 1, so 1+1=2).

Now, the sigma tensor σ_{mu nu} is made from the gamma matrices. Since each gamma matrix is dimensionless (they are just matrices, not operators), the commutator [γ_mu, γ_nu] is also dimensionless. So σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless as well.

Putting it all together, the Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}. Let's compute the dimensions of each part. So ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ has 3/2, σ is dimensionless, F has dimension 2. So ψ̄ σ ψ F would be (3/2 +3/2) + 2 = 3 +2=5.

But the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 (since the integral in the action is dimensionless, and the Lagrangian density has dimensions of [mass]^4 in 4D spacetime). So the term L_int has dimension 4. Therefore, κ must adjust the dimension so that overall it's 4.

So let me compute the dimensions of each component in the term: ψ̄ (3/2), σ (0), ψ (3/2), F (2). Summing these gives 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 =5. So the whole term is κ times something of dimension 5, and the term must have dimension 4. So 5 + [κ] =4 → [κ]=-1.

Wait, no, wait. Because the term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ F). The product ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2 +3/2) =3, and F is 2, so total 3+2=5. So the whole term has dimension [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]= -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1. So looking at the options, the first part of the answer is either A or C.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥0. Because in renormalizable theories, the interactions are "local" and the divergences can be absorbed into a finite number of counterterms. If a coupling has negative mass dimension, the interaction term is non-renormalizable, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Here, [κ]_M is -1, which is negative. So the theory is not renormalizable. So the two parts are [κ]=-1 and theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options, option C says [κ]=-1 and theory not renormalizable. Option A says [κ]=-1 and theory renormalizable. So the correct answer is C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2} [\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \).

### Step 1: Mass dimension of \( \kappa \)
In 4-dimensional spacetime, the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 to ensure the action is dimensionless. The fields involved are:
- \( \bar{\psi} \) and \( \psi \): Fermion fields with mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \).
- \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \): A commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, so \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is dimensionless.
- \( F^{\mu\nu} \): The field strength tensor, with mass dimension 2 (as it is derived from derivatives of the gauge field, which has dimension 1).

The term \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) has the following dimensions:
- \( \bar{\psi} \psi \): \( \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3 \),
- \( F^{\mu\nu} \): 2,
- Total dimension of \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \): \( 3 + 2 = 5 \).

Since the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have mass dimension \( \geq 0 \). Here, \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), which is negative. This indicates that the interaction term is non-renormalizable, as divergences cannot be absorbed into a finite number of counterterms.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable.
