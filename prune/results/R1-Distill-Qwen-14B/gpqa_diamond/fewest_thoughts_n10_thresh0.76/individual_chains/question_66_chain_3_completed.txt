Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible interactions that can be constructed with the Standard Model fields, respecting certain symmetries. But wait, which symmetries exactly?

The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The options are combinations of these, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let me think about each symmetry. 

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think in SMEFT, all operators are Lorentz invariant. Because the Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, the effective theory should also respect that symmetry. So operators in SMEFT should be constructed to maintain Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like translational invariance). Wait, but SMEFT is a field theory, so it must respect Poincare symmetry. Because without that, you can't have a consistent field theory. So operators in SMEFT must be Poincare invariant. So point 2 is correct.

Wait, but wait. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes the Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if 2 is correct, then 1 must also be correct. Because Poincare implies Lorentz symmetry. So if the question is about which must be respected, then if 2 is correct, 1 is automatically correct. But I'm not sure if all SMEFT operators respect Poincare symmetry. Or maybe I got it wrong. Wait, no, the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So yes, 1 and 2 must be correct.

Wait, but wait, Poincare includes things like momentum conservation via translation symmetry. But SMEFT is a theory that applies everywhere, so I think all operators must be Poincare invariant. So points 1 and 2 are both required.

Now, looking at options, the options that include both 1 and 2 are A and C. Because option A is 1,2. Option C is 1,2,4.

Now, for the other symmetries. CP symmetry and CPT.

I think the Standard Model is CP symmetric, but not necessarily CPT. Wait no, the Standard Model is CPT symmetric because of the way it's constructed. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. So, the Standard Model is CPT symmetric because all interactions are CPT invariant. But does that mean that SMEFT must respect these symmetries?

Wait, SMEFT includes all possible operators that are Lorentz invariant. So can operators violate CP or CPT?

Wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the original Standard Model respects a symmetry, does SMEFT have to as well?

Wait, the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, but it can include higher-dimensional operators that may violate certain symmetries. So if the Standard Model has a symmetry, like CP, then the SMEFT operators must also respect that symmetry because they are constructed from the same fields and interactions.

Wait, but no. The SMEFT includes all possible operators that are compatible with the symmetries of the Standard Model. So if the Standard Model has a symmetry, SMEFT's operators must respect that. For example, the Standard Model is invariant under CPT, so SMEFT operators must also respect CPT. Because if they don't, then the theory would violate that symmetry.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the Standard Model is known to have CPT symmetry because all particle-antiparticle pairs are included, but does that mean that SMEFT must respect CPT? Or can some operators in SMEFT break CPT? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible operators allowed by the Standard Model's symmetries. So if the Standard Model has a symmetry, then the SMEFT operators must respect that symmetry. So for example, if the Standard Model is CP-symmetric, then the SMEFT operators can't have CP-violating terms unless they are higher-order.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because, for example, the SM is CP-symmetric except for some terms. Wait, no, the Standard Model doesn't have a CP symmetry. Wait, wait, no. The Standard Model includes CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. Oh right, the SM includes CP violation. So SM is not CP symmetric. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP. Therefore, SMEFT does not need to respect CP symmetry because the SM itself doesn't. So point 3 is incorrect.

Wait, but what about CPT? The SM is CPT-symmetric. Because all interactions in the SM are CPT invariant. So the SMEFT must include only operators that are CPT invariant. Because the SM is CPT-symmetric, the effective theory must also preserve it. So point 4, CPT symmetry, must be respected.

So putting it all together.

Symmetry 1 (Lorentz): Must be respected.
Symmetry 2 (Poincare): Must be respected because field theories require Poincare symmetry, including translations.
Symmetry 3 (CP): Not necessarily, because SM already has CP violation, so SMEFT can include operators that violate CP.
Symmetry 4 (CPT): Must be respected, because SM is CPT-symmetric, and SMEFT includes operators compatible with SM symmetries.

So the required symmetries are 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option C says 1,2,4.

Let me check the options:

A) 1,2 → includes 1 and 2.

B)3,4 → no, because 3 is not required.

C)1,2,4 → yes, this is what I concluded.

D)1,3,4 → no, because 3 is not required.

So the correct answer is option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a low-energy effective theory that includes all possible operators constructed from Standard Model (SM) fields, respecting the SM's symmetries. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Here's the analysis of the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory because the Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant. All operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translational invariance. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry. Therefore, this symmetry is also required.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model already includes CP-violating terms (e.g., in the CKM matrix). Since SMEFT includes all possible operators compatible with the SM, it does not need to strictly respect CP symmetry. Operators in SMEFT can violate CP symmetry, so this symmetry is not required.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model is CPT-symmetric, and SMEFT operators must respect this symmetry because they are constructed from the same fields and interactions as the SM. Therefore, CPT symmetry is required.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Among the given options, the correct choice is **C) 1, 2, 4**.

Answer: C
