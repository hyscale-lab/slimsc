Alright, so I have this question about redshift and detecting objects using optical telescopes. Hmm, let me try to break it down. Okay, the question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission or absorption line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Oh right, hydrogen's Lyman series. Lyman alpha is the transition from n=2 to n=1, and its rest wavelength is about 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms. So the quasar emits this light, and the hydrogen clouds absorb it.

Now, the quasar's light is absorbed, so the absorption line would be at a longer wavelength if the cloud is moving away (due to redshift). The observed wavelength lambda_obs is related to the rest wavelength lambda_rest by the redshift z: lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z).

But wait, if the cloud is at a high redshift, the absorbed light (Lyman alpha) might shift into the optical range. Because if the cloud is redshifted, the wavelength of the absorbed light becomes longer, so it moves from UV into visible (optical) range, which can be observed by ground-based telescopes.

So for this absorption to be in the optical range, the observed wavelength must be less than around 900 nm or so, because beyond that, it's infrared and optical telescopes can't see it effectively. Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think. The cutoff for optical might be around 400 nm (violet) or maybe higher? Or perhaps it's about whether the wavelength is in the observed range that the telescope can capture. Wait, ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths much below about 300 nm because the atmosphere absorbs a lot of UV. So the observed wavelength has to be in the optical range, which is roughly 400 nm to around 700 or 1000 nm, depending on the telescope. But wait, actually, optical telescopes can now go down to about 300 nm in some cases, but if the cloud is so far that the Lyman alpha line is in the optical, then it's observable.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms (0.1216 microns or 121.6 nm). If a cloud is at redshift z, the absorbed wavelength would be 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. We need this to be in the optical range for ground-based telescopes to detect it. But optical is visible light, which is about 400-700 nm, but some telescopes can go a bit further into near-infrared, say up to 1000 nm or so. So, if the observed wavelength is longer than 400 nm, it's in the visible
