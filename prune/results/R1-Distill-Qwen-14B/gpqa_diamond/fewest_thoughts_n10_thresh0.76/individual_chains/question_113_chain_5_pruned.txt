Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes an unknown compound that has been analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My goal is to figure out its chemical formula from the given data and the options provided.

Let's break down each analysis:

1. **FTIR Spectrum:**
   - A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around this region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but a very broad peak might suggest hydrogen bonding, maybe like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol? Or could it be an amine? No, the options don't have N, so probably O-H.

   - Two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm. The 1700 is a strong peak, which is typical for carbonyl groups (C=O). But wait, 1650 is a bit lower. I think that could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, maybe an aromatic carbonyl? Or maybe an ester or something else. Wait, esters usually have a carbonyl around 1730-1750? So 1700 might be a ketone or an aldehyde, but then why 1650? Or maybe it's an conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic compound. Alternatively, 1650 could be a C=C stretching. 

2. **1H NMR Spectrum:**
   - Several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, probably.

3. **Mass Spectrometry:**
   - A fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what this could be. Common fragments: 45 could be a CH3CO+ ion (since CH3CO has a molecular weight of 45: 12+1+12+16=45?), wait, wait, CH3CO is (12*2)+(1*3)+(16)
