Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about an electron and a positron annihilating into photons. Hmm, let me think through this.

Alright, the setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are one upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, let me get the facts straight. Both particles are moving along the same horizontal line, but opposite directions. Electron from left, positron from right. Lorentz factors are 4 and 2 respectively.

So, when they annihilate, they produce two photons. Each photon has the same energy. Also, their directions are both towards the right but one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So the angle between the two photons would depend on their angles relative to the horizontal, I suppose.

I remember that in annihilation processes, especially for an electron and positron, conservation laws are crucial. So, conservation of energy and momentum must apply here.

Let me recall, the rest mass of an electron and positron is the same, so their rest masses are equal. Their kinetic energies are determined by their Lorentz factors.

Wait, Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So gamma is greater than 1. The electron has gamma 4, so higher than the positron's gamma 2.

Hmm, but wait, both are moving towards each other. So the electron's velocity is to the right (since moving from left), and the positron's velocity is to the left (since moving from right). But wait, no—wait, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So, if the electron is moving from left to right, and the positron is moving from right to left, their velocities are opposite.

Wait, the problem says both are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left, which I'll assume is positive x-direction. The positron is moving from the right, which would be the negative x-direction. Or is it? Wait, perhaps I should clarify the directions.

Wait, the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from left. So, in the
