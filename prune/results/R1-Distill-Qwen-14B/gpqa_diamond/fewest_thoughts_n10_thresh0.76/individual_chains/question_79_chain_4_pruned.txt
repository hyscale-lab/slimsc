Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and think about what each part means.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction and the NMR data of the product. The reaction involves using 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, I remember that this reagent is often used in the formation of epoxides, specifically in the Prilezhaev epoxidation. Oh wait, no, Prilezhaev uses other conditions. Wait, maybe it's more for opening epoxides? Or maybe it's a base used in some kind of ring-opening? Or perhaps I'm getting confused with other reagents. Alternatively, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is also known as DABCO. Oh right! DABCO is a catalyst used in the epoxidation of alkenes using peracids. Wait, no, that's another catalyst. Alternatively, DABCO is sometimes used in the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a base. Hmm. I might need to think about this a bit more.

So, the product's NMR data is given. Let's look at the 1H NMR first.

The 1H NMR shows signals at:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

And the 13C NMR has signals at:
21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

Wait, the 13C has a peak at 197.7. That's a high shift. I remember that carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, amides) typically have carbons around that area. But wait, if the product is an epoxide, that might not have a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or something else. Or perhaps I'm wrong. Wait, epoxides are ethers, so the carbons in the epoxide rings are typically around 60-70 ppm, I think. So a 197.7 peak must be something else. Maybe a carbonyl, like an ester or a ketone? Hmm, but the starting material is compound X, which reacts under these conditions.

Wait, the reaction is with DABCO. Let me think about what DABCO does. I remember that DABCO is often used in the epoxidation reaction, but no, wait, epoxidation usually uses peracids. Alternatively, DABCO might be a base in a ring-opening of an epoxide. Alternatively, wait, maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening. Or perhaps it's a base-induced opening. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a diels-alder? No, probably not. Let me think: the molecule X is being reacted in DABCO in a nonpolar solvent at high temperature. Wait, what's the structure of X? The formula is C11H12O. So, X is an organic compound with 11 carbons, 12 hydrogens, and one oxygen.
