Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says: There's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system.

Hmm, right. So, first, I remember that the potential energy in a system of charges can be calculated using the formula for electric potential energy between point charges. The formula is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

Wait, but since there are multiple charges, I think the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But wait, when you have multiple charges, you have to consider each pair once. The formula for the total potential energy U of a system of N charges is the sum over all pairs of (k q_i q_j) / r_ij, but since all the charges are identical and arranged symmetrically here, maybe there's a simpler way.

So, let's see. The setup: 13 charges, each 2e. The 13th is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 m away from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from P, and their positions are fixed at that radius. So the 13th charge is at the center, and the others are on a sphere of radius 2 m.

Wait, but each of the 12 charges is a point charge at 2 m from P. So from the perspective of the 13th charge, which is at P, each of the 12 charges is 2m away. So the potential energy from the 13th charge with each of the 12 would be U13 = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m), but wait, no. Wait, no, the 13th is fixed, so maybe we don't consider it moving, but when calculating the potential energy of the system, each pair contributes
