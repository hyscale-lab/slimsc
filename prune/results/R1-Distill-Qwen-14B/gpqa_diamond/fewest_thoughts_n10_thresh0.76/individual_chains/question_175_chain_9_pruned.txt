Okay, so I've got this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they can emit electromagnetic radiation. The question mentions a spheroidal charge distribution, which is symmetric along the z-axis. Since it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. 

The problem asks about the power radiated at a specific angle θ=30 degrees and the form of the function f, which depends on λ and θ. The maximum power is A, and we're to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees and the form of f.

Wait, I think radiation from oscillating dipoles is described by the dipole radiation formula. The power radiated by a dipole is given by the Larmor formula, which is P = ( ( (e² a² ) / (6πε₀ c³) ) * something involving the angle, I guess. Oh right, the radiation pattern for a dipole is sin²θ, where θ is the angle from the dipole's axis. 

Wait, so the directional radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) for a dipole is proportional to sin²θ. So the maximum power occurs when sinθ is maximum, which is at θ=90 degrees, so sin(90) =1. So the maximum power A is when θ is 90 degrees. But wait, the problem says the maximum power is A. Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. So f(θ) would be proportional to sin²θ. 

But wait, the question says the maximum power is A. So when is the power maximum? For a dipole, the maximum is at θ=90 degrees. So if we're to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, I need to calculate f(30)/A. 

So f(θ) is proportional to sin²θ. So f(30) is sin²(30) times the maximum, which is sin²(90)=1. Sin(30) is 0.5, so sin² is 0.25. So A is the maximum, which occurs at θ=90, so f(90)=A. Therefore
