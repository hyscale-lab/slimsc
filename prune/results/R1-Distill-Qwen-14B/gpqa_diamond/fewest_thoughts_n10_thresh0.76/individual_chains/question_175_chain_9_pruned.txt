Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The question is about the power radiated in different directions and how it depends on wavelength and angle.

The setup is an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. So the charge distribution is symmetric around the z-axis, which probably means the radiation pattern isn't isotropic; it might have some angular dependence.

The problem says the maximum power is A, and we need to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the form of the function f, which is the power per unit solid angle as a function of lambda and theta.

Hmm, I think I need to recall the radiation pattern of a dipole antenna because oscillating charges in a dipole configuration are a common example. Oh wait, but even more generally, for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern is known. The power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle theta from the dipole's axis.

Wait, the dipole radiation pattern is maximum at the equator (theta=90 degrees) and falls off towards the poles (theta=0 and 180 degrees). The radiation pattern for an oscillating dipole has a sin^2(theta) dependence. Because the power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2(theta) times some function of the wavelength or frequency.

Wait, but wait, the power radiated in a particular direction also depends on the frequency or the wavelength. Let me think. The radiated power depends on the square of the acceleration of the charges, but for a dipole, the power emitted is proportional to (k^2) * (dipole moment)^2, where k is the wave number. Oh, but wait, the power per unit solid angle (like the radiation intensity) for a dipole is given by I = ( (μ0 * (k^4) * (p0^2) ) / (12π) ) * sin^2(theta), where p0 is the dipole moment amplitude, and k is 2π/lambda.

Wait, let's get this right. The expression for the intensity (power per unit area) in the far field (radiation zone) for a dipole is I = ( (k^2 * |p|^2 ) / (12π) ) * sin^2(theta). But p is the dip
