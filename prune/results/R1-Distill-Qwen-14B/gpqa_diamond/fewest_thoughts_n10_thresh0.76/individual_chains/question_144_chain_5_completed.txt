Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay, and I need to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like distance = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the proper lifetime, and β is the velocity over the speed of light.

Wait, but how do I find τ? Oh, I think the mean lifetime τ is connected to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Oh wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, converting Γ from MeV to GeV, since Γ is 320 MeV, that's 0.32 GeV.

So τ would be ħ divided by Γ. Let me plug in the numbers: τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, that's a tiny time.

But wait, the particle is moving, so I need to find its velocity. For that, I should find the momentum and then the velocity. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, but E is the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass and kinetic energy. Oh, but wait, for a relativistic particle, the total energy E = γ m c², and the momentum p = γ m v. Alternatively, since I have E and m, I can find the velocity.

Alternatively, I can use the relation between energy, mass, and momentum. The energy squared is the sum of the momentum squared times c^4 plus the mass squared times c^4. So, E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. Let's solve for p.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². Wait, but when using units where c=1, so E and m are in GeV and GeV/c² respectively. Oh, let me make sure about the units. So, E² = p² c² + m² c^4. Therefore, p² c² = E² - m² c^4. So, p² = (E² - m² c^4) / c².

But perhaps it's easier to compute the velocity β as v/c. Since E = γ m c², and p = γ m v. Another relation is that E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). Alternatively, the velocity can be found using β = p c / E. So, once I find p, I can get β.

Alternatively, maybe using relativistic expressions for β. Let me think. The total energy E = γ m c², where γ is 1/sqrt(1 - β²). The momentum p = γ m v = γ m β c. So, p = (γ m c β ). So, combining with E, p = (E / c²) * β.

Wait, another approach: β can be found using the energy and mass. Let me write E in terms of m and β.

E = m c² / sqrt(1 - β²). So, E² = m² c^4 / (1 - β²). Rearranging, 1 - β² = m² c^4 / E². So, β² = 1 - (m c² / E)^2. Since E is 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV/c². Wait, but when c=1 in these units, m c² is m (GeV), so m c² = 1.2 GeV. So, m c² is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV. So, (m c² / E)^2 = (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So, β² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking the square root, β ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Hmm, that's pretty close to the speed of light.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 1.2 divided by 8 is 0.15. Squared is 0.0225. So yes, 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887 c.

Now, knowing β, I can compute the lifetime as τ = ħ / Γ. Wait, the proper lifetime τ is given by ħ/(Γ). Then, the lab frame lifetime is τ' = γ τ. Because time dilation occurs. So I need to compute γ.

γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt( (m^2 c^4) / E^2 ) ) = E/(m c^2) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So γ is approximately 6.6667.

Wait, that makes sense since E = γ m c², so γ = E / (m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So, γ is 6.6667.

So, the lab frame lifetime is τ' = γ τ = (6.6667) * (2.056875e-24 s) ≈ let's compute that. 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = approximately 1.371e-23 seconds.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.056875e-24 * (20/3) ≈ (20/3)*2.056875e-24 = (approx) 13.7125e-24 s? Wait, no, 2.056875e-24 * 20/3 is (2.056875 * 20/3) e-24 = (41.1375 /3) e-24 ≈ 13.7125e-24 s. So τ' ≈ 1.37125e-23 seconds.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in computing gamma. Because gamma is 8/(1.2) which is 6.666..., correct. So 6.6667 multiplied by 2.056875e-24 is indeed approximately 1.371e-23 seconds.

Now, the decay distance is c * τ'. Because the particle is moving at velocity v = β c, so the distance it travels before decaying is v * τ' = β c * τ'.

Wait, no, in the lab frame, the lifetime is τ' = γ τ. So, the decay length is velocity (v) multiplied by the lifetime τ', but wait, wait, the proper lifetime is τ, and the lab lifetime is longer by gamma. So the decay occurs when the particle's lifetime in the lab frame has passed.

Wait, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer, so the time is τ' = gamma * tau. So the distance is v * tau' = beta c * gamma tau.

Alternatively, another way to compute the decay length is L = c * gamma * beta * tau, with tau = hbar / Gamma.

But let me make sure. The mean proper lifetime is tau = hbar / Gamma. So the lab lifetime is gamma * tau. So L = beta c * gamma tau.

So putting it all together: L = beta * c * gamma * (hbar / Gamma).

But wait, let me make sure about the formula. L is the mean decay length, which is the velocity times the lifetime in the lab frame. So, yes: L = v * t_lab = beta c * gamma tau.

So, L = beta * c * gamma * (hbar / Gamma).

Now, let me compute each part step by step.

Given:

- E_X = 8 GeV

- m_X = 1.2 GeV

- Gamma_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV

Compute:

1. Compute beta:

beta = sqrt(1 - (m c² / E)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1.2 /8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225 ) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

2. Compute gamma: gamma = E / (m c²) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

3. Compute tau: tau = hbar / Gamma_X. Planck's constant hbar is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So tau = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

4. Compute gamma * tau: 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈1.37125e-23 seconds.

5. Compute L = beta * c * gamma tau.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So, beta * c = 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by gamma tau: 2.966e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = let's compute that.

2.966e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (2.966 * 1.37125) e (8 -23) = (approx 4.0655) e-15 meters.

So, 4.0655e-15 meters.

Wait, but let me compute 2.966 multiplied by 1.37125 more accurately.

2.966 * 1.37125 = ?

Hmm, 3 *1.37125 is 4.11375. But 2.966 is 0.034 less than 3. So subtract 0.034 * 1.37125 from 4.11375.

0.034 *1.37125 ≈ 0.0466225. So 4.11375 - 0.0466225 = 4.0671275.

So approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 5.0223 ×1e-16

Option B)4.0655e-15

Option C)5.0223e-15

Option D)4.0655e-16

So the calculation gives approximately 4.067e-15 m, which matches option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but let me double-check the numbers. Did I make any miscalculations?

Alternative approach: Let me compute all factors more precisely.

Compute beta:

m =1.2 GeV, E=8 GeV.

(m/E) = 1.2/8 = 0.15.

(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Gamma: gamma = E/(m) = 8/1.2 = 6.666... = 20/3.

Tau: hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV s. Gamma_X is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

gamma * tau = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875e-24 ) /3.

20 * 2.056875e-24 = 41.1375e-24 =4.11375e-23.

Divide by 3: 4.11375e-23 /3 = 1.37125e-23 s.

Now, beta * c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

So, L = beta * c * gamma tau = 2.9661e8 * 1.37125e-23.

Calculating 2.9661e8 * 1.37125e-23:

Multiply 2.9661 * 1.37125 = ?

Breaking it down: 2 *1.37125 = 2.7425, 0.9661 *1.37125 ≈ let's see, 1 *1.37125 is 1.37125, subtract 0.0339 *1.37125.

Wait, 0.9661 is 1 - 0.0339.

So, 2.9661 *1.37125 = (2 + 0.9661) * 1.37125 = 2*1.37125 + 0.9661*1.37125.

2*1.37125 = 2.7425.

0.9661 *1.37125 ≈ calculate 0.96 *1.37125 = approx 1.3124. Plus 0.0061 *1.37125 ≈ 0.00837. So total ≈1.32077.

Adding to 2.7425: 2.7425 +1.32077 ≈4.0633.

So, 4.0633e-15 meters.

Which is approximately 4.0655e-15 as option B suggests.

So the correct answer is B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta c \gamma \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \)),
- \( \Gamma \) is the width of the particle.

### Step 1: Compute \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is calculated using the relativistic relation:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m c^2}{E}\right)^2}
\]

Given \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), we find:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1.2}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Substituting \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \gamma \tau \)
The lab-frame lifetime is:

\[
\gamma \tau = 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta c \gamma \tau
\]

Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \gamma \tau \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 1.37125 \times 10^{-23}
\]

First, calculate \( 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \approx 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Then:

\[
L = 2.9661 \times 10^8 \times 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
