Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They also provided the components of the operator P in terms of their matrices for Px, Py, and Pz.

Hmm, I remember that the operator P is a vector operator, which means it has components along x, y, and z. So P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Wait, but in the question, each component is given as ħ/2 times a matrix. Oh, right, because for spin-1/2 systems, the spin operator components are usually written as S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So in this case, the operator P must be the spin operator, since the muon has spin-1/2.

So each component P_x, P_y, P_z is equal to (ħ/2) times the respective Pauli matrix. So P_x is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], P_y is (ħ/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]].

But the problem is about the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n lies in x-z, which means it's of the form (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since in spherical coordinates, θ is the angle from the z-axis. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero or pi, but since it's arbitrary, any direction in x-z.

To find the eigenvector of P along direction n with eigenvalue +ħ/2, we need to find the eigenstate of P·n, because the operator along direction n is P·n.

Wait, right, because the operator along an arbitrary direction is the dot product of the vector operator and the direction vector. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But since n is in x-z, n_y is zero. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given that n is a unit vector, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Because n² = (n_x)^2 + (n_z)^2 = 1.

So P·n = (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z.

Substituting the given matrices:

P·n = (sinθ)*(ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ)*(ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix.

Each term is (ħ/2) times a matrix.

So:

Term1: (ħ/2) * sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]]

Term2: (ħ/2) * cosθ * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Adding these together:

The matrix becomes:

[ [ (ħ/2 cosθ ), (ħ/2 sinθ) ],
  [ (ħ/2 sinθ ), ( - ħ/2 sinθ ) ] ]

Wait, let me check:

Wait, the first row of P_x is [0,1], so when multiplied by sinθ * ħ/2, it's [0, sinθ * ħ/2]. Similarly, the first row of P_z is [1,0], multiplied by cosθ * ħ/2, it's [cosθ * ħ/2, 0]. So when added together, the first row is [cosθ*(ħ/2), sinθ*(ħ/2)].

Similarly, the second row of P_x is [1,0], so multiplied by sinθ gives [sinθ * ħ/2, 0], and P_z's second
