Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. It oscillates, so it must radiate energy. They're asking about the power radiated at a specific angle theta, which is 30 degrees here. Also, they're giving options for the fraction of the maximum power and the form of the function f, which depends on lambda and theta.

Wait, I remember that when a charge oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since it's spheroidal with symmetry along z, I think the radiation would be dipole-like, maybe a quadrupole? Or perhaps it's a dipole because the simplest case is a dipole oscillation.

Oh right, for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is symmetric in certain ways. The power radiated per unit solid angle (which is the function f) depends on the angle theta. The standard radiation pattern for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos²(theta)), but wait, no, that's the radiation pattern for an electric dipole in terms of the intensity. Let me get that right.

Wait, the intensity (power per unit area) for a dipole varies with the angle. The maximum intensity is along the equator, at theta = 90 degrees. The formula I remember is I is proportional to (sin(theta))^2, but wait, no, wait, for an electric dipole, the intensity in the far field is proportional to (sin^2(theta)). No, wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The intensity pattern for an electric dipole is maximum at theta = 90 degrees, and it's proportional to (sin(theta))^2, right? So the maximum occurs at sin(theta) = 1, which is 90 degrees. So the intensity is zero at theta=0 and theta=180, and maximum in between.

Wait, but wait, the problem here is about the power per unit solid angle. So solid angle is dΩ = sin(theta) dtheta dphi. So the function f would be the power per dΩ, which depends on theta and lambda.

Wait, but the question says f is a function
