Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. So, it's symmetric around that axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis.

The problem asks for two things: the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the possible form of f, which is the function of lambda.

Looking at the options, the possible forms of f are either lambda^-4, lambda^-3, etc. I remember that in antenna theory and radiation, the power radiated often depends on the square of the sine of theta or something like that. Wait, but for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern is given by the dipole formula. Oh right, the radiation intensity for a dipole varies as sin^2(theta), where theta is the angle from the axis.

Wait, but the question is about the fraction of the maximum power. So the maximum power A occurs when the intensity is maximum. For a dipole, the intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta), and the maximum occurs at theta = 90 degrees, where sin(theta) is 1. So at theta=90, it's the maximum.

But the question is about theta=30 degrees. So the fraction would be [sin(30)]^2 divided by the maximum value, which is [sin(90)]^2. Sin(30) is 0.5, so [0.5]^2 is 0.25, which is 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4. So the first part is 1/4.

Now, the second part is about the form of the function f, which is the power per unit solid angle. I think the radiated power per unit solid angle (the intensity) for an oscillating dipole is proportional to (sin^2(theta))/(r^2), but in the radiation zone, I might be missing some dependencies. Wait, more accurately, the intensity (power per unit area) for a dipole is proportional to ( (sin^2(theta)) * (d
