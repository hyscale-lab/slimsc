Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slowly because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of problems.

The question is about heating a mixture of salts A and B. They're equimolar, and the total weight is 7.20 grams. When heated, they produce a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through several tubes, and each tube reacts with the gases, leading to some weight changes. The goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Let me break down the information given:

1. The salts are A and B, equimolar, total mass 7.20g.
2. Heated to 200°C without air. So probably decomposition or some redox reaction.
3. Gases formed: passed through three tubes.
   - Tube 1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. So this is a drying agent, but maybe it's reacting with something.
   - Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. This would react with acidic gases like CO2 or SO3, producing a precipitate.
   - Tube 3: Red-hot copper. This probably reacts with gases that are oxidizing agents, like H2S or maybe SO2 or others.

The results:
- Tube 1 gains 3.60g. So the gas entering must have reacted with Mg(ClO4)2. Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can react with water. So maybe the gas contained water vapor, but wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is more about absorbing moisture, but in anhydrous form, it can react with water. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Hmm, another possibility is that it's removing water, but how?

Wait, wait. When a gas passes through Mg(ClO4)2, which is anhydrous, it might be that the gas is HCl, because Mg(ClO4)2 would react with HCl? Or maybe it's capturing water, but if the gas is, say, H2O vapor, then the Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it, increasing the tube's weight.

Wait, but if the gas is a mixture, perhaps one component is captured by Mg(ClO4)2. For example, if the gas mixture includes HCl, then Mg(ClO4)2 can react with it. Let me think: Mg(ClO4)2 + 2 HCl → MgCl2 + 2 HClO4. But I'm not sure about this reaction. Alternatively, maybe the Mg(ClO4)2 is capturing water of crystallization, but no, the setup says it's anhydrous, so it's in a dry state.

Wait, another approach: when gases pass through anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, what could cause the weight to increase? If the gas contains water vapor, the Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it, hence the tube's weight increases. So maybe water vapor is the gas that's captured here. But wait, the problem says the salts are heated without air, so maybe decomposition produces water vapor as a gas.

So tube 1 gains 3.60g. If that's water, then the mass increase is equal to the mass of H2O absorbed. So 3.60g of H2O. Let me calculate the moles: 3.60g / 18g/mol = 0.2 mol of H2O.

So, the gas mixture contains 0.2 mol of H2O.

Next, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. The weight didn't change, meaning no reaction. So the gas mixture must not have any acidic gases like CO2, SO3, H2S, or NH3. Because if there were, say, CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 precipitate, increasing the tube's weight. But since there's no change, the gases didn't react with the solution. So the gas leaving tube 2 is the same as entering, except for what was captured in tube 1.

Wait, but perhaps the gas passed through tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) first, so if H2O was removed, then the remaining gas goes to tube 2. Since tube 2 didn't change, the other gases are probably neutral or inert. So maybe the only gas that reacted was H2O, and the others didn't react.

Then, tube 3 is red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80g. So this part must involve a gas that reacts with copper. What gases react with red-hot copper? Well, maybe SO2, which can be oxidized by copper at high temperatures. Or maybe CO or H2. Alternatively, perhaps it's H2S being oxidized.

Wait, another thought. When a
