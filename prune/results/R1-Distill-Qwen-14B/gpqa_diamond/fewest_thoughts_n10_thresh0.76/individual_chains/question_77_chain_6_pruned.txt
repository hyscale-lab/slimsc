Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to these concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see... The question is about two different reactions, A and B, and I need to pick the correct major products from the options given.

First, let me look at the first reaction. It's described as: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene treated with BuLi and then H+. Hmm, I remember that BuLi is a strong base, a good nucleophile. So, what kind of reactions happen when you have an enol ether like this with BuLi?

Wait, the structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So the benzene ring is attached to a (CH2CH2CH(CH3)OCH2) group maybe? Or wait, no, the structure is more like OCH2 connected to the benzene. Let me draw it mentally. The butenyl group is -CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2- but wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2- but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- no, wait, the numbering. The butenyl group is four carbons, with a double bond starting at position 2. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- with a double bond where? Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, that's but-1-en-4-yl or something. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be:

Positions 1 2 3 4
1   2   3   4
So the double bond is between C2 and C3. So structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but that can't be because CH2=CHCH2CH2- isn't right.
