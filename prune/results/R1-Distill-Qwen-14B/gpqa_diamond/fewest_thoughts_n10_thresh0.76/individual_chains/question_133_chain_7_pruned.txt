Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (which is PO4^3- I think) in the solution. The dissociation constants Ka1, Ka2, Ka3 for H3PO4 are provided: 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, 1.8e-12 respectively.

Hmm, okay. So, the first thing I remember is that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. H3PO4 can lose protons to form H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The given K values tell us how these equilibria work.

So, we're given two salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me write their dissociation in solution.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O (I think the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O, so when it dissolves, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus some water, but the water is part of the crystal structure, not the solution. So the solution will have Na+ and HPO4^2- ions.

So, in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Now, the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Wait, but how is PO4^3- formed? It's the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

So, the reaction would be HPO4^2- + OH^- ↔ PO4^3- + H2O. But wait, the problem doesn't mention OH- concentration. Alternatively, considering the third dissociation step: HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+ (but with a very low Ka3 of 1.8e-12, so it's a weak process).

Wait, but the problem is in a solution that has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So, the phosphate species present are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. But how much of each is there? And will any of them convert to PO4^3-?

I think that when you mix these two, you create a buffer solution. Because H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donate a proton to form HPO4^2-), and HPO4^2- can act as a base (accept a proton to form H2PO4^-). But since the solution is neutral (T=25°C, pH=7?), but wait, no, the pH here might not be 7. Because phosphate can buffer the solution. But wait, I'm not sure about the pH here. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a buffer at a certain pH determined by the pKa values. Let's think about the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The pKa values are as follows:

Ka1 = 7.5e-3 → pKa1 ≈ 2.12
Ka2 = 6.2e-8 → pKa2 ≈ 7.21
Ka3 = 1.8e-12 → pKa3 ≈ 11.74

So, the H2PO4^- / HPO4^2- pair has a pKa around 7.21. So, if the pH is around 7, which is close to 7.21, the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- would be roughly 1:10^(7.21-7)=10^0.21≈1.6. So, more HPO4^2- than H2PO4^-.

Wait, but what's the pH of the solution here? Because the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, their concentrations will influence the pH. But the problem doesn't state the pH, so perhaps we can assume that the pH is near pKa2, which is 7.21, making the solution close to neutral.

But perhaps we don't need the
