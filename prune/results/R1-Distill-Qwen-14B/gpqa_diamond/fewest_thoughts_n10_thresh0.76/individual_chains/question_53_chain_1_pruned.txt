Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let's go through it step by step.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows an ester group, which tells me there's an -O-CO-O- linkage or maybe an -O-CO-O-R group. Wait, no, esters are usually R-O-CO-R', so the IR would have strong absorption around 1700-1750 cm^-1 for the carbonyl. So that's a starting point.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let me break them down:

1. Two aromatic H signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons would split into different signals depending on their positions. For a para substitution, there are two sets of equivalent H's, but if it's ortho or meta, the splitting can be different. Wait, but the question says two signals for aromatic-H. That might suggest that the substituents are in positions that cause two distinct sets of aromatic protons. Like, maybe if the substituents are in the para position, but each substituent is such that it causes different coupling. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted ring where the substituents are in adjacent positions (ortho). Hmm, not sure yet.

2. Two vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those on a double bond. So this suggests that there are two sets of vinyl protons. Maybe a conjugated diene or an ester group with a double bond adjacent, like in an enol ester? Wait, but esters usually have carbonyls adjacent to oxygen. Alternatively, maybe the compound has an ethenyl group (like CH2=CH-) attached. If the vinyl group is part of a substituent on the aromatic ring, each end (the CH2 and the CH) would have different H's. Or perhaps it's an allyl group? But the description says two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm, maybe they are adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ester group. Wait, perhaps the ester has a substituent that includes a double bond. For example, if the ester is something like O-CO-O-R, and R has a double bond. Like, maybe an allyl ester, where the ethylene group is next to the ester.

3. Two signals for -CH3 groups. So two different methyl groups. Each might be attached to different parts of the molecule. For example, one might be part of an ester group, say O-CO-O-R, where R is a methyl group. Wait, but then there's another methyl elsewhere. Or perhaps one methyl is adjacent to an oxygen, like an OCH3 group, but that's a methoxy group. But the question says -CH3 groups, so probably not. Alternatively, one methyl could be part of a ketone or ester, and another elsewhere, maybe as a substituent on the aromatic ring.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any -CH2 signals. So any CH2 groups would have to be equivalent or not present. If the molecule has a -CH2- group, the NMR would show a triplet or something. But since there's no -CH2 signal, perhaps the structure doesn't have any methylene groups.

Putting this together, the compound has an aromatic ring with two substituents. One substituent might be an ester group, which would require some carbons attached. Let's think about the structure.

Ester groups are typically R-O-CO-R'. So if the ester is attached to the benzene ring, then the R would be an aryl group, and R' could be an alkyl or another aryl. But in this case, the substituent on the ring is the ester group, so R is the benzene ring, and R' is another group.

Wait, but the FTIR shows an ester, so the structure has an ester functional
