Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, right, from what I remember, when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs due to Einstein's theory of relativity. So the astronaut's time will experience less time compared to someone on Earth.

The scenario is that an alien astronaut is traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. The spacecraft's speed is 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options given are whether they'll die before reaching, or how many years it'll take.

Wait, the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years. Oh, so the astronaut is 22, and if they have a 150-year lifespan, from Earth's frame of reference, they might not live long enough. But wait, from their own perspective, they might age less.

First, I think I need to calculate the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I remember that the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. Wait, that's correct? Or is it around 160,000? I think so. So the distance is approximately 160,000 light-years.

The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c. To find out how long the trip takes from Earth's frame, I can use the formula: time = distance/speed. So time = 160,000 ly / (0.99999987c). Since speed is in terms of c, the units will work out because a light-year is the distance light travels in a year. So the time from Earth's perspective is 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ roughly 160,000 years. Wait, that's a huge number. So from Earth's point of view, the trip takes about 160,000 years.

But wait, the astronaut is on the spacecraft. Due to time dilation, their experienced time is less. The time experienced by the astronaut is the Earth time multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma. Wait, no, the time experienced is the proper time, which is Earth time multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, right. The formula is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t' is the proper time (time experienced by the moving observer), and t is the time in the Earth's frame.

But wait, when you're moving at a high velocity, you experience less time. So in this case, the Earth observer sees the trip taking about 160,000 years, but the astronaut will experience much less.

Wait, wait, but the speed is 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to c. Let me compute the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute v²/c
