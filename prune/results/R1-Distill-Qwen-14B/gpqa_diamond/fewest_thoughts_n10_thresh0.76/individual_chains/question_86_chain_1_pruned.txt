Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a chemist performing two reactions with different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, and we need to determine the starting materials A and B.

The products given are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, so both products are the same compound but with opposite configurations at the chiral center? Because (R) and (S) are enantiomers. 

The reactions are:
1. A is treated with LiBH4 and then H+ to give (R)-product.
2. B is treated with BH3 and then H+ to give (S)-product.

I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for ketones to form alcohols. But wait, in some cases, it can also reduce esters or maybe even certain other carbonyl groups. Alternatively, BH3 is a milder reducing agent, perhaps for ketals or other protected carbonyls.

Wait, but wait, what's the product here? It's a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic ether with a ketone. So, maybe the starting material is some kind of ketal or acetal. Because when you reduce a ketal, you get an alcohol, but wait, the product here is a ketone, so maybe the starting materials are something else.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal. No, wait, 2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material was an ester or a carbonyl group that cyclizes upon reduction?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with some protecting groups. Wait, maybe the starting materials are some kind of acetals or ketals. Because when you reduce an acetal, you can open it up. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, another approach. Let me consider the product: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The structure is a six-member
