Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and which symmetries must be respected by all operators in it. Hmm, let me think about what I remember.

The question gives four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincaré, CP, and CPT. The options are combinations of these. I need to figure out which ones are required for all the operators in SMEFT.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model. These operators are classified by their dimension and must respect certain symmetries. But which symmetries are those?

Lorentz Symmetry: That's definitely a big one. All terms in the Lagrangian should respect Lorentz symmetry because that's a fundamental symmetry of spacetime. So any operator in SMEFT must be a Lorentz scalar or tensor, meaning they're built from fields that transform appropriately under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must.

Poincaré Symmetry: Hmm, Poincaré includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, but isn't the Poincaré group the combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries? So if the theory already respects Lorentz, does it automatically respect Poincaré? Well, the SMEFT is a field theory, so it should respect all the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Poincaré. But wait, operators in SMEFT are classified by their Lorentz structure, but maybe the requirement is that the operators themselves don't break Poincaré. But I'm a bit confused here. In SMEFT, the operators are local, meaning they should respect local symmetries. So yes, Poincaré symmetry (2) must be respected as well.

Wait, no. Because the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it's built in a way that the symmetries of the Standard Model are preserved. The Standard Model respects Poincaré, so SMEFT should too. So both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries are required. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

CP and CPT symmetries: Now, the Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, but does it respect CP? No, the Standard Model has CP violation (like in the CKM matrix). So the operators in SMEFT could potentially violate CP, but wait, are they required to respect it? Or is CP violation allowed?
