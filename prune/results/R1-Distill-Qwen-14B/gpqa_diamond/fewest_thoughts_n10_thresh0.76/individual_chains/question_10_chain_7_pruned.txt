Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which exoplanet has the highest density. Let's see... The question provides four options, a to d, each with different characteristics. I remember that density is mass divided by volume, so I'll need to calculate that for each planet.

Starting with option a: it's an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So if Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, then this planet, being the same mass and radius, should have the same density as Earth. So a is 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but if the density is the same as Earth, even though mass is double, unless the radius also changes. But I think the given density here is already calculated based on its mass and radius, so it's 5.5. So density is 5.5.

Option c: same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Hmm, same composition means same density as Earth, right? Because density depends on the material it's made of. So if it's 5 times Earth's mass but same radius... Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, same composition would mean same density, so mass and radius relate. Let me think. Earth's mass is M, radius R. If the other planet is 5M, but same density, then what's its radius? The volume scales with radius cubed. Since density is mass/volume, and if density stays the same, mass is proportional to volume. Volume is (4
