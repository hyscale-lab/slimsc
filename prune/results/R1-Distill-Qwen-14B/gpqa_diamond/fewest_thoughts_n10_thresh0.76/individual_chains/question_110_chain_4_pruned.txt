Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember from my astronomy class that these spectrographs have different capabilities. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to recall what the question is asking. Both observatories have specific brightness limits for the stars they can observe. From the question, I see that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than magnitude 17 V, while HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V. So, the stars must have apparent V magnitudes that are brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, but wait, no, actually, I think I got that backwards. Because if a star is brighter than a certain magnitude, that means it's more detectable. So, lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So, for example, a star with V=10 is brighter than V=15.

So, the ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17. That means apparent V ≤17, because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V ≤16. So, any star that is brighter than 17 mag can't be observed by HIRES, and any star that is brighter than 16 can't be observed by ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Hmm, brightness in astronomy is inverse. So, if a star is brighter, it has a lower apparent magnitude. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's V <17. Because for example, a 1st magnitude star is brighter than a 6th magnitude.

Wait, let me clarify. Apparent magnitude is how bright a star appears from Earth. Lower numbers are brighter. So, a magnitude 1 star is brighter than a magnitude 6 star. So, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V brighter than 17 mag. Oh wait, that's confusing wording. Because a star can't be 'brighter than 17 mag' because magnitude is a scale where lower is brighter. So, perhaps the correct way to interpret it
