Alright, I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. 

The key data given is the periodic shift in the spectral lines of the host stars. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves due to the planet's orbit, and we measure this shift. The formula that relates the velocity semi-amplitude (which I think is the maximum velocity the star moves at) to other parameters is K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ]^(1/ P ) ) ] ... Wait, maybe I should think about the formula more accurately.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ ( (G * M_p^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) ] / ( P * (1 - eÂ²)^(1/2) )

But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term is 1. Also, if the inclination i is 90 degrees (edge-on), sin i is 1. But in reality, the maximum K occurs when i is 90, but the actual K we observe depends on sin i. However, both planets are detected, so we can assume that sin i is the same for both, but since the question is comparing the two, perhaps this factor cancels out.

Wait, but the problem gives the shift in wavelength, which is due to the Doppler effect. The Doppler shift (delta lambda over lambda) is related to the velocity of the star. The formula is delta lambda / lambda = v/c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us.

But wait, the RV method measures the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is v. So if the shift is 5 milliangstroms for planet 1, and 7 for planet 2, but wait, the shift is given as a periodic shift, which I think corresponds to the maximum velocity.

Wait, but milliangstroms is a unit of length. The Doppler shift in wavelength is delta lambda. The star's velocity can be found from delta lambda / lambda = v/c.

So for each star, the maximum velocity K is (delta lambda) / lambda * c.

But wait, the wavelength of the spectral line is important. Let's assume that the stars have the same spectral lines. Let's say the given spectral line is at a certain wavelength, say lambda. Then delta lambda is 5 or 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, but for the same spectral line, the same lambda, so the ratio of velocities
