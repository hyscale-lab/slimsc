Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through each step. The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. 

First, let me outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints provided are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and compound E's IR is strong at 1715 cm^-1.

Options are A to D, each a different cyclic ketone.

Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

Starting with hint a: reaction with a phosphorous ylide gives a specific product. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide (a strong base) with an aldehyde or ketone (compound A in this case).

So the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let's parse that structure.

The parent ring is cyclopentane. At position 4, there's a substituent: propan-2-ylidene. Propan-2-ylidene is a methylene group (CH2) attached to a methyl group. Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene would be a substituent where the ylidene is on the second carbon of propane. So maybe it's a CH2-C(CH3)= group. Wait, that's a bit unclear.

Wait, perhaps the structure is: cyclopentane with methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a substituent that's a methylene group connected to a CH(CH3)2? Or perhaps it's a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3)2. Hmm, maybe the substituent is a cyclopropane-like structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

So, cyclopentane ring with methyl groups at carbons 1 and 2. At carbon 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is probably CH2-C(CH3)=, but wait, ylides are usually R2P=CH-R'. So in the product, after the Wittig reaction, the R' would be attached as a substituent via the double bond.

Wait, the Wittig reaction replaces the O of a carbonyl group (from compound A) with a CH2- group that's connected to the ylide's R group
