Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, molecular formula... Well, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (three degrees), a double bond (another degree), and an aldehyde group (which is a double bond, but perhaps that's part of the same structure). Or maybe something else.

The NMR data is given. Let me look at that.

1H-NMR (ppm):
9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

Alright, let's break this down. The 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But a triplet? Hmm, maybe it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, no, aldehyde is RCHO. The triplet might suggest coupling with two neighboring protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated system, like an enal (alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde). The triplet might come from coupling with two protons on adjacent carbons.

Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each for 2H. Those are probably aromatic protons. The 6.98 is a d (doublet), which suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Similarly, 6.51 is a d. So maybe two sets of aromatic protons, each pair in a para-substituted benzene ring. Wait, because in para substitution, the protons are equivalent, but in ortho they might split more. Wait, no. For example, in para-substituted benzene, each proton is next to two others, but in the case of 1,4-disubstitution, each proton is adjacent to others in a certain pattern. Hmm, maybe this is a case where there are two different substituents on the benzene ring, but in this NMR, perhaps it's two separate benzene rings.

Wait, another thought. Looking at the integration, there are 2H for each of the aromatic regions. So maybe two separate benzene rings, each substituted with something. But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: Each benzene ring is C6H5. So if there are two benzene rings, that
