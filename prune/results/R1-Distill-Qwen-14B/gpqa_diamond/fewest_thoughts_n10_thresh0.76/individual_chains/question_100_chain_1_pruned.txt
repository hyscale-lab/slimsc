Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 is an alkene because the degree of unsaturation would be 1 (since 2n + 2 = 8, so 6-8= -2, which is two double bonds or rings; wait wait, no, wait: formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, X and N are zero. So (2*3 +2 -6)/2 = (8-6)/2 = 1. So one double bond or one ring. C3H6 is probably propene, which is an alkene. So A is propene.

Then, A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh, that's probably an addition reaction. Since propene is CH2=CHCH3, bromination would add Br2 across the double bond. So Compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane, right? Wait, wait, no, wait. The reaction of propene with Br2 is a diaddition, but it might form 1,2-dibromopropane. Or could it be a bromohydrin? No, because CCl4 is a solvent and doesn't have hydroxide. So it's just addition, so B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a base, so it's likely an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides like 1,2-dibromopropane react with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So, in this case, removing H and Br from adjacent carbons would form propene again? Wait, but wait, if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, the elimination would give 1-butene? Wait, no, wait. Let me think: when you have CH2Br-CH2Br (but that's not possible for propane, wait. Wait correction: propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give BrCH2CHBrCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, right? So adding Br2 across the double bond would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's 1,2-dibromopropane. So when you treat this with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would eliminate HBr twice, right? Because each Br is on adjacent carbons.

Wait, so the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When treated with alcoholic KOH, it can lose two molecules of HBr. So the base would abstract a Î² hydrogen, leading to the elimination of Br- and H+ as HBr. Let's see: the possible eliminations. First elimination would form a double bond. But since there's two
