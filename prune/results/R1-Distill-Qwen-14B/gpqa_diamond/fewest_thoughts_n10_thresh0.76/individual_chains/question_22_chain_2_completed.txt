Okay, so I have this electrochemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what I remember from my notes. The question is about the oxidizing power of oxygen in different solutions and how it reacts kinetically.

The question says: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. Then I have to choose between options A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the oxidizing strength of oxygen depends on the solution's acidity. Let me think about the standard reduction potentials. Oh right, in acidic conditions, the O2 has a higher reduction potential. Wait, no, let me get this straight. The reaction for O2 in acidic solution is O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O, and the E° is around 1.23 V. In basic solution, the same reaction would be O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^- with a similar or maybe higher E°? Or wait, no, the E° for the basic solution might actually be higher because the same reaction is under different conditions.

Wait, no, the standard E° for O2 in acidic is 1.23 V. For basic, it's the same because E° doesn't depend on concentration. Wait, no, wait. E° is measured under standard conditions, which are 1 M concentrations. For the basic solution, the O2 reaction would involve OH- ions. So, the reduction potential in basic is O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^- and its E° is like 0.401 V? No, wait, that can't be right because O2 is a strong oxidizer. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up the values. Another approach: the reaction in acidic is more favorable. Let me think about the standard potentials.

I think in acidic solution, O2 has a higher reduction potential than in basic. Because in acidic, the reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O, E°=1.23 V. In basic, you have O2 + 2H2O +4e- →4OH-, and E° is 0.401 V. Wait, no, that would mean O2 is a weaker oxidizer in basic. But that doesn't make sense because in basic solutions, isn't O2 a better oxidizer?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The standard reduction potentials are measured under 1 M conditions. For a basic solution, the H+ concentration is lower. Wait, but the E° is a fixed value regardless of solution type. Hmm, perhaps the effective oxidizing power in different pH depends on the concentration.

Wait, no. The thermodynamic part is about the tendency (E°), but the kinetic part is about the rate. So, thermodynamically, in basic solution, is O2 a stronger or weaker oxidant?

Wait, wait. In acidic solution, the O2 reaction is O2 + 4H+ +4e^- → 2H2O. The E° is 1.23 V. But in basic solution, the same reaction would have OH^- instead of H+. So, the reaction would be O2 + 2H2O +4e^- →4 OH^- with E° of 0.401 V? Wait, that can't be right because 0.4 V is lower than 1.23 V, which would imply O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic. But I thought O2 is a better oxidant in basic solutions because of the availability of OH^- ions, but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach. The overall cell potential, E°cell, determines the spontaneity. A higher E° means a stronger oxidizing agent. So, if in acidic solution, E° is higher, then O2 is a stronger oxidant in acidic conditions. But wait, I've heard that O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent in basic solutions. Hmm, this is confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the Nernst equation. Because in basic conditions, the concentration of H+ is lower, so maybe the reaction is less favorable, making O2 a weaker oxidant. Wait, but I'm mixing up thermodynamics and kinetics here.

The question is about thermodynamic and kinetic aspects. Thermodynamically, which solution makes O2 a stronger oxidant? The standard E° is for 1 M concentrations. In a basic solution, the H+ concentration is low, but the reaction in basic would have OH- as products. So if the E° for the basic reaction is higher, then O2 is a stronger oxidant in basic. But I'm getting conflicting thoughts here.

Wait, I think I should look up the standard reduction potentials. Let me recall. The standard reduction potential for O2 in acidic is O2 + 4H+ +4e^- → 2H2O, E°=1.23 V. In basic, the reaction is O2 + 2H2O +4e^- →4 OH^-, and its E° is 0.401 V. Oh, so that would mean that O2 is a stronger oxidant in acidic conditions because 1.23 V is higher. But that can't be right, because I've heard that O2 is a better oxidizer in basic conditions. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the E° values. Maybe the basic solution has a higher E°. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, the standard E° for the basic reaction is lower than the acidic one. So in acidic, O2 is a stronger oxidant. So thermodynamically, O2 is a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions, not basic. But the question says thermodynamically, O2 is a ... oxidant in basic. So the first blank must be filled with 'stronger' or 'weaker'.

Wait, the question says "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." So if in basic, the E° is 0.401 V, which is lower than 1.23 V, then O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. So the first blank would be 'weaker'?

Wait, no, because higher E° means stronger oxidizer. So if E° for basic is lower, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic. So the first part would be 'weaker' in basic. Then, the second part is about kinetic in acidic. So how does O2 react in acidic solutions kinetically? Kinetically, which refers to the reaction rate.

In acidic solutions, H+ ions are more available. Since O2's reaction in acidic has a higher E°, but for the reaction rate, maybe it's more favorable. Wait, but the reaction rate can be influenced by factors like the presence of catalysts, concentration of ions, etc.

Alternatively, the activation energy for the reaction in acidic might be lower, making it faster. Or does it depend on the concentration of H+? Let me think about the reaction. In acidic conditions, the reaction is O2 + 4H+ +4e^- → 2H2O. The presence of H+ ions could lower the activation energy, making the reaction proceed faster. So in acidic solutions, O2 reacts faster.

So putting it together: thermodynamically in basic, O2 is a weaker oxidant (because lower E°), so first blank is 'weaker'. Kinetically in acidic, O2 reacts faster, so second blank is 'faster'.

Looking at the options:

Option C: weaker – faster → yes, that would be correct.

Option B says stronger – slower, which is opposite of what I concluded. Option A is stronger – faster, which I don't think is right because thermodynamically stronger is in acidic.

Wait, but the first part is about being an oxidant in basic. So first blank is 'weaker' because O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solution. Second part: in acidic, O2 reacts faster. So the combination is weaker and faster. So looking at the options, option C is 'weaker – faster'.


The question involves determining the oxidizing power of oxygen (O₂) thermodynamically and its reaction rate kinetically in different solutions. 

1. **Thermodynamic Analysis**:  
   The standard reduction potential for O₂ in acidic solution is higher (E° = 1.23 V) compared to its potential in basic solution (E° = 0.401 V). A higher reduction potential indicates a stronger oxidant. Therefore, thermodynamically, O₂ is a **weaker oxidant** in basic solutions.

2. **Kinetic Analysis**:  
   The reaction rate (kinetic aspect) depends on the availability of ions like H⁺, which facilitate the reaction. In acidic solutions, the presence of H⁺ ions lowers the activation energy, making the reaction proceed faster. Thus, kinetically, O₂ reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.

Combining these observations, the correct combination is **weaker – faster**. 

Answer: C
