Okay, so I have this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, I remember that quasars emit a lot of light, and sometimes their light gets absorbed by other objects. The question is about the Lyman alpha wavelength, which I think is around 1216 Angstroms. Right, Lyman alpha is the transition in hydrogen where an electron moves from the second to the first energy level, emitting a photon in the ultraviolet range.

So the clouds of neutral hydrogen are absorbing the light from the background quasars at this wavelength. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift such that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Oh, right, because the redshift determines how much the wavelength stretches, which affects whether the light is in the optical range we can observe from the ground.

Wait, optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet because the atmosphere blocks it. So the Lyman alpha emission (or absorption) needs to be shifted into the visible spectrum. The Lyman alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nanometers. That's in the far ultraviolet, which can't pass through the atmosphere. So to be detected in optical wavelengths, the wavelength after redshift must be in the range that optical telescopes can see, say around 400-700 nm.

So the formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength)/rest wavelength. The rest wavelength here is 1216 Angstroms. The observed wavelength has to be longer than what the atmosphere allows, so let's say the lower bound is the near-ultraviolet or optical. Wait, no, the observed wavelength needs to be in the optical range, so let's say at least around 400 nm. Wait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Or maybe even higher, like 500 nm (5000 Angstroms), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe 3600 Angstroms, since that's about the start of where ground-based telescopes can observe in the optical? Wait, no, 3600 Angstroms is 360 nm, which is UV still. Oh wait, no, 360 nm is near UV, but 400 nm is violet light, visible.

Wait, no. Let me think: 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV. To get this into the optical range, say 400 nm (4000 Angstroms), the redshift z would be (4000 - 1216)/1216.

Wait, let me compute that. 4000 - 1216 is 2784. Divide by 1216: 2784 / 1216 ≈ 2.29. So z ≈ 2.29. But wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift for the object to be detected with optical telescopes. So if the observed wavelength is longer than 400 nm (which is the lower end of optical), then the redshift must be such that the Lyman alpha is shifted beyond 400 nm.

Wait, no, because higher redshift would make the observed wavelength longer. So if the cloud has a redshift z, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. We need 1216*(1+z) >= 4000 Angstroms (since anything below 4000 Angstroms is UV and not observable from ground).

Wait, 1216*(1+z) >= 4000 => 1+z >= 4000/1216 ≈ 3.288. So z >= 2.288. So the lower limit is approximately z=2.29. Looking at the options, the closest higher option is C) 2.4 and D)1.9. Wait, 2.288 is between 2.2 and 2.4. So the lower limit would be around 2.29, so the redshift has to be higher than this. So the minimal z is just above 2.29, so any z higher than that would allow detection.

Wait, but the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, but wait a second. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. If the quasar's Lyman alpha line is absorbed by hydrogen clouds, and we observe this absorption line in the optical, then the observed wavelength must be in the range that optical telescopes can see, which is about 400-700 nm (4000 to 7000 Angstroms). So the minimum redshift is when the absorption line is at 400 nm, which is 4000 Angstroms.

So 1216*(1+z) = 4000 → z = (4000/1216) -1. Let me compute 4000 divided by 1216.

1216 *3= 3648, 3648 is less than 4000. 1216*3.2 = 3891.2. 1216*3.3= 3998. 3.3 *1216= 1216*3=3648, 0.3*1216=364.8 → 3648+364.8=4012.8. So 3.3 gives 4012.8, which is larger than 4000. So (1+z)=4000/1216 ≈3.289. So z≈2.289.

So the minimum redshift is approximately 2.29. So the object must have a redshift higher than about 2.29 to be detected in optical. The options are C)2.4 and D)1.9. Wait, looking at the options, the lower limit would be when the observed wavelength is at 4000 Angstroms (400 nm). But if the redshift is lower than 2.29, the observed wavelength would be shorter than 4000 Angstroms (400 nm), meaning it's in UV and not observable from the ground.

So the minimal z is about 2.29. Looking at the options, the available options are C)2.4 and D)1.9. Wait, 1.9 is lower than 2.29, so it would not be sufficient. So the correct option would be the next higher one, which is C)2.4. Because anything above 2.29 would work, so the lower limit is approximately 2.29, and the options don't have that exactly. So the minimal redshift is around 2.29, so the lower limit for the redshift is z ≈ 2.29. Therefore, any object with a z higher than 2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is z=2.29.

Wait, but the question says "the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected". So the minimal z is about 2.29. So the answer must be the option that is the smallest z that allows detection. So if any z >=2.29, what's the minimal z in the options that is >= 2.29? The options are C)2.4 and D)1.9. So 2.4 is higher than 2.29, so that's acceptable as a lower limit. Wait, no. The question is the lower limit. So the minimal redshift is z=2.29. So any object with z >=2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is 2.29. But the options don't have that. The closest higher option is C)2.4. So the correct answer is C)2.4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the calculation. Let's compute 4000/1216 exactly.

4000 / 1216 = ?

Well, 1216 * 3 = 3648. Subtract that from 4000: 4000-3648=352.

So 352/1216 = 0.289 approx. So 3.289. So z=2.289.

So the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29. So the answer options are 2.4 and 1.9. 1.9 is lower than 2.29, so z=1.9 would give an observed wavelength of 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9= let's compute: 1216 * 2=2432, 1216 *0.9= 1094.4 → total 3526.4 Angstroms, which is 352.64 nm, which is in the UV, not visible from ground. So z=1.9 is too low; the observed wavelength is still in UV. So the minimal z is higher than 2.289. So the only option higher than 2.289 is C)2.4.

Wait, but why is option D)1.9 an option? Because perhaps I got the reasoning wrong. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the quasar's redshift. Wait, the question says "the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected". The objects are the clouds, I think. So the clouds have a redshift z, and the quasars are at a higher redshift, since they are background.

Wait, no, the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. Wait, no, if the quasar is behind the cloud, then the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Because the quasar is at higher z. So the light from the quasar passes through the cloud, which is at a lower redshift. Wait, no, if the cloud is between us and the quasar, then the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. Because the quasar is farther away, so higher redshift.

Wait, but the question is about detecting the absorption line from the cloud. So the cloud's redshift is z_cloud. The quasar's redshift is z_quasar, which is larger than z_cloud. But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud. Because the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption line has to be redshifted into the optical.

So, the cloud's redshift must be such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >=4000 Angstroms. So z_cloud >= (4000/1216) – 1 ≈3.289 -1 =2.289.

So the cloud must have z >=2.289. The options are C)2.4, which is higher than 2.289, and D)1.9, which is lower. So the lower limit is z=2.289, so the minimal z is approximately 2.29. So the clouds must have a redshift above this to be detectable in optical. So the minimal redshift is about 2.29.

Looking at the options, the choices are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So 2.4 is the only option higher than 2.29. So the correct answer is C)2.4.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption lines (~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure that the observed wavelength of the absorption line falls within the optical range (~400–700 nm, or 4000–7000 Å). 

The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by the redshift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{observed}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Here, the rest wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is 1216 Å. For the absorption line to be detectable in the optical range, the observed wavelength must satisfy:

\[
\lambda_{\text{observed}} \geq 4000 \, \text{Å}
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
1216 \cdot (1 + z) \geq 4000
\]

Solving for \(z\):

\[
1 + z \geq \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.289
\]

\[
z \geq 3.289 - 1 \approx 2.289
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \(z \geq 2.29\). Now, comparing this result to the provided options:

- **A) 3**: This is higher than the calculated lower limit of \(z \approx 2.29\), so it is valid but not the smallest possible value.
- **B) 1.2**: This is lower than \(z \approx 2.29\), so it is not valid.
- **C) 2.4**: This is slightly higher than \(z \approx 2.29\), making it the smallest valid option.
- **D) 1.9**: This is lower than \(z \approx 2.29\), so it is not valid.

Therefore, the smallest valid redshift from the options is \(z = 2.4\), which corresponds to option **C**.
