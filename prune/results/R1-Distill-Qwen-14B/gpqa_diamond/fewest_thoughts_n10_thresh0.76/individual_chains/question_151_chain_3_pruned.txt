Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, that's like a vector in three-dimensional space. Then there's this observable represented by the matrix P. The matrix P has its first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), second row as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and third row as (0, 1/√2, 0). I need to find the probability that measuring this observable gives 0.

Wait, right, in quantum mechanics, the observable is an operator, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that operator. So the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

So the first step is to find the eigenvalues of P because those are the possible measurement outcomes. Then, I can see which eigenvalue is 0 and calculate the probability.

But wait, maybe I should first figure out the matrix P. Let me write it out properly.

P matrix:
Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Hmm, that's a 3x3 matrix. Let me think about its structure. It looks symmetric, so it should be diagonalizable. The eigenvalues would satisfy the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Wait, but calculating eigenvalues for a 3x3 might be a bit involved. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or see if the matrix has some properties that can simplify the process.

Looking at P, the diagonal elements are all 0. So the trace is 0, which means the sum of eigenvalues is zero. Also, the determinant would give the product of eigenvalues. Let me calculate the determinant of P.

The matrix P is:
0   1/√2  0
1/√2 0  1/√2
0   1/√2 0

Calculating determinant:

Using the first row for expansion:
0 * det
