Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about a light beam propagating through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer. The options are A, B, C, D, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Hmm, I remember that in physics, when dealing with light and moving media, it's all about how the medium's motion affects the speed of light as measured in the lab frame. So the glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the light beam.

Wait, so the light is going through the glass, and the glass itself is moving. I think the key here is to use the concept of relative velocity, but I'm not entirely sure whether it's just a simple addition or if there's some other consideration because of the refractive index.

I remember that in a medium at rest, the speed of light is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So if the medium is moving, does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, but according to special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But here, the medium isn't a vacuum—it's glass—so its motion might influence the speed.

So, in this scenario, the glass is moving at speed v relative to the lab. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Let's think about the frame where the glass is stationary. In that frame, the speed of light is c/n. Now, when the glass is moving at speed v towards the observer, how does that affect the observed speed in the lab frame?

Wait, I think we can use the velocity addition formula from special relativity here. Oh wait, no, because the velocity addition formula applies to inertial frames, and the medium's velocity is being considered. But wait, the medium's motion affects the light's speed in the frame where the medium is moving.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to find the speed of light in the moving glass from the lab frame's perspective. So, in the glass frame, the light is moving at c/n. Then, using the velocity addition formula to find the speed in the lab frame.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is (
