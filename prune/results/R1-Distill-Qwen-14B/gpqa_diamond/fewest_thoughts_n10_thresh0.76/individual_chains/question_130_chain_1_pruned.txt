Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds detected via quasar absorption lines. Hmm, let's break it down.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms. I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum for hydrogen. But wait, when it's absorbed, it shifts due to redshift.

Optical ground-based telescopes operate in the visible spectrum, right? So the observed wavelength after redshift has to be within the visible range for us to detect it. Otherwise, if it's in the UV or beyond, ground-based telescopes can't see it because Earth's atmosphere blocks UV light.

The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm, placing it in the far ultraviolet. If the cloud is at some redshift z, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_emit * (1+z). So, lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) Angstroms.

But optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths much below ~300 nm (like visible light is 400-700 nm). Wait, no, maybe the cutoff is higher. Hmm, I think the atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 300 nm, so ground-based telescopes can't see below that. So the observed wavelength must be >= around 300 nm for us to detect it.

So setting lambda_obs >= 300 nm. Wait, 300 nm is 3000 Angstroms. Because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So 300 nm = 3000 Angstroms.

So, 1216 * (1+z) >= 3000

Let me compute that. Divide both sides by 1216:

(1+z) >= 3000 / 1216 â‰ˆ 2.467

So, z >= 2.467 -1 = 1.467. So z must be at least about 1.47.

Looking at the options, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimum z where the absorption line is just detectable. But wait, wait. Let me think again. If the redshift is high enough that the Lyman alpha line moves into the optical, which is what we can observe.

Wait, no. If the quasar's emission is at 1216 Angstroms, and the cloud is at redshift z, the absorption line would be at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. For us to detect it in the optical, which is roughly 4000 Angstroms (400 nm) to about 7000 Angstroms (700 nm). So the observed wavelength has to be in that range.

Wait, 1216*(1+z) must be >= 4000 Angstroms,
