Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, let's see. The question gives a density matrix ρ and asks about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A to D, each with different r vectors.

Wait, first, I need to remember what a density matrix represents. Oh right, a density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a pure state, it's a projection operator, but for mixed states, it's a statistical mixture. 

The given ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that out. So, ρ = 1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). So each term is a projector. Since they're added and multiplied by 1/2, this looks like a mixed state with equal probabilities for |0⟩ and |1⟩. Because each projector is (|0><0|, which is a pure state) and the coefficients 1/2 each. So this is a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, what's the geometrical representation of a qubit state? I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, any single qubit state can be represented as a vector in a 3D space. The vector has components (x, y, z), and the state is |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1⟩. The Bloch vector r is (x, y, z) = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ).

But wait, the density matrix given isn't a pure state. It's a mixed state. So how do we represent that? Oh right, for a mixed state that's a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, the Bloch vector would be the average of the pure states' Bloch vectors. 

So |0⟩ corresponds to the Bloch vector (0,0,1) and |1⟩ is (0,0,-1). But wait, no, wait: the |0⟩ state is (0,0,1) on the Bloch sphere, right? Because when θ=0, the state is |0⟩, so cosθ/2 = 1, sinθ/2 is 0. So yes, |0⟩ is at (0,0,1), and |1⟩ is (0,0,-1).

So the density matrix ρ is a mixture with equal probabilities (each 1/2) of |0⟩ and |1⟩. So the Bloch vector would be the average of their Bloch vectors. So ( (0 + 0)/2, (0 + 0)/2, (1 + (-1))/2 )? Wait, wait no, that's not right because each term is multiplied by 1/2. So ( (0 *1/2) + (0 *1/2), same for y, and (1 *1/2) + (-1 *1/2) ) equals (0,0,0).

Wait, that can't be right. Because adding |0><0| and |1><1| each with 1/2 gives a density matrix that's diagonal with (1/2, 1/2, 0, 0) in the computational basis. I remember that the Bloch vector for a mixed state like this is the average of the Bloch vectors of the pure states in the mixture, each weighted by their probability. So |0> is (0,0,1), |1> is (0,0,-1). Each has probability 1/2. So the average is ( (0 + 0)*1/2, same for y, and (1*1/2 + (-1)*1/2) ) -> which gives (0, 0, 0).

Wait, but wait. Another way to think: the density matrix for a completely mixed state in 2x2 space is (I/2), since Tr(ρ)=1, and for a qubit, I is 2x2 identity. So ρ = I/2. Because ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is indeed I/2. 

So I/2 is the completely mixed state, which has zero Bloch vector. Because its vector is at the center of the Bloch sphere. So the position r is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but I should double-check. For a general density matrix ρ, the Bloch vector r is given by r = [ Tr(ρ (X) ) , Tr(ρ (Y) ), Tr(ρ (Z) ) ] where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices. Let me compute that.

The Pauli matrices are:
X = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Compute Tr(ρ X):

ρ is (1/2)[ [1 0; 0 1] + [1 0; 0 1] ]? Wait, no. Wait ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = I/2.

So ρ is I/2. Now, compute Tr(ρ X) = Tr( (I/2) X ) = (1/2) Tr(X) = (1/2)(0) = 0. Similarly Tr(ρ Y) = 0, and Tr(ρ Z) = (1/2)*Tr(Z) = (1/2)(1 + (-1)) = 0. So all components of r are zero, so r=(0,0,0). So that's option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically a classical mixture of the pure states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the Bloch vector \(r\) of a density matrix is determined by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\). For a pure state \(|0\rangle\), the Bloch vector is \((0, 0, 1)\), and for \(|1\rangle\), it is \((0, 0, -1)\). Since the density matrix is a classical mixture of these two states, the Bloch vector is the weighted average of their Bloch vectors, weighted by their probabilities:

\[
r = \frac{1}{2}(0, 0, 1) + \frac{1}{2}(0, 0, -1) = (0, 0, 0).
\]

Additionally, the density matrix \(\rho\) can be written as \(\rho = \frac{1}{2}I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the Bloch vector \((0, 0, 0)\). 

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
