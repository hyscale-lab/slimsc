Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. 

Wait, I remember that when metal ions react with ligands, they form complexes with different numbers of ligands attached. The stability constants (β) tell us how stable each complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is.

So the problem gives me the concentrations: [Co(II)] is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I think β indicates the formation constant for each complex. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]²+, and so on up to β4.

Wait, wait. Actually, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the complexes would be Co(SCN)_n^(2-n+?), I think. Wait, Co is +2. Each SCN is -1. So the charge on the complex would be +2 - n. So for n=1: Co(SCN) has charge +1, n=2: 0, n=3: -1, n=4: -2.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands, right? So the complex would be [Co(SCN)₂]^0. So that's the species we're interested in. We need to find the percentage of this species relative to all cobalt species present.

I think the approach here is to calculate the distribution of each complex based on their stability constants and the concentrations of Co and SCN-. 

The general idea is that the fraction of each complex depends on the formation constants and the concentrations of the ligand and the metal ion. So, for each possible complex, I can calculate the fraction as (β^n * [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum of all βs for each possible n multiplied by [SCN]^n), or something like that.

Wait, the formula for the fraction of a particular complex is (β_n [L]^n) divided by the sum over all m of (β_m [L]^m). But wait, each β is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So for each n, the term is β_n * [L]^n. So the denominator is the sum for each possible m (from 0 to 4, I guess, since β4 is given) of β_m [L]^m. But wait, what about the initial [Co^2+]?

Wait, I think the general formula is that the fraction f_n of the complex with n ligands is (β_n [L]^n) / (sum over m of β_m [L]^m ). Also, the total concentration of Co is the sum of all the fractions multiplied by the total concentration. Hmm, but the total cobalt concentration is given as 1e-2 M. Let me think.

Alternatively, the total concentration of all complexes is [Co_total] = sum_{n=0}^4 [CoL_n], where each [CoL_n] is the concentration of the complex with n ligands. Each [CoL_n] can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+] and the formation constants.

Wait, but [Co^2+] is the free ion. So, the formation of complexes is as follows:

[CoL_n] = β_n [Co^2+][L]^n

So, the total concentration is [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1}^4 [CoL_n] 

Which can be written as [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1}^4 β_n [
