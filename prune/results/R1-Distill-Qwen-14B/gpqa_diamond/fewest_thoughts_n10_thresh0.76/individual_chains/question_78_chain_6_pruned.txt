Okay, so I've got this question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that potentials are related to electric and magnetic fields, and when charges move, things get a bit more complicated because magnetic fields come into play.

The question gives me a scenario where a charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and I need to find the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a later time t, where t is greater than tr (the time when the field was generated). The setup mentions vectors r, d, and v, and I have to use the given options to choose the correct expressions.

Wait, let's break this down. The scalar potential V is usually straightforward for a static charge—like Coulomb's law. But when the charge is moving, does that change the expression for V? Or does it stay the same because potential is a scalar and maybe the time delay is factored into the position?

The vector potential A is trickier because it's related to the magnetic field generated by the moving charge. I think the general form for the vector potential comes from the Biot-Savart law, but when charges move, it's more about the current element. Oh wait, for a point charge in motion, the vector potential can be derived using the velocity of the charge.

I recall that the potentials are based on retarded time. The fields at a point r due to a charge moving with velocity v would depend on the charge's position at an earlier time tr. The vector d is the displacement from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So d is r minus the position of the charge at tr.

Now, for the scalar potential V. Normally, for a static charge, V is q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge to the point where the potential is measured. But when the charge is moving, the potential might have a correction due to the time delay. Wait, but wait—I think the scalar potential still depends on the charge and the distance as if it were static because the scalar potential doesn't directly depend on the motion of the charge. Or does it?

Wait, no. The potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity, but for the scalar potential, maybe it's still just the Coulomb potential, but at the retarded position. So V would be
