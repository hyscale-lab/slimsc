Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

So the question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. We need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, inertial frames... so no acceleration involved here. That should simplify things. I remember that in special relativity, when dealing with different frames moving at a constant velocity relative to each other, we use the Lorentz transformations or the velocity addition formula.

But wait, the question says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. So we're just dealing with relative motion here.

Let me think about the frames. Let's denote the Galaxy's frame as S and the ejecta's frame as S'. In S', the center of the Galaxy (which is moving towards the ejecta) has a velocity of v = 60,000 km/s. Wait, but in reality, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy. So in the Galaxy's frame S, the ejecta is moving at some speed, and in the ejecta's frame S', the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So I think this is a case of relative
