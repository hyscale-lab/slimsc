Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, let me try to unpack this.

Wait, so the supernova ejecta is moving towards the galaxy's center. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames. So from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Right, because if the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy, the galaxy would appear to move towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame.

The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, so I need to find the distance in the galaxy's reference frame. 

Wait, wait. Since both are inertial frames, this must be a problem involving special relativity. Because when you switch between frames, time dilation or length contraction might come into play. Right, so I should consider using the Lorentz transformation equations.

Let me think about the frames. The galaxy is stationary in its own frame, and the ejecta is moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s. But from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at the same speed, v. So the speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s.

Wait, 60,000 km/s is really fast. Let me convert that into a fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 / 300,000 is 0.2. So v is 0.2c. That might be important for relativistic effects.

Now, the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta frame. I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during this time. Hmm, but wait, from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards it. So the distance it travels in the galaxy's frame would be its speed multiplied by the time elapsed in that frame. But wait, how do the times relate between the two frames?

Oh wait, no. Because time intervals can differ between frames. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the galaxy's frame? Because the galaxy sees the ejecta moving, so there's time dilation. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let's clarify.
