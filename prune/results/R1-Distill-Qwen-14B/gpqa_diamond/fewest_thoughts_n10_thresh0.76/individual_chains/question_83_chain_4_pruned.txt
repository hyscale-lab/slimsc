Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration and pH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, so I'll have to calculate both values and match them.

First, I should probably figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Wait, right, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes based on the total volume. So, original volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water, so the new volume is 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid stay the same, but the concentration decreases.

Molarity is moles over volume (in liters). So initial moles of acetic acid: M = 0.05 M, volume = 0.02 L. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. After dilution, volume is 0.04 L, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, wait, no. Alternatively, I could use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. M1 is 0.05, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) /40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. Yeah, same result. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base) would produce the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

Now, for the pH at 25% titration. Wait, 25% of what? The total amount of acetic acid to be neutralized. So first, I need to find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point, then take 25% of that.

Wait, to find the equivalence point volume: the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is a strong base, each mole reacts with a mole of acetic acid. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. Volume = moles / concentration =
