Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

The problem says there are five planets, Planet_1 to Planet_5, with orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They are in orbital resonance, which I remember has something to do with their orbital periods being in a ratio of small integers. But I'm not sure if that affects the temperature calculation directly. The question is about the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. Right, the formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet is based on the inverse square law. The temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The formula I recall is:

Te = T_star * ( (L_star / (16πσ)) )^0.25 * ( (1 - albedo) / (d^0.5) )^0.25

But since all the planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures will depend on the distance from the star. 

Wait, but the planets are in a system, so if their periods are in a ratio, their distances should relate to that. Because orbital period depends on the semi-major axis (assuming circular orbits and same star mass). Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis, so T^2 ∝ a^3.

Wait, the orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 to Planet_5. Let me list them:

Planet_1: Period P1
Planet_2: P2 = 2*P1
Planet_3: P3 = 2.5*P1
Planet_4: P4 =3.5*P1
Planet_5: P5=5*P1

But I think the ratio is between the planets, so for example, Planet_2's period is twice Planet_1's. So for each planet, their period is P_i = ratio_i * P1.

Since T^2 ∝ a^3, then a ∝ T^(2/3). So the ratio of a for Planet_i to Planet_j is (P_i/P_j)^(2/3).
