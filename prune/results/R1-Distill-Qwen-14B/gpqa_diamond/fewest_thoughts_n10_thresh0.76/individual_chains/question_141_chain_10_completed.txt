Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to remember.

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh right, that's bromobenzene with a deuterium (d) somewhere. Wait, no, the 'd' probably refers to the solvent being D2O or something, but maybe the molecule has a deuterium attached. Or wait, sometimes the 'd' suffix denotes that a hydrogen is replaced with deuterium. So 1-bromobenzene-2-d would have a deuterium on the second carbon? Or wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering would be around the ring. So position 1 is bromine, position 2 is a deuterium? So the structure is bromine at C1 and deuterium at C2.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. But in what context?

Wait, aromatic substitution? If the starting material is bromobenzene, which is an aryl bromide. Aryl halides can undergo substitution reactions. But wait, is this about elimination? Or maybe some kind of elimination-addition (like the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond) or perhaps a coupling reaction?

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 is a strong base, which can deprotonate things. In the presence of a benzene ring with substituents, maybe it's an elimination reaction. Or perhaps it's a Fittig reaction? Wait, Fittig is when you have two aryl halides reacting with a metal like Na to form a biaryl. But the question is about NaNH2, which is different.

Alternatively, maybe it's about dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but benzene is a stable structure; it's hard to eliminate from it. Oh wait, but if there's a leaving group adjacent to a hydrogen, perhaps elimination could form a double bond. Wait, but benzene already has a ring of conjugated double bonds. So maybe this is about forming a diradical or something else?

Wait, perhaps the deuterium is part of a hydrogen/deuterium exchange. Wait, but if the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is NH3, and if the solvent is deuterated, like D2O, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, another angle: maybe this is a Birch reduction? Birch uses metals like Na or Li in ammonia, which can reduce aromatic rings. But Birch typically adds H2 across the ring, but in this case, we have a bromide attached.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromobenzene with a deuterium on the adjacent carbon. So if we treat with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps it's an elimination reaction where the Br leaves, and a double bond forms.

Wait, let me think about that. If the bromide is at position 1 and deuterium at position 2, maybe the base abstracts the deuterium (which is a proton in this case, but wait, deuterium is a heavier isotope but similar in chemistry). Wait, no, deuterium is a hydrogen isotope. So if the solvent is ammonia, which is a strong base, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the ring adjacent to Br.

Wait, but the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the Br is on C1, and C2 has a D. So the structure is:

Br
|
C1—C2 (with D) — C3
      |        |
      C6      C4
      ... etc.

Wait, in benzene, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent carbons and one substituent. So in this case, carbon 1 has Br, carbon 2 has D, and the other positions are H.

So when NaNH2 is added, which is a strong base, maybe it abstracts a proton from carbon 3 or another position adjacent to the Br. Wait, but if the base abstracts a proton from a position adjacent to Br, that could lead to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, but C2 has D. Hmm, no, perhaps it's more about an elimination reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is E2 elimination. So the base (NH2^-) abstracts a proton that's anti to the Br. But wait, in benzene, the positions are fixed. So if Br is on C1, and the base abstracts a proton from C2 (but wait, C2 has a D, which is not a proton), or maybe from C6 or C3.

Wait, if the base abstracts a proton from C3, then the leaving group (Br^-) would leave, and a double bond would form between C1 and C2. But wait, C2 has D, so that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more about deprotonation leading to a carbanion, which could undergo some kind of aromatic substitution.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about similar reactions. I remember that in aromatic systems, when you have a good leaving group like Br attached, and a strong base, it can lead to elimination reactions. For example, in case of 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, treatment with a strong base could deprotonate the methyl group, leading to elimination of Br and forming a double bond.

But in this case, the adjacent position to Br is C2, which has a D. Wait, if the base abstracts a proton from C3 (which is next to C2), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let me imagine the structure. Br is on C1, D on C2, and H's on C3 and C6 (assuming the numbering is 1,2,3,4,5,6 in order around the benzene ring). If a base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, which is adjacent to C2 (which has D), then perhaps the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. But wait, C2 already has a D, which is a hydrogen isotope. Hmm, but wait, in the product, would that D remain?

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but since C2 has D, perhaps that's not possible. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but I don't see a good leaving group elsewhere. Or maybe it's a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 is used in the formation of aniline from nitrobenzene via a reduction, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's about the formation of a benzene diradical, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a benzene ring with a double bond. So in this case, the product would be styrene or something similar, but benzene can't form such a compound because all the bonds are already conjugated. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe the starting material is actually bromobenzene with a deuterium on the para position or another position. But the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d, so it's attached to C1 and C2.

Let me try to draw this. Benzene ring: C1 has Br, C2 has D, others have H. When treated with NaNH2, which is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a proton adjacent to Br. So from C3 or C6. Let's say it abstracts a proton from C3. Then, Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. But wait, C2 has a D, so the adjacent carbon (C3) might have H's. So if the base takes a proton from C3, which is adjacent to C2 (which has D), then elimination would occur, but the resulting structure would have a double bond between C1 and C2, but since C2 has D, perhaps that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the D is a substituent and the base abstracts a hydrogen from a neighboring carbon, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to Br. But benzene is already a ring, so I'm not sure how that works.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a di-substituted benzene with a double bond. Wait, but that's impossible because the ring is already aromatic.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile, so that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, removing H from a position and Br leaving, forming a double bond. So from 1-bromo-2-d benzene, the H on C3 is abstracted, Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. But the product would then be 1,2-benzenedide, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, but double bonds on benzene are part of the ring's structure, so that's probably not feasible. So perhaps the reaction doesn't form a double bond but instead undergoes some other transformation.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible products. The question is asking how many possible organic products are formed. So maybe there's more than one product possible due to different sites of elimination or substitution.

Wait, if the base abstracts a proton from a position adjacent to Br, but there are two such positions: C2 and C6. But wait, C2 has D, so perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C6.

Wait, so if the base abstracts a proton from C6, then Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C6? That doesn't make sense because in benzene, each C is connected to two others. Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes a cyclohexadienyl anion or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of benzene diradical intermediates, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about aromatic substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile, so maybe it's not about substitution.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about known reactions of aryl halides with NaNH2. Oh! I remember that in some cases, when aryl halides are treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia, they can undergo elimination to form a benzene ring with a substituent that's part of a double bond. Wait, but benzene is already a ring of double bonds.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of forming a benzene ring with an adjacent substituent that's a deuterium and a leaving group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, wait, NaNH2 is used in the formation of arenediazonium salts, but that's usually with nitrous acid (HONO) and typically for substitution reactions. But that might not be applicable here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. So the Br leaves, and a proton is abstracted, leading to a double bond.

Wait, but benzene already has a conjugated system, so adding another double bond isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps the ring expands or contracts, but that's unlikely.

Hmm, maybe the reaction produces a benzene ring with a substituent that is a deuterium and a double bond, but I'm not sure how that would look.

Wait, perhaps the deuterium doesn't play a role in the reaction, so it's just a substituent. So the reaction is about the Br leaving, leading to a benzene ring with a deuterium and an anion or something.

Wait, if Br leaves, the benzene would have a negative charge. But that's unlikely because benzene is stable. Alternatively, the base (NH2^-) could deprotonate a position, leading to a resonance-stabilized carbanion.

Wait, if the base abstracts a proton from a position para to Br, or meta, leading to a carbanion which could then eliminate Br as a leaving group. But I'm not certain.

I think I'm getting too stuck here; perhaps I should try to recall if the reaction of aryl bromides with strong bases leads to elimination or substitution.

Wait, another possibility: this is a benzyne reaction. Benzyne is a diradical intermediate formed when an aryl halide undergoes dehalogenation with a strong base. So if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, and treated with NaNH2, perhaps it forms benzyne. But wait, benzyne requires two leaving groups, like two adjacent halogens. Because NaNH2 would abstract a proton, and the Br would leave, but you need another leaving group on the adjacent carbon to form the triple bond.

Wait, but in this case, the adjacent carbon has a deuterium, which is not a leaving group. So perhaps it's not possible to form benzyne here. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a diradical, but without a second leaving group, it can't form benzyne. So perhaps only one product is formed, or no reaction occurs.

Wait, but the question states that the reaction does occur, so there must be products.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the ring, leading to a carbanion, which then eliminates Br. So if the base abstracts a proton from position 4 (opposite Br), then the carbanion would form at position 4, and Br would leave, but how does that lead to a product? Maybe the ring opens, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, the elimination occurs between positions 1 and 2, but C2 has D. So perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C2, but C2 has D, not H. Hmm, so that can't happen. So the base would abstract a proton from another position, like C3 or C6.

Wait, let's say the base abstracts a proton from C3. Then, the Br on C1 leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. But C2 already has a D. So the structure becomes a ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and C2 has D. But wait, that would make the structure 1,2-dideuteroethylene benzene? I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, but in reality, the benzene ring can't have a double bond outside the ring, so maybe the double bond is part of the ring. Wait, but that's already how benzene is structured. So perhaps the reaction doesn't change the ring structure but removes the Br and forms a new substituent.

Wait, maybe the reaction produces benzene with a D and a new substituent where Br was. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where Br is replaced by something else. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile, so substitution is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a benzene ring with a substituent that's a deuterium and a double bond. But I'm not sure.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible products and how the reaction can proceed.

If the reaction is elimination, removing H from C3 and Br from C1, then a double bond forms between C1 and C2. So the product would have a double bond between C1 and C2, with C2 having a D. But that would result in a structure like 1,2-dideuteroethylene, but that's not possible in benzene because all the bonds are already conjugated.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is part of the ring, but that's already the case. So I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is benzene with a triple bond instead of a double bond, but that's not likely. Or perhaps it's a cyclohexadienyl anion, but that's more of an intermediate than a product.

Another thought: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a deuterium and a hydrogen being removed, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination but instead as a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group. But NaNH2 is a source of NH2^- ions. So perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that to happen, the ring must be activated towards substitution. Bromobenzene is not activated; it's deactivated because Br is an electron-withdrawing group. So substitution would be difficult unless there are strong activating groups.

So perhaps substitution isn't feasible here.

Wait, another angle: maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of benzene with a substituent that's a deuterium and a hydrogen removed. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction where two benzene rings are joined, but I don't see how that would happen here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any new products, so the answer is 1 (just the starting material), but that seems unlikely because the question implies a reaction occurs.

Hmm, I'm really not sure. Maybe I should look for similar problems.

Wait, I recall that when bromobenzene is treated with a strong base like NaNH2, it can undergo elimination to form a benzene ring with a double bond, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a deuterium and an elimination product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of two different products due to different sites of elimination. For example, the base could abstract a proton from C3 or from C6, leading to two different double bonds. But in this case, the structure is symmetric, so perhaps both would lead to the same product.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. The positions adjacent to Br are C2 (with D) and C6. If the base abstracts a proton from C6, then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6. But since the ring is symmetric, I think that would lead to the same product as if it abstracted from C3.

Wait, no, because C3 is adjacent to C2 (D), whereas C6 is adjacent to C1 (Br) and C5.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a single product because the starting material is symmetric. So the base can abstract a proton from either C3 or C6, but due to the symmetry, both would lead to the same product.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material isn't symmetric. The Br is on C1, and the D is on C2. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C1 and C4, perhaps. Wait, maybe not. Let me try to visualize the molecule.

If Br is on C1, D on C2, then the positions are arranged as:

C1 (Br) – C2 (D) – C3 – C4 – C5 – C6 – C1.

So the molecule isn't symmetric across the C1-C4 axis, because C2 has D and C6 has H. So the base could abstract a proton from C3 or C6, leading to different products.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a proton from C3, the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2. But C2 has D, so perhaps that's impossible. Alternatively, the base abstracts a proton from C6, leading to a double bond between C1 and C6. But that's the same as between C1 and C6, which is across the ring.

Hmm, but in benzene, all adjacent carbons are similar, so perhaps the product would be the same regardless of which position the base abstracts a proton from.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can only abstract a proton from C3, leading to a double bond between C1 and C2, making the product 1,2-dideuteroethylene? But that doesn't make sense because benzene is a six-membered ring with conjugated double bonds.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options. The options given are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the reaction leads to two different products, the answer would be C)2. But if only one product is formed, the answer is B)1.

Alternatively, maybe the deuterium affects the reaction, leading to different products. For example, if the base abstracts a proton from C3, the product would have a certain structure, and if it abstracts from C6, a different structure. But due to the symmetry of the starting material, perhaps only one product is formed.

Wait, no. Let me think again about the starting material. 1-bromo-2-d benzene has Br on C1 and D on C2. The molecule has two substituents on adjacent carbons. So the positions available for the base to abstract a proton are C3 and C6, which are not equivalent. Hence, the base could abstract a proton from C3 or C6, leading to two different elimination products.

Wait, if the base abstracts a proton from C3, then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but C2 has D. How is that possible? Or perhaps the D is not involved.

Alternatively, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C3, but that's not adjacent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, in benzene, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent carbons. So if Br is on C1, and the base abstracts a proton from C3, which is two carbons away from Br, then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C3, but that's not possible because in benzene, all adjacent carbons are connected with single and double bonds in a conjugated manner.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should consider that only one product is formed because the molecule's symmetry leads to the same product regardless of which proton is abstracted.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination but instead as something else, leading to a single product.

Wait, another thought: maybe the base deprotonates the ring, leading to a carbanion, which could then lose Br^- to form a benzene ring with a negative charge, but that's not stable. So perhaps the product would be the benzene ring without Br and with a negative charge, but that would require another step.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a di-substituted benzene, and the reaction leads to the loss of Br and the formation of a new substituent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any new products, but that can't be the case.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of this differently. Suppose the reaction is elimination, forming a benzene diradical. But without a second leaving group, it can't form benzyne. So perhaps the product is a single diradical intermediate, but that's not an organic product.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed because there's no second leaving group. So perhaps no products are formed, but the options don't include zero.

Wait, but the question says "how many possible organic products are there in this reaction?" So perhaps the reaction doesn't produce any new products, meaning the answer is B)1 (only the starting material remains). But the options have B as 1, which would imply only one product, which is the starting material. But that would mean no reaction occurs, which seems odd.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces a single product because the starting material's symmetry leads to only one possible product, regardless of which position the base abstracts a proton from.

Wait, but the starting material isn't symmetric. The Br is on C1, D on C2. So the positions available for deprotonation are C3 and C6, which are different.

If the base abstracts a proton from C3, the product would have a double bond between C1 and C2. If it abstracts from C6, the product would have a double bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, but in benzene, all double bonds are equivalent due to delocalization, so maybe both would lead to the same product.

But wait, the substituents (Br and D) are in specific positions, so perhaps the products would be different.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of only one product because the base can abstract a proton from either C3 or C6, but the resulting product is the same due to the ring's symmetry.

Wait, in this case, the product would have a double bond between C1 and C2, which is adjacent to D, and another possibility between C1 and C6, which is not adjacent to D. Or perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to two different products, so the answer is C)2.

But I'm not confident. Another angle: the solvent is condensed ammonia. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a substituent that's a deuterium and a new double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because the base isn't strong enough or the leaving group isn't good. But the question implies that a reaction occurs.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should make an educated guess. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4 products.

If the reaction is elimination leading to a single product, then the answer is B)1.

If it leads to two products due to different sites of elimination, the answer is C)2.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium doesn't affect the reaction, leading to a single product.

Hmm, I think I'll go with option C)2, because the starting material has two possible positions (C3 and C6) for the base to abstract a proton, leading to two different products. But wait, the starting material isn't symmetric, so perhaps each position leads to a different product. So the number of products would be 2.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material has bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2 on the benzene ring. NaNH2 is a strong base, and such reactions typically involve deprotonation and elimination. 

In this case, the base can abstract a proton from either position 3 or position 6, which are adjacent to the bromine at position 1. This leads to the elimination of bromine and the formation of a double bond. However, the starting material is not symmetric because position 2 has a deuterium, making positions 3 and 6 distinct in terms of their relationship to the substituents. 

If the base abstracts a proton from position 3, the double bond forms between positions 1 and 2. If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, the double bond forms between positions 1 and 6. These two elimination pathways lead to two distinct products due to the asymmetry of the starting material. Therefore, the reaction produces two possible organic products.

Answer: C
