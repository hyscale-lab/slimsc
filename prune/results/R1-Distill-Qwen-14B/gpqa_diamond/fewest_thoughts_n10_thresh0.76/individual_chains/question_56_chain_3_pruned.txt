Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, I remember that when an electron transitions between energy levels, certain selection rules apply. Let me think about what I know.

The question is about the state |3,0,0> decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. So, the process must involve two steps. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. Oh right, the selection rules for hydrogen are: Δn = 0, ±1 (but can't go from n=1 to n=2 with Δn=+1, I think n can't be zero, so 1 to 2 is okay). And for angular momentum, Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1, but for the transition to happen, the dipole must have a non-zero component. Wait, no, actually the selection rule is that m can change by 0, ±1. So each transition has to follow these rules.

So the initial state is |3,0,0>. It has n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0>, so n=1, l=0, m=0. To get from 3 to 1 via two transitions, each transition must change n by 1. So the first step would have to be from 3 to 2, and the second from 2 to 1. Because 3 can't go directly to 1 in a single dipole transition (since Δn can't be 2 for a dipole; that's for quadrupole maybe).

So the first transition is |3,0,0> → |2, l', m'>. What possible l' and m' can we have? Since initial l is 0, Δl must be ±1. So l' can be 1 (since 0 +1=1). So the first state after transition should have l=1. So the state is |2,1, m'>. And m can change by 0, ±1. So m' could be -1, 0, or +1.

Now, what about the second transition? The state after first transition is |2,1,m'>. Now, it needs to go to |1,0,0>. So from l=1, the next Δl must again be ±1. So l can go to 0 or 2. But the final state has l=0, so the second transition must have Δl = -1, because 1 → 0. So the second transition is from l=1 to l=0.

So the first transition is 3→2, l=0→1. The second is 2→1, l=1→0.

Now, for each transition, what are the possible m changes? For the first transition, m can go from 0 to m1, where m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Then, the second transition's m change would be from m1 to 0 (since the final state has m=0). So the possible m changes in the second transition are m1 → m_final. So, from m1 to 0, so m1 can be -1, 0, or +1, but the change must be Δm = 0, ±1.

Wait, let me think. The selection rule is that in each transition, Δm can be 0, ±1. So for the first transition, m starts at 0, so possible m1 = -1, 0, +1. Then, for the second transition, from m1 to 0. So possible transitions are m1 = -1 → 0 (Δm=+1), m1=0→0 (Δm=0), or m1=+1 →0 (Δm=-1). All allowed.

So the possible first steps are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,+1>, and the second steps would take each to |1,0,0>.

But wait, the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability. The options give specific routes, like option A is 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0, with probability 1/3.

But how do we determine the probabilities? I think the probability for each transition depends on the square of the dipole matrix elements. The matrix element for each transition is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or something like that. Alternatively, I remember that for hydrogenic transitions, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the integral of the spherical harmonics Y_l^m and Y_{l'}^{m'}.

Wait, but maybe there's a simpler way. I recall that for dipole transitions, the transition probability is zero unless certain conditions are met. Also, for the dipole selection rules, the transition is allowed only if the integral of Y_{l}^{m} * Y_{1}^{q} Y_{l'}^{m'} isn't zero. So, the integral ∫ Y_{l}^{m} Y_{1}^{q} Y_{l'}^{m'} dΩ must be non-zero.

Wait, but in our case, the first transition is from l=0 to l=1. So the dipole operator has l=1. So the integral is Y_0^0 Y_1^q Y_1^m' (since the initial l is 0, m=0; after transition, l=1, m=m'.)

Wait, no. The dipole operator has angular momentum components with l=1. So the matrix element involves the integral of Y_0^0 * Y_1^q * Y_1^m', which is the integral of Y_0^0 Y_1^{q} Y_1^{m'}.

Wait, but Y_0^0 is 1/(sqrt(4π)), so the integral reduces to ∫ Y_1^{q} Y_1^{m'} dΩ. The integral of Y_a Y_b is zero unless a = b*, which in this case, since m' can be -1,0, +1, for the integral to be non-zero, Y_1^q Y_1^{m'} must be a combination that gives a non-zero result. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of which m transitions are allowed. For the first transition, from m=0 to m'.

The dipole operator has components with m = -1, 0, +1. So for each component of the dipole operator, the transition is allowed if m' = m_initial + m_dipole.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The transition from state |n, l, m> to |n', l', m'> is allowed if m' = m + q, where q is the m-component of the dipole operator, which can be -1, 0, +1. So for the first transition, m is 0, so m' can be 0+(-1)= -1, 0, or +1.

Similarly, for the second transition, the state is |2,1, m1>. The dipole operator again can cause
