Okay, I'm trying to tackle this qPCR question. Let me start by recalling what I know about qPCR and calibration curves.

So, the scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it serially and ran three technical replicates each. The efficiency was 100%, which is perfect because it means the reaction is doubling the target every cycle. The RÂ² is 1, so the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope was -3.3. Hmm, I remember that the slope in a qPCR curve relates to the efficiency. The formula for slope is usually -3.32 divided by the efficiency. Wait, but here the efficiency is 100%, so that's an efficiency of 1, right? So slope should be -3.32 / 1 = -3.32. Oh wait, the given slope is -3.3, which is very close. Maybe a minor rounding difference or something, but that's fine.

Looking at the data, each concentration's Ct values are in triplicates. For example, at 100,000 copies, they have 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. So the average would be around 34.2. Similarly, each concentration's Ct increases by about 3.3 cycles as the concentration decreases by a factor of 10. Let me check the differences between concentrations. From 100,000 to 10,00
