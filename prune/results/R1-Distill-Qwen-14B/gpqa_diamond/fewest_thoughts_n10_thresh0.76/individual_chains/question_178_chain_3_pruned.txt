Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum field theory problem. The question is about finding the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ in a given Lagrangian and determining whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that renormalizability depends on the dimensions of the coupling constants. Let's think this through step by step.

The Lagrangian is given as L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is (i/2) times the commutator of gamma matrices. So, σ_{μν} = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. 

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. I know that in 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian must be mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless. The Lagrangian density has units of [Mass]^4 since the integral over d^4x (which has [Mass]^-4) must give a dimensionless quantity.

So, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. Let's break down the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

I remember the mass dimensions of the fields. For a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2. Because in 4D, the action for ψ is ∫ψ̄ iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ d^4x, which must be dimensionless. So [ψ] = [Mass]^{3/2}, since each ∂_μ has [Mass], and the Lagrangian each term must be [Mass]^4. So for each ψ, it's 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is made from gamma matrices. Each γ matrix is dimensionless, I think, because they are just matrices. So when you take a commutator, it's still dimensionless. So σ_{μν} has the same dimension as [γ matrices], which is zero. So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have dimensions [ψ̄][σ][ψ] = (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) = 3. Because ψ̄ has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2 each.

What about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. The field strength tensor F is derived from the vector potential A. The Maxwell Lagrangian is like F^2. Each F has dimension 2 because the Maxwell term is (∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ)^2, and ∂ has dimension 1. So each F^{μν} is (∂ A) which is [Mass]^1 * [A]. The vector potential A has dimension 1 because the kinetic term is (∂ A)^2, which must have dimension 4. So (∂ A) has dimension 2, so F has dimension 2.

So putting it all together, the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F: Let's compute the dimensions. The product ψ̄ σ ψ F would be [ψ̄][σ][ψ][F] = (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5. Because each ψ is 3/2, and F is 2. So the entire product has dimension 5.

But the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the coupling κ must have dimension [Mass]^{4 -5} = [Mass]^{-1}.

Wait, that's correct? Because the term is κ multiplied by that product. So the dimension is [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [κ] +5 =4. So [κ] is -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Wait, but does this term have any derivatives in it? Let me think. The given term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. σ_{μν} is built from the gamma matrices, which don't carry any momentum dependence. The F tensor is built from the field's derivatives. So the F term is like ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, but in the Lagrangian, F is already the field strength, which has derivatives. So the term as written has two fermion fields and an F tensor which brings in two derivatives.

So the dimensions are as I thought earlier.

So the dimension of κ is [Mass]^{-1}, which is -1.

Now, for renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≤4−d, where d is the spacetime dimension. Wait, in 4 dimensions
