Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

The setup is that there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma times S_z. Oh wait, right, S_z is the spin in the z-direction. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. So the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the field, I guess.

Then, suddenly the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin precesses around the field direction. But wait, here the field changes direction. So the initial state is along Z, and suddenly it switches to Y. How does the spin evolve after that?

I think it's something about the Hamiltonian. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field via the Hamiltonian H = -mu·B. Initially, H is proportional to S_z because B is along Z. Then, after the field changes, H becomes proportional to S_y because B is along Y.

Wait, but when the field is turned off and on, the particle's spin state might change. So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z, which is along the original field. After the field changes, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. So the state will now evolve under this new Hamiltonian.

The time evolution of the state is determined by the Schrödinger equation. The energy levels for H = -gamma S_y B (since mu = gamma S, and the magnetic field is B in y-direction) would have energies proportional to S_y. But wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for spin-1/2.

So the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = (gamma B ħ/2) and E_- = -(gamma B ħ/2). Wait, no, wait: H = -gamma B S_y, right? Because mu dot B is gamma S_y * B (since B is along y). So H = -gamma B S_y. So the energies are E = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E = gamma B (ħ/2), but wait no, wait, let me correct that. The actual H is mu · B, but mu is gamma S, so H is gamma S · B. Wait, no, wait: magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, and the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B. Because the interaction energy is -mu·B. So H = -gamma S · B.

So when B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y. So the energies are E = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E = gamma B (ħ/2), but wait, wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H has eigenvalues -gamma B (ħ/2) * sign? Let me compute it correctly.

H = -gamma B (S_y). The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So H's eigenvalues are -gamma B (s) where s is ± ħ/2. So E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (1/2) ? Wait, no, wait, S_y's eigenvalues are ± (ħ/2). So H's eigenvalues are -gamma B * (± ħ/2). So E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) * (1) for s=+1/2? Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the spin-up and spin-down in the y-direction.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the time evolution. The initial state is the eigenstate of S_z, right? Because the initial magnetic field is along Z, so the spin is aligned with that. So the initial state is, say, |+z>, which is spin-up in z-direction. So after the field switches to y, the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma
