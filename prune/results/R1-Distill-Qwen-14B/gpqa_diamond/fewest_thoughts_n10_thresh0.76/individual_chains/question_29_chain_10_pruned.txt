Okay, so I've got this genetics question here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The problem is that this compound makes it unusable for food. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. The plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and then they sequenced the target gene in each mutant.

The question is asking which mutation will probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, the idea is that if the gene causing the compound is mutated, it won't be expressed, thus the compound won't be made.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change in the first exon. Let me compare the wild-type sequence with each mutant.

The wild-type gene starts (in the first exon) as:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, comparing the first part: the wild-type is ATGTTTCTCGCT. Mutant 1 has ATGTTCTACGCT. Wait, let me count the letters. Let's break it down.

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1:    ATG T T C TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, perhaps looking for where the changes occur. Let me line them up:

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG
Mutant 1:   ATG T T C TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for the exact differences. Let me write the first parts.

Wild-type: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

So, the first five nucleotides are the same (ATGTT). Then, the wild type has 'TTCTC' (positions 6-10), while mutant 1 has 'CTACG' (positions 6-10). Wait, no—maybe I should look for the specific change.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look for where the changes are in each mutant.

Let me look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:

Wild-type: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...
Mutant 1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

So the change is from CTCGCT to CTACGC in the middle of the first exon. So in the wild-type, it's CTCGCT, mutant 1 is TACGC. Wait, perhaps it's a substitution.

Wait, wait, maybe it's a point mutation. Let me count the nucleotides. Let's see:

Comparing the sequences:

Wild-type: positions 1-20: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

So, looking at the first change: WT has TTT CTC, mutant has TCT.

Wait, the first part of WT is TTTC, and mutant has TTCT. Wait, perhaps it's a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact point of change is in the codon.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the consequences of each mutation on the protein product. Because the anti-nutritional compound is synthesized by the gene product. So, if the mutation leads to a premature stop codon, the protein might be truncated, which could disrupt its function. Alternatively, a missense mutation could change an amino acid, possibly inactivating the enzyme.

So the question is, which mutation leads to a frameshift or a premature stop codon, or a missense that disrupts the gene function.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The change is in some part of the sequence. Let me look at the DNA sequences.

Wild-type gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking at the first part where the sequences differ:

WT: ...TTTCGCTGGTA...
Mutant 1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTA...

Wait, let me see the exact positions. Maybe it's better to write the sequences:

WT: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: ATG T T C TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, so compared to WT, the first three nucleotides after ATG are TTT in WT, and TT C in mutant 1? Or perhaps looking at the exact nucleotides:

WT: positions 4-10: TTT CTC GCT
Mutant1: positions 4-10: T CTAC GCT

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact nucleotides where they differ.

Wait, perhaps the sequence comparison is better done letter by letter.

Looking at the given sequences:

Wild-type starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGT
