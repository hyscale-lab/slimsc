Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's go through it step by step.

So, the setup: they did a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes, G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants for each and some double mutants. The idea is to see how these genes contribute to resistance against the fungal disease.

The results show the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild-type (WT). Wild-type is 100%, which is full resistance. Let's list out the data:

- g1: 75% → so less resistance than WT. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance, but not completely.
- g2: 0% → no resistance. So without G2, the plant is super susceptible. That's a big effect.
- g3: 50% → half the resistance. So knocking out G3 reduces resistance but not as much as G2.
- g1g3: 10% → very low resistance. That's worse than either single mutant.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2 alone. So when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, no resistance.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2 alone. So when G1 and G2 are both out, no resistance.

Wait, what's the question again? It's about the interaction between these genes and their functions. We're told that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So probably, one of them is a master regulator.

The options are about which gene is the transcription factor, and how the others interact with each other in terms of gene redundancy, pleiotropy, epistasis, etc.

I remember that epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of B depends on A. So if you have a mutation in A, the mutation in B doesn't matter anymore.

Gene redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other's functions. So if you knock out one, the other can take over, but knocking both out causes a more severe phenotype.

Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure how that comes into play here.

So, looking at the data:

g2 has 0% resistance. That's really low, suggesting that G2 is essential for resistance. If G2 is a transcription factor, then it might be upstream, activating other genes. So without G2, the downstream genes aren't expressed, leading to no resistance.

Looking at the double mutants:

g2g3 is 0% → same as g2. So when G2 is knocked out, adding G3 knockout doesn't change the resistance. That implies that in the absence of G2, G3 doesn't contribute. So G3's function is downstream of G2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

Similarly, g1g2 is 0% → same as g2. So when G2 is knocked out, G1's knockout doesn't matter. So G2 is epistatic to G1 as well. So G2 is acting upstream of G1 and G3.

Wait, but what about g1 alone? Its resistance is 75%, which is less than WT. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance, but it's not as bad as when G2 is knocked out. So G1 is downstream of G2, perhaps. Because when G2 is present, G1 helps, but when both are absent, it's worse.

But wait, g2g3 is 0% (same as g2), so G3's effect is only felt when G2 is present. Similarly, when G2 is present, G1 is contributing as well.

Looking at the g1g3 double mutant: resistance is 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either single knockout. That suggests that G1 and G3 are each contributing to resistance, but they might not be redundant. Because if they were redundant, the double mutant would have the same phenotype as either single. But here, it's worse, so perhaps they function in separate pathways. Or maybe they work together in some way.

Wait, but let me think about the epistatic relationships.

If G2 is the transcription factor upstream, then any downstream genes (like G1 and G3) would have their effects dependent on G2. So if G2 is knocked out, the downstream genes don't matter. Hence, g2
