Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Let's think.

Wait, the problem says both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. So, no acceleration involved, right? That probably means I can use special relativity here, maybe time dilation or length contraction.

The ejecta sees the galaxy moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but that's a really high speedâ€”like a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me check: the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2c. Hmm, that's 20% the speed of light. Not super high, but relativistic effects might matter here.

So the problem is about time and distance between two frames. The time given is in the ejecta frame. I need to find the distance in the galaxy frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta frame.

Wait, but time in one frame relates to the other via the Lorentz transformation. Oh, right, time dilation. But wait, how does this work when something is moving relative to another frame?

Let me remember. The time experienced in one frame (proper time) is related to the other frame's time. The formula is t = gamma * (t' + (v x')/c
