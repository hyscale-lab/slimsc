Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova and some motion. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Hmm, the question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. So from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused about the reference frames here. So the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center, but in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards them. So I think this is a problem involving relative velocity and maybe time dilation due to special relativity, but I'm not entirely sure.

Let me think. In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at some velocity. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. Since both are inertial, we can use the velocity addition formula from special relativity to find the actual velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but wait. If in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at v = 60,000 km/s, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at the same speed but opposite direction, right? Because the velocity between the two frames is the same in magnitude. So the ejecta's speed
