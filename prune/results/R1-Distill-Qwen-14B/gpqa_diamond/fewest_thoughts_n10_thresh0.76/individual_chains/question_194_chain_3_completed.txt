Alright, so I've got this problem about calculating the partition function for a system of three spins. The spins are S1, S2, and S3, each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, okay, I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor exp(-βE), right? β is 1/(kT). So I need to find all possible configurations of S1, S2, S3, calculate the energy for each, then sum exp(-βE) for each.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them all.

Let me think, the spins can be in states where all are +1, two are +1 and one is -1, etc. But maybe it's easier to group the states by their total energy because some will have the same E.

So first, I need to compute the energy E for each state.

The energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

Let me compute S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3 for each state.

Case 1: All spins up (+1, +1, +1)
Each product S_i S_j is 1. So sum is 3. So E = -J * 3 = -3J.

Case 2: Two spins up, one down. Let's say S3 is -1, others +1. Then:
S1S2 = (+1)(+1)=1
S1S3= (+1)(-1)=-1
S2S3= (+1)(-1)=-1
Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait, wait. E is negative J multiplied by the sum. So for case 2, sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Case 3: One spin up, two down. For example, S1=+1, others -1. Then:
S1S2=(+1)(-1)=-1
S1S3=(+1)(-1)=-1
S2S3=(-1)(-1)=1
Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, same as case 2? Hmm, but wait, let me check another configuration in case 3. Say, S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (-1)
S1S3 = (-1)
S2S3 = (+1)
Sum: -1-1+1 = -1. So same E as before. Hmm, so all cases where two are down and one up - same as two up and one down?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Let me take another case: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

Then:
S1S2 = -1
S1S3 = +1
S2S3 = -1
Sum: -1+1-1 = -1. So same as before. So in any state where exactly one spin is different, the sum is -1, leading to E= J.

But wait, wait. What if all three spins are down? Let's see.

Case 4: All spins down (-1, -1, -1)
S1S2 = 1, since (-1)(-1)=1, same for S1S3 and S2S3. Sum is 3. So E = -J*3 = -3J. Same as case 1.

So, the possible energies are -3J, J, and maybe another value?

Wait, wait, I thought all two-up and one-down, and one-up and two-down give E=J, but what about the case where all are same but opposite?

Wait, let me check another configuration. Suppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum 1-1-1=-1, E = J.

Another case: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Sum is (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1. E= J.

Wait a minute, so what's happening? For all the cases except when all are same, whether two up or two down, the sum is -1, leading to E=J. So how many states have E=-3J? Only two: all up and all down.

Then the rest of the 6 states (since 8-2=6) have E= J? Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.

Wait, each spin can be +1 or -1, so 8 states:

1. +1, +1, +1 → sum 3 → E=-3J.
2. +1, +1, -1 → sum 1 -1 -1 =-1 → E= J.
3. +1, -1, +1 → sum -1 +1 -1= -1 → E= J.
4. +1, -1, -1 → sum -1 -1 +1 =-1 → E= J.
5. -1, +1, +1 → sum -1 -1 +1= -1 → E= J.
6. -1, +1, -1 → sum 1 -1 +1 = 1 → E= -J*(1) = -J. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me recalculate for state 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

So S1S2 = (-1)(+1)=-1.

S1S3 = (-1)(-1)=1.

S2S3= (+1)(-1) = -1.

Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. So E= J.

Wait, that's the same as before. Then state 6's sum is -1. So E= J.

Wait, same for all the other states except the two all-up and all-down.

Let me check state 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, +1.

S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.

Sum: 1 -1 -1 =-1 → E= J.

State 8: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1 → sum 3 → E= -3J.

Wait, but earlier I thought state 6 had sum 1, but no, I made a mistake. So all states where exactly two are same and one different, the sum is -1, leading to E= J. So the only two states with E=-3J are all up and all down.

So in that case, how many states have E= J?

Wait, 8 total states, minus 2 (all up and all down) → 6 states with E= J.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck each state:

1. All up → sum 3 → E=-3J.

2. (+1, +1, -1): sum 1-1-1= -1 → E= J.

3. (+1, -1, +1): sum -1 +1 -1= -1 → E= J.

4. (+1, -1, -1): sum -1 -1 +1= -1 → E= J.

5. (-1, +1, +1): sum -1 -1 +1= -1 → E= J.

6. (-1, +1, -1): sum 1 -1 +1=1 → E= -J.

Wait wait, no, in state 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (-1)(1) = -1.

S1S3 = (-1)(-1)=1.

S2S3 = (1)(-1)=-1.

Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. So E= J.

Wait, so state 6's sum is -1, so E= J. So all 6 states except the two all-same have E= J.

Hmm, that can't be right. Because when all three spins are aligned, the sum is 3. When two are aligned and one is opposite, the sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1, leading to E= J.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for state 6.

Wait, state 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Compute each product:

S1S2: (-1)(+1) = -1.

S1S3: (-1)(-1)=1.

S2S3: (+1)(-1) = -1.

Sum: (-1) + 1 + (-1) = (-1 -1) +1 = -2+1= -1. So E= J.

So in this case, all six states except the two all-same have E= J.

Wait, so that can't be right because 6 states with E= J, and 2 with E= -3J. So the partition function Z would be:

Z = sum [e^{β E} ] for each state.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor is exp(-β E), because E is the energy.

Wait no, the Boltzmann factor is e^{-β E}.

Wait, Z is the sum over all states of exp( -β E_i ), where E_i is the energy of state i.

So for each state, compute e^{-β E_i}.

So for the two states with E = -3J: each contributes e^{-β (-3J)} = e^{3β J}.

The six states with E= J each contribute e^{-β J}.

So Z = 2 * e^{3 β J} + 6 * e^{-β J}.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check:

Option A: 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ} → No, because the first term would be e^{-3Jβ}.

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Yes, that's what I think.

Wait, but looking at the options:

A) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)
B) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)
C) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)
D) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)

So the correct Z would be 2 e^{3J β} + 6 e^{-J β}, which is option B.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Because in the energy term, E is -3J for all up and all down, so e^{-β E} is e^{-β (-3J)} = e^{3β J}.

And for the other six states with E= J, e^{-β J}.

So Z = 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J} → which is option B.


To calculate the partition function \( Z \) for the given system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start with the energy expression:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \right).
\]

### Step 1: Enumerate all possible states and their energies
There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states for the three spins. By evaluating the energy for each state, we find:

1. **All spins up (\( +1, +1, +1 \))**:  
   \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \).  
   Sum: \( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \).  
   Energy: \( E = -J \cdot 3 = -3J \).

2. **All spins down (\( -1, -1, -1 \))**:  
   \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \).  
   Sum: \( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \).  
   Energy: \( E = -J \cdot 3 = -3J \).

3. **Two spins up, one spin down**:  
   For example, \( (+1, +1, -1) \):  
   \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \).  
   Sum: \( 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \).  
   Energy: \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).  

   Similarly, all other states with two spins up and one spin down will also have \( E = J \).

4. **One spin up, two spins down**:  
   For example, \( (+1, -1, -1) \):  
   \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \).  
   Sum: \( -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 \).  
   Energy: \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).  

   Similarly, all other states with one spin up and two spins down will also have \( E = J \).

### Step 2: Group states by energy
From the above, we find:
- **2 states** have \( E = -3J \) (all spins up and all spins down).
- **6 states** have \( E = J \) (all other configurations).

### Step 3: Calculate the partition function
The partition function is given by:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E}.
\]

For the two states with \( E = -3J \), the contribution is:

\[
2 \cdot e^{-\beta (-3J)} = 2 \cdot e^{3J\beta}.
\]

For the six states with \( E = J \), the contribution is:

\[
6 \cdot e^{-\beta J}.
\]

Thus, the total partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
Comparing with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect signs).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect exponents).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect exponents and coefficients).

The correct answer is **Option B**.
