Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to break it down step by step. I need to figure out which compound the spectral data corresponds to.

First, let's look at the question. The chemist found a white solid, and there are some spectral data given. The options are four different aromatic compounds, each with chlorine substituents. My goal is to match the spectral data to one of these.

The data given includes mass spec, IR, and 1H NMR. Let me go through each one and see what they tell me.

Starting with the mass spectrometry. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%, so that's the molecular weight. Then there's a peak at 158 (32%). Hmm, what could that be? Well, sometimes in mass spec, you can get fragment ions, but the molecular weight is 156, so a peak at 158 might suggest some kind of adduct, like [M + H]+ or maybe a chloride adduct. Alternatively, if the molecule has a double bond or some other structure, maybe there's a fragment that weighs more? Not sure yet, but I'll keep that in mind.

Next, the IR spectrum. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a wide range, but I'm trying to think about what absorptions fall there. Broad peaks in that region often correspond to O-H stretches, like in alcohols, phenols, or carboxylic acids. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is probably a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe it's an ester, acid, aldehyde, or ketone. Let's see.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. The first peak is at 11.0 ppm as a singlet (s) integrating to 1H. That high chemical shift is likely an aldehyde proton, or maybe a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, carboxylic acids typically show a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, but sometimes they can be sharp if deprotonated. Alternatively, an aldehyde's proton is around 9-10 ppm, but it can vary. Wait, but wait, 11.0 is a bit high for an aldehyde. Maybe it's a phenolic OH? No, because phenol OHs are usually around 5 ppm, but if it's exchanging and broad, but in this case, the peak is a singlet, so maybe it's not. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually around 10-12 ppm, but it's often broad because of hydrogen bonding. But in the NMR here, it's a singlet, which is sharp. Wait, that doesn't fit. Unless the sample is a very pure acid, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

The other NMR signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Those look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest coupling between adjacent protons on the ring. So maybe it's a para-substituted ring. Like, if there are substituents in the para position, the adjacent protons would each have two neighboring protons, making them doublets.

Wait, but wait, if the substituents are in para positions, the ring protons would be two doublets, each two protons. So maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with substituents at positions 2 and 5, for example, but that would make the protons split into different patterns.

Wait, let's think about the coupling. For a para-substituted benzene, the adjacent protons would be meta to each substituent. Wait, no, if there are two substituents, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with another substituent in the ortho position, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring has two substituents in positions that create a coupling pattern where each set of two equivalent protons are each a doublet. So maybe if there's a substituent in the para position, and another substituent in another position, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another angle. Let's look at the options. The options are:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
B)4-chlorobenzoic acid
C) Phenyl chloroformate
D)2-chlorobenzoic acid

So, each option has a benzene ring with some substituents. Let me think about each one.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That would have a benzene ring with Cl at position 3, OH at 2, and a formyl (CHO) group at position 1 (since numbering goes in order, so 2 is OH, 3 is Cl, 1 is CHO). Wait, no, wait. The numbering would be such that the substituents get the lowest numbers. So let's see: if it's 2-hydroxy, 3-chloro, and 1-CHO, that's positions 1, 2, 3. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in different positions.

Wait, but the structure is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So the benzaldehyde is at position 1; then positions 2 and 3 have OH and Cl, respectively. So in that
