Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator Ay is given as c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

Wait, so the matrix S is... let me write it down. So S looks like this:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π), so Ay = c * S. So Ay is a 2x2 matrix as well. The problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

The options are A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which statement is correct during the calculation.

First, let's compute the eigenvalues of S, because then I can just multiply by c to get the eigenvalues of Ay.

The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving det(S - λI) = 0.

So the matrix S - λI would be:

[ -λ    -i ]
[ i    -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i)(i) = λ² - (i²). Since i squared is -1, so it's λ² - (-1) = λ² +1. Setting that to zero: λ² +1 =0 → λ²= -1 → λ= ±i.

Wait, so the eigenvalues of S are i and -i. Then the eigenvalues of Ay, which is c multiplied by S, would be c*(i) and c*(-i). Since c is h/(4π), that would be (h/(4π)) * i and negative that.

So the eigenvalues of Ay are i*(h/(4π)) and -i*(h/(4π)).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, and the real parts are ±h/(4π). That doesn't match because our eigenvalues are purely imaginary, with real parts zero. So A can't be right.

Option B says
