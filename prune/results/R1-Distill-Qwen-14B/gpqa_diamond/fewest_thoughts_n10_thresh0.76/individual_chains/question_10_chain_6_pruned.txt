Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question asks which of the options has the highest density among the given exoplanets. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are labeled A to D, each corresponding to one of the options a to d.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, density = mass/volume. Volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, right? But maybe I don't need to calculate each one exactly. Maybe there's a way to compare them without getting too deep into math.

Looking at each option:

Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So, its mass is same as Earth, and radius same. So density would be same as Earth's. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, no, wait. Wait, Earth's average density is around 5.5 g/cm³, yeah. So Earth's density is about 5.5.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and density approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but if the density is given, then it's already 5.5. So this planet's density is the same as Earth's. So maybe not the highest.

Option c) A planet with same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Wait, same composition would mean same density, right? Because density is based on composition. So if it's same composition, its density is same as Earth. But wait, same composition and more mass... let's think. If I have a planet with same composition, so same density, but more mass, that would require a larger radius. So for example, if Earth's mass is M, then this planet's mass is 5M. Since density is the same, the volume would be (5M)/(density). Because Volume = mass/density. Since volume scales with mass^something, maybe to the power of 1, if density is same. So, a more massive planet with same density would have a larger volume. So the radius would be bigger because volume is proportional to radius cubed. But the question is about density. So option c's density is same as Earth's, 5.5, same as a. So why would it have a higher density? Wait, unless the composition being same leads to same density regardless of size. So,
