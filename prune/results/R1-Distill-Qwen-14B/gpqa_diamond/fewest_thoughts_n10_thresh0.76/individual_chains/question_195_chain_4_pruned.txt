Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that there's a planet (let's call it Planet A) with a radius of 1 Earth radius. It's in a circular orbit and has a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star it's orbiting has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. Planet A's orbital period is 3 days.

Now, the question is about a second planet (Planet B) with a radius 2.5 times Earth's. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have so that it can both transit and occult the star. Both planets are in the same system, same orbital plane, and Planet B also has a circular orbit.

Hmm. Okay, so the key here is that for both transit and occultation events to occur, the orbital periods of the two planets must be such that they are in the same orbital plane and their orbital periods are synchronized in a way that they can pass in front and behind each other relative to the star.

Wait, wait. Oh right, for a planet to transit, it must pass in front of the star from our point of view. For occultation, it would be when the planet passes behind the star, so the star eclipses the planet. But how do their orbital periods relate?

I remember that for two planets to have their transits and occultations occur, their orbital periods must be in a ratio that allows their positions to align in these ways. But wait, I'm not sure about that. Another approach: perhaps the orbital periods must be such that their orbital velocities are in the right ratio so that when one transits, the other is in a position to occult, and vice versa.

Wait, maybe I should think about the orbital periods and alignment. Oh, maybe the periods need to be the same? No, that doesn't seem right because they could be in an orbital resonance.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For a planet to both transit and occult, it must pass in front and behind the star as seen from Earth. But for another planet to do that as well, their orbital periods must be such that their positions align in the same line of sight relative to the star at some point.

Alternatively, perhaps a more straightforward approach is to consider the Hill sphere of each planet. Wait, no, that's more about orbital stability. Or maybe it's about the synodic period.

Wait, another thought: for a planet to both transit and occult, the orbital plane must be aligned so that the planet's orbit brings it in front and behind the star. So, for two planets to do this, their orbital periods must allow their positions to coincide in such a way that when one is transiting, the other is in a position to occult, and vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital periods must be such that the second planet's orbital period is a multiple or a fraction of the first planet's period. So that their positions can align for these events.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the orbital mechanics involved.

Transit happens when the planet passes in front of the star, and occultation when it passes behind. For both events to be observed, the planet's orbit must be edge-on relative
