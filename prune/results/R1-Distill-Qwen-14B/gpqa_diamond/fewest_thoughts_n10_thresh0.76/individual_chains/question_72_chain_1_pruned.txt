Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me start by reading the question carefully. So, there's a series of reactions starting with a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature to form product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form the final product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4, with options A to D given.

Hmm, I think I need to break down each step and figure out what's happening in each reaction. Let's start with the first reaction.

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene part is a norbornene structure. The substituent at position 7 is a tert-butoxy group. So, the structure looks something like a norbornene with an oxygen attached to a tert-butyl group.

The first reaction involves two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and in such conditions, substitution reactions often happen. Also, dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups; perhaps some kind of alkylation is taking place.

Wait, the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two substituents at positions 5 and 6. Each of those substituents is a dibromomethyl group. So, each is CH2Br2, but wait, dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2? Or maybe each is CH2-Br, but two in the same position? Wait, no, the structure is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), which means each of the 5 and 6 positions has a CH2Br2 group. Wait, no, that's not possible because dibromomethyl is CH2Br2, which is a -CH2Br group. Oh wait, no, wait. Dibromomethyl would be a group where a methyl group has two bromines attached. So, it's -CH2Br, but wait, that's mono. Wait, maybe it's -CBr2H? Or perhaps it's -CHBr2. Oh wait, the structure is a cyclohexadiene with two substituents. Each substituent is a dibromomethyl group, so each is a -CH2Br group? Or perhaps each is a -CHBr2 group. Wait, no, the name is bis(dibromomethyl), so each substituent is a dibromomethyl group. So, each
