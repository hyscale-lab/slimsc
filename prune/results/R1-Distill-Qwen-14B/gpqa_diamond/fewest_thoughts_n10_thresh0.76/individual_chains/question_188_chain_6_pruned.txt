Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about calculating the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances involve some formula with the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. But wait, rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So it's a special case where a = b = c and alpha = beta = gamma.

The question gives the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and the angles are each 30 degrees. Oh wait, wait, interatomic distance... is that the same as the lattice parameter 'a'? I think so. Because in a crystal, the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice, which for a simple cubic structure would be 'a'. So yeah, a = 10 Å here.

The Miller indices given are (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1. The formula for interplanar spacing d_hkl is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hkl)( (cos α + cos β + cos γ) ) / a² ) ) Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, no, the formula for a rhombohedral system (which is a special case of a hexagonal or triclinic system?) Wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where a = b = c and all angles are equal. So the interplanar distance formula for a general crystal system
