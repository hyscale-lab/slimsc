Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, HCl, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think.

First, the problem gives me the volumes and concentrations of each solution. Let me jot them down:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base)

I think the first step is to figure out how much acid and base are present in terms of moles. Because when you mix them, the H+ and OH- will react. Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. Same with HCl, a strong acid.

So, let me calculate the moles for each component.

Starting with CH3COOH. Its concentration is 0.1 M, volume 500 mL which is 0.5 L. Moles = Molarity × Volume, so 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will add more H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will add OH- ions.

Next, HCl: 0.2 M, 400 mL is 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is strong, it will donate 0.08 moles of H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M, 300 mL is 0.3 L. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when these are mixed, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. But wait, what about the acetic acid? Because acetic acid is a weak acid, it might not react with the OH- as readily as H+ ions from strong acids.

Wait, but in solution, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will deprotonate the acetic acid, right? Or wait, maybe not. Let me think. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it can donate a proton (H+), but when you have excess OH-, it might take that proton, turning CH3COOH into CH3COO^-.

So perhaps the OH- will react with both the H+ from HCl and the CH3COOH. Hmm, but let's calculate the total H+ and OH-.

Wait, let's calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

First, from HCl: 0.08 moles H+.

From CH3COOH: since it's a weak acid, it doesn't release as much H+ as a strong acid, but when mixed with a strong base, the base will deprotonate some of it. Alternatively, perhaps the OH- will react with H+ first, and any remaining will react with the acetic acid.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. Wait, no: CH3COOH is a weak acid, so in presence of excess OH-, it can act as an acid, providing H+ to react with OH-.

Wait, maybe it's better to handle this in two steps:

1. Calculate the total moles of H+ from all sources (HCl and CH3COOH).
2. Calculate the total moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2).

But wait, actually, the reaction will proceed as such: OH- will first neutralize any H+ from the strong acid (HCl), and then any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH), which will donate H+ (so it's a bit more complex).

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to consider all the H+ and OH- in solution, considering that the HCl is a strong acid and thus fully ionized, and the Ba(OH)2 is fully ionized as well.

So, let's proceed step by step.

First, calculate the total moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, no. HCl is a strong acid, so it provides 0.08 moles of H+. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't release all its H+; but when OH- is present, it will deprotonate some of it. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is to calculate the total H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the net moles of H+ and OH- after mixing.

Wait, but when mixing, the total volume changes. Let me compute the total volume first. The solutions are 500 mL, 400 mL, 300 mL. So total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

So, total volume is 1.2 L.

Now, calculate the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 mol OH-.

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol CH3COOH.

Now, when you mix all these, the OH- will react with H+ from HCl first, because HCl is a strong acid. So, the H+ from HCl and OH- will neutralize each other.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Moles of OH-: 0.18 mol.

So, when OH- reacts with H+, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So, 0.08 mol H+ will react with 0.08 mol OH-.

After this reaction, we'll have:

Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

So, we've used up all the H+ from HCl, and we have 0.10 mol OH- left.

Now, what about the CH3COOH? Since we have OH- left, it will react with CH3COOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So CH3COOH is a weak acid; it can donate a proton to OH-.

So moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 mol.

Moles of OH- remaining: 0.10 mol.

So OH- will react with CH3COOH. Let's see: 0.05 mol of CH3COOH can react with 0.05 mol OH- to produce 0.05 mol CH3COO^-.

After this reaction:

Moles of CH3COOH left: 0.05 - 0.05 = 0 mol.

Moles of OH- left: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Wait, but wait a second. CH3COOH is a weak acid. When OH- is added, it deprotonates it. So each mole of OH- consumes a mole of CH3COOH, producing a mole of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water.

So after this, we have some OH- left (0.05 mol) and some acetate ions.

Wait, but the next step is to see what remains in solution.

So after all this, the total solution is 1.2 L.

The remaining species after neutralization:

- Excess OH-: 0.05 mol.

- Acetate ions (CH3COO^-): 0.05 mol.

And any other ions? Well, Ba^2+ from Ba(OH)2. Let's see: Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.09 mol → moles of Ba^2+ is 0.09 mol.

But since we've already accounted for the OH- in the neutralization, the Ba^2+ remains in solution. But Ba^2+ is a spectator ion; it doesn't react further.

So the main ions in solution are OH- and CH3COO^-.

Wait, but the excess OH- is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L. So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

But wait, the presence of acetate ions might affect the pH. Acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetic acid). So in solution, acetate can hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

So the solution now has:

- Excess OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.05 mol.

- Acetate ions (CH3COO^-): 0.05 mol.

So the total OH- concentration is from both the excess OH- and the hydrolysis of acetate.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If all the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 mol, and after reacting with H+ and CH3COOH, we have 0.05 mol left. So that's a significant amount. Also, the acetate ions can hydrolyze to produce OH-.

So the solution will be basic, and the main contributors to OH- are both the excess OH- and the hydrolysis of acetate.

But wait, since the excess OH- is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L, let me compute its concentration first.

Concentration of OH- from excess: 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

But then, the acetate ions (0.05 mol) in 1.2 L is about 0.04167 M.

Now, acetate (CH3COO^-) is a weak base. It can accept a proton to form CH3COOH. In water, it can react:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. The Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8 × 10^-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56e-10.

So Kb is small, meaning that the hydrolysis of acetate isn't going to produce a lot of OH-.

But given that we already have a significant amount of OH- from excess, maybe the contribution from acetate hydrolysis is negligible compared to the OH- already present.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of excess OH- will suppress the hydrolysis of acetate (Le Chatelier's principle), shifting the equilibrium.

Wait, because if OH- is already high, adding more OH- would shift the acetate hydrolysis reaction to the left, reducing the production of OH- from acetate. So maybe the OH- from acetate is negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution's pH is dominated by the excess OH-.

So let's compute the initial OH- concentration from the excess.

OH- concentration = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. Wait, that's option A.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Because the acetate might also contribute some OH-.

But given that Kb is very small, the hydrolysis may not contribute much. Let's do a quick calculation.

The hydrolysis reaction for acetate:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The initial concentration of acetate is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

Let x be the concentration of OH- produced from acetate hydrolysis.

At equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.04167 - x

[CH3COOH] = x

[OH-] = 0.04167 + x

But since Kb is 5.56e-10, which is very small, x will be very small compared to 0.04167. So we can approximate [OH-] ≈ 0.04167.

So Kb ≈ (x^2) / (0.04167) = 5.56e-10.

Solving for x: x^2 = 5.56e-10 * 0.04167 ≈ 2.3e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(2.3e-11) ≈ 4.8e-6 M.

So the additional OH- from acetate is about 4.8e-6 M, which is much smaller than the 0.04167 M from excess OH-. So the contribution is negligible. Therefore, the main source of OH- is the excess from Ba(OH)2.

So the OH- concentration is approximately 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) → Let's calculate that.

0.04167 is approximately 4.167e-2 → log(4.167e-2) is log(4.167) + log(1e-2).

Log(4.167) is about 0.620. So 0.620 - 2 = -1.380.

So pOH ≈ 1.38, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62.

Wait, but another thought: when mixing the three solutions, the total volume is 1.2 L. Did I account for that correctly? Yes, I think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial neutralization steps.

Let me double-check the neutralization steps.

HCl provides 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.18 mol OH-.

So, H+ and OH- react in a 1:1 ratio.

So 0.08 mol H+ + 0.08 mol OH- → 0.08 mol H2O.

Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Now, the remaining OH- can react with CH3COOH.

CH3COOH (0.05 mol) + OH- (0.10 mol) → ?

Each mole of CH3COOH reacts with one mole of OH- to produce CH3COO^- and H2O.

So, since CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, all of it will react with 0.05 mol OH-.

So remaining OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So, yes, I did this correctly. So the excess OH- is 0.05 mol, giving a concentration of 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M. So indeed, the pH is around 12.62.

So the answer should be option A, 12.62.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixing of three solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base). The total volume of the mixture is 1.2 L.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each component
- **HCl**:  
  Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).
- **Ba(OH)₂**:  
  Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
- **CH₃COOH**:  
  Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 2: Neutralization reactions
1. **Reaction between H⁺ (from HCl) and OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂):**  
   The strong acid (HCl) and strong base (Ba(OH)₂) neutralize each other in a 1:1 molar ratio:  
   \[
   \text{H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O}
   \]  
   Moles of H⁺ = 0.08 mol, and moles of OH⁻ = 0.18 mol.  
   After neutralization:  
   - Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Reaction between remaining OH⁻ and CH₃COOH:**  
   The weak acid (CH₃COOH) reacts with the remaining OH⁻:  
   \[
   \text{CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O}
   \]  
   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.05 mol, and moles of OH⁻ = 0.10 mol.  
   After neutralization:  
   - Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - CH₃COOH is fully consumed, producing 0.05 mol of CH₃COO⁻.

### Step 3: Determine the concentration of OH⁻
The remaining OH⁻ in the solution is 0.05 mol, distributed in a total volume of 1.2 L.  
\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate pOH and pH
The pOH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is then:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Step 5: Verify contributions from CH₃COO⁻
CH₃COO⁻ (the conjugate base of CH₃COOH) can hydrolyze in water to produce OH⁻:  
\[
\text{CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ↔ CH₃COOH + OH⁻}.
\]  
The \( K_b \) for CH₃COO⁻ is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.8 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.56 \times 10^{-10} \).  
Given the small \( K_b \), the contribution of OH⁻ from CH₃COO⁻ is negligible compared to the 0.04167 M OH⁻ already present.

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is dominated by the excess OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂, giving a pH of approximately **12.62**.
