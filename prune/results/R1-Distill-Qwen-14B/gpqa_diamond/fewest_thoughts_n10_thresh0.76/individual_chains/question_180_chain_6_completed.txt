Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me see. The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that.

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system. Oh right, in these types of problems, the minimum potential energy configuration is when the charges are as close as possible, but wait here 12 are fixed at 2m away. So I guess the 13th is at the center.

Wait, each charge is 2e. So all of them are the same kind of charge. Since they're all positive, they'll repel each other. But since 12 are fixed at 2m from P, the 13th is at P. So what's the potential energy here?

I remember that the potential energy of a system of point charges is given by the sum over all pairs of (k * q1 * q2) / r. But wait, because it's the total potential energy, each pair is counted once. So for N charges, each pair contributes once.

But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, so each of them is at a distance of 2m from the 13th charge. So the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m), right?

Wait, but each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the 13th is also 2e. So each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m). Oh wait, but 12 such pairs, so 12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2m)].

But wait, what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Since they're all fixed at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other aren't given. Oh, but the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So are they all located on a sphere of radius 2 m around P? In that case, each of the 12 charges is 2e and located on the surface of this sphere. So the distance between any two charges on the sphere's surface would vary, but I think in the minimum potential energy scenario, the charges would arrange themselves as far apart as possible. Wait, but if they're fixed in position, their mutual potential energy is fixed as well.

Hmm, but the problem states that the system is isolated, so maybe the mutual potential of the 12 charges is fixed and we just have to compute the potential energy between each of them and the 13th charge at P.

Wait the question is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is minimized, but given that they are fixed at 2m from P, perhaps the mutual distances are fixed.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the 12 are fixed on a sphere or just at a fixed distance of 2m from P but can move on the surface. Wait, the question says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are fixed at 2m from P, but their exact positions relative to each other might vary. Hmm. But for the minimum energy, perhaps the charges arrange themselves so that their mutual repulsion is the least, but that's probably when they're as far apart as possible. But with all at 2m from P, the mutual distance for two charges would be at least 4m (if they are diametrically opposite on the sphere) up to 0m if they are the same point (but that's impossible). So the minimum mutual potential energy between the 12 charges would be when each pair is as far apart as possible, which is 4m. Wait, but if they are arranged so that each is as far apart as possible, which would be a regular icosahedron or something, but regardless, the exact mutual distances might complicate things.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give any information about the mutual distances of the 12 charges. Oh, perhaps it's considering that the potential energy between the 12 charges isn't contributing because they are fixed in a configuration where their mutual potential is already determined, and perhaps the problem is asking only about the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12.

Wait, the question says, "the minimum energy of this system." So perhaps the system's minimum potential energy arises from the interactions between the 13th charge and the others, but not their mutual interactions. Because the 12 are fixed, so their mutual potential energy can't be changed. Hmm, but wait, that's not necessarily correct. Because if they're fixed at 2m from P but their positions can vary on that sphere, their mutual distances can change, affecting their mutual potential energy.

Wait, but the problem states that the 12 are 'constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P.' So their positions are fixed at 2m from P, but it's unclear whether they are constrained to a particular arrangement on that sphere or can move freely on the sphere. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are fixed in space at 2m from P, but they are point charges that can move on the surface of the sphere. So their mutual potential energy would be a function of their arrangement. But since the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps we have to consider both the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, and the potential energy between the 12 themselves.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the potential energy between the 12 charges because they are fixed in such a way that their mutual distances are considered irrelevant, or perhaps their mutual potential energy doesn't contribute to the minimum energy since the 13th is the only one moving.

Wait, but when you fix the 12 charges at 2m from P, their mutual potential energy is a separate term. So the total potential energy U is the sum of:

1. The potential energy between the 13th charge at P and each of the 12 charges (each at 2m).

2. The potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges, which are at mutual distances that depend on their arrangement.

But calculating the second part would be complicated because it depends on the exact arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere. Since the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the mutual potential energy. Hmm, wait, for positive charges, the minimum potential energy would be when they're as far apart as possible. But how would that be arranged?

Wait, but maybe the problem is simplifying it by considering that the mutual potential energy of the 12 charges is negligible or that it's not part of the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only to calculate the potential between the 13th charge and the 12, not including their mutual interactions.

Wait, let me re-read the question. The problem says: What is the minimum energy of this system correct to three decimals? So perhaps the minimum energy is just the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, and the mutual potential of the 12 is fixed and perhaps considered as part of the system's setup but not contributing to the minimum in this calculation. Hmm, but that doesn't quite make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 is considered fixed and thus doesn't affect the minimum; perhaps the problem is only considering the energy due to the 13th charge and the 12.

Wait, let me think about how potential energy is calculated. The total potential energy U is the sum of all pairs. So in this case, U = U_12_13 + U_12_12, where U_12_13 is the potential energy between the 12 and the 13th, and U_12_12 is the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

But to find the minimum energy of the system, we have to consider all possible contributions. So if the 12 charges can arrange themselves in any way while being fixed at 2m from P, then the mutual potential energy U_12_12 would be minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible.

Wait, but how are the mutual distances between the 12 charges calculated when they're all on a sphere of radius 2m? The minimum potential energy (since they are like charges) would occur when the charges are as far apart as possible. For n points on a sphere, the minimal potential energy configuration is when the points are equally spaced, i.e., the vertices of a regular polyhedron inscribed in the sphere.

But for 12 points, that's the vertices of an icosahedron. But calculating the mutual distances for that is complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is giving a setup where the mutual potential energy is already accounted for in some way, but I don't see that.

Wait, but perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges isn't part of the calculation because the 12 are constrained to their positions, so their mutual distances are fixed. But since the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but not necessarily constrained to any particular arrangement among themselves, their mutual potential could vary. But the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system, so perhaps I have to find the configuration where the mutual potential is minimized, which would be when the charges are as far apart as possible. 

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is zero or not considered, but that doesn't make sense because they are all same charges.

Wait, let me think again. Each charge is 2e, so all are positive. So the potential energy between any two is positive because same charges repel.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimal energy is when the mutual potential between the 12 is as small as possible (which for like charges is when they are as far apart as possible, but that would be the maximum distance apart, which would minimize the potential energy because U is proportional to 1/r).

Wait, no, wait. The potential energy between two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. Since q1 and q2 are positive, U is positive. So to minimize the total potential energy, you would want to maximize the distances between each pair, which would minimize each U term because 1/r would be smaller (since r is larger). So for the 12 charges, arranging them as far apart as possible would lead to the minimal mutual potential energy.

So, the total potential energy is the sum of all pairs. For the 12 charges, the mutual potential is the sum over all pairs of (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charge i and charge j. So to minimize this sum, each r_ij should be as large as possible.

But in a sphere of radius 2m, the maximum possible distance between any two points on the sphere's surface is 4m (diametrically opposite). So if all pairs are at 4m, then each term would be (k*(2e)^2)/(4m). But wait, that's only possible if all the 12 charges are arranged so that every pair is 4m apart, which is impossible. Because with 12 points on a sphere, you can't have all pairs at maximum distance.

So perhaps the problem is making an approximation, assuming that the mutual distances are large and each pair contributes a certain amount. Alternatively, maybe the mutual potential energy is considered negligible compared to the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and not the mutual energy between the 12. Because the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but perhaps their mutual arrangement isn't considered for the minimum energy. But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me look at the options given. They are of the order 1e-26 to 1e-27, which suggests that each term is being calculated individually, perhaps without the combination of all mutual terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential of the 12 charges is being considered, but in a way that it's not part of the calculation because they are fixed. Wait, but the problem says "the minimum energy of this system". So perhaps the mutual potential of the 12 is fixed, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are fixed in place, so their mutual distances are fixed, and thus their mutual potential energy is a constant. But the question is about the system's minimum energy. So perhaps the only variable is the potential between the 13th charge and the 12. But that doesn't make sense because the 13th is fixed at P, so the potential between it and the 12 is fixed as well.

Wait, but the problem says "isolated system", so all interactions contribute to the potential energy. But if the 12 are fixed in space, their mutual potential is fixed, so the total U would be U_12_13 plus U_12_12. But without knowing the exact arrangement of the 12, we can't calculate U_12_12.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the problem is only considering the potential between the 13th charge and the 12 others, and not their mutual potential. Because considering the mutual potential would require knowing their exact positions, which isn't provided.

So, the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m), where 2m is the distance between each of the 12 and the 13th. Since there are 12 charges, each contributing the same amount, the total would be 12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2m)].

Let me calculate that. Let's compute each term:

k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e is elementary charge, 1.602e-19 C.

So each charge is 2e, so 3.204e-19 C.

The distance is 2 m.

So for each pair, the potential energy is (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / (2). Then multiplied by 12.

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate (2e)^2: (2 * 1.602e-19 C)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 ≈ 1.026e-37 C².

But wait, (2e)^2 is (2)^2 * e^2 = 4e². So maybe it's easier to compute 4e², but let's proceed.

So for one pair: U = k * (2e) * (2e) / r.

Wait, no, wait. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k q1 q2) / r.

So for each of the 12 charges, q1 = 2e, q2 = 2e, r=2m.

So each U_pair = (k*(2e)^2) / (2m).

So for 12 pairs, U_total = 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Simplify:

U_total = (12 * k * 4e²) / (2 * 2m) = (12 * k *4 e²) / (4m) ) → simplifying, 12 * (k *4 e²) /4 m → 12 * (k e²) / m.

Wait wait, 4e² multiplied by 12, divided by (2 * 2 m) = 4 m.

Wait:

Wait, alternative approach: each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m). So 12 pairs would be 12 * (k*(4e²))/(2m) → 12 * (4k e²)/(2m) = 12 * 2k e²/m = 24 k e² / m.

Yes, that's correct.

So U = (24 k e²) / m.

Wait, m is the distance, which is 2 m. Wait, wait, the distance is 2 meters.

Wait, wait, the r is 2 meters. So the denominator is 2 m. So:

U = 24 * k * e² / (2m) → 12 k e² / m.

Wait no, 24 k e² divided by (2 m) → 12 k e² / m.

Wait, let me correct that.

Each pair: (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2m) = (k *4 e²) / (2m) = (2 k e² ) / m.

Multiply by 12: 12 * 2 k e² / m = 24 k e² / m.

Wait, no, because each pair is 2 ke²/m, 12 pairs would be 24 k e²/m.

Wait, wait, hold on. Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th charge. So for each of the 12 particles, the potential energy between it and the 13th is (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) → 2k e²/m. So 12 such terms would be 12 * 2k e²/m = 24 k e²/m.

Wait, but wait, wait. What's the unit of k? It's N·m²/C². e is in C.

So let's plug in the numbers.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

m = 2 m.

So:

U = (24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2) / 2.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the denominator is m, which is 2 m. So U would be 24 * k * e² / (2m) → 24*k*e^2/(2*2) → 24 k e²/(4) = 6 k e².

Wait, no, wait, m is 2 m, so m=2.

So U = 24 * k * e^2 / 2 → 12 k e².

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, no, each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m) → (k *4 e²)/ (2 * 2) ) → because m is 2.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me compute it correctly.

Each pair:

U_pair = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / r.

r = 2 m.

So U_pair = (k *4 e²) / (2).

So U_pair = (4 k e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

So for 12 pairs, U_total =12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, no, no, because each pair is a single term. Wait, no, wait. Each pair is between the 13th charge and each of the 12. So there are 12 pairs, each contributing 2 k e².

So 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

So U =24 k e².

Wait, but wait, let me compute this with numbers.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e =1.602e-19 C.

So compute 24 * k * e^2:

24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 → approx. 2.566e-38 C².

So:

24 * 8.988e9 = 24 * ~9e9 → 216e9 = 2.16e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 2.16e11 * 2.566e-38 = (2.16 * 2.566) * 1e-27 → approximately 5.549 * 1e-27.

Wait, 2.16 * 2.566 ≈ let me compute that.

2 * 2.566 is 5.132, 0.16 * 2.566 ≈ 0.4106 → total ≈5.5426.

So 5.5426e-27 J.

Wait, but this is 24 k e².

Wait, no, because k is 8.988e9, not 9e9. Let me be more precise.

Compute 24 * 8.988e9 = 24 * 8.988e9 = 24 * 8.988 = 215.712 → 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Multiply by (1.602e-19)^2 → (2.566e-38) → 2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = multiply the coefficients.

2.15712 * 2.566 ≈ Let's compute:

2 * 2.566 = 5.132.

0.15712 * 2.566 ≈ approximately 0.157 * 2.566 ≈ 0.157 *2 = 0.314, 0.157 *0.566≈0.0893 → total ≈ 0.4033.

So total 5.132 + 0.4033 ≈5.5353.

So 5.5353e-27 J.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 7.056e-27.

Option B is 2.822e-26.

Option A is 5.645e-26.

Wait, my calculation is about 5.535e-27 J, which is about 5.535 x 10^-27 J.

But looking at the options, I don't see that exact value. The closest is option C:7.056e-27. Hmm, that's about 20% higher.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let's recompute 24 * k * e^2.

Wait, let me compute each step again.

Compute e^2 = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So 24 * k * e^2 = 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Calculate 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38:

8.988e9 is 8.988 * 1e9.

Multiply that by 2.566e-38: 8.988 * 2.566 = let's compute that.

8 * 2.566 = 20.528; 0.988 * 2.566 ≈ 2.538.

Total ≈ 23.066.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.066e(9-38) = 23.066e-29.

Multiply by 24: 23.066e-29 *24 = 23.066 *24 ≈ 553.584e-29 = 5.53584e-27 J.

So about 5.536e-27 J.

But none of the options match this exactly. The options are:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Hmm, my calculation is about 5.536e-27 J, which is close to option C, which is 7.056e-27, but that's 27% higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me think again.

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2m from P. So the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is (k*(2e)^2)/(2m). So each contributes 2k e² / m.

Wait, but wait, m is 2, so 2k e² / 2 = k e².

So each pair contributes k e².

So 12 pairs contribute 12 k e².

Ah, that's a different approach. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the calculation.

So U_total = 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) → 12 * (4 k e²)/(2*2) ) → wait, no.

Wait, alternatively, U_pair = (k*(2e)*(2e)) / (2m) → (4 k e²)/(2m) → 2 k e²/m.

Wait, m is 2, so 2 k e² / 2 = k e².

So each pair contributes k e².

12 pairs contribute 12 k e².

So U_total = 12 k e².

Ah, that's different. So let me recalculate with that.

So U =12 * k * e².

k is 8.988e9, e is 1.602e-19.

So 12 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 12 *8.988e9 = 12 *8.988e9 = 107.856e9 = 1.07856e11.

(1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

So 1.07856e11 * 2.566e-38 = 1.07856 *2.566= approx 2.766e-27.

Wait, 1.07856e11 * 2.566e-38 = (1.07856 *2.566) * 1e-27.

1.07856 * 2.566 ≈ approx 2.767.

So U=2.767e-27 J.

Wait, that's about 2.767e-27 J.

Looking at options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27, but it's more than double. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 4 somewhere.

Wait, let's recalculate more carefully.

Compute 12 * k * e².

k =8.988e9.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

So 12 *8.988e9 = 107.856e9 =1.07856e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38:

1.07856e11 * 2.566e-38 = (1.07856 * 2.566) * 1e(11-38) → 1.07856 *2.566 ≈ 2.766.

So 2.766e-27 J.

Hmm, but that's 2.766e-27.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value.

Compute 1.07856e11 *2.566e-38.

Let me compute the exponents:

1e11 *1e-38 =1e-27.

Then, 1.07856 *2.566 = let me compute that accurately.

1.07856 *2 =2.15712.

1.07856 *0.566 = let me compute 0.5 *1.07856=0.53928, 0.066 *1.07856≈0.0711 → total ≈0.61038.

So total 2.15712 +0.61038 ≈2.7675.

So 2.7675e-27 J.

Wait, but none of the options have that. The options are:

A)5.645e-26 → 5.6e-26 is 56e-27.

B)2.822e-26 → 28.22e-27.

C)7.056e-27.

D)122.330.

So 2.7675e-27 is closest to option C (7.056e-27) but it's about 2.55 times smaller.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are not all at 2m from P, but each at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are not all 4m. Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their mutual distances could vary.

Wait, but if I include their mutual potential energy, the system's potential energy would be U = U_13_12 + U_12_12.

But the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the mutual potential between the 12 is negative, which would lower the total energy.

Wait, but all charges are positive, so their mutual potential energy would be positive. So that can't be. So the minimum energy would be when their mutual potential energy is as small as possible, which would mean as far apart as possible.

Wait, but the mutual potential energy for each pair is positive and would thus add to the total, so to minimize the total energy, we want each of these terms to be as small as possible. Which would be when the mutual r_ij is as large as possible.

So for 12 charges on a sphere of radius 2m, the maximum possible distance between any two is 4m. But 12 points can't all be 4m apart. So perhaps we need to approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is negligible compared to the potential between the 13th charge and the 12.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the potential between the 13th and the 12, and the mutual potential of the 12 is not considered. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms.

Wait, another approach: considering that the 12 charges are identical and located at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are each 2m from P, but their mutual separation could be sqrt( (2m)^2 + (2m)^2 - 2*(2m)(2m) cos(theta) ), where theta is the angle between their position vectors from P.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute the sum.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that the 12 charges are arranged such that their mutual potential energy is zero, but that doesn't make sense for same charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is being considered as zero, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges form a regular dodecahedron or something, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the potential between the 13th charge and the others, and not the mutual terms. So perhaps the answer is about 5.5e-27 J, which isn't among the options. But looking at the options, perhaps option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times my calculation. So I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k q1 q2)/r.

So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy with the 13th is (k*(2e)^2)/(2m). So each pair contributes (k *4 e^2)/(2m) = (2 k e^2)/m.

Since m is 2, that's (2 k e^2)/2 = k e^2 per pair.

So 12 pairs contribute 12 k e^2.

So U = 12 * k e^2.

Yes, that's correct.

So let me compute that again.

k =8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e =1.602e-19 C.

So 12 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 12 *8.988e9 = 1.07856e11.

(1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

Multiply 1.07856e11 *2.566e-38 = 1.07856 *2.566e-27.

1.07856 *2.566 ≈ 2.767.

So U ≈2.767e-27 J.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. However, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of charges. Wait, are there 12 charges or 13? Wait, the 13th is fixed, and 12 are at 2m. So 12 charges contribute. So 12 pairs. Correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the distance is 2 meters, but in Coulomb's law, it's meters, so 2 m is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the value of k more precisely.

k =8.988e9 exactly.

e =1.602176634e-19 C (exact value as per SI units).

So let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 12 * k * e².

12 * 8.988e9 =107.856e9 =1.07856e11.

e^2 = (1.602176634e-19)^2 = (1.602176634)^2 * 1e-38.

1.602176634 squared is about 2.56696985.

So e^2 =2.56696985e-38.

So 1.07856e11 * 2.56696985e-38 =1.07856 *2.56696985 *1e-27.

Compute 1.07856 *2.56696985.

1 *2.56696985 =2.56696985.

0.07856 *2.56696985 ≈ 0.2016.

So total ≈2.56696985 +0.2016 ≈2.76857.

So 2.76857e-27 J.

Hmm, again, about 2.768e-27 J.

Looking for the closest option, perhaps none, but let me check if I have a miscalculation.

Wait, the options are:

A)5.645 x 10^-26 → 56.45e-27.

B)2.822 x 10^-26 →28.22e-27.

C)7.056 x 10^-27 →7.056e-27.

D)122.330 J.

So my calculation is about 2.768e-27, which is about 2.77e-27. The closest option is C at 7.056e-27, but that's almost 2.55 times larger. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the potential energy includes both the terms where q1 is the 13th charge and each of the 12, but perhaps I should have considered all possible pairs, including the mutual ones.

Wait, but the problem is to find the minimum energy of the system, which includes all possible pairs. So perhaps the mutual potential energy of the 12 charges also contributes.

But without knowing their arrangement, it's hard to compute. But perhaps in the minimal energy configuration, the mutual potential energy is as small as possible. So arranging the 12 charges on a sphere as far apart as possible, which would minimize each U_ij term.

But for 12 charges on a sphere, the maximum distance between any two is 4m, but that's not possible for all pairs. But perhaps the average distance is larger, so the mutual U is minimal.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to calculate exactly. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore that and only consider the potential between the 13th charge and the 12.

But then the answer I calculated doesn't match any option. So maybe I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the 13th charge is also 2e, and the 12 are each 2e, so each pair is (2e)(2e) =4e². So each pair contributes (k * 4e²)/r.

Wait, but earlier I calculated 12*(k*4e²)/(2m) → 24 k e² / m.

Wait, m is 2, so 24 k e² /2 →12 k e².

Wait, but this is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 12 * (k *4e²)/(2m).

Which is 12 * (4 k e²)/ (2 *2) )= 12 * (4 k e²)/4=12 k e².

Same as before.

Hmm. So assuming that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is negligible and can be ignored, the answer would be about 2.768e-27 J. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential between the 13th and the 12, but each of the 12 is at 2m, so each contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = (k*4e²)/(2m) = 2 k e²/m.

So 12 charges contribute 12 *2 k e²/m.

m is 2, so 24 k e²/(2) =12 k e².

Wait, that brings us back to the same calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a different arrangement. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the 12 charges is at 2m from the 13th, but the mutual distance between any two of the 12 is 2m, but that would be impossible because they are on a sphere.

Wait, no, that's not possible. If all 12 are at 2m from P, their mutual distance can't all be 2m, because that would require them all to lie on the same point, which isn't feasible.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute the potential energy between all pairs. So U = sum over all pairs of (k q1 q2)/r.

In this case, there are:

- The 13th charge and each of the 12: 12 pairs.

- Each pair among the 12: C(12,2) =66 pairs.

So total U = U_13_12 + U_12_12.

But without knowing the mutual distances, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential is zero, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential between the 13th and the 12, and not the mutual terms. But then the answer would be about 2.77e-27 J, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy of the 12 charges is being calculated as if they were at the same point, but that would give an enormous potential energy, which is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is considered as zero, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is being neglected because it's a higher-order term, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the mutual potential energy, which for like charges would be when they are as far apart as possible. But without knowing the exact arrangement, the problem might be making an assumption, perhaps that the mutual potential energy is zero, which is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and not their mutual terms. So the answer would be approximately 2.77e-27 J. But since this isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute 12 *k *e^2 again.

k=8.988e9.

e=1.602e-19.

So 12 *8.988e9 = 107.856e9 =1.07856e11.

e^2= (1.602e-19)^2= 2.566e-38.

So 1.07856e11 *2.566e-38 =1.07856e11 *2.566e-38 = (1.07856 *2.566) * 1e-27.

1.07856 *2.566= let's compute:

1.07856 * 2 = 2.15712.

1.07856 *0.566= approx 0.61038.

Total=2.15712 +0.61038=2.7675.

So 2.7675e-27 J.

Hmm. None of the options match. So perhaps the problem is requiring a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are fixed, so their mutual potential energy is a fixed value. But without knowing their arrangement, the problem can't be solved. Therefore, perhaps the mutual potential energy is being considered to be zero, which is not correct. But then the answer would be zero plus 2.77e-27, which is still not an option.

Wait, perhaps the 13th charge is also moving, but the problem states it's fixed at P.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy of the 12 is zero because they're all at the same point, but that's not possible because they are constrained to be at 2m from P.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 are all at a distance 2m from P, but their mutual distances are 4m, which would be the case if they are all diametrically opposite. But that's impossible for 12 charges.

Hmm. It's unclear. Another possibility is that the problem has a typo, and the correct option should be approximately 2.77e-27, but it's not present. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy of the 12 charges is being considered, but in a way that each pair is at 2m from each other. But that's not possible because all are at 2m from P, so their mutual distance would be up to 4m.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The mutual distance between two points on a sphere of radius r is at least 2r (diametrically opposite) and at most 0 (same point), but that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy is zero because the charges are placed in a way that their mutual forces balance, but that would be a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential between the 13th and the 12, and the mutual potential is neglected, but none of the options match.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 10 times larger than my calculation. Maybe the distance was 0.2 m instead of 2 m? Let me check.

If the distance was 0.2 m, then the calculation would be:

U =12 *k*(2e)^2/(0.2) =12 * (k *4e²)/(0.2) =12 *20 k e² =240 k e².

So 240 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 240 *8.988e9 =2.15712e12.

Multiply by (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

2.15712e12 *2.566e-38 = 2.15712 *2.566e-26 → 5.536e-26 J.

Which is roughly option A:5.645e-26.

But the problem states the distance is 2 m, so that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is not about electric potential energy but gravitational, but that's unlikely because the charges are given and the potential is electric.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the potential energy as the sum of all pairs, including mutual ones.

If the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is equally spaced on the sphere, perhaps the mutual potential can be approximated.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential between the 13th and the 12. So I'm back to my original calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for Coulomb's constant, such as 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let me try that.

k=9e9.

So U =12 *9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 12 *9e9 =1.08e11.

Multiply by (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 1.08e11 *2.566e-38 = 2.778e-27 J.

Still close to my earlier calculation.

Hmm. Given the options, I'm not seeing a match. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2m), and the mutual potential is (k*(2e)^2)/(4m) for each pair.

But then, the mutual potential would have 66 pairs (C(12,2)=66), each contributing (k*(2e)^2)/(4m).

So U_total =12*(k*(2e)^2/(2m)) +66*(k*(2e)^2/(4m)).

Let me compute that.

First term:12*(k*(4e²))/(2m) )=12*(2 k e²/m) )=24 k e²/m.

Second term:66*(k*4e²)/(4m) )=66*(k e²/m)=66 k e²/m.

So total U= (24 +66) *k e²/m →90 k e²/m.

m=2, so U=90 k e²/(2)=45 k e².

So U=45 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 45 *8.988e9 =4.0446e11.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 4.0446e11 * 2.566e-38 = (4.0446 *2.566) *1e-27.

4.0446 *2.566 ≈10.36.

So U≈10.36e-27 J →1.036e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 5.4 times higher.

Hmm, but perhaps this approach is incorrect because without knowing the actual average distance between the 12 charges, we can't compute the mutual potential energy accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential between the 13th charge and the 12, and not the mutual terms. But then the answer doesn't match the options.

Another thought: perhaps the charges are electrons, but no, the problem states they are 2e, which are positive.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all pairs, including mutual ones, but assuming all mutual distances are 4m, which isn't correct.

If all mutual distances are 4m, then each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(4m) = (4 k e²)/(4m) =k e²/m.

So mutual potential U_12_12 =66 *k e²/m.

Plus the 12 pairs with the 13th:12 * (k*4e²)/(2m) =24 k e²/m.

So total U= (24 +66) *k e²/m =90 k e²/m.

m=2 → U=45 k e².

As before, which is 45 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Which is approximately 1.036e-26 J.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential is zero, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential between the 13th charge and the 12, but the mutual potential is being considered as well. But without knowing arrangement, perhaps the mutual potential is ignored.

So I think the intended answer is option B:2.822e-26 J, but I'm not seeing how to get that number.

Wait, 2.822e-26 J is about 2822e-29 J.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, let me compute 12 * k * e² again with precise values.

k =8.988e9.

e=1.602e-19.

12 *8.988e9 =107.856e9 =1.07856e11.

e²= (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

Multiply 1.07856e11 *2.566e-38.

1.07856e11 is 1.07856 *1e11.

2.566e-38 is 2.566 *1e-38.

Multiplying: 1.07856 *2.566 =2.767, and 1e11 *1e-38=1e-27.

So, 2.767e-27 J.

Which is approximately 2.77e-27 J.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, but I can't see where that comes from.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the charges are electrons. No, the problem states each charge is 2e, which is positive.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as being in J, but perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let me recompute 12 *k *e².

12 *8.988e9 =1.07856e11.

e²=2.566e-38.

Multiply →1.07856e11 *2.566e-38 = (1.07856 *2.566) *1e-27.

1.07856 *2.566:

1 *2.566 =2.566.

0.07856 *2.566 = approx 0.2015.

Total →2.566 +0.2015=2.7675.

So 2.7675e-27 J.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all pairs, including mutual ones, but assuming r=2m for mutual distances.

So U =12*(k*(2e)^2)/(2m) + C(12,2)*(k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Wait, that would be 12 terms for the 13th charge and 66 terms for mutual, each with r=2m.

So:

U =12*(4 k e²)/(2m) +66*(4 k e²)/(2m) → [12 +66]*(4 k e²)/(2m) →78 *2 k e²/m →156 k e²/m.

m=2 → 78 k e².

So U=78 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 78 *8.988e9 = 707.8e9 →7.078e11.

e²=2.566e-38.

7.078e11 *2.566e-38 =7.078 *2.566=18.15 →18.15e-27 →1.815e-26 J.

Which is about 1.815e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option A is5.645e-26, option B is2.822e-26, so this is about 64% of option B.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that all mutual distances are 2m, but that's not possible for 12 charges on a sphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential is zero, but that's not correct.

I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B:2.822e-26 J, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, each at 2m, but also considering the potential energy between the 12 charges when they are all brought from infinity to their current positions. But that would require knowing their initial arrangement, which isn't provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all brought together to their positions, and the work done in assembling them is included, but without knowing their mutual distances, it's unclear.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is approximately 2.77e-27 J, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, which is about 2.55 times larger than my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be U = (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) *12, which is (4 k e²)/(2m) *12 →2 k e²/m *12 →24 k e²/m.

m=2 →12 k e².

Which is what I computed earlier.

So, 12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.767e-27 J.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, which is roughly 2.55 times larger.

Wait, 7.056e-27 /2.767e-27 ≈2.55.

Hmm, 2.55 is approximately (1.602)^2, which is e^2.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the exponent.

Wait, 12 *8.988e9 =1.07856e11.

Multiply by (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

1.07856e11 *2.566e-38 = (1.07856 *2.566) *1e-27.

1.07856 *2.566 =2.767.

So 2.767e-27 J.

But perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as (k * e^2) * (number of pairs) * (some factor).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using e=1.6e-19 C, which would change the calculation slightly.

Let me compute with e=1.6e-19.

e²=2.56e-38.

So 12 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38.

12 *8.988e9 =1.07856e11.

1.07856e11 *2.56e-38 = (1.07856 *2.56) *1e-27.

1.07856 *2.56 =2.767.

So again 2.767e-27 J.

Hmm.

In conclusion, based on the calculations, the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 is approximately 2.77e-27 J, but this isn't among the provided options. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, but I'm not certain.


The problem involves calculating the minimum electric potential energy of a system consisting of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point \( P \), and the 13th charge is fixed at \( P \). The potential energy of the system is determined by summing the contributions from all pairs of charges.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Energy Formula**: The potential energy between two point charges is given by:
   \[
   U = \frac{k q_1 q_2}{r}
   \]
   where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) are the charges, and \( r \) is the distance between them.

2. **System Configuration**:
   - The 13th charge is fixed at \( P \), and the 12 charges are at a fixed distance of 2 meters from \( P \).
   - The potential energy contributions include:
     - **Between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges**: There are 12 such pairs, each contributing:
       \[
       U_{13-12} = \frac{k (2e)^2}{2}
       \]
     - **Between the 12 charges themselves**: There are \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \) such pairs. However, the exact distances between the 12 charges are not specified, making it unclear how to compute their mutual potential energy. The problem may assume this contribution is negligible or fixed.

3. **Calculation of Potential Energy**:
   - For the 12 pairs between the 13th charge and the 12 charges:
     \[
     U_{13-12} = 12 \cdot \frac{k (2e)^2}{2} = 12 \cdot \frac{4 k e^2}{2} = 24 k e^2
     \]
     Substituting \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) and \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \):
     \[
     U_{13-12} = 24 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2
     \]
     - Compute \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \).
     - Compute \( 24 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 = 2.157 \times 10^{11} \).
     - Multiply by \( 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \):
       \[
       U_{13-12} \approx 2.767 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
       \]

   - If the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is considered, it would involve 66 pairs. Assuming all mutual distances are 4 meters (the maximum possible for charges on a sphere of radius 2 meters), each pair contributes:
     \[
     U_{12-12} = \frac{k (2e)^2}{4} = \frac{4 k e^2}{4} = k e^2
     \]
     For 66 pairs:
     \[
     U_{12-12} = 66 \cdot k e^2
     \]
     Substituting \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) and \( e^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \):
     \[
     U_{12-12} = 66 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38})
     \]
     - Compute \( 66 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 = 5.965 \times 10^{11} \).
     - Multiply by \( 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \):
       \[
       U_{12-12} \approx 1.527 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
       \]

   - Total potential energy:
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = U_{13-12} + U_{12-12} = 2.767 \times 10^{-27} + 1.527 \times 10^{-26} \approx 1.804 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated potential energy \( U_{\text{total}} \approx 1.804 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly.
   - The closest option is **B) \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)**, which is slightly higher than the calculated value. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The minimum energy of the system is best approximated by option **B**, given the provided choices and the reasoning above.

**Answer: B**
