Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Hmm, let's read it again. The scientist is making a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, which I think means the PCR is perfect, right? No loss there. The R² is 1, so that's a perfect correlation, which is great. The slope is -3.3. 

Looking at the data, when the concentration is higher, like 100,000 copies per µl, the Ct values are around 33.9 to 34.5. As the concentration drops, the Ct values decrease. Wait, no—higher concentrations should result in lower Ct values because there's more target, so it reaches the threshold sooner. Oh wait, no, wait. Ct is the cycle threshold. Lower Ct means the target was detected earlier, so higher initial quantity. So when the concentration is 100,000, the Ct is around 34, and it goes down to about 20.7 when the concentration is just 10 copies. That makes sense.

Now the question is about the discrepancies in his results. Let's look at the options.

Option A: qPCR can't be used for quantification. But the efficiency is 100% and R² is 1, so the data should be good. This option seems unlikely because the setup looks correct.

Option B: Ct values don't correlate with target amount. But R² is 1, so they do correlate. So B might not be the right choice.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Hmm. Because each ten-fold dilution should correspond to a change in Ct of about 3.3 cycles, right? Because the efficiency is 100%, the formula is Ct = -slope * log10(concentration) + intercept. The slope here is -3.3. So each ten-fold decrease in concentration would increase the Ct by 3.3. Let's see the data. From 100000 to 10000 is a ten-fold dilution, Ct went from ~34 to ~31. That's a change of about 3.3. Next, from 10000 to 1000, Ct went from 31 to ~27.6, which is a 3.4 change. So that's about right. Next, 1000 to 100, Ct went from 27.9 to 24.6, which is about 3.3. Then, 100 to 10, Ct from 24.6 to 20.7, which is a change of about 3.9. Hmm, that's a bit more than 3.3. So each ten-fold dilution should be about 3.3 cycles apart. But in the last step, the change is 3.9, which is more than 3.3. Wait, maybe the slope is -3.3, so each ten-fold (log1
