Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, let me break it down. So, the setup is that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then they used in vivo imaging and saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid, and some got stuck in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They isolated the fluorescent Peyer patches and looked at the variable heavy chain genes, which showed high variability. The question is about what process is happening.

Wait, I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're specialized areas where immune responses to enteric pathogens, like rotavirus, are initiated. So when the GFP-tagged proteins were given orally, they probably got taken up by the immune cells in the Peyer patches.

The fact that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid suggests that not all the proteins made it through. Stomach acid can break down proteins, so maybe only some of them were protected, perhaps by being taken up quickly. The ones that got entangled in mucus before reaching the lymphoid organsâ€”maybe they were sampled by the immune cells in the Peyer patches.

Once in the Peyer patches, the immune system would process these antigens. The variable heavy chain gene variability points me towards some immune process that diversifies the receptors, like B cell receptors. High variability in the variable regions suggests a process that generates diversity, which is something that happens during B cell development and immune responses.

The options given are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Wait, VDJ recombination is the process during B cell development in the bone marrow where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are combined to form the heavy chain. This happens during the maturation of B cells, and creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. But if the GFP-tagged proteins are being taken up by mature B cells, perhaps in the Peyer patches, then VDJ recombination might not be happening there because that occurs earlier in development.

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, is a process that occurs after the initial B cell response. It happens in the germinal centers, where B cells undergo mutation in the variable regions of their receptors. This increases the diversity of the antibodies produced, allowing for a more specific immune response. So if the variable heavy chain genes show high variability, that could be due to somatic hypermutation.

Class switching recombination is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), which doesn't affect the variable region's variability directly, so probably not the right answer.

Complement activation is more about the complement system attacking pathogens, not directly related to the variability in B cell receptors.

So putting it together, the process that leads to high variability in the variable heavy chains after an immune response is somatic hypermutation. That's during the immune response, especially in the germinal centers, where B cells proliferate and undergo hypermutation, leading to diverse antibodies. The high variability would be due to this process.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence observations reveal that some proteins are destroyed by stomach acid, while others are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. The fluorescent Peyer patches are isolated, and the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cell population show high variability. Peyer patches are specialized lymphoid tissues where immune responses to enteric pathogens are initiated, and the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that generates diversity in B cell receptors.

Among the options:

- **VDJ recombination** occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J gene segments are combined to form the heavy chain. This process generates initial diversity but does not explain the high variability observed in mature B cells after an immune response.
- **Class switching recombination** involves changing the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) and does not directly affect the variability of the variable regions.
- **Complement activation** is a part of the immune system's attack on pathogens and is unrelated to the variability in B cell receptors.
- **Somatic hypermutation** occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, where B cells undergo mutations in the variable regions of their receptors, leading to increased diversity and specificity. This process aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

Given the context of immune responses and the observed variability, the process taking place is **somatic hypermutation**.
