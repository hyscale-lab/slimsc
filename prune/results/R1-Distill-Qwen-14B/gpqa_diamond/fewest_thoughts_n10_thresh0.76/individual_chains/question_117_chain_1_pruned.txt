Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism is when a compound has chiral centers, right? Those are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. Let me think through each of the options given.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to figure out which ones exhibit optical isomerism. The options are 1, 2, 3, 4. The answer choices are combinations of these, so I need to determine which of them display optical activity.

First, let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.**

Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, the structure here is [1,1'-biphenyl], so the two benzene rings are connected at the 1-position of each. So, the substituents are at 2 and 2' positions, and 6 and 6' have nitro groups.

Looking at the structure, I need to see if there's a chiral center. The central carbon in a biphenyl group is the one connecting the two rings. Wait, no, the biphenyl is connected via a single bond, so the central atom is the one in the single bond between the two rings. Wait, no, each benzene ring is a planar structure, and the single bond connecting them allows rotation. So, the central atom is the point where the two rings are connected. But wait, in biphenyl, the two rings are connected by a single carbon-carbon bond, so each ring has a single point of attachment, which is the central atom? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the structure [1,1'-biphenyl] would have each benzene ring attached to the same carbon? No, wait, the numbering is 1 and 1', so each ring has a substituent at position 1, which are connected. So the structure would have two benzene rings connected at their 1 positions. So the central bond is between the two rings.

But wait, in the compound, the substituents are at 2 and 2', which are adjacent to the connecting point. So the groups attached to the central part might be the same on each
