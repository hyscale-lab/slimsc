Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The question is about reactions involving oct-4-ene in both E and Z configurations. They're treated with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. Then the products are run on HPLC columns, both standard and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each will show.

Wait, mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, right? And I remember that mCPBA is a peracid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But wait, does that happen for all alkenes, regardless of geometry?

So Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equivalent of mCPBA. Then aqueous acid. Hmm, I think that when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. But wait, epoxidation is stereospecific, right? The peracid adds across the double bond in a way that depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.

Wait, in the case of epoxidation, the configuration of the starting alkene affects the structure of the epoxide. For example, if you have a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide that forms would have the oxygen atoms on opposite sides. Wait, no, maybe I should think about it more carefully.

Wait, mCPBA is a peracid, and epoxidation involves the peracid attacking the double bond. The reaction is an electrocyclic process where the peracid's oxygen forms a three-membered ring (epoxide) with the alkene. The key point is that the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects whether the epoxide is formed as a cis or trans epoxide?

Wait, no, the starting alkene's geometry affects how the epoxide forms. For example, in a trans (E) alkene, when the peracid adds, the two new oxygen bonds are formed in a way that the substituents on either end of the epoxide end up on the same side or opposite sides.

Wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally. Let's think about (E)-oct-4-ene. It's CH2CH2 with substituents opposite each other. So the double bond is CH2-CH2, but wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle. Wait, no, let's get the structure right. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 with four carbons on each side, so it's CH2CH2 between carbons 4 and 5. The (E) configuration means that the higher priority groups on each carbon are opposite.

When mCPBA reacts with (E)-oct-4-ene, it forms an epoxide. Now, since the starting alkene is E, the epoxide formed would have the two new oxygen atoms on opposite faces, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide? Or wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think about the addition. The peracid adds across the double bond. The epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene? Or does the
