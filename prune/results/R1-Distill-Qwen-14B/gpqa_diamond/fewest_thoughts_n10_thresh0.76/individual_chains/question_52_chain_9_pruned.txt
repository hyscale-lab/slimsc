Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When it's not covered, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and when 40% of its surface is covered, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changesâ€”so, ratio without spots divided by ratio with spots.

Hmm, okay. So, in the stellar photosphere, under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us how the population of different energy levels changes with temperature and energy.

The Boltzmann equation is something like: (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Where n_i and n_j are the number of atoms in energy levels i and j, g_i and g_j are their statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

So the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Wait, but the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star is spotted, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower than when it's unspotted.

Wait, but the effective temperature of the star as a whole is lower when there are spots. So the overall photospheric temperature is lower in the spotted case. But wait, how does that affect the individual regions?

Wait, the star's surface has spots. The spots are cooler, but the rest is at a higher temperature. But the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is spotted. Oh, wait, perhaps the question is considering the average, but does that affect the photosphere's temperature in the non-spotted regions?

Wait, no. The star's photosphere is the layer where most of
