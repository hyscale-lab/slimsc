Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again and try to understand all the parts.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty principle relates the variances of two observables, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Wait, no, this is more about calculating the variance of P_z when the state is an eigenstate of another operator.

Alright, let's break down the given information. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each represented as 3x3 matrices. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the basis states are |+⟩, |0⟩, and |-⟩, corresponding to eigenvalues ℏ, 0, and -ℏ for P_z.

The system's state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The question is to find the uncertainty ΔP_z, which is the square root of the variance of P_z in this state.

I think the first step is to express the given state in terms of the eigenbasis of P_z because the uncertainty in P_z would involve measuring it in its own basis. Wait, but isn't the state already given in the P_z basis? Because the problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state vector is already in that basis, meaning each component corresponds to the eigenstates of P_z.

Wait a second, I'm a bit confused about that. Because if the state is given in the P_z basis, then the components are directly the amplitudes for each eigenstate. So the state is |ψ⟩ = a|+⟩ + b|0⟩ + c|−⟩, where a, b, c are the components. Let me write down the given vector:

The vector is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. So that's a= -1/2, b=1/√2, c= -1/2.

Now, to find the uncertainty ΔP_z, I need to compute the variance of P_z in this state. The formula
