Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, parallax is usually denoted as 'p' but here they wrote 'plx'—I think that's just a notation, like parallax equals plx. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5.

Wait, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, parallax p is equal to 1 over distance d (in parsecs). So p = 1/d. That makes sense because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So if p is 1/d, then d is 1/p.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So we're looking for the relationship between N and r, where r is the distance. Let's think about this step by step.

First, N is proportional to 1/p^5. Since p is 1/d, substituting that in gives N proportional to (d)^5, because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, so I think it's asking about the number of stars per unit distance, which would be the derivative of N with respect to d. Because if N increases as d^5
