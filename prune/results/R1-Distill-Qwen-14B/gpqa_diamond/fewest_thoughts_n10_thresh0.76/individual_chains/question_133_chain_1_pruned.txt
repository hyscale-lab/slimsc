Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in this solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, and the given Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, so we're looking for the concentration of that ion. But how does adding these two salts affect the solution?

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each salt. Molar mass (Mw) for KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and for Na2HPO4·2H2O, it's 177.99 g/mol.

So for KH2PO4: moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007334 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005611 mol.

Wait, wait a second. Let me compute that accurately. Let me do the exact calculations:

KH2PO4:
1.00 / 136.09 = approximately 0.007334 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O:
1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005611 mol.

Now, what do these salts dissociate into in solution?

KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^-.

So, each mole of KH2PO4 gives 1 mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O, when dissolved, would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since it's the disodium hydrogen phosphate). So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives 1 mole of HPO4^2-.

Wait no, wait. The formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So when it dissolves, the formula would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water molecules, but those don't affect the ions. So yes, each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So from KH2PO4, we have 0.007334 mol of H2PO4^- and from Na2HPO4·2H2O,
