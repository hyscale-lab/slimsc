Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when dibrominated compounds react with a strong base like KOH, it's usually an elimination reaction. But wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid molecule, so maybe it's more about ring-opening or dehydrohalogenation? Wait, no, adamantane doesn't open easily. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH—since KOH is a strong base, perhaps it's an E2 elimination. But where would the elimination happen?

Wait, elimination would form a double bond. So if the two bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons (like 1 and 3?), maybe the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Wait, but 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Oh wait, the structure of adamantane—each carbon is part of multiple rings. Let me visualize. Adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond, with four fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two non-adjacent carbons. So if KOH is used, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but how? Hmm, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation for each Br, but that would lead to two double bonds? Or maybe it's a di-elimination, forming an allene? Wait, but with two Brs, probably each is eliminated, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. The NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That sounds like an -OCH₂- group. The other peaks are around 2.4-2.2 ppm for 10H, which is typical for adamantane's bridgehead protons, and 1.94 ppm for 2H, maybe another -CH₂- group. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl, like a ketone or an ester.

Wait, so if KOH is used, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But between two Br atoms on adamantane? Wait
