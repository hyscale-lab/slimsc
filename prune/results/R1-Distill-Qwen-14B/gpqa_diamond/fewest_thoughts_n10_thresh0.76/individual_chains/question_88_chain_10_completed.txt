Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the scenario: They tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then they did in vivo imaging. From the imaging, they saw that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Wait, but the stomach has a lot of acid, so maybe the GFP didn't survive there. But then some reached the intestines, but got entangled in the mucus before getting to the secondary lymphoid organs. Oh, right, secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. Then they looked at the variable heavy chain genes, which showed high variability.

The question is asking which process is taking place. The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

I remember that when a pathogen is ingested, like through the mouth, the immune system in the gut (like Peyer's patches) is important. So the rotavirus capsid proteins are probably acting as antigens here. 

The GFP is on the inner capsid, which I think is VP6. I think that in rotavirus, VP6 is part of the inner capsid, so maybe that's what's being tagged. When given orally, these proteins would be taken up by the gut, but some might not make it past the stomach acid because the acidity could break them down. But the ones that do survive would move through the intestines. The mucus in the gut can trap things, so some proteins might get stuck there. But those that get to the Peyer's patches would interact with immune cells.

Peyer's patches are sites where antigens are sampled, right? So the antigens would be taken up by M cells, which present them to immune cells like B cells. Once the B cells take up the antigen, they start to activate. When they do, they start to proliferate. I remember that during this proliferation, B cells undergo something called somatic hypermutation. 

Somatic hypermutation is a process where the B cells introduce mutations into their antibody genes, leading to a diverse set of antibodies. This happens in the germinal centers, which are part of the secondary lymphoid organs. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests that each B cell's antibody is a bit different from the others, which is exactly what happens during hypermutation. 

Wait, what about the other options? Let's see. Complement activation is more about the classical pathway, which might be triggered by antibodies binding to antigens. But the question is about the process leading to variability in the genes, which points to a B cell process, not complement. 

Class switching is when B cells change the class of antibody they produce (like from IgM to IgG), but that's more about the type of antibody, not the variable regions. VDJ recombination occurs during the initial formation of the B cell receptor in the bone marrow, which is a one-time event. Somatic hypermutation happens later, during the immune response, and increases diversity after the initial setup.

So the process here is somatic hypermutation. That's why the variable heavy chains are so diverse among the isolated cells. They underwent this process to generate a wide range of specific receptors to target the antigen better.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some of the GFP-tagged proteins are destroyed by stomach acid, while others are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Fluorescent Peyer patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells reveals high variability.

Peyer's patches are specialized sites in the gut where antigens are sampled and immune responses are initiated. The GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins act as antigens, likely being taken up by M cells and presented to B cells. During this process, B cells proliferate and undergo somatic hypermutation, a mechanism that introduces mutations into the variable regions of their antibody genes. This results in a diverse set of antibodies tailored to recognize the antigen more effectively. The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes is consistent with this process.

Other options can be ruled out as follows:
- **Complement activation** is not relevant here, as it primarily involves the classical pathway and is not directly related to generating variability in antibody genes.
- **Class switching recombination** refers to changes in the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) and does not explain the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **VDJ recombination** occurs during the initial formation of B cell receptors in the bone marrow and is not responsible for the diversity observed during an immune response.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches.

Answer: A
