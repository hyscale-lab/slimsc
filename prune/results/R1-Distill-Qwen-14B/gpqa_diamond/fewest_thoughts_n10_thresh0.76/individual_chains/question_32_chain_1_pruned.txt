Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember from my studies that when dealing with relativistic particles, you have to use the equations from special relativity. 

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is Lithium, right? So, the isotope would be Li-6 because Lithium typically has 3 protons and if there are 3 neutrons, that makes 6 nucleons in total. So the mass number A is 6.

I think the first thing I need to do is find the rest mass energy of the Li nucleus. The rest mass energy is given by E_rest = m*c². But wait, I remember that the mass of a nucleus isn't exactly the sum of protons and neutrons because of binding energy and other factors, but for these purposes, maybe I can approximate it as the atomic mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the atomic mass of Li-6. Wait, but I don't have that data here. Maybe I can recall that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c² and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Let me calculate that.

Each proton is 938 MeV/c², so 3 * 938 = 2814 MeV. Each neutron is 939 MeV/c², so 3*939=2817 MeV. Adding them together: 2814 + 2817 = 5631 MeV, which is 5.631 GeV. But wait, that's the sum of the individual particles, but the actual mass of the nucleus is less because of the mass defect due to binding energy. Hmm, but I don't have the exact binding energy for Li-6. Maybe the problem expects me to use the mass number as an approximation, treating the nucleus as a single particle with mass equal to A times the mass of a nucleon. Or perhaps I should use the average mass of a nucleon, but that might not be precise. Alternatively, maybe the problem just uses the mass of the nucleus as roughly the sum, ignoring the binding energy for simplicity.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula where energy E is gamma * m * c². So I need to calculate gamma, the Lorentz factor, when the speed v is 0.96c.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let's compute v²/c²: (0.96c)^2 / c^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that again. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, correct. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.571.

But wait, let me be precise. 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes.
