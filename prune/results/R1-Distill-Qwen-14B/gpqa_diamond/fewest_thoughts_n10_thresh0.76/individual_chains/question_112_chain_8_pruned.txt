Okay, so I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read the question carefully.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, first, I think I should normalize this state because probabilities must add up to 1. But wait, the question says it's proportional, so maybe I should find the normalization factor first.

Wait, the problem mentions an operator whose matrix elements are given as A_ij. A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. So this must be a 2x2 matrix because the state is in a two-level system (up and down).

So let's write out the matrix A. For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So A looks like:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

Hmm, this matrix looks familiar. Oh right, it's the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Now, the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down> states. So when the question asks about measuring the particle in the eigenstates of this operator, it's effectively asking for the probability of finding the state in |+x> and |-x>.

So I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, and then the coefficients' squared magnitudes will give the probabilities.

But wait, let's first get the state |alpha> properly normalized. The current state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's compute the norm.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2. Because the inner product is with the conjugate.

|1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
|2 - i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.
So sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, I need to express this state in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

What are those eigenstates again? The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for |+x>, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for |-x>.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me denote |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So any state can be written as c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>.
