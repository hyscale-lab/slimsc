Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR shows peaks consistent with the expected molecule except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and equal integrals adding up to 1H. So they must be split in some way, but the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Hmm, because if it were coupling with another proton, like vicinal coupling, youâ€™d see a specific splitting pattern. But the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling, so maybe it's something else causing the split.

Then looking at the LC-MS: two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So same m/z, same retention time? Or maybe same mass but different RT? Wait, LC-MS at elevated temperature would have the same mass but different retention times? Or same retention? Wait, the mass is same, so same molecular weight. So it's either isomers, or maybe something else.

The options are A to D. Let's go through them.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a different mass, right? Because it's not fully formed. So the mass would be higher. But the question says both peaks have same mass as expected. So maybe A is not the answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have same molecular weight, same physical properties except in chiral environments. So in NMR, you wouldn't see splitting because each enantiomer's protons would look the same. Wait, in an achiral environment, you wouldn't see splitting between enantiomers because the NMR can't distinguish them. But wait, the question says the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. If it's a racemic mixture, then in the NMR, each enantiomer's protons might show as a singlet each, but since they're identical in each enantiomer, the peaks would overlap. Wait no, because in a single enantiomer, the environment is chiral, so the alpha-proton would split into multiple peaks due to coupling with neighboring chiral centers? Or wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, maybe not. Alternatively, wait, racemic mixture would typically show as a single peak because each enantiomer is mirror image, but if there's a stereogenic center causing diastereotopicity, perhaps. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. If the compound is a racemic mix, but the molecule is not symmetric, perhaps each enantiomer has a different environment for that proton. Like, but in a racemic mixture, the NMR would average out? Or if the molecule has a stereogenic center causing the proton to be split into two different environments. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think more.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, what's that? Maybe during the coupling reaction, there's some kind of side reaction where two bonds form but with different coupling partners, leading to isomers. Or perhaps the coupling leads to an unexpected diastereomer. Or maybe the reaction creates two different diastereomers, which would affect the NMR. But how does that lead to two peaks for the same proton? If the molecule has two different diastereotopic protons, each would have a different shift. But if there are diastereomers, each would have their own set of peaks. So in the NMR, each would show as separate signals, but maybe the same integral. Wait, but in the question, the two peaks together have integral of 1H. So maybe each is 0.5H? That doesn't make sense unless there's something else.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR signals would be different. For a single proton that's in different environments due to diastereomerism, each diastereomer would show a different shift. So if the sample is a 50:50 mix of two diastereomers, each would contribute a peak, leading to two separate peaks for that same proton. That would fit with the NMR observation: two peaks, same integral (each 0.5H? No, wait, if each is 1H in each, but if the sample is a 50:50 mix, each would integrate to 0.5H, adding to 1H total. So that makes sense for the NMR. And for the LC-MS, each diastereomer would have the same mass because they're isomers. So they would elute at different times (different RT) but same mass. But in the question, the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. Wait, but diastereomers have same molecular weight, right? So same mass, but different RT on LC. But the question says LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass, which would fit for diastereomers.

Wait, but the question says LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So same m/z, same molecular weight. So that would suggest same molecular formula, which is the case for diastereomers. So the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton because of diastereomers, and the LC-MS shows two peaks because the diastereomers have different retention times.

Wait, but why would the NMR have two peaks with similar shifts? Diastereomers can have different chemical shifts, but maybe in this case, the shifts are similar. Because the question says similar chemical shifts. So the two diastereomers have the same or similar environments for that alpha-proton, but perhaps they're not identical. So the shifts are similar but not identical, leading to two peaks. But then why does the integral add up to 1H?

Wait, if the mixture is 50:50 of two diastereomers, each would have one proton, so each would contribute 0.5H. So the integral would be 1H, which matches the observation.

So the NMR shows two peaks because the sample is a mixture of two diastereomers, each with the same integral but different shifts. And the LC-MS shows two peaks because each diastereomer is eluting at a different time, but same mass. So that would point to option D.

Wait, but what about option B? If it's a racemic mixture, would the NMR show two peaks? Racemic mixtures have enantiomers. In the NMR, each enantiomer's protons would not split each other's signals because they're not coupling across the enantiomeric pairs. Wait, but in a racemic mixture, all the protons are the same because each enantiomer is a mirror image. So for a chiral center where the proton is, in a racemic mix, the NMR would show a single peak because the two enantiomers are identical in terms of the proton environment. So the NMR would not show two peaks. So option B is probably not correct.

So the options are D (diastereomers) or C (double coupling). Let me think about option C again. 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Could that cause the same proton to split into two? Maybe during the formation of an amide bond, such as in an HATU or EDC coupling, perhaps some kind of side reaction or unexpected stereochemistry. For example, maybe forming two different diastereomers via different stereochemistry in the amide bond, which would lead to diastereomers. That would align with option C causing diastereomerism, which would be same as option D.

Wait, but option C says 'double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Maybe it refers to a coupling reaction that leads to two different products, like two different stereoisomers of the amide. So, perhaps in the amide bond formation, there's a possibility of forming two diastereomers (e.g., different stereospecific products), which would lead to two separate molecules in the mixture. Then the NMR would show two peaks for the same proton, and LC-MS would show two peaks. So both C and D could lead to the same observations.

Wait, but option C is about the reaction forming two products, while option D is about the sample being a mixture of diastereomers. So if the reaction produces diastereomers, then option D is the correct explanation, regardless of the cause. So perhaps the correct answer is D, regardless of whether it's due to coupling or something else during synthesis.

In the question, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, same integral, similar shifts. So the answer points to diastereomers because they have same molecular weight but different shifts. So the two peaks in NMR are from the same proton in two different diastereomers. And the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass, which is consistent with diastereomers.

So the most likely answer is D.


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts, equal integrals (adding up to 1H), and no spin-spin coupling. LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Analysis of the Options:

**Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
A precursor would typically have a different molecular weight (higher mass) due to incomplete formation of the target molecule. However, the LC-MS data shows two peaks with the same mass as the expected molecule, ruling out this option.

**Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images and have identical physical properties, including NMR spectra. In an NMR spectrum, a racemic mixture of enantiomers would not produce two distinct peaks for the same proton because the environments for the protons in each enantiomer are identical. Thus, this option does not explain the observed NMR data.

**Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
"Double coupling" could refer to the formation of two different stereoisomers during the amide-bond formation reaction. This could lead to a mixture of diastereomers, which would explain the NMR and LC-MS observations. However, this explanation overlaps conceptually with Option D, which directly addresses the presence of diastereomers.

**Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images and have different physical properties, including NMR chemical shifts. If the crude compound is a mixture of two diastereomers, each would contribute a distinct peak for the same alpha-proton in the NMR spectrum due to their different environments. The LC-MS data, showing two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, is consistent with diastereomers, as they have the same molecular formula but different physical properties. This explanation aligns well with the observations.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, as this accounts for both the NMR and LC-MS data. While Option C could describe the origin of the diastereomers, Option D directly addresses the observed phenomenon.

**Answer: D**
