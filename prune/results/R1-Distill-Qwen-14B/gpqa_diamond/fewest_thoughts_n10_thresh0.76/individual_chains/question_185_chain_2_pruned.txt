Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved with spin-½ particles, like electrons.

Wait, Pauli matrices are a set of three 2x2 matrices (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z). When you take their dot product with a vector n, which is a unit vector, you're essentially creating a spin operator in the direction of n. Oh right, the dot product σ · n would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z.

The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are what's being asked. I remember that the eigenvalues of a spin component operator like σ · n are plus and minus 1. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by some vector. Let me think, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, but when you have σ · n, which is a linear combination, what are its eigenvalues?

Wait, the trace of σ ·n is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero. The square of σ ·n would be (σ·n)^2. Let me compute that: (σ·n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y +n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding that gives the sum of each σ_i squared plus the sum of cross terms. But σ_i squared is the identity
