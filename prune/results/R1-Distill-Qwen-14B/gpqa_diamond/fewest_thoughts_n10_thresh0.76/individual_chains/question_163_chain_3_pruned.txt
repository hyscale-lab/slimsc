Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution and finding out how much 0.1 M monobasic strong acid is needed. Also, I have to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D.

Hmm, Fe(OH)3 is iron(III) hydroxide, right? So when it dissolves in an acid, it should react. Monobasic strong acid—like HCl or HNO3—so it'll donate one H+ ion.

The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid. I think the general reaction would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 would need 3 moles of H+.

First, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. The mass is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would be Fe (55.85 g/mol) + 3*(O (16) + H (1)) = 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me double-check that calculation: 0.1 divided by 106.85. Yeah, around 9.36e-4 moles.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+, the moles of H+ needed are 0.000936 *3 = 0.002808 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M. So the volume needed is moles / concentration. So 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, I see option C has 28.05 cm³, which is close. So that's probably the volume needed.

Wait, but wait. The total solution is 100 cm³. So does the volume of acid added affect the total? Hmm, the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³, so maybe the acid is being added to make up the solution to 100 cm³. Or perhaps the acid has a certain concentration, and the volume is calculated based on that. Let me think again.

Wait, the acid is 0.1 M. So to get 0.002808 moles, the volume would be 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. But the problem states the total volume is 100 cm³. Hmm, does that affect anything? Oh wait, no, because when you mix, the total volume isn't just the sum, but since the problem says the total is 100 cm³, perhaps the acid volume is adjusted accordingly. But no, the question is asking for the minimum volume of the acid needed to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. So maybe the 100 cm³ is the final solution, not the acid volume.

Wait, no, the problem says "in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution after adding acid is 100 cm³. So the acid volume plus the solution volume? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, I think the 100 cm
