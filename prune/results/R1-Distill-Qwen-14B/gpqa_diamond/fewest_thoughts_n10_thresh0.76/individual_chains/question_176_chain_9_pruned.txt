Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, column matrix usually has each element as a component, but wait, those numbers might be in some basis. So the state vector is a 3x1 column vector: [-1, 2, 1]^T. Hmm, but wait, quantum states are typically normalized, right? The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1. Let's check: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh wait, that's 6, so the state isn't normalized. Maybe that's a typo, but perhaps the problem assumes it's normalized. Alternatively, maybe the state is given without normalization, and the probabilities will be calculated using the inner products regardless.

The operators P and Q are given as square matrices. The operator P's matrix is:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Hmm, I need to check if this matrix is Hermitian because observables should have Hermitian operators. Let me see: the elements seem symmetric across the diagonal. The (1,2) and (2,1) elements are 1/sqrt(2), and (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2) as well as (3,2). So yeah, it's Hermitian.

The operator Q's matrix is diagonal:
First row: 1,0,0
Second: 0,0,0
Third: 0,0,-1. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. That makes sense for Q.

The question is: if someone measures Q just after measuring P, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So the order is P first, then Q. But I'm supposed to find the probability that P is 0 and Q is
