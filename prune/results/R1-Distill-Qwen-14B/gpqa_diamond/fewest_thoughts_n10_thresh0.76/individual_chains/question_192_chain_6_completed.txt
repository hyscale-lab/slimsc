Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the setup: There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So the conductor has a hollow part inside, not touching the outer surface because r is less than R.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. Hmm, this is getting a bit spatial, maybe I should draw a rough diagram.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged initially. When the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, what happens? I remember that in electrostatics, charges in conductors redistribute themselves. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, placing a charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, the cavity is isolated from the conductor because it's a conductor with a cavity. So when we put a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge -q. Because the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge +q to balance it. So the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer has +q. Right, that makes sense.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So for points outside a conductor, the electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. Because the conductor's charges rearrange themselves, and their distribution is symmetric. So whether it's a solid sphere or a shell, the external field is the same as a point charge at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor has a cavity with induced charges. So the total charge on the conductor is +q (outer surface). Because the inner surface is -q, and the outer is +q, summing to zero plus the original conductor's charge (which was zero). So the conductor's total charge is +q.

So when calculating the electric field at a point outside the conductor (like point P), the field should be as if the charge +q is located at the center of the conductor. So E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but wait. The point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the angle between l and s is theta. Hmm, how does that factor into the calculation?

Oh, right. Point P is outside the conductor, so the conductor's induced charges will influence the field. But wait, the induced charge on the inner surface is -q, which is inside the cavity. The conducting material is between the cavity and the outer surface. So, the inner surface's induced charge is inside the conductor, and the outer surface's +q is on the outside.

Wait, but when considering the external point P, the only charges that contribute to the electric field are the outer charges. Because the inner charges are screened by the conductor. So the electric field outside is only due to the outer surface's charge, which is +q. So regardless of where P is located, as long as it's outside, the field is the same as a point charge at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the charge +q is placed inside the cavity. So the conductor's total charge is +q (since inner is -q, outer is +q). So the outer surface's charge is +q. Therefore, the electric field at P outside is due to the +q charge at the center of the conductor. So the field is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but the options have some other terms. Let's look at the options:

Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So that would match what I was thinking.

But then why are the other options considering l and s and theta? Because maybe they are considering the field due to the charge inside the cavity, but that's inside the conductor. No, wait, the charge is in the cavity; the conductor's charges rearrange to -q on inner surface and +q on outer.

Wait, but when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface becomes -q, and the outer surface +q. So the total charge on the conductor is +q. So any external field is due to this +q.

So, the field at P is as if the +q is at the center of the conductor, regardless of where P is located outside. So the electric field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², right?

Looking at the options, that's option B.

But wait, wait another moment. Suppose the conductor wasn't there. Then the electric field at P would be due to the charge +q being at a point s away from the center. But in this case, the conductor's presence changes the distribution. But for points outside the conductor, the conductor's charges are all on the outer surface, so the field is as if the charge is at the center of the conductor.

Hmm, so the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait again. The point P is a distance l from the cavity's center. The conductor's radius is R, and the distance between the centers is s. So perhaps the point P's position is such that it's in a region where the field is affected by the induced charges. Or maybe my initial reasoning is incorrect.

Wait, another approach: Use the method of image charges. Or perhaps think about Gauss's Law.

Suppose we take a Gaussian surface outside the conductor. The total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface is +q, so the electric flux through it is (1/(4πε₀)) * q. The electric field at point P is E * 4πL² = (1/(4πε₀)) * q. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So that's the same as option B.

But wait, the problem says that the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, so that's what's used in the calculation. So yes, the answer should be B.

But why are the other options considering l and s? Maybe that's a trap, making you think about the position of the point P relative to the cavity's position. But for points outside the conductor, the conductor's own charges (which are all on the outer surface) are what contribute, and their distribution is such that the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center.

So I think the correct answer is option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   - The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor.  
   - To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor develops a charge $+q$. Thus, the total charge on the conductor is $+q$, and this charge resides on the outer surface due to electrostatic shielding.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   - For points outside a conductor, the electric field is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. This is a consequence of the spherical symmetry of the conductor's charge distribution.  
   - At point $P$, which is a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, the electric field is therefore determined by the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor, $+q$, and is given by:  
     \[
     E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
     \]

3. **Relevance of Other Parameters**:  
   - The parameters $l$, $s$, and $\theta$ describe the position of the point $P$ relative to the cavity and the conductor. However, since $P$ is outside the conductor, the electric field at $P$ is independent of the position of the cavity or the charge $+q$ inside it. The field is solely due to the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor, which behaves as if it were located at the center of the conductor.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. This expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is irrelevant for points outside the conductor.  
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. This involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is also irrelevant for points outside the conductor.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While it resembles the correct form, it uses $l$ instead of $L$, which is the correct distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
