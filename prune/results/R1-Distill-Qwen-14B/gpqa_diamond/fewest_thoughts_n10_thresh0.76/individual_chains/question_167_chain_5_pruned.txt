Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are things like coherent states, squeezed states, etc., and non-Gaussian states are more complex, like cat states. The problem gives me a specific state and asks me to find the non-Gaussianity measure.

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. And N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. 

I need to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) which is defined as del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix. 

Wait, but how do I find the relative entropy here? I'm a bit fuzzy on how to compute this. So, relative entropy between two states is S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But in this case, the problem states it as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. That's a bit different. Hmm, perhaps I should clarify. Or maybe it's a typo and it's supposed to be S(rho || tau), which is the standard way.

Wait, the problem says, "relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]". Oh, that's a bit unusual. Normally, relative entropy is S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho - rho ln tau). But here, it's [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], which would be the same as S(rho||tau) plus trace(tau ln rho), because in S(rho||tau), it's trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). So the del_b as given is trace(rho ln rho) minus trace(tau ln tau). That's different. Hmm, not sure if that's correct, but I'll proceed with what's given.

So the first step is to find rho and tau. The state rho is the density matrix of |psi>, which is pure. So rho would be |psi><psi|.

But tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. Wait, but which Gaussian state? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I'm to assume that the reference Gaussian state is a maximally mixed state? Or perhaps it's another Gaussian state that is the best approximation to rho? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. The non-Gaussianity is calculated with respect to a reference Gaussian state. But which one? I think usually, when using relative entropy for non-Gaussianity, the reference is the closest Gaussian state to rho. So perhaps tau is the Gaussian state that minimizes the relative entropy, making del_b the minimal relative entropy between rho and any Gaussian state.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively,
