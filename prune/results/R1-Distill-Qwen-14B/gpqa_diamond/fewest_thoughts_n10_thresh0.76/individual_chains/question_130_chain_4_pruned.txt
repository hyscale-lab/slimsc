Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting objects with optical telescopes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, Lyman alpha emission is typically at 121.6 nm, right? Oh wait, no, wait. Lyman alpha is the transition from n=2 to n=1 in hydrogen, which is about 121.6 nm (since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm). Oh, but wait, the question says it's 1216 Angstroms. Hmm, maybe that's a typo, but I'll go with what's given.

So when these clouds absorb the quasar's light, they cause a absorption line at 1216 Angstroms. But the quasar's light is redshifted because it's moving away from us. So the observed wavelength (λ_observed) will be longer than the rest wavelength (λ_rest).

The redshift z is defined as (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1. So z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1.

Wait, but in this context, the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. So the hydrogen cloud is at some redshift, and the quasar is behind it. So the quasar's light is redshifted by the quasar's own redshift, and the absorption line is at a wavelength longer than 1216 Angstroms.

But wait, the question is about the clouds being detected. So the absorption line is at a wavelength that must be observable by ground-based optical telescopes. So what's the cutoff?

Ground-based optical telescopes typically observe in the range of about 350 nm to around 1000 nm (near-infrared might be beyond that, but optical is roughly visible spectrum, so 400-700 nm is visible, but telescopes can go a bit beyond). Wait, but if the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms
