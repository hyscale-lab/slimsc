Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again.

We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we have to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm. Right, Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide. When you add a strong acid to it, they will react. The reaction equation should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. Oh wait, wait. Monobasic acid means it donates one H+ per molecule, so like HCl, HNO3, etc. So the acid is reacting with the hydroxide.

First step: Find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1.008. So Fe: 55.85, O: 3×16=48, H:3×1.008=3.024. Adding them: 55.85 + 48 +3.024 = 106.874 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.1 / 106.874 ≈ 0.0009357 moles. Let me compute that: 0.1 divided by 106.874. Let me calculate. Let me see, 106.874 is approximately 107. 0.1 / 107 ≈ 0.0009346. So approximately 9.346e-4 moles.

The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid is as follows:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O.

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+.

So for 0.0009346 moles of Fe(OH)3, the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 0.0009346 ≈ 0.0028038 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M. So volume (V) = moles / concentration.

Wait, but wait. The acid is monobasic, so each mole provides one mole of H+. So for 0.0028038 moles of H+, the volume is 0.0028038 / 0.1 = 0.028038 liters, which is 28.038 cm³. Hmm, that's about 28 cm³. But wait, the options don't have exactly 28. Let me check the options.

Option C is 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. Option B is 30.09, etc. So the volume needed is approximately 28 cm³. But wait, the question says "minimum volume". So is this the correct calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should verify. Fe(OH)3's molar mass: Fe is 55.85, each OH- is 17.01 (16 O + 1 H). So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(17.01) = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol. So yes, 0.1 g is 0.1 / 106.88 = approximately 0.0009346 mol.

Yes, so 3 moles H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3. So 3 * 0.0009346 = 0.0028038 mol H+ needed. The acid is 0.1 M, so volume V = 0.0028038 / 0.1 = 0.028038 L = 28.038 cm³. So about 28.04 cm³. So the answer should be close to 28 cm³. Looking back at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. So that's the volume part.

But wait
