Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3) with circular orbits discovered using the TTV method. I remember TTV stands for transit timing variations, which is a method used to detect exoplanets by analyzing the changes in the timing of a planet's transit across its star. But I'm not sure how that affects the current problem. Maybe the method relates to how the planets' masses affect each other's orbits, but perhaps that's not directly needed here.

The problem states that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. Similarly, between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. I think equilibrium temperature has to do with how much heat a planet absorbs from its star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) multiplied by ( (1 - albedo) / (distance)^2 )^(1/4). Wait, maybe more accurately, the formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where 'a' is the orbital distance. Or wait, no, the exact formula might be T_eq = T_star * ( ( (1 - albedo) / (16 * π * sigma) ) )^(1/4) * ( L / (4π a^2) )^(1/4). Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of how T scales with distance.

Wait, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance from the star. Because the formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)), but if we’re considering the same star, R_star would be the same for all planets. So the distance a is the key factor. So, T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So if Planet1 and Planet2 have a T ratio of 1.4, that implies that the distance ratio is (1/(1.4))². Wait, let me think: if T1/T2 = 1.4, then since T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so T1 / T2 = sqrt(a2 / a1).
