Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an acid chloride, but wait, no, wait. Oh, right, another reaction: when you have an ester, maybe? Or maybe it's a different scenario. Alternatively, red phosphorus is sometimes used in the dehydrohalogenation or maybe in the preparation of alkenes, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the data given for Compound X: the IR and the NMR. Let's start with the IR. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch or maybe an N-H. But also, in that range, maybe an alkene or another functional group. But 3400-2500 is a broad region, so it's probably an O-H. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong peak. That could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions—those are around where aromatic C=C stretching occurs. So, maybe there's an aromatic ring with substituents, possibly conjugated.

Now the NMR. Let's see. The 1H NMR has peaks at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). That's a broad singlet, which makes me think of an acidic proton, like an aldehyde or a phenol. Or maybe a carboxylic acid? Wait, but in a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually around 10-12 ppm, and it's a broad peak. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but another possibility: an enol proton? No, that's usually more around 5-7 ppm, but I'm not too sure. Let's think. If the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a carbonyl. If the NMR has a 10.5 ppm, that's a -COOH proton. So perhaps Compound
