Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The setup is that he's using a vacuum pump to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. That's super low pressure, right? The idea is to have as few gas molecules as possible in the sample compartment so that the electron beam doesn't get scattered too much. But even at that low pressure, some gas particles are still present, as the mass spectrometer detected.

So, Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment. Oh, and the formula for mean free path is something like λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecule diameter, and P is pressure. Or maybe I should remember that λ is inversely proportional to pressure. So lower pressure means longer mean free path, which makes sense because the molecules don't hit each other as often.

Now, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. It's now λ2 instead of λ1. But the temperature is the same, so that shouldn't change things. Why would λ change then?

Wait, I remember that when electrons are present, they can cause additional scattering. So the electrons in the beam are interacting with the gas molecules. That would add more collisions for the gas molecules, right? Because the gas molecules would be colliding not just with each other but also with the electrons.

So the gas molecules' mean free path is being altered because there's another factor causing collisions. The electron beam introduces more scattering events. How does that affect λ?

The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels before a collision. If there are more collisions happening because the electrons are hitting the gas molecules, the mean free path should be shorter. Because the molecules are colliding more often, so λ decreases. So λ2 is less than λ1.

Wait, let me think again. The original calculation λ1 was based on the gas molecules' interactions with each other (like gas behavior) in the ultra-high vacuum. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons can scatter the gas molecules. So each time a gas molecule interacts with an electron, it's another collision, effectively reducing the mean free path.

So the presence of the electron beam adds more collision events for the gas molecules, meaning their average path is shorter. So λ2 < λ1.

Looking at the options: option C says λ2 < λ1. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, but what about the pressure? The pressure was already super low. But the presence of the electron beam... Oh wait, pressure is P, but maybe the electrons contribute to the effective pressure? Or does it affect the collision rate differently?

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to ionize or something. But that's probably beyond the scope here. The question seems to relate to scattering due to the electron beam.

So yeah,
