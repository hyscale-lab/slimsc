Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle and some quantum numbers. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. Oh, right, parity is a quantum number related to spatial inversion. And Pauli statistics are involved here, so the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange of identical particles. Wait, but does this apply here? Since the NN system is emitting a particle, I guess the emitted particle X is another nucleon, but wait, no—wait, X is a particle emitted, but wait, the initial state is NN, which are two nucleons (like maybe two neutrons or a neutron and a proton?), but if they emit a particle, the product would be NNN if X is a nucleon. But the question says the final NN state, so maybe X is another particle, like a pion or something else. Because if X is a pion, which is a meson, then the initial two nucleons become one nucleon and a meson. Wait, no, the question says the final state is NN, so maybe X is a meson—like a pion. Because if you have two nucleons and emit a pion, you'd have three nucleons? Wait, no, maybe I got that mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps it's a decay process where two nucleons emit a particle and end up as a different state, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should focus on the quantum numbers part.

The problem mentions Pauli statistics requiring that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So the isospin T, spin S, and orbital angular momentum L of the NN system must satisfy T = S + L + 1 modulo 2. And the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So I need to find which partial wave is not allowed. The options are different transitions with different angular momentum states for X.

The initial state is 1S0. Let's parse that term symbol. The general form is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would have S=0 (since 2*0+1=
