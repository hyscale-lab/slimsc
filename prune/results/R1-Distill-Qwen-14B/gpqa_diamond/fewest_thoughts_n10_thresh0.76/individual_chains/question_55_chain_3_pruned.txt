Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are four different acetates: Cis and Trans versions of propenyl and butenyl acetates. Hmm, I need to figure out which one matches the given NMR spectrum.

The NMR data provided is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet)

Alright, let's break this down. First, I should probably draw the structures of each of the options to see which one fits the NMR data.

The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate.

Wait, I should clarify: propenyl and butenyl are different. Propenyl has a double bond between C1 and C2 (like CH₂=CHCH₂-). Butenyl would have four carbons with a double bond, maybe between C1-C2 or C2-C3.

Wait, but the options are about the configuration (cis or trans) of the substituents around the double bond. For propenyl acetate, the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂OAc? Or wait, perhaps it's more like Ac-O-CH₂CH=CH₂? No, wait, acetate is OAc, so the structure would be the ester.

Wait, let me think about the structure of these compounds. For example, propenyl acetate would be CH₂CH₂-OAc attached to a propenyl group. Wait no, the propenyl group is the substituent on the ester. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH₂CH=CH₂? No, wait, that’s not right. Wait, no, the ester is formed between an acid (like acetic acid) and an alcohol. So if it's propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH₂
