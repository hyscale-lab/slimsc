Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Let me see what I remember about this.

So, the problem states that the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants, beta, for the complexes are given as beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16. Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused about the order here. Oh, right, stability constants usually increase as the number of ligands increases. So beta1 would be for the monodentate complex, like [Co(SCN)]^2+? Or wait, no, maybe beta1 is for the first step. Let me think: for each complex, the beta is the formation constant, so for [Co(SCN)]^2+, beta1 is 9; for [Co(SCN)₂]^(2-), beta2 is 40, and so on? Or wait, maybe the complexes have different numbers of SCN- ligands. So, for Co(II) complexes with thiocyanate, the possible species are:

1. Co²+ (no SCN attached)
2. Co(SCN)²+ (one SCN)
3. Co(SCN)₂^0? Or maybe [Co(SCN)₂]^(2-)? Wait, no, let me think about charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So, Co²+ with one SCN^- would be CoSCN^+, but wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, the complex [Co(SCN)]^2+ would have Co²+ plus one SCN^-. So charge is 2+ plus (-1) from SCN, so 1+. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think: the complex is [Co(SCN)]^(n). Let's see, Co²+ plus one SCN^- (charge -1) would make the complex have charge 2+ -1 = 1+? So [Co(SCN)]^+.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the charges wrong. Let me think again: each SCN- is a monodentate ligand. So, for each SCN, it's -1. So, the complex [Co(SCN)]^+ would be Co²+ + SCN^- → charge is (2+) + (-1) = +1. So the complex would be [CoSCN]^+.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)₂]^0 would be Co²+ + 2 SCN^- → 2+ -2 = 0. So neutral complex. And so on.

But the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that seems a bit off because β often increases with each step, but here beta4 is lower. Hmm, maybe I've misunderstood the numbering. Wait, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^(2+), [Co(SCN)₂]^(2+), [Co(SCN)3]^(2+), [Co(SCN)4]^0. Because each additional SCN adds another ligand, but the charge changes. Alternatively, maybe the complexes are all [Co(SCN)_n]^(2+ -n), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each step of adding a SCN^- ion, but the beta values are cumulative. Wait, no, the stability constants are usually given for each step. So for the first, beta1 is the formation of the first complex, then beta2 is the second, etc. So the overall formation constant for the n-th complex is the product of betas up to n.

Wait, no, each beta is the cumulative constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^-2, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^-3. Or wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again: each beta is the stepwise formation constant. So, β1 is the constant for the first ligand: Co²+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+; β2 is the constant for the second ligand: [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)₂]^0; etc. So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2+-n) would be the product of the stepwise constants up to that n.

So, to find the fraction of each complex, we need to calculate the distribution of Co species. The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)₂]^0 complex. So, that's the one with two SCN ligands. So, I need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]^0 in the solution.

So, the approach is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex relative to the total. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species: free Co²+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, [Co(SCN)3]^-2, [Co(SCN)4]^-3. But how many ligands can Co(II) have? The problem gives four betas, so four possible complexes.

The general approach is to consider all possible complexes, compute their concentrations using their respective stability constants, and then find the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex.

The problem can be approached using the concept of the distribution of metal species in solution. The fraction of each species is determined by the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β1β2[SCN^-]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN^-]^3 + β1β2β3β4[SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, no. Wait, the distribution is calculated as the sum over all possible complexes, each weighted by their formation constant and ligand concentration, divided by the total sum. So, the fraction f_n for the complex with n ligands is [β1β2...βn * [SCN^-]^n ] / denominator, where denominator is the sum over all possible complexes.

Wait, but the problem is that each β is the stepwise constant. So the overall beta for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 to βn.

So, for each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge}, the concentration is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = [Co]^{free} * β1 * β2 * ... * βn * [SCN^-]^n

Wait, but [Co]^{free} is the concentration of free Co²+.

Alternatively, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:

c_total = [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)₂]^0 + [Co(SCN)3]^-2 + [Co(SCN)4]^-3

Which can be written as:

c_total = [Co²+] + K1 * [Co²+][SCN^-] + K2 * [Co²+][SCN^-]^2 + K3 * [Co²+][SCN^-]^3 + K4 * [Co²+][SCN^-]^4

Where K1 = β1, K2 = β1β2, K3 = β1β2β3, K4 = β1β2β3β4.

So, [Co²+] is the free ion concentration.

Let me define α_n as the fraction of Co in the n-th complex. Then,

α_n = (K_n [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + K1 [SCN^-] + K2 [SCN^-]^2 + K3 [SCN^-]^3 + K4 [SCN^-]^4 )

where K_n is the product β1β2...βn.

Wait, but K1 is β1, K2 is β1β2, K3 is β1β2β3, K4 is β1β2β3β4.

So, for each n, K_n = product of β1 to βn.

So, the denominator is 1 + K1 s + K2 s² + K3 s³ + K4 s^4, where s is [SCN^-].

So, the problem now is to compute for each n, compute α_n = (K_n s^n) / denominator, and then find the sum of all α_n to get 100%.

The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2.

So, let's compute each term:

First, calculate K1, K2, K3, K4.

Given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So,

K1 = β1 = 9.

K2 = β1 * β2 = 9 *40 = 360.

K3 = K2 * β3 = 360 * 63 = let's compute that: 360 *60=21600, 360 *3=1080 → 22680.

K4 = K3 * β4 = 22680 *16 → 22680 *10=226800, 22680*6=136080 → 226800 +136080=362880.

Now, s is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term in the denominator:

1) 1

2) K1 s = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

3) K2 s² = 360 * (0.1)^2 = 360 *0.01 =3.6

4) K3 s^3 = 22680 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 *0.001 =22.68

5) K4 s^4 =362880 * (0.1)^4 =362880 *0.0001=36.288

Now, sum all these terms to get the denominator:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So denominator is 64.468.

Now, for each n, compute the numerator for α_n.

n=0: Co²+ → term is 1 → α0 = 1 / 64.468 ≈ 0.015514.

n=1: [CoSCN]^+, term is K1 s =0.9 → α1= 0.9 /64.468 ≈ 0.014.

n=2: [Co(SCN)₂]^0 → term is K2 s² =3.6 → α2=3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05553.

n=3: term is K3 s^3=22.68 → α3=22.68 /64.468≈0.3518.

n=4: term is K4 s^4=36.288 → α4=36.288 /64.468≈0.5627.

Wait a minute, adding all these up: 0.0155 + 0.014 +0.0555 +0.3518 +0.5627 ≈ 1.0 (since 0.0155+0.014=0.0295; +0.0555=0.085; +0.3518=0.4368; +0.5627=0.9995, which is about 1, considering rounding errors).

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So α2 is about 0.05553, which is 5.553%. But wait, that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Wait, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I confused the complexes. Because the blue dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+. Or, wait, no. Wait, [Co(SCN)₂]^{0} is neutral, and [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ would have two SCN- so charge would be 2+ minus 2*(-1) → 2+ -2 → 0. Oh wait, same as before.

Wait, perhaps I have a miscalculation in the denominator or in the terms.

Wait, let's recompute all the terms.

Compute each term:

s = 0.1.

K1 =9 → term1= K1 s=9*0.1=0.9.

K2=360 → term2= 360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6.

K3=22680 → term3=22680*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

K4=362880 → term4=362880*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So terms are 0.9,3.6,22.68,36.288.

Denominator: 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

1+0.9=1.9; 1.9+3.6=5.5; 5.5+22.68=28.18; 28.18+36.288=64.468. So denominator is correct.

Now the terms for the numerators.

For α2, it's K2 s² / denominator → 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05553 → about 5.55%.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the K values.

Wait, wait. Maybe I got the K's wrong. Because β1 is for the first step, β2 for the second, etc. So K1 is β1, K2 is β1*beta2, K3 is beta1*beta2*beta3, K4 is beta1*beta2*beta3*beta4. Oh, that's what I did.

Wait, but what if the stability constants are given for the overall complexes, not stepwise? No, stability constants are usually stepwise. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the order of the stability constants. Let me double-check the question: the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, but looking at the numbers: β1=9, β2=40 (so K2=9*40=360), β3=63 (K3=360*63=22680), β4=16 (K4=22680*16=362880).

Hmm. But in the denominator, K4's term is 36.288, which is the largest term. So the dominant term is the fourth complex.

Wait, but the sum is 64.468, so the biggest term is 36.288 (K4 s^4), so the majority of Co is in the [Co(SCN)4]^-3 complex. Hmm, but the question is about the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex, which is 3.6/64.468 ≈5.55%, which isn't among the options. So that suggests I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the numbering is different. Oh! Maybe β1 is for the first complex, which is [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^-2, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^-3.

But wait, let me think: the problem says the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps the way the stability constants are given is for each successive complex as the overall constant, not stepwise. So β1 would be the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, etc.

Wait, no. That can't be right because the stepwise constants are typically smaller than the overall constants. Or maybe it's the other way around. I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the given β's are the overall stability constants for each complex. So, β1=9 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2=40 is for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β3=63 for [Co(SCN)3]^-2, and β4=16 for [Co(SCN)4]^-3.

If that's the case, then the approach is different. Because each β_n is the overall formation constant for the n-th complex.

In that scenario, the fraction of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (sum over all m of β_m [SCN^-]^m )

Because each β_m is the overall stability constant for the m-th complex.

Wait, but that would mean that the denominator is 1 (for Co²+) plus β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4.

Because each β_m s^m is the concentration of the m-th complex relative to Co²+.

So for each m, [Co(SCN)_m] = Co²+ * β_m s^m.

So the total concentration is Co²+ (1 + β1 s + β2 s^2 + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4 ) = c_total.

So, [Co²+] = c_total / (1 + β1 s + β2 s^2 + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4 )

But wait, in the problem, the total cobalt concentration c_total is given as 1e-2 M.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, it says the total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So, the sum of all species is 1e-2 M.

So, using that approach, the fraction for each complex is (β_m s^m) / (sum over all m' of β_m' s^m' )

Because [Co(SCN)_m] = (β_m s^m / denominator) * c_total.

So, fraction f_m = β_m s^m / denominator.

Denominator D =1 + β1 s + β2 s^2 + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4.

So, let's compute D.

With β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

s = 0.1.

Compute each term:

1) 1 → 1.

2) β1 s → 9 *0.1=0.9.

3) β2 s^2 →40 *0.01=0.4.

4) β3 s^3 →63 *0.001=0.063.

5) β4 s^4 →16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Now sum all terms:

1 +0.9=1.9.

1.9 +0.4=2.3.

2.3 +0.063=2.363.

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

Now, compute the numerator for each complex:

n=2: β2 s^2=40 * 0.01=0.4.

So f2=0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169 → about 16.9%, which corresponds to option D (16.9%).

Hmm, that's one of the options. Option D is 16.9%.

Wait, but earlier when I thought the βs were stepwise, I got a much lower percentage. So which approach is correct?

I think I must have confused the definition of the stability constants. The problem states "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Typically, the stability constant (also called formation constant) Kf is for the overall formation of the complex. So, for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge}, Kf is the equilibrium constant for:

Co²+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge}.

So β1=9 is the Kf for [CoSCN]^+, β2=40 for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β3=63 for [Co(SCN)3]^-2, and β4=16 for [Co(SCN)4]^-3.

In that case, the approach is to compute each [Co(SCN)_m] as:

[Co(SCN)_m] = (Kf_m * [Co²+] [SCN^-]^m )

But the total [Co] is the sum of all species:

[Co²+] + Σ (Kf_m [Co²+] [SCN^-]^m ) = c_total.

Factor out [Co²+]:

[Co²+] (1 + Σ (Kf_m [SCN^-]^m )) = c_total.

So [Co²+] = c_total / (1 + Σ (Kf_m [SCN^-]^m )).

But to find the fraction of each complex, f_m = (Kf_m [SCN^-]^m ) / (1 + Σ (Kf_m' [SCN^-]^m' )).

So in this case, computing each term as Kf multiplied by s to the power of m.

So with the Kf's as given, the calculation goes as follows:

Compute each term:

1 → 1.

β1 s → 9 *0.1=0.9.

β2 s^2 →40 *0.01=0.4.

β3 s^3 →63 *0.001=0.063.

β4 s^4 →16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum: 1+0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

Now, the fraction for β2 (n=2) is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169 → 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I've read that sometimes the dithiocyanate complexes are blue. If the n=2 complex is the dithiocyanate, then this approach would give 16.9%, option D.

But wait, earlier when I considered the βs as stepwise, I got a much lower percentage. So which approach is correct?

I think the problem defines the βs as the overall stability constants, not the stepwise ones. So the correct approach is the second one, giving 16.9%, which is option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants provided and the given concentrations. The stability constants are interpreted as overall formation constants for each complex:

- β₁ = 9 for [CoSCN]⁺  
- β₂ = 40 for [Co(SCN)₂]⁰  
- β₃ = 63 for [Co(SCN)₃]²⁻  
- β₄ = 16 for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻  

The total cobalt concentration is given as \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), and the thiocyanate concentration is \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The fraction of each cobalt species is determined by the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
\]

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
The denominator is the sum of all terms:

\[
D = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \)
- \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \)
- \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \)

\[
D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰
The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Conclusion
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
