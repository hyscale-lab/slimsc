Okay, so I need to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because of this, when the star rotates, the spots come into view, and the brightness changes, which can mimic an exoplanet transit.

The question is asking, if there were no spots, what radius should a planet have to produce the same brightness variation as observed? So essentially, we're comparing the light curve amplitude from the planet to what the spots cause.

Hmm, right. So when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the square of the planet's radius divided by the star's radius. Because the area blocked is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the star's brightness is lower, and when it's not, it's higher. But how does that translate to the observed brightness variation?

I think the observed variation comes from the difference between the spotted and unspotted parts. Let me think. The star's total brightness is the sum of its unspotted and spotted areas. The spots are cooler, so they emit less light.

The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, but a hemisphere is half the star. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2), because each hemisphere is half the sphere. Or wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's spots. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (Area of hemisphere).

Wait, the star's total surface area is 4π Rstar². So each hemisphere is 2π Rstar². So the spot area is 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4π Rstar².

Each spot is 1000K cooler than the star's 6000K. So the flux from the spots is lower. The star's flux from the unspotted area is higher.

Wait, but the star's luminosity is dominated
