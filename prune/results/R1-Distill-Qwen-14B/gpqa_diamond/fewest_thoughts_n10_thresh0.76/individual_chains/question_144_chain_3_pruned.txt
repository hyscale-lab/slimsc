Okay, so I have this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with various numbers. 

Wait, mesons are particles, right? And when they decay, their mean lifetime is related to their width. Oh right, the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, wait, I think actually, the formula is Γ = ħ * τ. No, wait, no. Because Γ is the energy width, which has units of energy. ħ has units of energy times time. So, the relation should be Γ (in energy) multiplied by τ (time) equals ħ (which is in energy·time). So, τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that makes sense.

But the question isn't directly asking for the lifetime. It's asking for the mean decay distance. So, the mean decay distance would be the product of the velocity of the meson times its lifetime. Because distance is velocity multiplied by time. So, d = v * τ.

Wait, but how do I find the velocity? I need to calculate the velocity of the meson. The meson is produced with energy E,
