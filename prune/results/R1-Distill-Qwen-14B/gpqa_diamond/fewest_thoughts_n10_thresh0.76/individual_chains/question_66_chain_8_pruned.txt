Alright, so I'm trying to answer this SMEFT question. Hmm, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that it's a framework where you write down all possible interactions that could occur at high energies, and then you look for effective operators that might modify the Standard Model. But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are about Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. I'm a bit fuzzy on some of these, so I'll need to think through each one.

First, let's recall what each symmetry entails. Lorentz symmetry has to do with how the laws of physics look the same in all inertial frames. So, any operator in the theory must transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, but I think Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries. Do SMEFT operators necessarily respect Poincare symmetry? Well, SMEFT is a field theory, which I believe by default respects Poincare symmetry. But wait, when you add higher-dimensional operators, do they automatically respect translations? I'm a bit confused here. Translational symmetry is part of Poincare, so if the theory is built as a Poincare-invariant one, then yes. But the question is whether all operators must respect it. I think in SMEFT, the operators are local and constructed in a way that preserves Poincare, so maybe Poincare is also a must.

Then, CP symmetry: that's charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) together. Do SMEFT operators have to respect CP? Well, the Standard Model doesn't necessarily have CP symmetry beyond the electroweak sector, and I think SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. For example, the Weinberg operator (like the dimension-5 operator for neutrino masses) doesn't respect CP, but wait, no, that operator is actually C and P even. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up. Alternatively, some operators could involve terms that change the CP properties. But wait, the SMEFT is constructed such that the operators are written in terms of the SM fields, but the operators themselves could break CP. Like, for example, the QCD axion models might involve terms that violate CP. Or wait, I'm getting a
