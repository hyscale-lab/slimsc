Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism, also known as enantiomerism, occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. But wait, are there other factors I should consider? Oh right, sometimes even if there are chiral centers, the molecule might not be chiral overall because of some symmetry or other factors.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. Let me go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have different substituents leading to possible isomerism. Wait, the substituents here are at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. So the structure is two benzene rings connected at position 1. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6', and carboxylate ester groups at 2 and 2'. But wait, does this create a chiral center? Or is there some kind of plane of symmetry? If the substituents are symmetrical, maybe the molecule isn't chiral. Let me visualize: the two nitro groups are on the same side maybe? Or opposite? Oh wait, the biphenyl itself, if the substituents are on the same positions on each ring, could have a plane of symmetry through the central bond. If both substituents are on the same side, then the molecule might be symmetrical. But wait, the positions are 6 and 6' on each benzene. So, each benzene has a nitro group at position 6 (which is the same as position 2 on the other ring if considering the biphenyl structure). Hmm, maybe it's symmetrical. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should think about whether each substituent is in a position that allows for a chiral arrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the central bond allows for hindered rotation, making the substituents on each ring have different arrangements, leading to cis or trans isomerism. Wait, but that's more about stereoisomerism in general, but in this case, the question is about optical isomerism, which requires chirality. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. So if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule won't have optical isomerism. Alternatively, if they're asymmetric, then it will. For biphenyls, especially when substituents are in such positions, sometimes they can lead to atropisomerism, which is a kind of stereoisomerism due to restricted rotation. But that's a different type than optical isomerism. Wait, atropisomers are enantiomers if they're non-superimposable. So if the molecule can't rotate freely, and the substituents are in such a way that their arrangement creates a chiral center, then yes, they would have optical isomerism. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about this one.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is like CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, the formula is 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the ester is on the third carbon. The molecule is CH3-C(O-)OCH3, but wait, no, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxy would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. When esterified, the structure becomes CH3-C(O-)OCH3? No, wait, wait. Let me think again. The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: structure is CH3-CHOH-COOH. But as the ester, it would be CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3. So looking at the structure, the central carbon (the
