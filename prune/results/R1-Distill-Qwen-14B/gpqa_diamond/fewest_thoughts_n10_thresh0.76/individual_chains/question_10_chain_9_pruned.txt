Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. Let me think about each option and figure out which one has the highest density.

The question gives four options, a to d, and the choices are A to D, each corresponding to one option. I need to find out which exoplanet has the highest density.

Let me break down each option:

Option a) Earth mass and Earth radius. So its density would be same as Earth's. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So a is 5.5.

Option b) 2 Earth masses and density about 5.5. Wait, wait. The density is given as approximately 5.5. Hmm, so the density is already provided. So for option b, the density is 5.5. That's same as Earth, but more mass. Wait, but if the mass is 2 Earth masses, but the density is same, then the radius must be larger. Because volume depends on radius cubed. So volume would be (radius)^3. If density is mass/volume, and mass is 2 times, but density same, volume is 2 times. So radius would be cube root of 2 times Earth’s radius. But the question is about density, so for option b, the density is already 5.5. So same as Earth.

Option c) Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Okay, same composition implies same density, right? Because composition affects density. So if it's same as Earth, density is 5.5. So for c, density is same as a and b. But wait, wait a second. No—if the composition is same, then density should be same regardless of mass. Because density is mass/volume, and if you have more mass but same composition, the volume increases proportionally. So for same composition, density is same. So c's density is 5.5.

Option d) Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Same reasoning as c. So density is same as Earth, 5.5. So all options a, b, c, d have the same density? But wait, wait. Let me re-examine the options.

Wait, no. Option b says the planet has a density of approximately 5.5. So that's given. So if another option has same composition, same density regardless of mass. So then, all options have 5
