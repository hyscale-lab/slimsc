Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Hmm, I remember that pions can decay into other particles, like in this case, a positive pion is decaying into a positive muon and a neutrino. The pion is stationary, so that must mean the initial momentum is zero. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through this.

The given masses are: Pi-plus rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and the mu-plus rest mass is 105.7 MeV. Wait, the neutrino's mass is usually considered negligible, right? So I guess the neutrino has almost zero rest mass. So, the products are a muon and a neutrino.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So, the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal and opposite. So, the magnitude of their momenta should be the same, but directions opposite.

I'm trying to remember the equations for conservation of energy and momentum in such decays. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, because it's stationary. So E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Each particle's energy is the sum of their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so E_nu ≈ K_nu. The muon's energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy: E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu.

So the total energy equation is:
m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu
Which is:
139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu

But since the neutrino is massless, its energy is just its kinetic energy. Now, for momentum conservation, the magnitudes of their momenta should be equal. So, the momentum of muon, p_mu, equals the momentum of neutrino, p_nu, but opposite in direction.

Momentum p is related to energy and mass by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². For the muon, E_mu is (105.7 + K_mu) MeV. So,

(p_mu c)² = (E_mu)^2 - (m_mu c²)^2
Similarly for the neutrino, since its mass is zero, E_nu = p_nu c.

But since p_mu = p_nu, let's denote p as the magnitude of the momentum. So,

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )
E_nu = p c

And the total energy equation is:

139.6 = E_mu + E_nu
= sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c

Wait, but the units are in MeV. I think I can ignore the c's because all terms would be in MeV, and the equations would remain consistent.

Let me set x = p c. Then the equation becomes:

139.6 = sqrt( x^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + x

Let me rearrange this. Let me subtract x from both sides:

139.6 - x = sqrt( x^2 + 105.7^2 )

Now, square both sides:

(139.6 - x)^2 = x^2 + (105.7)^2

Expanding the left side:

139.6^2 - 2 *139.6 x + x^2 = x^2 + 105.7^2

Simplify:

139.6² - 2(139.6)x = 105.7²

Compute 139.6 squared and 105.7 squared.

139.6^2 is approximately (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

105.7^2 is about (100 +5.7)^2 = 100² + 2*100*5.7 +5.7² = 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So, plug into the equation:

19488.1
