Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but let me think through each compound one by one.

First, I remember that a compound can exhibit optical activity if it has chiral centers, meaning it has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Also, the molecule shouldn't be superimposable on its mirror image. So, I'll go through each compound to check for chiral centers and any possible symmetry that might make them achiral even if they have one.

Starting with the first compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Wait, no. Let me draw it. The molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Structure: Cl is on C1, and C2 has a methyl group. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2-CH2? Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons, with double bond starting at C1. So: C1=CH2, but wait, no. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and is connected to C3 and C4.

Wait, that would make the structure Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH3? Because but-1-ene
