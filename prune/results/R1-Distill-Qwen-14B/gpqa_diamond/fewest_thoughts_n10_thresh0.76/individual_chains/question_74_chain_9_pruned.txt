Hmm, okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it has decayed. That makes me think about the concept of decay probabilities and half-lives, I guess.

Wait, but wait—radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over a given time. So the decay process is memoryless, meaning the probability only depends on the current time, not how much time has already passed. Oh, right, that's the key point.

The problem states that after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. But since the decay is memoryless, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes shouldn't be affected by the previous 50 minutes. So, I don't need to worry about the past; I just look at the future time.

Wait, but wait—hold on. The initial probability given is 32% decay within 100 minutes. So that means the decay constant or the probability per time is related to that. Let me think about the formula for radioactive decay. The probability that a nucleus decays in a time t is given by P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.

But wait, another approach is using the fact that the decay follows an exponential law. Let me remember: the number of und
