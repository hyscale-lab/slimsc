Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, they did in vivo imaging and saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They found the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated proliferating cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes showed high variability. The question is about which process is happening.

Hmm, I remember that Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, right? They're involved in immune responses, especially to things that are ingested, like maybe rotavirus.

The GFP is on the inner capsid proteins. So when the mice are given the virus via oral gavage, the stomach acid would break down some of these proteins. That makes sense because stomach acid is really acidic and can digest proteins. So the fluorescence being destroyed suggests that some of the proteins are being broken down there.

The remaining GFP-tagged proteins that weren't destroyed by stomach acid would have to get through the intestinal mucus. Intestinal mucus can be a barrier, so some proteins got stuck there. But others made it to the secondary lymphoid organs, which in the gut are the Peyer's patches.

In the Peyer's patches, they isolated the proliferating cell population. Proliferating cells in lymphoid tissues are probably B cells because B cells multiply when they're activated by an antigen. Also, looking at the variable heavy chain gene sequences showing high variabilityâ€”variable regions are part of the B cell receptor, so high variability suggests that each B cell is producing a different antibody.

Wait, so what processes lead to high variability in the variable regions of heavy chains? I recall that during B cell development, there's a process called VDJ recombination, which happens in the bone marrow. This allows for the generation of diverse B cell receptors by shuffling the V, D, and J gene segments. But wait, in the question, the cells are proliferating in the Peyer's patches after an immune response, so maybe this is a secondary lymphoid organ where the immune response is being mounted.

Wait, what processes happen after the initial B cell development? Oh, right, there's also somatic hypermutation, which occurs in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. Somatic hypermutation introduces point mutations in the variable region genes, increasing the diversity of the antibodies produced. This process happens during the immune response, allowing for affinity maturation.

So the question says that the variable heavy chain genes show high variability. Somatic hypermutation would lead to that because each B cell's variable region is slightly different. So the process taking place is likely somatic hypermutation, which is option A.

Wait, but what about class switching recombination? That's when the B cell changes its isotype from, say, IgM to IgG or IgA. That process also occurs in the germinal centers, but it's about changing the class of antibody, not the variability of the variable regions. So the variable regions would be affected more by hypermutation than class switching.

VDJ recombination is during the initial formation of the B cell receptor in the bone marrow, leading to initial diversity. But since the cells are already present and are proliferating, and after the initial exposure, it's more likely to be hypermutation, which happens during the immune response to an antigen.

So the answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins become entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. The fluorescent Peyer's patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability.

Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue and are involved in immune responses to ingested antigens. The observed fluorescence in these patches suggests that some GFP-tagged rotavirus capsid proteins successfully navigated the stomach acid and intestinal mucus to reach the lymphoid tissue. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes indicates a process that generates diverse antibody repertoires.

Among the options:

- **Somatic hypermutation** occurs in germinal centers of lymphoid tissues during the immune response, introducing point mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors, leading to increased diversity in antibodies.
- **Complement activation** is a part of the immune response but does not directly explain the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **Class switching recombination** changes the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not account for the variability in the variable regions.
- **VDJ recombination** occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, generating initial diversity in B cell receptors, but this process does not explain the observed variability after antigen exposure.

Since the experiment involves an immune response to an antigen and the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes is consistent with the process of somatic hypermutation, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
