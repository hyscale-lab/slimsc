Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, let's think about what I remember from my studies.

The spin state is given as (3i, 4). Wait, wait, I think that notation means it's a two-component vector, right? So it's a column vector like [3i; 4], because in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually vectors in a two-dimensional space for spin-1/2 particles like electrons.

The expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨S⟩ = ⟨ψ| S |ψ⟩, where ψ is the state vector. Oh, right, and since S is an observable, the expectation value is the average you'd measure if you measured S on many copies of the state ψ.

The problem is asking for S_y, which is the spin operator along the y-axis. I remember that the Pauli matrices are used for spin operators. The Pauli matrix σ_y is given as:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

But wait, the spin operator S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y. Because S = (ħ/2) σ for each component. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

So the matrix for S_y would be:

(ħ/2) * [[0, -i],
         [i, 0]]

Which simplifies to:

[[0, -iħ/2],
 [iħ/2, 0]]

Alright,
