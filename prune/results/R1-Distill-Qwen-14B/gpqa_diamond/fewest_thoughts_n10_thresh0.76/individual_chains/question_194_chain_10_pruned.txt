Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, I remember the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), where beta is 1/(kT). Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states.

The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. So each term is the product of two spins. Let me think about that. Since each spin is either +1 or -1, their product will be +1 if they are the same and -1 if different. So each S_i S_j term contributes either +1 or -1.

Wait, but the energy is negative J times the sum. So if all pairs are aligned (all +1), then the sum would be 3, and E would be -3J. If some pairs are anti-aligned, the sum could be less.

I think I need to calculate the energy for each possible state and then compute the Boltzmann factors.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each S_i S_j can be +1 or -1, so the sum can range from +3 (all three +1) to -3 (all three -1) in steps of 2. Wait, no, is that the case? Let me see: Let's say S1, S2, S3 are all +1. Then each product is +1, sum is 3. If two are +1 and one is -1, how does that affect the sum? Let me think. Suppose S1 and S2 are +1, S3 is -1. Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is +1 -1 -1 = -1. Hmm, so the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3? Wait, no, when two are -1 and one is +1? Let me pick another example. S1 = +1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. Hmm. Another case: all three are -1. Each product is +1, so sum is 3. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3? Wait, maybe I should count all possible cases.

Alternatively, maybe group the states based on the number of aligned pairs, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, think of the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Each term is +1 or -1.

Each state will have S being 3, 1, -1, or -3. How many states have each S value?

Let me think of all possible 8 states.

Each spin is either +1 or -1. Let's list all possible combinations.

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. Sum S=3.
   So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum S=+1 -1 -1 = -1.
   E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum S=-1 +1 -1 =-1.
   E = J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum S= -1 -1 +1 =-1.
   E = J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum S=-1 -1 +1 =-1.
   E = J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum S=-1 +1 -1 =-1.
   E = J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   S1S
