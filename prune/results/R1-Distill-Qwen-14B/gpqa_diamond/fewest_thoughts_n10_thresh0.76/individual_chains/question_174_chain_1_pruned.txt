Okay, so I need to solve this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the one calculated using classical approximation.

Wait, the problem is about relativistic vs. non-relativistic (classical) kinetic energy. So the correct T1 uses relativistic equations, and the classical approximation uses non-relativistic (maybe like KE = ½ mv²). Then I need to find the difference between these two values.

Let me get the given data straight.

Initial rest-mass energy: 300 GeV. So initial energy is all rest mass since it's at rest.

After fission, two fragments. Let their masses be m1 and m2. Given that m1 = 2 * m2. And m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. So M is the original mass.

Wait, M is the initial mass, but the sum of the two fragments is 0.99 M. So the rest mass of the fragments is less than the original. That makes sense because some mass is converted into kinetic energy during fission.

So, setting up the equations.

m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

And m1 = 2 m2.

Substituting m1 into the first equation:

2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M.

So m1 = 2 * 0.33 M = 0.66 M. Wait, 0.33 + 0.66 = 0.99 M, which matches, so that's correct.

But wait, the initial rest mass is M. The total rest mass after is 0.99 M. So that implies that the mass has decreased, which means energy was released, probably in the form of kinetic energy.

Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero because momentum is conserved. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Let me denote the velocities of the two fragments as v1 and v2. Since momentum is conserved, m1 v1 = m2 v2. Because m1 is 2 m2, so 2 m2 * v1 = m2 * v2 → 2 v1 = v2. So the lighter fragment moves faster than the heavier one.

Wait, but in terms of velocity, the lighter one would have a higher speed, right? That makes sense because the more massive one doesn't accelerate as much for the same momentum.

So the kinetic energy of each fragment is the relativistic kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy is the energy released, which is initial rest energy minus the sum of the rest energies of the fragments.

Initial rest energy is 300 Ge
