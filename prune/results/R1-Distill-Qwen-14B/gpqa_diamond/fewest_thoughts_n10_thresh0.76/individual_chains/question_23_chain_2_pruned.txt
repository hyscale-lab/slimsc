Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, using TLC, they saw that the reactant spot got smaller, and two new spots appeared. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different structures.

Hmm, so the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that structure. The benzene ring has an ether group attached, right? The ether is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl), which is a substituent. Breaking that down: but-3-en-1-yl is a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at C3. So, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-O- benzene? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But wait, the substituents are on the butenyl group.

Wait, the substituent is 2,2-dimethyl. So, the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, but wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, that can't be right because but has four carbons, so positions 1,2,3,4. So, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but wait, no. Wait, the numbering starts from the end. So, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, which is actually impossible because a four-carbon chain can't
