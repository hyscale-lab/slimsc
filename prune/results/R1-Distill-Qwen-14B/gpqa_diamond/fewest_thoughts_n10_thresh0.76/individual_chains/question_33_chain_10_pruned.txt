Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about a cycloaddition reaction. Hmm, I remember that cycloadditions are all about the joining of two molecules to form a ring, right? The question says it's a [4+2] cycloaddition, which I think is a Diels-Alder reaction. Wait, no, wait. Diels-Alder is [4+2], yes, between a diene and a dienophile. But wait, the question is about an exo product. Oh right, in Diels-Alder reactions, endo rule says the more substituted product is favored, but exo is when substituents are on the opposite side, maybe from the dienophile.

So the reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione. I need to figure out how they react under heat. Thiophene is a five-membered ring with sulfur. 2,5-dimethylthiophene would have methyl groups on the 2 and 5 positions. Furan-2,5-dione is a cyclic dione, so the furan ring has two ketone groups opposite each other, at positions 2 and 5.

Wait, so in the [4+2] cycloaddition, one molecule must be the diene and the other the dienophile. Thiophene is aromatic, so maybe it's acting as the dienophile. Furan-2,5-dione has two ketones, which are good electron-withdrawing groups, so that could make it a good dienophile as well. Alternatively, maybe one of them is the diene. Let me think: thiophene is usually more electron-rich because of the sulfur, so it might act as a diene in a Diels-Alder?

Wait, wait. Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene and a dienophile. So the diene needs to be a conjugated system. 2,5-dimethylthiophene has two methyl groups but is the thiophene ring itself acting as the diene? Thiophene is aromatic, so its ring is conjugated but not in a way that can act as a diene. Oh wait, perhaps the furan-2,5-dione is the dienophile because it's an electron-deficient molecule due to the two ketone groups
