Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a given spin state. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I'm assuming this is represented as a column vector, so χ = [3i; 4]. Wait, no, wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin state is usually a two-component column vector. So the state would be written as a vector with two complex numbers as its components. So here, the first component is 3i, and the second is 4.

The question is about finding the expectation value of S_y, the spin along the y-direction. I remember that the expectation value is calculated as ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. But wait, actually, more accurately, it's the conjugate transpose of χ multiplied by S_y multiplied by χ, right? So ⟨S_y⟩ = χ† σ_y χ, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y.

Wait, what's the Pauli matrix σ_y again? Oh right, it's [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So σ_y is a 2x2 matrix. Right.

So to compute this expectation value, I need to compute χ† multiplied by σ_y multiplied by χ. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the state χ is [3i; 4]. The conjugate transpose χ† would be [ -3 (since (3i)* is -3i? Wait, wait, no. Wait, (3i)* is -3i, because the complex conjugate of i is -i. Wait, wait, 3i is a complex number. Its conjugate is 3*(-i) = -3i. So the first component is 3i, so χ† would have the first component as -3i? Wait, no, wait: χ is a column vector, so χ† is a row vector with the conjugate of each component. So χ is [3i; 4], so χ† is [3i*, 4*], which would be [ -3i, 4 ], since the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and 4 is real, so its conjugate is 4.

Wait, no. Wait,
