Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because sigmatropic rearrangements aren't my strongest topic. But let's take it step by step.

The question has three parts, all involving sigmatropic rearrangements. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond within a sigma framework. The general form is something like [n]s迁移. The most common ones are the Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts. But wait, the question mentions each of the three reactions, so I need to figure out what's happening in each.

Let's look at the first reaction:

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat → A

Hmm, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So that's an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. Structure-wise, that's (CH3O)2CH-NH2. Then, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2 where the double bond is between C3 and C4, but but has four carbons. Oh wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but-3-ene would have the double bond between C3 and C4, but that's actually the fourth carbon, which doesn't make sense because but has four carbons. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, but that's not possible because the double bond can't be between C3 and C4 in butene. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, that would be 3-en-2-ol, but that's a four-carbon chain. So the structure would be CH2
