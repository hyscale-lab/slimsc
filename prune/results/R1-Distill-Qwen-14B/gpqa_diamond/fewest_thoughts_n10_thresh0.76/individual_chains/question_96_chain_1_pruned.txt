Okay, so I've got this question about black hole entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. We need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. Oh right, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area. Or wait, maybe it's S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G)? I'm a bit confused about the constants, but the main point is that entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon.

So first, I need to find the radius of the event horizon, then compute the area, and then use that to find the entropy.

The event horizon radius R is given by the Schwarzschild radius formula: R = 2 G M / c². But maybe I can find R using the angular size and distance. The angular size θ is very small, so I can use the small angle approximation where θ (in radians) ≈ R / d. Oh wait, that's right because θ = R/d when θ is in radians.

So θ is 1e-17 degrees. Convert that to radians. Since 180 degrees is π radians, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ_rad = (1e-17) * (π/180).

Calculating that: 1e-17 * π is about 3.14e-17, divided by 180 is roughly 1.745e-19 radians.

So using θ ≈ R/d, R = θ_rad * d.

d is 1e10 parsecs. Wait, how big is a parsec? Oh, 1 parsec is approximately 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So R = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m. Let's compute that.

1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = Let's see. 1.745 * 3.086 is about 5.38. Then exponents: 1e-19 * 1e26 = 1e7. So R ≈ 5.38e7 meters.

Wait, that's 5.38e7 meters, which is about 5.38e4 kilometers. Hmm, supermassive black holes have event horizons on the order of millions of kilometers, so maybe this makes sense.

Wait, but 5e7 meters is 5e4 km. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, no, 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs is 3.086e26 meters. Multiply by theta in radians: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26. Let me compute it more accurately.

Calculating 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26:
Multiply 1.745 * 3.086 = approximately 5.386.
Exponents: 1e-19 * 1e26 = 1e7.
So 5.386e7 meters. Yeah, that's correct.

So R ≈5.386e7 meters. 

Now, the area A of the event horizon is 4π R².

Compute R squared: (5.386e7 m)^2 ≈
