Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and when they decay, their mean lifetime or the distance they travel before decaying depends on certain factors like their energy, mass, and width. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, which makes sense because particles decay really quickly.

Wait, I think the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime times its velocity. So, the formula should be something like distance = c * τ * β, where τ is the mean lifetime, c is the speed of light, and β is the velocity relative to the speed of light (so β = v/c).

But how do I find τ? Oh right, for unstable particles, the mean lifetime τ is related to the particle's width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, so Γ (which is the energy width) is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the formula is τ = ħ / Γ. Or is it τ = ħ_bar * something? Let me get the units right.

Wait, Γ is the decay width, and it's equal to ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. So yeah, that's the relation. But I have to make sure about the units. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units of GeV·s or something like that. Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s when converted. So I'll have to convert Γ into GeV to match the units.

Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So substituting into the formula, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) )= approximately 2.0569e-24 seconds. That's the mean lifetime.

But wait, I think the formula for the mean lifetime is τ = ħ
