Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember it's related to quantum mechanics. Let me think. The question says that an electron is traveling at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE.

Wait, I think this is about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Right, the principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. The formula I remember is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Oh, but wait, here we're dealing with energy uncertainty. Energy is related to momentum because kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m). So maybe I need to link the uncertainty in momentum to the uncertainty in energy.

Let me jot down the given data:

v = 2e8 m/s
Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1e-9 meters (since 1 nm is 1e-9 m)
Mass of electron m = 9.11e-31 kg.

First, I'll find the uncertainty in momentum Δp. From the uncertainty principle:

Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2

So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx)

Wait, but in some cases people approximate it by just taking ħ over Δx, omitting the 1/2 factor because it's just an order of magnitude estimate. Since the question is about the minimum uncertainty, using the inequality as equality would give the lower bound for ΔE.

So I'll proceed with Δp ≈ ħ / (2Δx). But maybe for this problem, using ħ/(Δx) is sufficient because the options are orders of magnitude apart. Let's proceed.

The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So let me calculate Δp:

Δp ≈ ħ / (2 * Δx)
Δx is 0.1e-9 m.

Putting the numbers in:

Δp ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 0.1e-9)
Let me compute the denominator first: 2 * 0.1e-9 = 0.2e-9 = 2e-10.

So Δp ≈ 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-10
Wait, 2e-10 is 2*1e-10. So 1e-34 divided by 1e-10 is 1e-24. So 1e-34 / 2e-10 = (1/2) * 1e-24 = 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

1.05e-34 / (2e-10) = (1.05 / 2) * (1e-34 / 1e-10) ) = 0.525 * 1e-24
