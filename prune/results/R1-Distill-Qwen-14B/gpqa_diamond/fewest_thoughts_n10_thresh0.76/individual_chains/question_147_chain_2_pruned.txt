Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle annihilation. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, so an antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, slow moving... Oh, right, when particles are moving slowly, their kinetic energy is much less than their rest mass energy. So maybe I can approximate things using non-relativistic methods? Or wait, no, maybe I should consider relativistic effects since the velocities might be significant. Hmm, but the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps the initial kinetic energy isn't too high.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the antiproton is moving, but the proton is probably at rest? Or wait, do I know the initial setup? The problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the initial system has the proton at rest, and the antiproton has some low velocity. Or maybe both are moving? Not sure. Oh wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, which implies that the proton is at rest, perhaps.

Wait, the process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, the initial particles are a proton and antiproton. The proton has rest mass m_p, and the antiproton has rest mass m_p as well. So the total rest mass energy is 2 m_p c². But wait, the problem says m_A c² is 300 MeV. What's the mass of the proton? I remember m_p c² is approximately 938 MeV. So each A particle has a much lower mass than the proton. Hmm, so the products are lighter, but there are two of each, so four particles in total.

Now, when particles annihilate or collide, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can treat this as a non-relativistic process. Or maybe not, because the product particles might end up moving at relativistic speeds.

Wait, let's think about the initial setup. The proton is probably at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity. Since it's moving slowly, maybe we can approximate that the initial momentum is roughly the momentum of the antiproton, which is low.

But wait, the initial system's total energy
