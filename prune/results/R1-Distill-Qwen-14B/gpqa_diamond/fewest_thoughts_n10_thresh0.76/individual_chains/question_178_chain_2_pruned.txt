Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a Lagrangian L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. And the question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, I remember that dimensions in field theories are important for renormalizability. The idea is that terms in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension less than or equal to 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 since the integral over spacetime (which has dimension 4) times the Lagrangian (which must be dimensionless) gives a dimensionless action.

So, the first step is to find the mass dimension of each field and factor in the Lagrangian term. Let me break down each part of the term L_int.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, then F^{μν}.

I think each field has a specific mass dimension. For a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2 because the kinetic term in the Lagrangian is something like iψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which has to have dimension 4. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, so ψ must be (4 - 1)/2 = 3/2 each.

Wait, wait, that calculation: The kinetic term is i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. The derivative has dimension 1. The term must be dimension 4. ψ̄ and ψ are both spinors, each with dimension d. So 2d (for ψ̄ and ψ) +1 (from ∂) =4. So 2d =3 → d=3/2. Yep, so each ψ has dimension 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of γ matrices. Each γ has dimension 0 because they're just matrices. So [σ_{μν}] is [γμ, γν] which is dimension 0 (since they're both 0). So σ_{μν} is dimension 0.

Then there's ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ. So the dimensions: ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2. So 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 = 3. So [ψ̄ σ ψ] has dimension 3.

Wait, but wait, σ is a product of two γ matrices, but since each γ is dimensionless, the whole thing is dimensionless. So the product is still dimension 3.

Now, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, right? Or maybe another abelian field
