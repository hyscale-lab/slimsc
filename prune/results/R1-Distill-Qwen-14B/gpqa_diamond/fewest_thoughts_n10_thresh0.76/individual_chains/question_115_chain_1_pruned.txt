Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, usually two if it's a simple case. But wait, let me think about the specifics here.

The setup: An electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving from the right, also along the same axis, but with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, but one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is about the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma is the factor by which time dilation and length contraction occur. But how does that tie into their velocities and momenta?

Oh, right! The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So a higher gamma means the object is moving closer to the speed of light.

But wait, electrons and positrons have the same mass. So their energies and momenta can be calculated using their respective gammas and masses.

Wait, but since one is an electron and the other a positron, their charges are opposite, but the problem here is about their motion and momentum. So, maybe I need to calculate their relativistic momenta.

Right, the momentum p is gamma * m * v. But since gamma is given, and for electrons, the rest mass is known, perhaps I can calculate their momenta.

Wait, but how to relate that to the photons? Photons carry momentum, and their energy is related to their frequency or wavelength. Also, since photons are massless, their momentum is E/c, where E is energy.

But wait, the problem states that the two photons have the same energy. So E1 = E2 = E. Since each photon's momentum is E/c, their momenta are the same in magnitude, but the direction depends on where they go.

Now, considering conservation of momentum. The total momentum before collision must equal the total after.

So, the initial system consists of the electron and positron. Let's model the setup with a coordinate system. Let's say the horizontal axis is the x-axis. The electron is moving from the left, so its velocity is in the positive x-direction. The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is in the negative x-direction.

Wait no, wait. If the positron is moving from the right, along the horizontal axis. So electron is moving to the right (left to right, let's say positive x), and the positron is moving to the left (right to left, negative x).

Wait, no. Electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so direction is positive x. Positron is moving along same axis but from the right, so it's moving in the negative x direction, right? Because moving from the right along the same axis (like towards the left).

So to calculate their momenta, I need to compute the relativistic momentum for each.

For the electron: gamma1 = 4. Its momentum pe = gamma1 * m_e * v_e.

But wait, velocity v can be found from gamma. Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me
