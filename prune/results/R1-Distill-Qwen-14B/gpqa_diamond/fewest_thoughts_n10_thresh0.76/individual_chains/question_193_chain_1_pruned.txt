Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is usually denoted as 'p' or 'plx', right? So the relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Like, the formula is distance (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So parallax plx = 1/d, where d is distance. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So if I have N proportional to 1/(plx)^5, I can substitute plx with 1/d. Let's see, plx = 1/d, so 1/(plx) is d. So 1/(plx)^5 would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5? Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Let's write it down.

N = k * (1/plx^5) where k is some constant.

But since plx = 1/d, replacing it:

N = k * (1/( (1/d) )^5 ) = k * d^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm, wait, per unit range. So maybe it's the number density in terms of distance.

Wait
