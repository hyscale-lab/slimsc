Okay, I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio problem. Let's break it down.

So, the question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions remain the same. We need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D.

Hmm. First, I think I need to remember what the pp-III branch is. The proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun, and I think the pp-III branch is a part of that chain. So stopping the pp-III would mean that a certain part of the fusion reactions isn't happening anymore.

Wait, the pp-III branch involves the fusion of a helium-3 nucleus (triton) with a proton to produce helium-4 and a positron. The reaction is: ³H + p → ⁴He + e⁺ + ν_e. Or wait, maybe it's ³H + ³H → ⁴He + 2 protons + 2 neutrinos? Hmm, no, wait, the pp-III branch is another way, perhaps. Let me think. The main pp chain goes through the pp-I and pp-II branches. The pp-III branch is a minor pathway where two ³H (tritium) nuclei combine to form ⁴He, releasing two protons and two neutrinos. Right, so the reaction for pp-III is ³H + ³H → ⁴He + 2p + 2ν_e. So each of these produces two neutrinos, each with about 192 keV of energy, I think. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, the neutrinos from the pp chain usually have lower energies, around 200 keV or so, but wait, the question is about higher energy bands, 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So maybe this is about the higher-energy neutrinos from other processes.

Wait, another major source of solar neutrinos is the CNO cycle, which produces neutrinos of higher energies. CNO neutrinos are typically higher energy than the pp neutrinos. Oh wait, but in the Sun, the main process is the proton-proton chain, and the CNO cycle contributes a smaller amount. So if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino flux?

Let me think about the neutrino production. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos with a certain energy spectrum. Each fusion in the pp-III branch emits two neutrinos, each with an energy around 160 keV or so. So if the pp-III branch stops, the neutrino flux from that source would drop. But the question is about higher energy bands, so maybe the pp-III neutrinos are not in those bands.

Wait, the question is about the flux in higher energy bands, 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So perhaps these are from the CNO cycle or other higher-energy processes. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the
