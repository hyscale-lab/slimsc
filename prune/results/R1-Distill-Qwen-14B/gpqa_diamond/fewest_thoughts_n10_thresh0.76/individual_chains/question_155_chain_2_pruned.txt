Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the standard deviation formula. So, ΔPz would be the square root of the expectation of Pz squared minus the square of the expectation of Pz.

The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Hmm, wait, but the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So, the state is expressed in the Pz eigenbasis. That's important because it might simplify some calculations.

First, I need to calculate the expectation value of Pz, ⟨Pz⟩. Since the state is a vector in the Pz basis, applying Pz to the state should just give the eigenvalue corresponding to that state.

Wait, the state is (a, b, c) where a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(2), c= -1/2. But since the basis is the Pz eigenbasis, each basis vector corresponds to a particular eigenvalue. So, the state is a linear combination of the Pz eigenstates.

Looking at the matrix for Pz, which is diagonal, it's clear. The diagonal entries are the eigenvalues for each basis vector. So the first basis vector (eigenstate of Pz with eigenvalue ħ) has components (1,0,0). The second is (0,0,0), wait no, looking at Pz's matrix:

Pz matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ for the respective basis states. So, the given state is a combination of these three.

The state vector is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me check the normalization. The sum of squares: (-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 +1)/4 = 4/4=1. So it's normalized, good.

So, the state is |ψ⟩ = (-1/2)|1⟩ + (1/√2)|2⟩ + (-1/2)|3⟩, where |1⟩ is the eigenstate with eigenvalue ħ, |2⟩ has eigenvalue 0, and |3⟩ has eigenvalue -ħ.

Wait, but wait. The state is given in the Pz eigenbasis, so each component is the amplitude for that eigenstate. So when we calculate ⟨ψ|Pz|ψ⟩, it's just the sum of the probabilities times their eigenvalues.

So, let's compute ⟨Pz⟩:

⟨Pz
