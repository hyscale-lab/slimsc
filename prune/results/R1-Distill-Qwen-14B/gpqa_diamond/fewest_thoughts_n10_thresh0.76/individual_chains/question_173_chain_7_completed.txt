Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's asking.

The question says that an electron is traveling along the x-direction at a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE. The options are A to D, each a different order of magnitude.

Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle comes into play here. The principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. The formula I recall is Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, sometimes it's written as the product being greater than or equal to ħ/2, but for the minimum uncertainty, we can take it as equality.

So, first, I need to find the uncertainty in momentum Δp. Once I have Δp, I can relate that to the uncertainty in energy. But wait, how?

Wait a second, energy is related to momentum through the kinetic energy formula. Since the electron is moving at a speed v, its kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But wait, that's the average or exact energy if we know the exact momentum. But here, since we have an uncertainty in momentum, the uncertainty in energy ΔE should be related to Δp. So, maybe I should think about the uncertainty in kinetic energy. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the relation between Δp and ΔE via the derivative of energy with respect to momentum.

Let me think. The kinetic energy K is (p²)/(2m), right? So, if I take the differential of K with respect to p, dK/dp = p/m. So, the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be approximately (dK/dp)*Δp. So, ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, wait. Because the uncertainty in energy is also related to the change in kinetic energy due to the uncertainty in momentum. So, if Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, then the corresponding uncertainty in kinetic energy is (p/m) multiplied by Δp. Because K = p²/(2m), so dK = (2p/(2m)) dp = (p/m) dp. So, that's where that comes from.

But wait, p is the momentum. Since the electron is moving at speed v, the exact momentum p is m*v. So, p = m*v, and thus dK/dp = (m*v)/m = v. So, substituting back, ΔE ≈ v * Δp.

Wait, that's a helpful simplification. So ΔE ≈ v * Δp.

So first, I need to find Δp. From the uncertainty principle, Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2, so Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx).

Yes, that makes sense. So let's compute Δp.

Given that Δx is 0.1 nm. 0.1 nm is 0.1e-9 meters, which is 1e-10 meters.

Wait, no: 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters? Wait, 1 nm is 1e-9 m, so 0.1 nm is 0.1 * 1e-9 m = 1e-10 m. Right.

So, Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Let's plug in the numbers.

The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But sometimes, to approximate, people use 1e-34 J·s for easy calculations. So for estimation, I can use ħ ≈ 1e-34 J·s.

So, Δp ≈ (1e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-10 m) ) = (1e-34)/(2e-10) ) = (1/2) * 1e-24 kg·m/s. So, that's 5e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, let me compute that again. 1e-34 divided by 2e-10 is 1e-34 /2e-10 = (1/2) * 1e-24 = 5e-25 kg·m/s. Right.

Okay, so Δp is approximately 5e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, the speed v is given as 2e8 m/s. So, using the earlier relation ΔE ≈ v * Δp.

So, ΔE ≈ (2e8 m/s) * (5e-25 kg·m/s) ) = 10e-17 J. Because 2e8 *5e-25 = 10e-17, which is 1e-16 J. Wait, wait, 2e8 *5e-25 = (2*5) * (e8 * e-25) ) = 10 * e-17 = 1e-16 J.

Hold on, let me do that multiplication again. 2e8 times 5e-25: 2*5=10, e8 * e-25 = e-17, so 10e-17 = 1e-16 J.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: 2e8 is 2*10^8, 5e-25 is 5*10^-25. Multiply them: 2*5=10, 10^8 *10^-25=10^-17. So 10 *10^-17=10^-16 J.

So ΔE is approximately 1e-16 J. Looking back at the options, option D is ~1e-16 J.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there any factor I'm missing? Because sometimes the uncertainty principle uses a coefficient like 1/(2π) or something. Oh, right, in the uncertainty principle, Δx Δp >= ħ/2. So when we take the minimum uncertainty, it's ħ/2, so the formula I used is correct. So I think that's accounted for.

Alternatively, sometimes people write Δx Δp ~ ħ, but I think the correct minimal uncertainty is ħ/2. So I think my calculation is right.

So, with that calculation, the minimum uncertainty in energy is about 1e-16 J, which is option D.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron, we use the Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between momentum and energy. The Uncertainty Principle states:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, the uncertainty in position is given as \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Using the reduced Planck's constant \( \hbar \approx 1 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), the minimum uncertainty in momentum is:

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 1 \times 10^{-10}} = 5 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Next, the uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) is related to the uncertainty in momentum \( \Delta p \) through the kinetic energy formula. Since the kinetic energy \( K \) is given by \( K = \frac{p^2}{2m} \), the differential \( \Delta K \) can be approximated as:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{p}{m} \cdot \Delta p = v \cdot \Delta p,
\]

where \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of the electron. Substituting \( \Delta p = 5 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \) and \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
\Delta E \approx (2 \times 10^8) \cdot (5 \times 10^{-25}) = 10 \times 10^{-17} = 1 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J}.
\]

Thus, the minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately \( 1 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option D.
