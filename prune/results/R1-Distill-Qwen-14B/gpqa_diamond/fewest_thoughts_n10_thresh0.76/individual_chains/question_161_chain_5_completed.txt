Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope setup. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, Mike is working on a high-resolution TEM that's operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment. Oh wait, the pressure is less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to have very few gas molecules so that the electron microscopy can be better because there's less interference.

But even after doing all that, some gas particles are still there, and the mass spectrometer detects them. Mike figured out the mean free path of these gas molecules, which is λ1. He used factors like the volume of the compartment, pressure, and temperature. Mean free path, right, I remember that's the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The formula is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), but wait, pressure is involved, and temperature too.

Then, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices something about the mean free path. It changes from λ1 to λ2. But the temperature is the same, so that shouldn't change. So why is λ2 different?

Wait, the mean free path in a vacuum is usually calculated based on gas properties. But when the electron beam is on, maybe something else is happening. Oh, right! The electron beam itself might be interacting with the gas molecules. Like, the electrons could be causing the gas molecules to ionize or something. If the gas becomes ionized, the mean free path would change because the effective cross-section for collisions changes.

In the original state, the gas is neutral. When ionized, the ions might have different interactions. Let me think. For a neutral gas, the mean free path is based on the collisions between gas molecules. But when the electrons from the beam hit the gas, they might cause the gas molecules to lose or gain electrons, making them charged. Charged particles would interact more strongly with each other and perhaps with the electron beam. 

Wait, but how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules? If the gas is ionized, the mean free path might decrease. Because now, the ions can also collide with each other and with the electrons. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam introduces more energy, causing more frequent collisions. Or perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more mobile, increasing the rate of collisions.

Another angle: when the electron beam is on, does it cause the gas to become a plasma? If so, the behavior of the gas changes. Plasmas have different properties. The mean free path in a plasma might be shorter because of increased interactions between ions and electrons. So the λ would decrease.

So, in the initial situation, the mean free path was λ1, assuming the gas is neutral. But when the electron beam is active, if the gas is ionized, the mean free path λ2 would be shorter than λ1. Because ionized particles (charged) have a higher effective cross-sectional area for collisions. That would make the mean free path smaller. 

So, looking at the options: the question is what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1. The options are A, B, C, D.

Option C says λ2 < λ1. That makes sense if the gas becomes ionized. Because the ions would hit each other more often, so the mean free path is shorter.

Wait, but wait. The mean free path formula for a gas is λ = (kT)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), where d is the diameter of the molecules. But in this case, when the gas is ionized, does the effective diameter change? Well, for charged particles, perhaps they have a larger effective diameter because their Coulomb interactions dominate. So d would be larger. Let me think: if d increases, λ would decrease. That's because λ is inversely proportional to d squared. So a larger d leads to a smaller λ.

So if d increases upon ionization, λ would decrease. So λ2 would be less than λ1. So option C is λ2 < λ1. That would be correct.

Another thought: the electron beam might cause gas molecules to become charged, which affects their mean free path because they can now interact with the charged surfaces of the microscope or the beam itself. Alternatively, perhaps the electrons cause the gas to heat up, but the question states that the temperature remains the same, so that's not a factor.

So the conclusion is that λ2 is less than λ1. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, Mike achieved an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment with a pressure of less than $10^{-9}$ Torr. Despite this, some gas molecules remained, and their mean free path, $\lambda_1$, was determined based on the compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature. Upon initiating the electron beam, Mike observed a change in the mean free path to $\lambda_2$, even though the temperature remained constant.

The mean free path of gas molecules is influenced by factors such as molecular diameter, pressure, and temperature. Initially, $\lambda_1$ was calculated for neutral gas molecules. However, when the electron beam was activated, the gas molecules could become ionized due to interactions with the beam. Ionized gas molecules (charged particles) have a larger effective cross-sectional area for collisions compared to neutral molecules, which reduces the mean free path. This is because the Coulomb interactions between charged particles increase the frequency of collisions, leading to a shorter average distance between collisions.

Given that $\lambda_2$ corresponds to the mean free path in the ionized state, it must be smaller than $\lambda_1$, which corresponds to the mean free path of neutral gas molecules. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that $\lambda_2 < \lambda_1$.

Answer: C
