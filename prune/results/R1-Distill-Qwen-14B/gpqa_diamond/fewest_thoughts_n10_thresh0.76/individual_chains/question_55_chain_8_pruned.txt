Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are all acetates, either propenyl or butenyl, and whether they're cis or trans.

Let me recall what I know about NMR and these structures. The compound is an acetate, so it has an acetyl group (OAc-) attached to some propenyl or butenyl group. The substituents are going to affect the NMR signals, especially the vinyl protons.

Looking at the NMR data:

7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
2.1 ppm (3H, s)
1.6 ppm (3H, d)

The singlet at 2.1 ppm is probably the methyl group from the acetate (OAc-), since that's a common singlet. The doublet at 7.0 ppm with a coupling of 16 Hz is a large coupling, which usually suggests a trans coupling in a vinyl system. So that's probably one of the vinyl protons.

The doublet of quartets at 5.5 ppm is a bit trickier. Wait, a doublet of quartets (dq) implies that the proton is coupled to two different sets of protons. So maybe it's in a position where it's next to two different groups. Hmm, like maybe a CH2 group next to an CH with another substituent? Or perhaps in a conjugated system where the coupling is through more than one bond.

Let me think about the possible structures.

Option C and B are propenyl acetates. Propenyl has three carbons, so the structure would be something like CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Or wait, no, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or is it CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond?

Wait, acetates are usually OAc-OR. So for propenyl, it's OAc-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc for propenyl acetate.

But wait, the configuration
