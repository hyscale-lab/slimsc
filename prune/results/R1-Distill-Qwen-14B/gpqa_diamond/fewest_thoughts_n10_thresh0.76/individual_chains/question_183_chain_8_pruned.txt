Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize its structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring, right? With substituents at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-). Also, there's an ene in the name, so the ring has a double bond. The numbering would be such that the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, I think.

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a double bond at 3-4. On carbon 2 is a formyl (CHO), and on carbon 5 is a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH-, so it's attached to the cyclohexene ring at position 5.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus is used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, but wait, no, that's for converting alkyl chlorides to alkenes. Alternatively, red phosphorus is used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction? No, Wolff-Kishner is about removing carbonyl groups with heat and ammonia. Wait, maybe it's a reaction involving elimination or addition.

Wait, another reaction: when alkenes react with HI in presence of red phosphorus, it's a halogenation or addition. Oh wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is a reagent for the addition to alkenes. Wait, no, wait: when you have an alkene and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it's the same as the hydrohalogenation. But wait, maybe it's something else. Another possibility: the reaction of a conjugated diene with HI and P? No, perhaps it's about the Michael addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation? No, because we have excess HI. Wait, wait, red phosphorus is used in the preparation of carbonyl halides. Oh wait, another reaction: the reaction of
