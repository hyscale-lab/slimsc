Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on my olefin metathesis reactions, but let me think this through.

Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis, right? Metathesis means the redistribution of substituents in a molecule. So, it breaks and reforms double bonds. I remember that Grubbs is good for ring-closing and ring-opening metatheses, as well as cross metatheses.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But since the molecule is chiral, that's why it's racemic. The structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, wait. Let me draw it out. Pent-1-ene has five carbons with a double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's see: pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2? No, wait, pent has five carbons. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. But it's 3-methyl, so a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait, no. Oh wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, pent-1-ene: positions 1 and 2 have the double bond. Then, the 3rd carbon (position 3) has a methyl group. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, wait, that can't be right because that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, but that's 3-methyl, so
