Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about diffraction, which I remember is a topic we covered recently. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says there's an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light with wavelength Î» is shining along the z-axis, hitting this aperture. The setup creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh, and we can approximate tan(theta) as theta since the angles are small.

Hmm, wait. When N is infinitely large, the aperture becomes a circle because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. So this is a circular aperture problem, right? Because each side becomes infinitesimally small, making it a smooth circle.

I remember that for a single slit, the minima occur at certain angles, but wait, this is a circular aperture. Circular apertures are different. They have something called the Airy disk pattern, where the central maximum is surrounded by rings of minima and maxima.

Wait, no, wait a second. For a single slit, the diffraction pattern is a series of bright and dark fringes. The minima occur at angles where a sin(theta) = m lambda, with m being integers. But for a circular aperture, the minima are at different conditions. Oh right, the first minimum for a circular aperture occurs at a different condition than a single slit.

Wait, the problem says it's an N-sided polygon with apothems of length a. So the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem is related to the radius (the distance from center to vertex). But when N approaches infinity, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle. So the circle has radius 'a'?

Wait, no. Wait, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem 'a' is related to the radius R (distance from center to a vertex) by a = R * cos(pi/N). But when N is very large, cos(pi/N) approaches 1, so a is approximately R. So yeah, in the limit as N approaches infinity, the apothem 'a' becomes the
