Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about binary star systems and figuring out which one is more massive. Let me see what the question says.

Alright, the problem states that there are two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. So system_1's period is longer than system_2's. Then, the spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s.

The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. They mention that the mass of a system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Wait, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocities of the stars are related to their masses. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity because it's orbiting the center of mass with a smaller circle. Oh right, because the center of mass is the balance point. So the mass is inversely proportional to the velocity.

So the formula I think we use is the mass ratio. The mass ratio (q) is the mass of the smaller star divided by the mass of the larger star. And from Kepler's third law, the period is related to the total mass as well. Or wait, maybe I should think about the mass function here.

Wait, maybe it's better to approach this using the formula for the masses based on RVs. I recall that each star's RV amplitude is inversely proportional to its mass. So if one star has a higher RV, it's less massive.

Let me think. Let's denote the two stars in system_1 as m1a and m1b. Their RV amplitudes are 10 and 5 km/s. So the mass ratio q1 would be m1b/m1a = (v1a / v1b) = (10/5) = 2. So m1b is twice as massive as m1a. So the masses are m1a and 2*m1a. The total mass of system_1 is m1a + 2*m1a = 3*m1a.

Similarly, for system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 and 10
