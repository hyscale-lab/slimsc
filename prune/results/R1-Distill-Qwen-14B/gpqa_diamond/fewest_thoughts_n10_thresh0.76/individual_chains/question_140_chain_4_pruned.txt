Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by understanding what's given and breaking it down step by step.

First, the problem describes Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. That makes me think that Substance X is probably a diatomic molecule where one of the atoms has a heavier isotope. Maybe like H2O where oxygen might have a heavier isotope, or something like that.

Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, same number of neutrons and protons. So for a molecule, each atom in it must have equal n and p. Wait, but molecules can have multiple atoms. So maybe W is a molecule where each constituent atom has equal n and p. Or perhaps the entire molecule has equal n and p. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think.

Wait, the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about common gases. Maybe H2O? No, because H2O has O with more neutrons. Or maybe CO2? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is something like O2 or N2. Wait, no, because O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in O-16, but heavier isotopes would change that.

Wait, perhaps the gas is something like CH4? No, that's not a gas formed in such reactions. Maybe the gas is something with equal neutrons and protons per molecule. Let me think of the possibilities. If the molecule is H2O, each molecule would have 10 protons (2 from H, 8 from O) and 10 neutrons? Wait, no, O usually has 8 neutrons in O-16, but if it's a heavier isotope, maybe O-18? So O would have 10 neutrons. H has no neutrons. So H2O would have 2 H (0 neutrons) and 1 O with 10 neutrons. Total neutrons in the molecule is 10, protons are 8 (O) + 2 (H) = 10. Oh wait, that's equal. So each molecule of H2O would have 10 protons and 10 neutrons. That's 20 each? No, wait, the molecule has a total of 10 protons and 10 neutrons. So that's equal. Oh, but wait, the problem says gas W. So maybe W is H2O, but that's a liquid, not a gas, under standard conditions. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps W is H2. Because each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That's not equal. Or maybe W is something like NH3. Wait, but ammonia is a gas, but let's see. N has 7 protons, and each H has 1. So total protons: 7 +3=10. Neutrons: N has
