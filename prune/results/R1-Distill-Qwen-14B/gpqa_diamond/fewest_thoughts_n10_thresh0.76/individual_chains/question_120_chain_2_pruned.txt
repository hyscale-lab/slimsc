Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and parallax. Hmm, let me think about it step by step.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, which probably means they're spread out evenly in all directions. The task is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax. The options are different power laws, so I need to figure out which exponent applies.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. Right, the parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance. So, plx = 1/distance. Or wait, no, actually, the formula is plx (in parsecs) is equal to 1/distance in parsecs. Oh right, so a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, and a parallax of 0.5 means it's 2 parsecs away.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, if I have a certain range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density in space is uniform. So the number of stars depends on the volume they occupy. Because volume increases with distance, the number of stars per unit volume is the same in all regions.

Wait, but parallax is inversely related to distance. So as parallax increases (which means the star is closer), how does the number of stars in a given parallax range change?

Let me think about the volume associated with a certain range of parallax. Let's imagine two consecutive parallax values: plx and plx + dplx. What's the corresponding distance? Distance d is 1/plx. So when plx is small (far away), d is large.

But wait, the volume between plx and plx + dplx would be the volume of a spherical shell. The volume of a shell is 4πr² dr, where r is the radius. But since dr is in terms of distance, I need to express the change in distance corresponding to a change in parallax.

Parallax (p) is 1/d, so d = 1/p. The change in d (dd) when p changes by d_p is... Let's see. d = 1/p → dd = -1/p² dp. Since we're considering a small dp, the negative sign indicates
