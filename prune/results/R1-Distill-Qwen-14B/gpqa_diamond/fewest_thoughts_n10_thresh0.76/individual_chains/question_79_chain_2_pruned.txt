Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra were taken, and we need to identify what compound X was from the options given.

First, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides. Wait, no, actually, isn't that used in the Sharpless epoxidation? Or maybe it's more commonly known as a base used in certain reactions. Hmm, wait, Sharpless uses a different catalyst, but this reagent is often used in the epoxidation of alkenes. Oh right, I think it's a base used in some epoxidation reactions, maybe the Prilezhaev epoxidation? Or wait, maybe it's part of the conditions for epoxidizing alkenes using a peracid. Wait, no, peracids are like mCPBA or something. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up things.

Wait, another approach: the reaction conditions. The solvent is nonpolar, and the temperature is 403 K, which is around 130°C. So that's a fairly high temperature. The reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (which I think is called DBU or something else? Wait, no, DBU is 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene. So maybe this is a different bicyclic amine. Oh, wait, I think 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is also known as diazepine or something, but more importantly, I remember that it's a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So perhaps it's used as a base in some kind of elimination or epoxidation.

Wait, another thought: when alkenes react with certain reagents to form epoxides. Epoxidation usually involves some kind of peracid, but sometimes other conditions are used. Oh, wait, the Prilezhaev oxidation is for epoxidizing alkenes using a peracid in an acidic condition. Alternatively, the reaction could be using an oxidizing agent like mCPBA (meta-chloroperbenzoic acid) in a non-polar solvent. But in this case, the reagent is DBU-like, but not exactly DBU.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting off track. Let me think again. The product's NMR is given. So maybe I should first analyze the NMR data to figure out what the product is, and then backtrack to find the starting material.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7
