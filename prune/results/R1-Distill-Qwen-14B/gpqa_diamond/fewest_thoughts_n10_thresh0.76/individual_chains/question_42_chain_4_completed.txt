Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. But maybe that's not directly relevant here.

The question gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperature ratios are Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by 40%, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3 by 130%? Wait, no, the ratio is 2.3, so Planet2 is 2.3 times hotter than Planet3. So Planet3 is cooler.

Then, the mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So Planet1 is 15% more massive than Planet2, and Planet2 is 35% more than Planet3. So each planet is progressively less massive as we go from Planet1 to Planet3.

The question is asking about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. How much larger is it? The options are A to D, with numbers like ~10.4, ~3.2, etc.

I think I need to use the formula that relates orbital period to the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, Kepler's third law! But wait, Kepler's law in its basic form is for planets orbiting the same star, right? So, P² ∝ a³ / M, where M is the mass of the star. But wait, if the planets are orbiting the same star, the mass of the star (M) is the same for all. So, for Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² / G M) * a³. So, P² is proportional to a³ when M is same.

But wait, the equilibrium temperature comes into play here. The equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's albedo, and the distance. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π² σ D²) ]^(1/4), where L is star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is distance. But wait, maybe more simply, T is proportional to (L (1 - a))^(1/4) / D^(1/2). Because T scales with (L(1-a)/D²)^(1/4), so T ∝ (L(1-a))^(1/4) / D^(1/2).

Wait, but in this problem, the albedo is the same for all three planets, so (1 - a) is a constant. So the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L)^(1/4) / D^(1/2). But since all three planets orbit the same star, L is the same for all. So T ∝ 1 / D^(1/2), which means D ∝ 1/(T^2). Oh wait, no: T is proportional to (1/D^0.5), so D is proportional to (1/T)^2 → D ∝ 1/(T²). So if T1 is the temperature of Planet1, and T2 of Planet2, then D2 = D1 * (T1 / T2)^2.

So the ratio of distances between the planets can be found using their temperature ratios.

Given that T1/T2 = 1.4, so D2 = D1 * (1.4)^(-2). Wait, because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D), so D is proportional to 1/(T²). So if T2 = T1 / 1.4, then D2 = (1.4)^2 * D1. Wait, no, let's double-check.

If T ∝ 1 / sqrt(D), then D ∝ 1 / T². So D2 = D1 * (T1 / T2)^2. Because when T increases, D decreases.

So for the first ratio, T1/T2 = 1.4 → T1 = 1.4 T2.

Then D2 = D1 * (1.4)^2 → (1.4)^2 is 1.96. So D2 is 1.96 times D1.

Then, between Planet2 and Planet3, T2/T3 = 2.3 → T3 = T2 / 2.3.

So D3 = D2 * (T2 / T3)^2 → T2 is 2.3 times T3 → T2/T3 = 2.3. So D3 = D2 * (2.3)^2 → (2.3)^2 is about 5.29. So D3 = D2 * 5.29.

But D2 is already 1.96 D1, so D3 = 1.96 *5.29 D1. Let me calculate that: 1.96 *5.29. Let me see: 2 *5.29=10.58, but 1.96 is 0.04 less than 2. So subtract 0.04 *5.29=0.2116 → 10.58 -0.2116=10.3684. So D3 is approximately 10.3684 times D1.

So the distance of Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.

Wait, but Kepler's third law says P² ∝ a³. So P is proportional to a^(3/2). So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (D3/D1)^(3/2). Since D3/D1 is approximately 10.37, then P3/P1 = (10.37)^(3/2).

What's 10.37 to the 3/2 power? Let's compute.

First, sqrt(10.37) is about 3.22. Then, 3.22 cubed is approximately 3.22 *3.22= 10.3684, then 10.3684 *3.22 ≈ 33.36. So P3 is about 33.36 times P1.

Wait, but let me check. Wait, 10.37^1.5. Let me compute 10^1.5 is about 31.62. 10.37 is a bit more than 10, so a bit higher than 31.62. Let me calculate it properly.

Wait, perhaps using exponents:

10.37^(3/2) = (10.37^0.5) * (10.37^1). So sqrt(10.37) is approximately 3.22, as I thought earlier. 10.37 is 10.37, so 3.22 *10.37 = 3.22 *10 =32.2 plus 3.22 *0.37≈1.20 → 32.2+1.2=33.4.

So P3/P1≈33.4.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

Wait, but wait a second. Are there any other factors I'm missing? Because Kepler's third law in the context of exoplanets usually involves the mass of the star. Do I have any info about the star's mass?

Ah, right! Because the problem doesn't specify the star's mass, so I'm assuming all planets orbit the same star. So yes, Kepler's law applies as P² ∝ a³/(M), where M is the star's mass. But since all planets are around the same star, M is same, so P² ∝ a³, so the ratio comes from a³.

Wait, but what about the mass ratios of the planets themselves? Hmm, the problem gives the mass ratios between the planets, but I'm not sure how that affects the orbital period. Because Kepler's law for a planet's orbit around a star (assuming the star's mass is much larger) depends on the star's mass, not the planet's. So the planet's mass doesn't significantly affect the period in the case where the planet is much less massive than the star. But if the planet's mass is a significant fraction, then you might need to consider it, but I think in most cases, it's negligible, especially for exoplanets where typically the star is much more massive.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the planets' mass ratios are given. Planet1 is 1.15 times Planet2, and Planet2 is 1.35 times Planet3. So Planet1 is 1.15 * Planet2, and Planet2 is 1.35 * Planet3 → Planet1 is 1.15 *1.35 * Planet3 = ~1.5525 times Planet3. So all planets have masses close to each other. But again, in Kepler's law, it's the star's mass that matters. So unless the star's mass is a significant fraction of the planets' masses, which I think it's not, we can neglect the planet masses.

So, I think the calculation is correct. The orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times that of Planet1, so the answer is option D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance, as well as Kepler's third law.

### Step 1: Relating Temperature to Orbital Distance
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \), where \( D \) is the orbital distance. This implies \( D \propto \frac{1}{T^2} \). Given the temperature ratios:
- \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \), so \( D_2 = D_1 \cdot (1.4)^2 = D_1 \cdot 1.96 \).
- \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \), so \( D_3 = D_2 \cdot (2.3)^2 = D_2 \cdot 5.29 \).

Substituting \( D_2 = 1.96 D_1 \) into \( D_3 \), we find:
\[
D_3 = 1.96 \cdot 5.29 \cdot D_1 \approx 10.37 \cdot D_1.
\]

### Step 2: Relating Orbital Distance to Orbital Period
Kepler's third law states \( P^2 \propto D^3 \), or equivalently, \( \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2} \). Substituting \( \frac{D_3}{D_1} \approx 10.37 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculating \( (10.37)^{3/2} \)
First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.37} \approx 3.22 \). Then, cube this result:
\[
(10.37)^{3/2} = \sqrt{10.37} \cdot 10.37 \approx 3.22 \cdot 10.37 \approx 33.4.
\]

### Step 4: Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:
