Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about the luminosities of two stars. Let me read it again carefully. 

The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Wait, but the question isn't directly about mass, right? Oh, right, the question is about luminosity. 

They determined the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest and found they're the same. Hmm, the peak wavelength. Oh, right, that's the black body radiation peak, which depends on temperature. So I remember Wien's Law, which states that the wavelength of maximum intensity is inversely proportional to the temperature. So 位_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. 

So if both stars have the same 位_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because 位_max is the same, T1 = T2. That's an important point. 

The radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is how fast they're moving away or towards us. But for Doppler shift, the observed wavelength would be affected. But wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, so if the stars emit a spectrum that peaks at 位_max, but their velocities might shift that peak. 

Wait, but in the scenario, the observed wavelengths at maximum brightness are the same. So perhaps the stars' actual emission peaks are shifted due to their velocities. But the problem said the wavelengths they appear brightest are the same. So maybe we have to correct for the Doppler shift to find their actual temperatures. 

Because if a star is moving towards us (radial velocity positive?), it would blueshift the peak wavelength, making it shorter. If moving away, redshift. But in this case, Star_1's radial velocity is 0, so no shift. Star_2's is 700 km/s. But wait, which direction? The problem doesn't specify, just says the radial velocities are 0 and 700. Let me think: if a star is moving towards us, its observed wavelength is shorter than emitted. If moving away, longer. 

So for Star_2, if it has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, I need to assume direction.
