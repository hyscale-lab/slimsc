Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I remember that when a nucleus undergoes fission, it splits into two smaller nuclei, and they move apart due to the conservation of momentum. Since the original nucleus is at rest, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

The problem says the initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Oh wait, right, the rest mass energy is given by E=mc², so M is the rest mass, and energy is 300 GeV. But when it splits, the combined rest mass of the two fragments is 99% of M. So the total rest mass after fission is 0.99*M. That must mean that some mass was converted into kinetic energy, right? Because the initial rest mass is 300 GeV, the total energy after fission includes the rest masses and the kinetic energies.

The fragments' rest masses sum to 99% of M. So one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let me write that down. Let the smaller fragment have mass m, so the larger is 2m. So m + 2m =3m=0.99M → m = (0.99M)/3 = 0.33M. Wait no, wait, 3m=0.99M → m=0.33M? Wait, 0.99M/3 is 0.33M? Let me calculate: 0.99 divided by 3 is 0.33. So m=0.33M, and the other is 0.66M. So the two fragments have rest masses 0.33M and 0.66M. So the total rest mass is 0.99M as given.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero. That means the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let’s denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for the two fragments. Using conservation of momentum: (0.66M) * v1 = (0.33M) * v2. Wait, but wait, in
