Okay, so I've got this question about NMR spectroscopy, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question says that there's a mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present based on the options given.

First, let's understand the structure of each compound. The molecular formula C10H14 suggests each is a disubstituted benzene with four methyl groups, because benzene has six carbons, so four methyl groups would add four times two (since each methyl is CH3) making total carbons 6 + 4*1 = 10? Wait, no, wait. Benzene is C6H6. If each compound is a tetramethylbenzene, then each would have four methyl groups attached. So the formula would be C6H5(C4H9)? No, wait, no. Let me think again. Each methyl is -CH3. So four methyl groups would add 4*(CH3) = 4C and 12H. Benzene is C6H6, but when you add substituents, each substituent replaces a hydrogen. So for four methyl groups, the formula would be C10H14. Because C6 + 4 = C10, H: each methyl adds 3 H, but each substitution removes one H. So for four methyls, benzene has 6 H. Each substitution replaces one H, so 6 -4 = 2 H left? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, benzene when substituted, each substituent replaces a H. So for each substitution, you lose one H. So four substituents would replace four Hs, so the total H on the benzene would be 6 -4 = 2. But each substituent is a methyl group, which has three H. So total H would be 2 (from benzene) + 4*(3) = 2 +12 =14. So the formula is C10H14, which matches. So each compound is a tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, no, another way: each methyl is CH3, so four methyls add 4*3=12 H. Benzene has 6 H. But in the compound, each substitution reduces the H on the ring. For four substituents, 6-4=2 H remain. So total H in the molecule is 2 (from ring) +12 (from methyls) =14. So the formula is C10H14. So each compound is a tetramethylbenzene with four substituents.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The aromatic region shows two singlets at around 6.7 ppm, each integrating for 1:1 ratio. Since each singlet suggests all equivalent protons in that environment, and the integration is 1:1, that suggests that
