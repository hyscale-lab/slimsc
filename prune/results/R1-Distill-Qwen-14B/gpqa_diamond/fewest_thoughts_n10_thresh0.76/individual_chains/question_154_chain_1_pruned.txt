Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are four different compounds. I remember that for such problems, I should look at the molecular formula, functional groups, and the NMR data.

First, looking at the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%). There's another peak at 158, which is 32%. Hmm, so the molecular weight is 156. The other peak could be a fragment or maybe a chlorine isotope. Wait, chlorine has an isotope with a mass of about 35 and 37. So the molecular ion at 156 could have a Cl? Let me calculate: molecular weight is 156, and if there's a Cl (35.5), then the rest would be 120.5. Or maybe another way: perhaps the molecular formula includes Cl.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's see the formula. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding Cl and OH. Wait, benzaldehyde is C6H5CHO. If it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate the molecular weight: C(7*12)=84, H(5)=5, Cl=35.5, O(2*16)=32. Total is 84+5+35.5+32 = 156.5. Oh, that's about 156.5, close to the molecular ion at 156. But wait, the peak is at 156, but the actual molecular weight would be a whole number. Hmm, maybe it's 156 exactly, but perhaps I should double-check.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. With a Cl, it becomes C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: C7 is 84, H5 is 5, Cl
