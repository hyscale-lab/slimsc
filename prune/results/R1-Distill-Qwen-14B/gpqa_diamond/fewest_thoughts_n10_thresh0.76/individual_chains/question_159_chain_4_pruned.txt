Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this quasar question. Hmm, the question says that observations in the near infrared and optical spectrum show a peak at about 790 nm and flux drops below that. I remember that in quasars, emission lines can be broad and sometimes have specific features, but I'm not entirely sure how that ties into the problem here.

Wait, the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth. Oh right, comoving distance depends on the redshift of the object and the cosmological parameters. The given universe is defined by the Lambda-CDM model with specific values: Hubble constant H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ω_m is 0.3, dark energy Ω_Λ is 0.7, and it's a flat universe. So I need to find the comoving distance for a quasar observed under these conditions.

But how does the peak wavelength relate to this? I think the peak in the spectrum could be due to some emission line. Wait, quasars often show emission lines like Lyman-alpha or others. The Lyman-alpha line is in the ultraviolet, but if it's redshifted into the optical or near-infrared, that might be what's happening here. So if the observed peak is at 790 nm, that's in the near infrared. The rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is about 121.6 nm. Let me check that. 121 nm is in the far UV. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's much longer.

So the redshift z can be calculated using the formula λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z). So z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1. Plugging the numbers: 790 / 121.6 is approximately 6.498. So z is about 5.498. Wait, let me calculate more accurately. 121.6 * 6.498 is about 790. Let's see 121.6 *6 = 729.6, 121.6 * 6.498= 121.6*(6 + 0.498) = 729.6 + 121.6 *0.498. 121.6 *0.
