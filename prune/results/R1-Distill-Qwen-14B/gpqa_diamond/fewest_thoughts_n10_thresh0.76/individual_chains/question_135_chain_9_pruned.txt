Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ_f f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I misread that. Let me look again. Oh, right, it's probably written as something like -λ ψ_f (y) (something) ψ_f(y). But I'm not too concerned about the exact form right now because the main point is probably the interaction terms.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about what are the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion pairs.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because energy and momentum must be conserved; the rest mass energy of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle.

So first, I need to know the masses of the various fermions involved. Let me list the known fermion masses. I'll have to think about up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top, and the leptons like electron, muon, tau.

Wait, but wait. The fermion content in the decay depends on which fermions can interact with X. The Lagrangian term given is -λ_f ψ_f (y) (some term) ψ_f(y). Hmm, the exact form matters because it tells me what fermions X couples to. So the term is -λ f ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y), maybe? Or perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling term where X is interacting with ψ_f, which is a fermion field.

Wait, the given interaction is L = -λ f f-bar X. Because usually, Yukawa interactions look like L = -g ψ ψ X, where X is a scalar (boson), and ψ is a fermion. So in this case, the term would be something like -λ X ψ_f ψ_f, which implies that X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So for each ψ_f, X can decay into ψ_f and ψ_f-bar.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the Lagrangian is written as: -λ f bar{psi}_f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) psi_f(y). Hmm, perhaps it's more precise to say that X couples to the fermions ψ_f. So for each fermion in the theory, X can mediate interactions, including decays.

But to figure out which fermions X can decay into, I need to know which fermions have a mass less than half of X's mass (since m_X =6 GeV, so m_f <=3 GeV). Because the rest mass of each fermion in the decay must be less than or equal to 3 GeV for the decay to be possible.

So let me list the approximate masses of the fermions:

- Up quark: around 2 MeV (much less than 3 GeV)
- Down quark: about 4-5 MeV
- Strange quark: ~100 MeV
- Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV (wait, but X is 6 GeV. 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. So bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks because 4.5 >3
