Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction. Hmm, let me try to think it through.

The question is about an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field diffraction pattern. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Also, the angles are small, so we can use the approximation tan(theta) ≈ theta.

Wait, when N is infinitely large, the shape becomes like a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. But wait, the apothem is the same for all sides. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which is the same as the radius of the inscribed circle.

So if the apothem is 'a' and N is very large, the aperture is approximately a circular aperture with radius a. Because as N increases, the distance from the center to the midpoint (apothem) becomes the radius of the circle. So the problem reduces to finding the minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Wait, but wait. I remember that the minima for a circular aperture occur at a certain condition. In the case of a single slit (rectangular aperture), the minima are at θ = (mλ)/(a), where a is the width and m is an integer. But for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is different. The min
