Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetic engineering. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm. The scenario is about creating a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. The goal is to see if this protein has a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They introduced a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. But when they tried to express it, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected. They looked into the construct's plus strand sequence and found an issue.

The question is why the overexpression isn't happening. The options are A to D.

First, I need to look at the construct's sequence. Let me read through it. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then there's TAC, which is Tyrosine, but wait, I thought the hemagglutinin (HA) tag is added at the N-terminus. So maybe the HA tag's sequence is supposed to be before the GADD45G coding sequence. But in the given sequence, does the HA tag appear correctly?

Wait, no. Let me think. The HA tag is a short peptide, usually about 11 amino acids. Its DNA sequence is something like ATG TAC CAC CAC ... or similar, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag is the sequence that comes after the ATG. But looking at the start of the given sequence: 5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTG
