Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is a way to count the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or each double bond (or triple bond) contributes to the index. For each ring or double bond, the index increases by one. Triple bonds count as two because they have two degrees of unsaturation.

So, first, I need to figure out what the starting material looks like. The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break that name down.

Cyclohex-3-ene means there's a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with a double bond starting at the third carbon. So the ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Then, there are two substituents: a formyl group (which is a CHO group) at position 2, and a vinyl group (which is CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- group, right? So the substituents are attached at positions 2 and 5.

Wait, wait. Let me draw the structure in my mind. The cyclohexene ring has five substituents? No, the main ring is cyclohex-3-ene, and substituents are at 2 and 5 positions.

So, position 2 is attached to a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 is attached to a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so it's CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so the substituent is CH2-CH2 but with a double bond. Oh wait, maybe I should correct that. The vinyl group is -CH2CH2 with a double bond between the two carbons, so it's CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

So the starting molecule has two double
