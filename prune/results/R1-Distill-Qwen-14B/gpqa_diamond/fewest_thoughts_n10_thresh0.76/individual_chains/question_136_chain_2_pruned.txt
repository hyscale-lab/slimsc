Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem to solve. Hmm, let's try to break it down. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. 

Wait, right, the field is radial, so its direction is along the radius vector. Since it's only radial, the other components (like theta and phi in spherical coordinates) must be zero. So, f(r) = (F_r, 0, 0), where F_r is the radial component.

Given that the magnitude is 1/r², so F_r = 1/r². That makes sense because in spherical coordinates, the radial component of a vector is just the component along the radius.

Now, I need to find the divergence of this vector field. I remember that in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field A is given by (1/(r²)) * ∂(r² A_r) / ∂r + (other terms for theta and phi, but since A_theta and A_phi are zero here, those terms vanish). So, because our field only has A_r, the divergence simplifies.

So, divergence of f, which is ∇·f, would be (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * F_r). Substituting F_r = 1/r², let's compute that.

Let me plug in F_r:

∇·f = (1/r²) * d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ]
Simplify inside the derivative: r² * 1/r² = 1. So the expression becomes:

(1/r²) * d/dr (1) = (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

Wait, so the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin? Because at r=0, the field might not be defined. But wait, wait, the field is defined as 1/r², so at r=0, it's like a point source or something. Hmm, but in vector calculus, when you have a vector field with a 1/r² dependence, you often think about point charges or something like that.

Wait, okay, but the divergence we found is zero except potentially at r=0. So, the divergence is zero in the volume away from the origin. But the volume of
