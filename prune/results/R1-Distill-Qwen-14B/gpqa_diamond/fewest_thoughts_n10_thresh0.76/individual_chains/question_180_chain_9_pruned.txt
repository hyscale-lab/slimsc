Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.2e-19 coulombs. Right, because e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C. So 2e would be 3.204 x 10^-19 C. But I think for calculations, it's easier to just use e as 1.6e-19 for simplicity unless high precision is needed.

Now, the setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, I imagine point P has one charge, and the other 12 are all around it at a distance of 2 meters each. The problem is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, so I think it's asking for the electrostatic potential energy of the system.

Wait, electrostatic potential energy... I remember that when charges are placed in a system, the potential energy is the work done to bring them to their positions. Since all the charges are identical and of the same sign, they would repel each other. But in this case, the 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters away, so maybe the potential energy is calculated based on their arrangement.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P. So all the 12 other charges are at 2 meters from P. So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge. But what about the potential energy between each of them and the fixed one? Also, the 12 charges are all 2 meters apart from the fixed one, but what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Because they all are at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances might vary. Wait, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are each at a distance of
