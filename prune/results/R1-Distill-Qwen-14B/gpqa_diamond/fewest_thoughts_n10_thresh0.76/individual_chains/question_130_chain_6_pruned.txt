Okay, so I have this question about detecting large clouds of neutral hydrogen using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I remember that hydrogen emits or absorbs certain wavelengths. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha line is at about 1216 Angstroms. That's in the ultraviolet range, right?

Wait, the question says these clouds absorb light from background quasars at that wavelength. So, the quasars' light is being absorbed by the hydrogen. But ground-based optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because our atmosphere absorbs it. So, the observed wavelength must be shifted into the optical range.

Oh, right, redshift! When the universe expands, the wavelength stretches. The observed wavelength (位_observed) is equal to the rest wavelength (位_rest) multiplied by (1 + redshift) (z). So 位_obs = 位_rest * (1 + z).

But wait, since the absorption is at 1216 Angstroms, which is UV, and we're using optical telescopes, the observed wavelength must be longer than what the telescope can see. Wait, no, the quasar's light is absorbed, so the part at 1216 Angstroms is missing. But that wavelength is in UV, which ground telescopes can't see. So how do they detect it?

Oh, maybe the quasar emits light across the spectrum, but the part that's absorbed (the Lyman-alpha line) is in the UV. So when that part is missing, we can detect it indirectly. But if the cloud is moving away, the absorption line shifts. So the observed wavelength of that Lyman-alpha absorption would be longer than 1216 Angstroms.

Wait, but ground-based optical telescopes can't observe UV. So the absorption line must have been redshifted into the visible range. So the quasar's light, when observed, has the Lyman-alpha absorption at a wavelength that's in the optical range. So that would require that the redshift z is such that 1216*(1+z) is in the optical, say, less than about 4000 Angstroms (since optical goes up to about 7000, but maybe more accurately, let's think about what's observable).

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z where the cloud can be detected. So the Lyman-alpha line must be in the optical. So the maximum wavelength we can observe is in optical. Let me think: what's the cutoff? I think optical is roughly 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) up to about 700 nm (7000 Angstroms). But maybe for ground-based telescopes, the atmospheric window allows observation in certain optical bands, like up to about 1 micron (10,000 Angstroms), but perhaps not beyond.

Wait, the Lyman-alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. To shift it into the optical, which is much longer. So the observed wavelength would be 1216*(1+z) >= 4000 Angstroms? Because if it's shorter than that, it's UV and can't be seen. So solving for z:

1216*(1+z) >= 4000
