Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length a. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining on it, and we need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field. Hmm, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of bright and dark spots called the diffraction pattern.

Wait, the question says N is infinitely large. Oh right, when you have a polygon with a huge number of sides, it effectively becomes a circular aperture. So maybe this problem is related to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture instead of a polygon. But wait, I'm a bit confused. No, hold on—the polygon is the aperture, but when N approaches infinity, it's like a circle. But the setup here is about the diffraction from a polygon, but perhaps for the case when it's a circle, the formula is simpler.

Wait, the problem says all apothems are the same length a. Apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, right? So for a regular polygon, the apothem is given by a = R * cos(π/N), where R is the radius of the circumscribed circle. But when N is very large, N approaches infinity, so the polygon becomes a circle. Then, the apothem a approaches R, because cos(π/N) approaches 1 as N becomes large. So in the limit, the apothem a is approximately equal to the radius R of the
