Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB. Hmm, the question is about finding the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime is limited by the process γγ → e+ e-. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are in the GeV range, so I think this involves some high-energy physics concepts.

Wait, I remember that the interaction of high-energy photons with the CMB is important in cosmology. Gamma-rays can annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. This process affects how long these gamma-rays can exist in the universe because they're being absorbed.

So, the lifetime being limited by this process probably means that the gamma-rays decay (or are annihilated) on a timescale comparable to the age of the universe. So the mean free time for this process would be similar to the age of the universe.

The average energy of a CMB photon is given, which is 1e-3 eV. But I think the CMB has a blackbody spectrum, so the average energy might be related to the temperature. Wait, the CMB temperature is about 2.7 K. The average photon energy in a blackbody is roughly 2.7 times the temperature in eV, right? So 2.7 * 2.7 K ≈ 7.29e-3 eV, but the question says the average is 1e-3 eV. Hmm, maybe I should just go with the given value, 1e-3 eV.

I need to find the gamma-ray energy E such that the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- multiplied by the photon density gives a mean free time that's equal to the age of the universe.

The mean free time τ is given by τ ≈ 1/(nσv), where n is the number density of CMB photons, σ is the cross-section for the process, and v is the relative velocity of the gamma-ray and CMB photon.

Wait, but for high-energy gamma-rays, the relative velocity is approximately the speed of light, so v ≈ c. So, the mean free time τ ≈ 1/(nσc). 

The age of the universe is roughly 10 billion years, which is about 3e17 seconds. So, τ ≈ 3e17 s.

The cross-section for γγ → e+ e- depends on the energy of the gamma-ray and the CMB photon. The formula I remember for the cross-section (although I'm not 100% sure) is something like σ ≈ (4π/3) * (α² / (s)) * (something in terms of s and the photon energies). Wait, maybe it's better to think about the threshold for this process. Oh wait, no, because we're looking for the energy where the mean free time equals the age of the universe.

Alternatively, I remember that the optical depth τ is the cross-section multiplied by the column density, N = n * x, where x is the path length. For a process happening in the universe, the relevant x might be the age of the universe times the speed of light. So, for a gamma-ray traveling in the universe for time t, the path length is c*t
