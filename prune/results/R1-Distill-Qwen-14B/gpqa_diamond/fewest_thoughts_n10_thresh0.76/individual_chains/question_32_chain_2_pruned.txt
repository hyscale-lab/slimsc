Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. It's about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the nucleus in question is 'X', which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, the standard lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make the isotope Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, probably as a charged particle like a singly ionized Li+6, but I'm not sure if the charge affects the energy here. Maybe it doesn't because the mass is what's important for relativistic energy.

The problem is to find the energy of the RHIC. I think RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so each ion has a certain kinetic energy. But wait, the question is about the total energy, not just the kinetic. Because in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy plus kinetic.

The speed is given as 0.96c. So I need to calculate the total energy (gamma * m0c²) of the nucleus moving at that speed.

Gamma (γ) is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c².

Calculating (0.96)^2: 0.96 * 0.96. Let's see, 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So gamma is 1/sqrt(0.0784). What's the square root of 0.0784? Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784. Because 0.28*0.28=0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me check that
