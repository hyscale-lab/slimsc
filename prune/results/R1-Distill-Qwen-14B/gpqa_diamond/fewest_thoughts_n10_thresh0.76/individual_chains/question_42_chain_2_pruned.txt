Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again. 

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They’re using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I'm not sure how that affects this problem. Maybe it's just context about how they were discovered.

The problem gives me the equilibrium temperature ratios. The ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. I think that means Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times Planet2's, and Planet2 is 2.3 times Planet3's. So, T1 = 1.4 T2, and T2 = 2.3 T3.

Then, there's the mass ratios. Planet1 and Planet2's masses have a ratio of about 1.15, and Planet2 and Planet3 is about 1.35. So M1 = 1.15 M2, and M2 = 1.35 M3. So M1 = 1.15 * 1.35 M3 = 1.5525 M3. Hmm, not sure if I need that yet.

The question is about the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. So, I need to find P3 / P1, and the options are given.

Wait, the problem says the albedo is equal for all three, which is 0.3, like Earth. Oh, so albedo doesn't play a role here because it's the same for all. So when calculating equilibrium temperature, the formula is T = [ ( (1 - a) * L ) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ]^(1/4), where a is albedo, L is star's luminosity, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, D is distance from star. But since L and σ are the same for all planets around the same star, and a is the same, the temperature depends on 1/D².

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. The formula, I think, is T = T_earth * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ), but maybe more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L/(16πD²))^(1/4), which simplifies to (L)^(1/4)/(D^(1/2)), assuming albedo is same. So for each planet, T is proportional to (L)^(1/4) / D^(1/2). But since all planets orbit the same star, L is same for each. So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D). 

So, T1 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 ), because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). Oh wait, no: T1 = T_earth * (L/(16 π D1²))^(1/4) → T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(D1). Similarly, T2 is proportional to 1/sqrt(D2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1).
