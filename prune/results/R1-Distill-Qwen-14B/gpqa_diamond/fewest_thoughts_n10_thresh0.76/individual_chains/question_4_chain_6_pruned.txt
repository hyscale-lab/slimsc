Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our world, magnets always have both poles, right? Like, you can't have a magnet with just a North pole by itself; it's always paired. So that's something about the magnetic monopoles, maybe?

Wait, Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields behave. Let me recall them. There are four equations, right? The first one is about the divergence of the electric field, Gauss's law. The second is about the circulation of the electric field, Faraday's law. The third is Gauss's law for magnetism, and the fourth is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition.

In our universe, the third equation says that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. So ∇·B = 0. That's because there are no isolated magnetic charges, or monopoles. So if in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that would mean magnetic monopoles exist.

So if magnetic monopoles exist, what would change in Maxwell's equations? Well, in our case, the third equation holds because there are no monopoles. But if monopoles exist, then that equation would change. Because Gauss's law for magnetism would be similar to Gauss's law for electricity. So instead of ∇·B = 0, it would be ∇·B = μρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So that equation definitely changes.

Wait, but the question is about which equations are different. The options mention various equations. Let's see.

Maxwell's equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ (Gauss's law for electric fields)
2. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t (Faraday's law)
3. ∇·B = 0 (Gauss's law for magnetism)
4. ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t (Ampère-Maxwell law)

Wait, sometimes equation 4 is written in terms of B. Let me think. Oh right, equation 4 in terms of B is: ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t). Or something like that. But the main point is about the curl of E and B.

So if magnetic monopoles exist, equation 3 changes. But what about equation 2? Let me think. Equation 2 is about the curl of E being related to the time derivative of B. In our world, that's correct because changing B fields create circulating E fields. But with monopoles, perhaps another equation would change. Or maybe another aspect comes into play.

Wait, there's another thing. When magnetic monopoles exist, there's a dual symmetry between electric and magnetic fields. So perhaps the curl of B would also have a term related to electric current or something else. Wait, no, in our equation 4, the curl of B is proportional to the current plus the time derivative of E.

Wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, I think that another equation would get a term similar to equation 3. Because in the absence of monopoles, equation 2 and 4 are okay. But when monop
