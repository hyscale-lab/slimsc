Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that we have a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. Their NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options given are various tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

Hmm, I remember that aromatic protons typically show up between 6.5 and 8.5 ppm. The splitting (like singlet, doublet, etc.) depends on the neighboring protons. If there are two singlets, maybe each corresponds to a set of equivalent aromatic protons in each compound.

The three singlets at 2.2 ppm might be from CH3 groups attached to something else. Since 2.2 is around where methyl groups on benzene rings show up, especially if they're attached to substituents that deshield them a bit. Like, maybe they're attached to oxygen or something? Oh, wait, no, in this case, the options are all methyl or ethyl substituents.

Wait, the options are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene. So all these are derivatives of benzene with substituents.

Let me think about each structure. 

First, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. That's a benzene ring with four methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. Wait, but benzene is a ring, so numbering 1,2,3,4 would mean that's a contiguous block of four methyl groups. That's a bit hard to imagine because that would leave positions 5 and 6 without substituents. But wait, that might not be possible because a benzene ring has six positions. So 1,2,3,4 would be four substituents in a row, making the ring very crowded. Maybe it's a 1,2,3,4-tetra substitution, but I'm not sure if that's possible or stable. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl group in a different arrangement, but that might lead to symmetry.

Wait, maybe it's more like a 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl group in such a way that the substituents are adjacent, making a very symmetric structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a part of a para arrangement but more substituents. Wait, maybe that's not the best approach. Let me think about each option and their NMR signals.

The aromatic region: each compound will give some protons. For each compound, we can think about how many unique aromatic protons they have and whether they would be equivalent, leading to singlets.
