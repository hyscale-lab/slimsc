Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let's try to unpack what's being asked here. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that a supernova occurred in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in their own inertial frames of reference. So, from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's a very high speed! I think that's a significant fraction of the speed of light. Because the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. So we might need to consider relativistic effects here.

The problem asks: What distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame? Hmm, so time is experienced differently in each frame because of time dilation. Oh right, that's from the theory of relativity.

Let me think about how time dilation works. The formula is t' = gamma * (t - (v x)/cÂ²), but since the motion is directly towards each other, maybe the x component is straightforward. But wait, in this case, I'm trying to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame while 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. So perhaps I should find the time in the Galaxy's frame and then multiply by the velocity.

Wait, let's clarify the frames. Let me denote the Galaxy's frame as S and the ejecta's frame as S'. So in S (Galaxy), the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. But from S' (ejecta), the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. Oh wait, in relativity, the two frames have velocities that are opposite but not just negatives because of the way velocities transform. But maybe for this problem, we can consider that in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the center. So v is 6e4 km/s.

But wait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving at
