Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, they're talking about reference frames here. I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we have to consider relativistic effects. But wait, the speed given is 60,000 km/s. Let me check the speed of light. Oh right, the speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is only 20% of the speed of light. Hmm, not super fast, but maybe we should still consider relativistic effects because the problem mentions different reference frames.

The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is approaching at that speed. But wait, in reality, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at that speed in the Galaxy's frame. Since both are inertial frames, according to Newtonian mechanics, the distance should just be speed multiplied by time. But wait, time might be different in different frames because of relativity.

Wait, the question asks: What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds have passed. But how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame? Because of time dilation, maybe. Or perhaps length contraction.

Alternatively, maybe it's simpler than that
