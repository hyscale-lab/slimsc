Okay, so I'm trying to solve this vector calculus problem. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and the field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, right. So I remember that for vector fields, the divergence is a measure of the magnitude of a vector field's source or sink at a given point. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface.

Wait, the divergence theorem says that the integral of ∇·f over a volume is equal to the flux of f through the surface enclosing that volume. So, ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector.

So, perhaps I can compute this integral either by calculating the divergence directly and integrating, or by finding the flux through the surface of the sphere.

Let me think about the vector field. Since it's only radial and depends on 1/r², the field must look like f(r) = (some constant) * r̂ / r². Wait, because in spherical coordinates, the radial unit vector is r̂, so the field would be f = F(r) r̂, where F(r) is 1/r² here.

So, the field is F(r) = 1/r
