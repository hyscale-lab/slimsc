Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a compound has chiral centers. Wait, but also some other factors like whether the compound is meso or not. Let me think through each of the seven compounds one by one.

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me visualize its structure. But-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Wait, no, but wait, the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So structure is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but wait, the numbering is but-1-ene, so it's CH2=CHCH2CH3. Substituting the Cl on carbon 1, and a methyl on carbon 2: so Cl-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, maybe it's Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2. So structure: Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or perhaps CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but the correct structure for 1-chloro-2
