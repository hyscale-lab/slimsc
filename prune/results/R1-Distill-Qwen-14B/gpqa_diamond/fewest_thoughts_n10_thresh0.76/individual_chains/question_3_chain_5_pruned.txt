Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Oh right, the expectation value is like the average outcome if you measured this operator many times on identically prepared systems.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state. So here, O is 10σz +5σx. 

Wait, but since expectation is linear, I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That's easier because I can compute each expectation separately.

First, let's figure out what each expectation value is. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me note that coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me check if these coefficients are normalized. The square of 0.5 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, which adds up to 1, so that's good.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz is easy. Because σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively. So, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let me compute that: (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now, for ⟨σx⟩. Oh wait, σx is the Pauli X matrix. The expectation value of σx in a given state is a bit trickier. I think the formula is something like (|a|^2 + |b|^2) times something, but wait, no. Alternatively, I can write the state in terms of the eigenstates of σx, but maybe it's easier to compute it directly using the matrix form.

Alternatively, there's another approach. The expectation value of σx is 2 times the probability of measuring spin-up minus 1, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I can compute it using the state expressed as a vector.

The state can be written as a column vector. Let me think: |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So the state |ψ⟩ is 0.5*[1;0] + (sqrt(3)/2)[0;1] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

The σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The expectation value is ψ† σx ψ. So compute ψ† σx ψ.

Wait, ψ is a column vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], a row vector.

Multiplying σx ψ: σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when we multiply it by ψ:

σx ψ = [0*0.5 +1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 +0*(sqrt(3)/2)]^T = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, ψ† multiplied by this gives 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5). Let me calculate
