Okay, so I've got this question here about a scientific experiment involving ligand-receptor pairs and some genetic constructs. Hmm, I need to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up when they look under the microscope. Let's break this down.

First, the setup: They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions, right? So each gene is under its own promoter or something? Wait, no, wait. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. I remember that IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor is probably expressed as a separate transcript but within the same mRNA as the ligand. Or is it the other way around? Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so two separate genes in one construct. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is 3' with eGFP at the C-terminus.

Oh, and there are stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272. So, the ligand is followed by a stop with loxP, and the receptor has a stop with lox2272. But wait, Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites. So maybe when Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassettes, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

In the experiment, they transfected the vector into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So they probably checked if the ligand and receptor are expressed. But the real test is when they breed mice homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they cross them with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre should be active in neural crest cells, I think. Because the construct is probably under a regulatory element that Cre can excise.

Now, when the offspring are born, they visualize under a confocal. They expected to see green (eGFP) but didn't. So why?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if the Cre is active in neural crest cells, would that affect the expression? Not sure. Maybe if the ligand is secreted, but the question is about the GFP expression, which is the receptor part.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. So maybe the construct isn't trafficked to the membrane. But if the expression is checked via Western blot with the antibodies, perhaps the protein is present but not trafficked. But the question says after transfection, they tested expression. If the Western blot shows the proteins, perhaps the expression is correct. But the confocal looks for GFP, which would require proper trafficking. Wait, but in the question, they used the vector in astrocytes. So in culture, maybe the expression is fine, but when in the mouse, perhaps the Cre wasn't properly activating, so the lox sites weren't excised. Wait, no, because the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, so the Cre should be active in neural crest cells.

Wait, but let's think about the construct. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, but the receptor is under IRES. Oh, wait, the vector is bicistronic, so each ORF is under its own promoter? No, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. So CBA is a strong constitutive promoter, so the ligand would be expressed in many tissues. The IRES is after the receptor ORF, so the receptor would be expressed only when the IRES is functional, perhaps in certain cell types or when the upstream gene is translated.

Wait, but the construct is lox-Cre. So perhaps in the presence of Cre, the loxP and lox2272 sites are used. Let me think about how this works. The vector has two stop cassettes: the ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So when Cre is present, which recognizes loxP sites, would it excise the stop cassettes?

Wait, maybe the vector is arranged with the ligand first, then a stop with loxP, then the receptor, then a stop with lox2272. So when Cre is present, it would excise the loxP-stop between ligand and mCherry. So ligand is expressed with mCherry, but the stop is removed only when Cre is present. Similarly, the receptor would have a stop that's removed by a different recombinase, but wait the lox2272 is a variant that Cre can't recognize. Oh, unless another recombinase is used, but in the question, they used SOX10-Cre, which is Cre.

Wait, no. LoxP is recognized by Cre, but lox2272 is a variant that requires a different recombinase, like Dre. So in this case, the receptor has a stop cassette that Cre cannot excise since it's lox2272. So only the ligand's stop would be excised by Cre, but the receptor's stop would remain. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed (since the stop is removed), but the receptor would still have the stop in place, so the eGFP would not be expressed. Therefore, the eGFP wouldn't show up in the confocal.

Wait, but the question says that the vector is homozygous. So in the mouse, each allele has the ligand-receptor construct. When crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is hemizygous, the Cre would excise the loxP sites in the cells where Cre is active (like neural crest cells). So the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, so Cre would remove that, allowing the ligand to be expressed with mCherry. But the receptor's stop is between the receptor ORF and eGFP. Since the stop is flanked by lox2272 sites, and Cre doesn't recognize lox2272, the stop would remain. So the receptor ORF would be expressed, but the eGFP wouldn't be, because the stop is still there.

Wait, but the question says that they're looking for the receptor-eGFP. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't excised. But why? Because the stop is flanked by lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the eGFP isn't expressed. So in the Western blot, perhaps the proteins are expressed, but not the eGFP.

Alternatively, if the eGFP isn't expressed, the confocal wouldn't show green. So that's why they don't see a green signal. So among the options, which one matches this scenario?

Looking at the options again:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean a frameshift, so eGFP isn't expressed. But that's a genetic issue with the construct, not an expression regulation issue. The question setup suggests the vectors are correctly made, so perhaps this is not the case. Or maybe the stop is in the way.

Wait, let's think about the construct. The ligand is at 5', followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Then, the receptor is at 3', with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 before eGFP. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed (since the stop is in the way, but the CBA promoter is strong and constitutive). Wait, no, the ligand is under CBA, which would drive its expression regardless. The stop after ligand would prevent mCherry from being expressed unless the stop is excised by Cre. Similarly, the receptor is under IRES, which may require certain conditions, but perhaps in the presence of Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, so mCherry is expressed.

But for the receptor, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. Unless the stop is excised, eGFP isn't expressed. If the construct uses Cre, which only recognizes loxP, then the lox2272 sites wouldn't be cut. So the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, in the mouse model, which is homozygous for this construct, the Cre from SOX10-Cre would only remove the ligand's stop, allowing mCherry expression, but the receptor's eGFP remains unexpressed.

So the absence of green is because the eGFP isn't being expressed because its stop cassette isn't excised. Cre can't cut lox2272, so the stop remains. So the likely reason is that the lox2272 cassette isn't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options again:

Option C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. Hmm, but the ligand is under CBA, a strong promoter, so that's probably not it.

Option D) receptor and eGFP not in frame. That would mean the eGFP isn't expressed because the frame is wrong, but that's a construct design issue. The question seems to set up the vector correctly, so perhaps this isn't the case.

Option B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the eGFP isn't expressed, then it wouldn't be in the Golgi. But the Western blot would detect the receptor if the antibody is present. But the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps in the blot, they see the receptor but not the eGFP? But the question states that the blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, so maybe the proteins are present but the eGFP isn't. But the question says they tested the construct expression after transfection, but the mouse model is where the problem occurs.

Wait, the mouse model is homozygous, and they crossed it with SOX10-Cre. So in the mouse, Cre is present, but the construct has only the loxP sites for the ligand's stop. So in the mouse, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed, but the receptor's eGFP remains undelivered because the stop with lox2272 isn't cut.

So the reason for no green is because the eGFP isn't being expressed due to the stop cassette not being excised. So the vector design is such that only the ligand is expressed after Cre, not the receptor.

Wait, but the question is about the developmental fate, so the ligand and receptor interaction. But the experiment is about whether the eGFP is expressed. So the answer is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop wasn't removed. Which would point to the construct's design, perhaps the lox sites are wrong.

Looking at the options again, the correct answer would be that the stop for the receptor isn't excised because the lox2272 isn't recognized by Cre. So the eGFP remains under the stop, hence no expression. So which option matches this?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, which would prevent their expression, but that's a different issue. The question is about the expression, not the genetic reading frame.

Alternatively, looking at the options, option C is about enhancers, which I think is not the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the IRES isn't working correctly. The receptor is under IRES, which is a cis-acting element that allows for internal initiation. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor might not be expressed, but the question says the ligand is under CBA, so it's expressed. But the absence of GFP would then be because the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the question doesn't mention any issues with IRES function, so I think this is less likely.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recap:

- Vector is bicistronic, ligand (CBA) first, then receptor (IRES) second.
- Ligand has loxP-stop, receptor has lox2272-stop.
- Cre is introduced by SOX10-Cre mice.
- Cre can cut loxP, so ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry expression.
- Receptor's stop is lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so eGFP remains under stop—so not expressed.

Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. So the reason is that the lox2272 sites aren't cut by Cre, so the stop remains. But none of the options directly state this.

Looking at the options:

Option C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the ligand has CBA, which is a strong promoter, so no enhancer needed. The receptor's expression might depend on IRES, but I'm not sure.

Option D) The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would be a problem if the ORF is broken, but the question says the vector is correctly made—so probably not.

Option B) The receptor-eGFP is stuck in Golgi. If it's stuck, perhaps it's not at the cell surface. But the Western blot would show the protein is expressed. Since the question says they see signals proportional to actin loading, perhaps the proteins are expressed but not GFP. So this could be why the confocal doesn't show green.

Wait, but the presence of eGFP in the cell would require the stop to be removed. If the stop is in place, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the Western blot would only detect the receptor if the antibody is against the receptor. If the eGFP isn't expressed, the GFP isn't present. So in the Western, perhaps the blot shows the receptor but not the eGFP.

But the question says that the Western blot was done after transfection, which suggests they tested the expression. I'm not entirely sure, but the main issue here is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. So which option aligns with that?

Looking again:

The answer is that the eGFP is not expressed because the lox sites surrounding the receptor's stop are not recognized by Cre. Since the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's isn't, the eGFP isn't expressed. Thus, the construct's design (lox2272 not cut by Cre) is the issue.

But the options don't directly mention this. So perhaps the answer is Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But that would be a problem with the construct's design, not the expression regulation. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another angle: the stop cassettes. The ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, and then the receptor's ORF is followed by a stop. If the stop is not excised, the receptor won't be expressed. But in the vector, perhaps the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed in a different way.

Wait, IRES elements allow the ribosome to initiate translation without an upstream start codon. So in the vector, the ligand is under CBA, then the stop with loxP, then the receptor is under IRES. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed (since CBA is strong), and the receptor? Well, IRES allows the receptor to be expressed as a separate ORF from the same mRNA. Or perhaps the vector is set up so that the receptor is co-expressed with the ligand. But in the presence of Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, so the ligand is expressed with mCherry. The receptor's stop is not removed, so eGFP isn't expressed.

In the mouse model, the Cre is present, so the ligand is expressed, but the receptor's eGFP isn't. Hence, the confocal shows no green.

So the reason is that the eGFP isn't expressed because its stop wasn't excised. Therefore, the problem is that the lox2272 sites can't be cut by Cre. So the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: maybe the IRES isn't working correctly. The IRES is between the ligand and receptor. Or wait, in the vector, the ligand is at 5', followed by a stop cassette, then the receptor. The receptor is under IRES. So the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed as a separate ORF. But if the ligand is expressed, as a separate transcript, perhaps the receptor isn't. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the stop cassette after the receptor's ORF prevents eGFP expression. So the IRES is there, but the stop with lox2272 isn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the conclusion is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. But the question is why. So the reason is that the lox2272 sites aren't cut, so the stop remains. The options don't directly address this, but perhaps the answer is option C, which is about enhancers. Or perhaps it's option D, which is about the reading frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not properly expressed because the stop isn't removed. So the only way this would happen is if the lox sites are wrong, but the options don't directly state this.

Wait, looking at the options, option D says "the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame." Could that mean that the ORF is not correctly spliced, leading to a frameshift? If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But this would be a construct design problem, perhaps due to incorrect cloning. If the ORFs are out of frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But if the vector was correctly made, this wouldn't be the case. So maybe the answer is D, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the question states that the IRES is upstream of the receptor, which is a setup that allows for its expression.

Hmm, I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think about the possible answer from the options given.

The correct answer is probably option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the stop cassette isn't being excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop remains. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, another angle: in the vector, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP. The stop cassettes are designed so that Cre can excise them. If the eGFP stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is with the stop cassette for the receptor.

But the answer options don't directly refer to this. So perhaps the best fit is option D, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C, but I don't see how the enhancer would be missing.

Wait, another thought: the vector is bicistronic with CBA for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. So the ligand is expressed under CBA, the receptor under IRES. Cre excises the ligand's stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed, but the receptor's stop isn't excised, so eGFP isn't. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal.

So the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't excised. The only option that relates to this is none of the options directly, but perhaps option D is about the ORF, which I'm not certain about.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP isn't being properly translated because of the stop. So the absence of the green signal is because the eGFP isn't expressed. The reason is that the lox2272 sites aren't recognized by Cre, so the stop remains. But none of the options mention this.

In that case, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not being expressed due to the stop cassette, which isn't excised, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the real issue is that the stop cassettes are in the wrong orientation. For example, if the lox sites are in the wrong orientation, Cre won't cut them. So the stop isn't removed, preventing expression. But again, the options don't directly address this.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option D. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the IRES isn't working correctly, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another approach: the construct has the ligand under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so the ligand is expressed. The receptor is under IRES, which may depend on the ligand's expression. Wait, no, IRES elements allow for independent expression. So the receptor would be expressed regardless.

But in the presence of Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, so the mCherry is expressed. The receptor's stop is uncut, so eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the mouse model would only express the ligand and mCherry, but not the receptor and eGFP. Thus, the confocal would show red (mCherry) but not green.

But the question says they don't see a green signal. So the reason is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed. Therefore, in the options, the correct answer is that the construct isn't allowing eGFP expression because the stop isn't cut, which isn't directly an option. So I need to pick the best fit.

Wait, looking again at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. So they act on other cells. But why would that affect the GFP expression in the same cells? Probably not.

B) receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If so, then the eGFP wouldn't be on the surface, but the Western would show the protein. But the question says the blot shows signals proportional to actin, implying that the proteins are expressed.

C) enhancer missing. If no enhancer, then expression is lower, but the CBA promoter is strong, so maybe not.

D) receptor and eGFP not in frame. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the ORF is not correct. But the vector was designed correctly, so probably not.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: the enhancer is missing. But why would that affect the mouse model? The vector has a strong promoter, so enhancer may not be critical.

Wait, perhaps the stop cassettes are in the way. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't cut, as I thought earlier. But since the options don't directly say that, perhaps the best fit is option D.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another angle: the vector is a bicistronic construct with lox sites. The ligand is at 5', with a loxP stop, and the receptor at 3' with a lox2272 stop. Cre is introduced, so the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop isn't removed because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. So the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. Therefore, the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed, which is due to the wrong lox sites. But the options don't mention this.

Wait, perhaps the construct was supposed to have lox sites that Cre can cut on both. But it's designed with loxP for the ligand and lox2272 for the receptor. Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't mention that. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But why would that be the case?

Alternatively, perhaps the stop is in frame, preventing eGFP expression. So the eGFP's ORF is not correctly in frame. But if the vector was designed correctly, that shouldn't be the case.

Hmm. I think I've gone through all possible angles, and the most plausible answer is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed. Since this isn't directly an option, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the eGFP is not being properly translated because the stop cassette is in place. So the eGFP isn't expressed. So the answer would be option D, which states that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C, but I don't see how that fits.

Wait, perhaps the stop cassette is in a way that the eGFP isn't being expressed. So the eGFP isn't present because the stop is preventing it. Therefore, the correct answer would be that the eGFP isn't expressed due to the stop, but none of the options mention this. So perhaps the best fit is option D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. If the enhancer is missing, then the IRES might not function, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the ligand is under CBA, so it would still be expressed. But in the mouse, the confocal is looking for the receptor-eGFP. If the receptor isn't expressed, then no eGFP. But why would the enhancer be missing? The question doesn't say anything about enhancers in the construct.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Based on the construct, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop with lox2272 isn't cut by Cre. So the answer is that the stop isn't excised, but since that's not an option, the closest is perhaps option D.

Wait, but the question says the vector is bicistronic with the ligand at 5' and the receptor at 3', both under their own promoters. No, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor under IRES.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the IRES isn't functional, so the receptor isn't expressed. But that would be a problem regardless of Cre.

Alternatively, perhaps the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't because the IRES isn't working. But I'm not certain.

I think I'll go with option D as the answer, but I'm not entirely confident.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor, where the ligand is under the CBA promoter and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. The ligand's ORF is flanked by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, while the receptor's ORF is flanked by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. The experiment involves crossing mice homozygous for this construct with SOX10-Cre mice, but no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design**:  
   - The ligand is expressed under the strong CBA promoter, while the receptor is expressed via an IRES element.  
   - The ligand's stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP) can be excised by Cre recombinase, allowing mCherry expression.  
   - The receptor's stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272) cannot be excised by Cre, as lox2272 is a variant site requiring a different recombinase (e.g., Dre).  

2. **Cre Activity**:  
   - SOX10-Cre mice introduce Cre recombinase, which excises the ligand's stop cassette, allowing mCherry expression.  
   - However, the receptor's stop cassette remains intact because Cre cannot recognize lox2272, preventing eGFP expression.  

3. **Observed Outcome**:  
   - In the confocal microscopy, mCherry (from the ligand) may be visible, but eGFP (from the receptor) is not expressed due to the unexcised stop cassette.  

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**:  
  This refers to the ligand-receptor interaction mode but does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.  

- **B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**:  
  If this were true, the eGFP would still be expressed but mislocalized. The absence of a green signal suggests eGFP is not produced, not just mislocalized.  

- **C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**:  
  The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, which does not require an enhancer. The receptor's IRES element should allow expression without an enhancer. This option is unlikely.  

- **D) The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame**:  
  If the receptor and eGFP were out of frame, eGFP would not be expressed due to a frameshift. However, the construct was designed correctly, making this unlikely.  

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that the eGFP is not expressed because the receptor's stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272) is not excised by Cre recombinase. None of the options directly address this issue, but the closest match is **D**, as it implies a problem with eGFP expression due to construct design.  

Answer: D
