Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

The question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that this is similar to the 3D version of the harmonic oscillator, where each degree of freedom (x, y, z) behaves like a 1D oscillator. But wait, in spherical coordinates, maybe it's better to think in terms of the radial part and angular parts.

Wait, no, in 3D, the isotropic harmonic oscillator can be treated as three independent 1D oscillators in each direction. So the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Or wait, is that right? Oh yes, because the Hamiltonian separates into x, y, z parts, so the total energy is the sum of each direction's energy.

But wait, in the case of the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). So each quantum number contributes to the total energy.

Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed in terms of the total quantum number n = n_x + n_y + n_z, so E = ħω(n + 3/2). Hmm, that might be easier because the problem is about the third excited state. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about what the 'third excited state' refers to here. 

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy state, which is n=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z = 0). The first excited state would be the first state above that, which could be when one of the n's is 1 and the others are 0. But wait, the counting of excited states can be a bit tricky because each state with the same n can have a different set of (n_x, n_y, n_z) but same energy.

So the energy levels are degenerate, meaning multiple states share the same energy. The degeneracy depends on the value of n. For example, n=0:
