Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let's see. The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. 

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system, and it's asking for the answer in Joules, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, the system is isolated, so maybe we don't have to worry about external fields or anything like that. But I'm a bit confused about what exactly constitutes the energy here. Oh right, when dealing with electric charges, the potential energy comes from their interactions. So since these charges are in a system, their mutual electrostatic potentials contribute to the total potential energy.

So the problem is about calculating the electric potential energy of this system. But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of these 12 charges is 2 meters from P, but what about their mutual distances? Are they all at the same point 2 meters from P, or are they arranged in some configuration?

Hmm, the problem says they are "constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P". Oh, so they are all fixed on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters around P. But wait, they are identical particles with charge 2e each. So each charge is 2e, so that's 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. Let me calculate that: 2 * 1.6e-19 C is 3.2e-19 C.

But I'm trying to find the potential energy. Wait, for a system of charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But wait, since the charges are identical and all are the same, the calculation can be simplified.

But wait, the system has 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 m away. So how many
