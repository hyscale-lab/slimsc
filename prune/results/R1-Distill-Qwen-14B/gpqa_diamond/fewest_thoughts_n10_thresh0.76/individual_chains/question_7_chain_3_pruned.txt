Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the annihilation of high-energy gamma rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The question is asking at what energy the gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe would be limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. The options are A to D, all in the range of 1e4 to 3.9e5 GeV. Hmm, that's pretty high energy!

I remember that gamma-ray photons can interact with the CMB through various processes, and one of them is pair production. The process in question here is γγ → e+ e-. So, when a high-energy gamma ray meets a low-energy CMB photon, they can annihilate into an electron-positron pair. The idea is that if this interaction happens frequently enough, it would limit how long high-energy photons can exist in the universe, thus limiting their lifetime.

The problem is about finding the energy where the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this interaction. So, I think this involves calculating the mean free path or the interaction rate. If the interaction rate is high, the mean free path is short, meaning the photon doesn't travel far before interacting.

Wait, the mean lifetime is inversely proportional to the interaction rate. So, the lifetime τ would be the inverse of the interaction rate Γ, right? τ ≈ 1/Γ.

The interaction rate Γ would depend on the cross-section σ of the process and the number density n of the target photons (CMB photons here). So Γ = σ * n * v, where v is the relative velocity. But since the speeds are relativistic, I think v is approximately c, so maybe v≈1 in natural units.

The cross-section for pair production from two photons (γγ → e+e-) has a certain dependence on the energies of the photons. I recall that the cross-section σ is proportional to 1/(s) where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Wait, no, actually, the cross-section for this process at high energies is given by σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α² / (s)) * (something). Wait, let me think. The cross-section for pair production in the context of photon-photon collisions (like two photons creating an electron-positron pair) is given by σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α²) * (m_e^2) / (s), where m_e is the electron mass, and s is the square of the center-of-mass energy.

Wait, but the exact expression might be more involved. Another formula I remember is σ = (8π/3) * (α²) * (m_e^2) / (E1 E2) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, since the process is s-channel, the cross-section for γγ → e+e- is proportional to σ ~ α² (m_e^2)/(E1 E2), where E1 and E2 are the energies of the two photons in the center-of-mass frame. Hmm, or wait, no, in the lab frame, perhaps. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the center-of-mass energy squared s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since for two photons moving in opposite directions, this becomes s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2. But if they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite, so p1 = -p2. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + (-p1 c))^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (2 p1 c)^2. But for photons, E = p c, so E1 = p1 c, E2 = p2 c. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2.

So s = (2√(E1 E2))^2. So s = 4 E1 E2. Therefore, the cross-section σ is proportional to m_e^4 / (s^2) or something else? Wait, I think the cross-section for pair production from two photons is:

σ = (8π/3) * (α²) * (m_e^2) / (s) * some function.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the exact expression. Alternatively, I remember that the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by:

σ = (8 π α²) / (3 s) * (something). Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing it with other processes.

Alternatively, I remember that the cross-section for pair production by a photon with energy E1 and another with E2 is given by:

σ = (8 π α² m_e²) / (E1 E2) ) * (something like
