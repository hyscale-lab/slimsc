Okay, so I've got this question about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets orbiting a star. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from it. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think. Oh right, the formula is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Oh wait, no, the albedo factor is (1 - A)^(1/4), where A is the albedo. But in this question, both planets have the same albedo, so the albedos would cancel out when taking the ratio. That's good, saves me some steps.

So the question gives me the masses and radii of the planets, but I think those aren't directly relevant for the equilibrium temperature. Because equilibrium temp depends on the star's properties and the planet's distance, right? The RV method and transit method data give us the mass and radius of the planets, but for temperature, I probably don't need that.

Wait, the RV method gives the mass of the planet, and the transit method gives the radius. Oh, but for equilibrium temp, it's about the planet's distance from the star. So how does the RV data tie into that? Oh, RV method gives the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. And the transit method gives the orbital period, I think.

Wait, the question says that both planets are detected using both methods. So we can get their masses and radii, but perhaps the RV gives the Doppler shift which relates to the velocity, which in turn relates to the orbital period and the mass of the star. Hmm, but how does this help me find the distance a, which is needed for the equilibrium temp.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look at the data given.

The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, Teff 6300 K. So the star's properties are fixed.

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, 1.3 Earth radii.

The Doppler shifts are given for each planet. Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å in [OI] line at 6300 Å. Planet2's shift is 0.04 Å. 

Wait, the Doppler shift (radial velocity) is related to the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula for radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = (v) = [ (G * (M_star + M_planet) ) / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ... Wait, K is the semi-amplitude of the RV. But since the planets are much less massive than the star, M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (G M_star )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) * ( 1 / ( (M_star)^2 )^(1/3) ) ) Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, I think the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (2 π G) / (c T) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(0.5) )

But because M_p is much less than M_star, it's approximately K ≈ ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^0.5 ) ) *
