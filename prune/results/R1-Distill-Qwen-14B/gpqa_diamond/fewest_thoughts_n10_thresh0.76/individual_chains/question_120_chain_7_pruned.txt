Okay, so I'm looking at this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume that stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed probably means that there's the same number density of stars in all directions. I remember that in astronomy, the number of stars you can see depends on how far away they are, which relates to their parallax.

Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, right, the formula is distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by parallax. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (which I'll call Δplx) changes with plx. So I need to find a relation N(Δplx) vs plx.

If stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means the number density (stars per cubic parsec) is constant. Let me denote this number density as n. So, n is the same everywhere.

Now, to find the number of stars in a shell between parallax plx and plx + Δplx. Wait, wait. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so when plx increases, the distance decreases. So a small change in plx corresponds to a change in distance. Let me think about the volume of a spherical shell at a certain distance.

The parallax is related to distance by plx = 1/d. So when plx increases by Δplx, the distance goes from d to d - Δd. But I should express everything in terms of plx.

Let's consider a thin shell at parallax plx, so distance d = 1/plx. The thickness of the shell in terms of distance would be Δd. But we need to relate Δd to the change in plx, Δplx.

Since plx = 1/d, taking differentials: d(plx) = - (1/d²) dd. So Δplx ≈ -(1/d²) Δd. Therefore, Δd ≈ -d² Δplx. But since plx is positive and increasing (distance decreasing), the Δd is negative, which just means we're moving to closer distances.

But for the volume of the shell, it's 4π d² Δd. Wait, but if I'm integrating over a range of distances, the volume is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars in
