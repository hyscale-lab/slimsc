Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear decay. Hmm, let me try to think through it. Alright, the problem involves two different decay processes. The first one is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V, and the second one is a variant where instead of two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the second reaction would be 2A → 2B + 2E + M, I guess.

The question is about how the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles changes in these two cases. In the first decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum with an endpoint Q. Now, in the variant, how does this compare?

Wait, I remember something about particle decays and energy spectra. I think when particles are emitted in a decay, their energy can vary depending on the situation. In beta decay, for example, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because the decay process conserves energy and momentum, but the electron's energy depends on the neutrino's energy. The maximum energy (endpoint) occurs when the neutrino has zero energy, right?

So in the original decay (2A → 2B + 2E + 2V), each E particle's energy must be determined by the conservation laws. But since there are two E's and two V's, maybe their energies are correlated. But wait, the problem states that the E's have a continuous spectrum. So each E can have varying energy, but there's a maximum point, Q.

Now, in the variant decay, the process is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. M is massless and exotic. So what's different here? Let's think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

In the first case, the decay products are 2B, 2E, and 2V. Each V must carry away some energy and momentum. But in the variant, instead of two V's, we have one M, which is massless. So M must carry away a lot of momentum, maybe.

Wait, but in the original decay, E and V are both emitted. If the E's have a continuous spectrum, that suggests that in their emission, their energy isn't fixed. But perhaps the maximum energy Q is determined when all other particles (like the V's) take away as little energy as possible.

So in the original case, the E's can have a range
