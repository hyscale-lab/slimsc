Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Alright, first things first, let's try to understand the structure based on the information provided. A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring usually means that there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The total carbon count is 8, so the benzene itself has 6 carbons, meaning the substituents add up to 2 carbons. Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, the molecule has 8 carbons in total. Benzene has 6, so substituents contribute 2 more carbons. So each substituent on the benzene is one carbon? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons. But wait, di-substituted means two substituents. So each substituent would be one carbon each, but that would only add two carbons. So 6+2=8, which fits. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. So each substituent is a single carbon? Hmm, but that's a bit confusing. Let's
