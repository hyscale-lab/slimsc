Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question says that four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of E, where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). The options are A, B, C, D, each with different values.

Hmm, right. So I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy of a single particle in such a well is E_n = (n²) * (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number (n=1,2,3,...). So E_n is proportional to n squared.

But wait, the problem has four particles. Since they are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. But in a 1D infinite well, the quantum state is determined by the quantum number n and the spin. Oh right, each particle has spin-1/2, so two possible spin states: up and down.

So for each energy level (each n), we can have two particles with opposite spins. So the maximum number of fermions that can occupy a single n level is 2.

So the strategy is to fill the lowest energy levels with the four particles, making sure that each level can hold up to two particles.

Let's list the possible n values and how many particles can be placed in each:

n=1: 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: 2 particles (again, spin up and down)
Wait, but wait, four particles in total. So n=1 can take 2, n=2 can take another 2. That's four particles. But wait, do we need to arrange them in a way that the total energy is minimized?

Wait, the question is about the system's energy for ground state, first, and second excited states. So the ground state is the lowest possible total energy, and the excited states are higher total energies.

Wait no, for the ground state, all four particles will occupy the lowest possible energy levels, considering the Pauli exclusion.

So for four particles, we need to fill the lowest states.

n=1 can have 2 particles (each with opposite spins). Then n=2 can have another 2 particles (each with opposite spins).

So the total energy for the ground state would be the sum of the energies of each particle. Each particle in n=1 contributes E, each in n=2 contributes 4E (since n=2 means n²=4).

Wait, let's compute that. Each particle in n=1: E_1 = (1²) E = E.
Each particle in n=2: E_2 = (2²) E = 4E.

So two particles in n=1: 2 * E = 2E.
Two particles in n=2: 2 * 4E = 8E.
Total energy for ground state: 2E +8E =10 E.

Wait, that's 10E. But
