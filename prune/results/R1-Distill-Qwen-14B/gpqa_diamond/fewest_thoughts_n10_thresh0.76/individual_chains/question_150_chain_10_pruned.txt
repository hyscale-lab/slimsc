Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, then predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, okay. Let's break it down.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. To find degrees of unsaturation, the formula is: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0 (since no halogens are mentioned).

Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU) plus a double bond and a ring or another double bond. Or perhaps a benzene and an aldehyde group, which has a double bond. But wait, the aldehyde is a carbonyl, which is a double bond.

Looking at the NMR data: 

1H-NMR (ppm): 
9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

Breaking down the NMR peaks:

- 9.72 ppm: That's a high ppm, probably an aldehyde proton. The integration is 1H, and it's a triplet. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear as singlets or maybe triplets if coupled to something else. Hmm, tripletâ€”maybe adjacent to another proton, like if it's part of a conjugated system.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): These look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest coupling with one neighbor. Maybe two protons each on neighboring carbons in a para-substituted benzene ring? Wait, a para substitution would have two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps two aromatic rings or one with substituents.

Wait, but the integration adds up to 4H in aromatic regions. Maybe two aromatic rings each contributing 2H, but I'm not sure yet.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet. Broad suggests exchange with something, like an -OH proton. Wait, but the integration is 2H. Maybe it's a diol or something else. Alternatively, it could be vinyl protons. Oh, but 6.27 is a bit downfield, maybe adjacent to an oxygen or an electron-withdrawing group.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): This is around the region for CH2 groups attached to something electronegative. Maybe an OCH2 group. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So perhaps -OCH2CH2- or something similar. Wait, but the integration is 2H. So maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Alternatively, it's part of an ethyl group attached to something.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has an aldehyde group (from the 9.72 peak), an aromatic ring with substituents, and an oxygen-containing group, maybe an ether or ester.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms. How would the structure look?

Another approach: think about the reaction steps given. The compound is reacted with NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then aqueous KOH and heat. Those reagents suggest possible diazotization and
