Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and jot down the key points.

The question involves two mixtures, X and Y, and a hydrocarbon Z. Let me try to break this down.

So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Decolorizing bromine usually means they have double bonds because alkenes or alkynes can react with bromine, causing it to decolorize. Since X is a mixture of two liquids, maybe they are alkenes or something similar.

When X is treated with platinum (Pt) and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. Y is also an equimolar mixture of two liquids, but now they don't decolorize bromine water. So, Y's components don't have double bonds anymore. Oh, wait, because decolorizing bromine requires unsaturated bonds. So the reaction must have broken the double bonds.

The reaction is described as a disproportionation. Hmm, what's a disproportionation reaction? Oh right, it's when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, for example, in some redox reactions, a species splits into two, one part gaining electrons (reduction), and another losing (oxidation).

So, the mixture X is transformed into Y via this, and Y's components don't have double bonds. So, maybe X had some alkenes that upon hydrogenation (since Pt is a catalyst for hydrogenation) became alkanes? Wait, but if X decolorizes bromine, and Y doesn't, that makes sense because alkanes don't have double bonds.

Wait, but in the question, after X is treated with Pt and heated, it's a "disproportionation" that gives Y. Oh, wait, no—wait, the question says that treating X with Pt when heated gives Y, which is the result of a disproportionation. So the reaction is a disproportionation, but what's the substance that's undergoing this?

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes, but that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps X has a compound that can undergo hydrogenation but also has some other properties.

Wait, another point: the hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions yields only one substance, Z, which is a hydrocarbon. And Z is a constituent of Y. So, when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z, and when Y is hydrogenated, it also gives Z. But wait, Y is a mixture of two liquids, but when hydrogenated, it leads to Z—so perhaps the two components of Y are hydrogenated to the same Z, meaning they're similar in structure but maybe differ in the number of carbons or something else.

Wait, Z is a certain hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Let me calculate the molecular formula of Z. The mass percentage of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So, let's say the formula is CnHm. Let's compute m. The molar mass of H is about 1, and C is 12.

Hydrogen mass fraction is (m * 1) / (1
