Okay, so I have this problem about quantum mechanics, specifically about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices or something like that. Let me try to think through this.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, which is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay. The equation given is Ay(φ) = aφ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. The matrix operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). The matrix S is provided: its first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0).

Wait, I think I remember that the Pauli matrices are used for spin-1/2 particles, which a muon is, right? The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The structure of S looks familiar. Let me write it out:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Wait, isn't that similar to the structure of the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i? Let me recall the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is actually the Pauli Y matrix, which is usually denoted as σy. So S is σy.

Wait, but in the problem, Ay = c * S. So Ay is (h/(4π)) * σy. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) =0. Let's write down the matrix Ay.

Ay = c * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
So substituting c = h/(4π), Ay becomes:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Let me compute the matrix elements. The (1,2) element is -i*(h/(4π)), and the (2,1) is i*(h/(4π)).

To find eigenvalues, I'll set up the characteristic equation.

The matrix Ay - a I is:

[ -a    ( -i h/(4π) ) ]
[ i h/(4π)   -a ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero.

So determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ] = 0.

Compute each part:

The diagonal product is a^2.

The off-diagonal term: (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ] = (i * -i) * (h/(4π))^2. Wait, no, when you multiply the two elements, which are the off-diagonal terms. Wait, the (1,2) is (-i c) and (2,1) is (i c). So the determinant term from them is (-i c) * (i c) = (-i * i) * c^2. Because it
