Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about an electron state given by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So first, I need to normalize this state because the coefficients probably aren't normalized yet. Wait, right, the state is given as proportional, so we'll have to find the normalization constant.

The first part is about finding the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where the elements Aij are hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. So, that's a 2x2 matrix because it's dealing with spin up and down. Let me write that matrix out.

For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero (since Aij = 0 when i=j), and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[hbar/2  0      ]

Wait, but the operator is probably given as a 2x2 matrix because |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection. So this operator is an off-diagonal matrix. Hmm, what kind of operator is this? Oh, wait, maybe it's proportional to the spin-x operator or something else. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different operator, but perhaps it's the Pauli X matrix scaled by something.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So here, the operator A would be (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, right? Because A has elements (0, hbar/2; hbar/2, 0). So A = (hbar/2) σx.

So the eigenstates of this operator A would be the same as the eigenstates of σx, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. The eigenstates of σx are the superposition states (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because σx is the Pauli x matrix, which flips the spin in the x-direction.

Wait, but wait. The eigenvalues of σx are ±1. So the eigenvalues of A would be ± (hbar/2) * 1, so ±hbar/2.

But the question is about measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of operator A. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, where |+x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down>), and |−x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> − |down>).

So the first task is to find the probability that measuring the operator A (which has eigenstates |+x> and |−x>) yields each eigenvalue. So that's the same as projecting |alpha> onto each of these eigenstates and squaring the modulus.

But wait, |alpha> is given, but it's not normalized. So first, let me normalize the state.

The given state is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>.

So the normalization factor is 1 over sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2), where a=1+i, b=2−i.

Compute |a|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |1+i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) since the real part is 1 and imaginary part is 1.

Wait, wait, no. |a|^2 is (1^2 + 1^2) because a = 1 + i. So 1^2 is 1 for real, and 1^2 for imaginary, sum is 2.

Similarly, |b|^2: b is 2 - i
