Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. Hmm, I remember pions are subatomic particles, and they can decay into other particles. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles after the decay.

The reaction given is π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν. So a positive pion is decaying into a positive muon and a neutrino. Oh wait, the pion is stationary, which means the initial momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. That makes sense because the pion isn't moving, so the products can't just fly off in any direction—they have to balance each other out.

The rest masses are given: the pion (π⁺) is 139.6 MeV/c², and the muon (μ⁺) is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino's mass is negligible, right? Because neutrinos are super light, almost massless. So in calculations, we can take the neutrino's mass as zero.

Wait, but if the neutrino has no mass, then its energy would just be its kinetic energy, or perhaps it's considered as part of the decay's energy release. But I'm not sure; maybe I should think of it differently.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum. The initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion since it's stationary. So initial energy, E_initial = m_π c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the energy is the sum of the energies of
