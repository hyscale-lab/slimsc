Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The question gives me a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex with a concentration of 0.02 M. The temperature is 25°C, and the K value for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in this solution.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It binds metal ions like Ca²+ and forms a complex. So the solution has this complex, and I need to find the free [Ca²+] concentration.

The problem states that the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in its correct form to bind Ca²+ effectively. So I don't have to worry about the protonation state of EDTA here. That simplifies things a bit.

The Ca-EDTA complex is in a 1:1 ratio. So the formula is something like CaY²-, where Y is the EDTA part. The initial concentration of this complex is 0.02 M. So the initial [CaY²−] is 0.02 M.

I think I should use the formation constant (Kf) here. Wait, the given K is KCa-EDTA. Oh, right, K is the formation constant for the complex. So K = [CaY²−] / ([Ca²+][EDTA]). But wait, sometimes formation constants are given as Kf, which is the same as this. So K is 5x10^10.

The reaction is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The K for this is 5e10.

In solution, some of the CaY²− will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA. But since K is very large (1e10 is big), the complex is stable, so the dissociation is minimal, meaning [Ca²+] will be very small compared to 0.02 M.

So, let me set up an ICE table. Initial concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M. Changes: let x be the amount that dissociates. So [Ca²+] increases by x, [EDTA] increases by x, and [CaY²−] decreases by x.

So, after dissociation:
[CaY²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is small)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA] = x

The expression for K is [CaY²−]/( [Ca²+][EDTA] ) = K.

Plugging in:
0.02 / (x * x) ) = 5e10.

So 0.02 / x² = 5e10 → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-12 / 5 → wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5)e-12 = 0.4e-12 → so x² = 4e-13?
