Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question says an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4), and I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. Hmm. I remember that the expectation value is like the average value you'd measure if you measured S_y many times on identically prepared systems.

Wait, first I should probably write down what S_y is. Oh right, the Pauli matrices! The sigma matrices. The sigma_y matrix is given, so S_y is (ħ/2) times sigma_y because spin operators are (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So the matrix for S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the sigma_y matrix.

The given spin state is (3i, 4). So the state vector is a two-component vector: first component 3i, second component 4. I think I need to express this as a column vector. So it would be [3i; 4]. But wait, does the order matter? For spin-½ particles, the first component is typically the up state, and the second is the down state, but I don't think that affects the calculation directly here.

To find the expectation value, I remember that the formula is the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator, then multiplied by the state vector again. So mathematically, it's <ψ| S_y |ψ>.

Let me write this out step by step. First, the state vector |ψ> is [3i, 4]^T. Its conjugate transpose, which is the row vector <ψ|, would be [ -3i, 4 ] because we take the complex conjugate of each component. Wait, wait, no, wait. The components are 3i and 4. The conjugate of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 is 4. So yes, <ψ| is [-3i, 4].

The operator S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the sigma_y matrix. Sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y is (ħ/2) * that matrix.

Putting it all together, the expectation value <S_y> is <ψ| S_y |ψ> = (ħ/2) * <ψ| sigma_y |ψ>.

So let me compute <ψ| sigma_y
