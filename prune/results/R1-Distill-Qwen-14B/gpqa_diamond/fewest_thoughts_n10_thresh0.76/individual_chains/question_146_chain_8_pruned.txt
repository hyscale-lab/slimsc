Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major product when 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene reacts with maleic anhydride. Hmm, I remember that maleic anhydride is a dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions. So this must be a Diels-Alder reaction question.

First, let me think about the structure of 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene. Cyclopenta-1,3-diene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. Wait, no, actually, it's a cyclic diene. Oh wait, cyclopenta-1,3-diene has two double bonds? No, wait, I think cyclopentadiene would be 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is a conjugated diene. So 5-fluoro would mean there's a fluorine substituent on the fifth position, but since it's a five-membered ring, numbering starts from one position, so the fluorine is on one of the double-bonded carbons? Or maybe the ring is such that the fluorine is on the bridgehead or something?

Wait, no, 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene. Let me visualize it. So the ring has five members. Positions 1 and 3 are double bonds. Wait, that can't be right because 1,3 in a five-membered ring would leave a single bond between positions
