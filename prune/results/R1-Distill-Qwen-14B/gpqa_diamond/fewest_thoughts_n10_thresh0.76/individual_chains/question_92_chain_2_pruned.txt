Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to picture its structure. It looks like a molecule with two double bonds maybe? Wait, no, the formula has two double bonds: one at the beginning with (CH3)2C=CH- and another at the end, CH=C(CH3)2. So that's two double bonds in the molecule.

The question gives me some bond energies: Enthalpy of atomization for carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, bond energies for H-H is 100, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. So I need to use these to find the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. The formula is something like the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the products, but wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is calculated using the bond energies of the products minus the bond energies of the reactants, but wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

The general approach is: The enthalpy change (ΔH) for a reaction is equal to the sum of the bond energies of the bonds broken in the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the bonds formed in the products. Wait, no, that's for reactions. But here, we're talking about the enthalpy of formation of the compound. So maybe I should think about the compound as being formed from its elements in their standard states.

Alternatively, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the energy required to break all the bonds in the elements and form the bonds in the compound.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

ΔHf° = [Sum (Bond energies of all bonds in the compound)] - [Sum (Bond energies of all bonds in the elements as they appear in their standard states)]

But wait, the elements as they are in their standard states are C (graphite) and H2 gas. So for the compound, I need to count all
