Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but this might not be the case here because we have different acids and a base, plus some might be in excess.

Wait, the problem gives three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So I need to figure out how they'll react when mixed. Let's write down the moles of each component.

HCl is 500 mL of 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity Ã— Volume (L). So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.

H2SO4 is 300 mL of 0.3 M. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. Each mole gives 2 H+ ions. So moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is 200 mL of 0.5 M. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole gives 2 OH-. Moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the reaction between acids and base. The H+ will react with OH- to form water. But wait, there's also H2SO4 which is a diprotic acid. So I think I need to calculate the total H+ available and compare it with the OH-.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol (since HCl gives 1 H+ per mole)
Total H+ from H2SO4: 0.18 mol (as each mole gives 2 H+)
So total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol.

So the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio. So the limiting reagent will be OH- since 0.28 > 0.2.

So all 0.2 mol OH- will react, consuming 0.2 mol H+. The remaining H+ will be 0.08 mol.

After reaction, the remaining substances are: excess H+ (0.08 mol), the Cl- from HCl, the sulfate from H2SO4, and the Ba^2+ from Ba(OH)2. Also, water and possibly some unreacted H2SO4 if any.

Wait, but H2SO
