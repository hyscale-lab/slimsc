Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that the Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Oh right, hydrogen emits or absorbs at 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. That's in the far-ultraviolet, right? But ground-based telescopes can't observe UV because the atmosphere absorbs it. So how does this affect the redshift?

So the quasar emits light, and the hydrogen cloud absorbs at 1216 Angstroms. But if the cloud is at a high redshift, that wavelength gets stretched. The observed wavelength would be lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

But ground-based optical telescopes can't see UV, so the absorbed light must be shifted into the visible spectrum, which is about 400-700 nm. So the Lyman alpha line needs to be redshifted into the optical range for us to detect it.

So let's calculate the minimum redshift where 1216 Angstroms (which is 121.6 nm) is redshifted into the optical range, say 400 nm (which is 4000 Angstroms).

Wait, wait. Wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. To shift into optical, which is around 400 nm (the lower end), the formula is:

lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z)

We want lambda_obs to be >= 400 nm (for optical). So:

400 = 1216 * (1 + z)

Solving for z:

1 + z = 400 / 1216 ≈ 0.329

Wait, that can't be right because 0.329 is less than 1. So 1 + z would be 0.329? That doesn't make sense because z would be negative, which isn't possible. Oh wait, I must have messed up the inequality.

Wait, no. Wait, if the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, and after redshift, it's longer. So for the observed wavelength to be in the optical (say, 4000 Angstroms, which is 400 nm), we have:

lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) >= 4000 Angstroms.

So 1+z = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29

So z ≈ 2.29. So the redshift needs to be at least around 2.29 for the Lyman alpha line to be observed at 4000 Angstroms (400 nm), which is violet but still in optical.

Wait
