Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of quantum mechanics. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says there are four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The possible answers are given as options A to D, each with different combinations of E multiples.

Wait, what's E here? Oh, right, the question defines E as (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²). I remember that the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = n² E, where n is the quantum number. So for each particle, the energy depends on n squared times E.

But wait, these are identical particles, so I need to consider the Pauli exclusion principle. Since they are spin-1/2 particles, which are fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion. That means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. So each particle's quantum state must be unique in terms of their quantum numbers and spin.

Hmm, but in a 1D well, each particle's state is determined by the principal quantum number n and their spin. Since spin-1/2 has two possible states, up and down, each energy level (n) can hold two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, but wait, no. Because in a 1D box, the quantum state is just determined by n, right? Because angular momentum is zero in 1D. So each spatial state (each n) can have two particles with opposite spins. So for each n, we can have two particles.

So with four particles, let's figure out how they fill up the energy levels.

In the ground state, we start filling the lowest energy levels. The lowest n is 1, which can hold two particles. Then n=2 can hold two more. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1, and the next two into n=2. So all four are filled up to n=2. But wait, that's two particles per level, so n=1 has two, n=2 has two. So the ground state would have each particle in either n=1 or n=2.

But wait,
