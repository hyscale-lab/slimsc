Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). I'm a bit rusty on my Lagrangians, but I remember that the structure of the interaction term tells me about the possible particles involved in the decay.

The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. So the problem is asking which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. 

First, I need to figure out which fermions can interact with X. The interaction term seems to involve ψ_f, which I think represents a fermion field. The term (υ + X) suggests that X couples to the fermion, maybe like a Yukawa coupling. So the fermions that X can decay into must have a mass less than or equal to half the mass of X because in a decay, the mass of the parent must be at least twice the mass of the child particles (since they're created from the boson's rest mass).

So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. Each decay product must be a pair of particles, like fermion and anti-fermion. So each fermion's mass must be <= 3 GeV, because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait! The fermions involved in the interaction are the ones that have a term in the Lagrangian. So looking at the Lagrangian, the fermion fields are ψ_f. The interaction is with these ψ_f particles. So which particles are these ψ_f? Are they quarks? Maybe. Let's think about the fermion masses.

Let me list the known fermion masses. The charged leptons are electrons, muons, taus. Their masses are about 0.511 MeV (electron), ~105.7 MeV (muon), and ~1777 GeV (tau). For quarks, the masses are a bit tricky because they're current masses and depend on the model, but roughly, the up and down quarks are around a few MeV, the strange around 100 MeV, charm about 1.5 GeV, bottom around 4.5 GeV, and top is about 173 GeV.

Wait, but the X boson is 6 GeV. So for a decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, each fermion's mass must be <= 3 GeV. Let me check each fermion:

- electron: 0.511 MeV → way below 3 GeV → allowed.
- muon: ~105.7 MeV → same as above.
- tau: 1.777 GeV → about 1.777 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV → allowed.
- Up quark: ~2 MeV → allowed.
- Down quark: ~4-5 MeV → allowed.
- Strange quark: ~100 MeV → allowed.
- Charm quark: ~1.27 GeV → allowed, since 1.27 <3.
- Bottom quark: ~4.7 GeV → 4.7 >3 → not allowed.
- Top quark: way too heavy, 173 GeV >>3 → definitely not.

So, the fermions that can be decay products are those with mass ≤ 3 GeV. So which ones qualify? Let's list all the possible fermions:

Leptons:
- e^+ e^- → mass 0.511 MeV each → allowed.
- mu^+ mu^- → 105.7 MeV → allowed.
