Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. 

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ><ψ|, but this one seems different because it's a sum of two projectors.

Wait, so |0> and |1> are the standard basis states for a qubit. The density matrix can be written as (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That looks familiar—I think this is called a maximally mixed state. Because for a qubit, when the density matrix is (I)/2, where I is the identity matrix, it represents the completely mixed state. But wait, let's make sure.

The state |0> is [1, 0]^T and |1> is [0, 1]^T. So |0><0| would be a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in (2,2) and zeros elsewhere. Adding them together gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on both diagonal elements. Then, multiplying by 1/2 gives [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So the density matrix ρ is the identity matrix divided by 2.

Now, I'm supposed to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. Wait, what does that mean? I think in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a point on a unit sphere. The Bloch vector r for a state ρ is given by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. Because for a general single-qubit state, the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space with |r| ≤ 1.

So let's write the given ρ in terms of the identity and Pauli matrices. The given ρ is (I)/2. So expanding that, it's (I + 0·(X⊗Y⊗Z))/2. Because if we have (I + r_x X + r_y Y + r_z Z)/2 = ρ. Comparing to our ρ, which is I/2, this implies that all the coefficients r_x, r_y, r_z must be zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0).

Looking at the options:

A) (1,1,0) → That can't be, because that would mean |r| is sqrt(2), which is more than 1, but the Bloch vector can't exceed length 1.

B) (0,0,1) → That's along the z-axis, which would represent a state like |1> or |0> if it's (0,0,1) or (0,0,-1), but wait, for |0>, r would be (0,0,1), and |1> is (0,0,-1). But our state is a mixture of both, so it's the completely mixed state, which is at the origin.

C) (0,0,0) → That matches what I was thinking. The Bloch vector is zero, so the state is at the origin.

D) (1,1,1) → Same as A, impossible because of the length.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be described using a Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\), where the density matrix is expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma},
\]

with \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) being the Pauli matrices. Comparing this to the given \(\rho\), it is evident that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), as there are no contributions from the Pauli matrices. This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) \((1,1,0)\):** This is invalid because the Bloch vector length exceeds 1.
- **B) \((0,0,1)\):** This corresponds to a pure state like \(|0\rangle\), not a mixed state.
- **C) \((0,0,0)\):** This correctly represents the completely mixed state at the origin.
- **D) \((1,1,1)\):** This is invalid because the Bloch vector length exceeds 1.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
