Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read through it again.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4•2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in this solution. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay. So I'm thinking that this is a buffer solution problem because we have two different phosphate species. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which I think is H2PO4^- when dissolved, right? And Na2HPO4•2H2O is sodium dihydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These two are adjacent species in the phosphate ion dissociation series. The H2PO4^- can deprotonate to form HPO4^2-, so this should form a buffer solution. The presence of a buffer suggests that the pH can be determined using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which uses the pKa of the acid in the buffer.

Wait, let's get the dissociation right. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It dissociates in three steps:

1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So, in the solution, we have H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). These two are adjacent, so the buffer will be based around the second dissociation, so the relevant pKa is Ka2. Let me confirm: the first buffer would be H3PO4 and H2PO4^-, the second is H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the third is HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.

Since the problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-, I need to think about whether this comes directly from the solution or if it's formed through dissociation.

Wait, but in the given solution, we don't have any PO4^3- initially. The substances are KH2PO4, which gives H2PO4^-, and Na2HPO4 which gives HPO4^2-. So, the only PO4 species present are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. But the question is about PO4^3-—so that would be produced by the further deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

Ah, right. So, HPO4^2- can donate another proton to become PO4^3-.

But wait, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low because Ka3 is very small (1.8e-12), which is much smaller than Ka2 (6.2e-8). So, the amount of PO4^3- would be negligible compared to HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

But the question specifically asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^
