Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I need to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, right. So, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation and how the population of energy levels changes with temperature. Let me recall: the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor, which is (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the effective temperature is lower. How does that affect the ratio?

Let me think. The ratio N2/N1 is proportional to exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. If T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative (since denominator is smaller), so the exponential term gets smaller. But wait, if ΔE is positive (E2 higher than E1), then a lower T would make the ratio N2/N1 smaller.

Wait, but the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K). So the ratio N1/N2 would be higher when the star has spots because the ratio N2/N1 is lower. Wait, the question says the ratio of N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. Or wait, let me read it again.

Wait, the question says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. So, when spots are present, the ratio (N1/N2) is lower. Hmm, wait no, because the ratio is N1/N2. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is N_level1 / N_level2. And that ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots.

So, let's clarify. When the star has spots, Teff drops. The Ti atoms in the photosphere are in LTE. So their level populations are determined by the local temperature.

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so the overall photospheric effective temperature is lower. But what about the regions not covered by spots? The unspotted regions are at 6000 K. So the overall Teff is an average, but how does that affect the line formation? Wait, but the question says the photosphere is in LTE, so perhaps the effective temperature refers to the photospheric temperature, which is an average. Or wait, maybe the whole photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, but that doesn't make much sense because the spots are cooler regions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question says that when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere's average temperature is lower.

But the problem is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels. So, when the overall temperature is lower, how does the ratio change?

Wait, but each region of the star has its own temperature. The unspotted regions are at 6000 K, the spotted regions are cooler, say T_spot. But how much cooler? The problem doesn't give us the temperature of the spots. Hmm, the problem states that the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered. But how is Teff calculated? It's the effective temperature, which is the square root of the total luminosity divided by the surface area times some factor. But perhaps the average flux is determined by the sum of the fluxes from the spotted and unspotted regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying it by assuming that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. So the entire photosphere is at 5500 K? That seems a bit odd because spots are cooler regions on the surface, but perhaps the question is treating the photosphere as if it's at 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So maybe the average temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K when 40% is covered. But I'm not sure if the spots are at a different temperature, but the average is lower. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to model this as the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, which would lower the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the unspotted regions are at 6000 K and the spotted regions are at some lower temperature, say T_spot. Then the average temperature would be a weighted average, but that complicates things. The problem doesn't provide T_spot, so I'm thinking the question is simplified, and when the star has spots, the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K, so the entire photosphere is at that average. So the Ti atoms are in LTE at 5500 K when spots are present, and at 6000 K when there are no spots.

Wait, that's probably the approach to take. So the ratio N1/N2 is given by (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), but wait the ratio is N1/N2, so it's (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ), because the Boltzmann factor is exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), so when we take N1/N2, it's (g1/g2) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ), which is the same as (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

Wait, no. Let me go through the math again. The Boltzmann distribution says N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So here, considering N1 and N2, the ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Which is the same as (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Let me denote ΔE as E2 - E1. So the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, but if E2 > E1, then ΔE is positive. So when T increases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases or decreases? Let's see: For higher T, ΔE/(k T) becomes smaller, so the exponential increases because the exponent is a smaller positive number.

Wait, no. Let's think. If T increases, the denominator k T increases, so ΔE/(k T) decreases. So, for a given positive ΔE, as T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases, making the exponential smaller. Wait, because the exponent is positive and gets smaller, so exp(small positive) is larger than exp(bigger positive). Wait no, wait: exp(0) is 1, exp(0.1) is about 1.1, exp(0.2) is about 1.22, etc. So as the exponent increases, the exponential increases. So if T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases, so the exponent is smaller, so the exponential term becomes smaller. So for N1/N2, which is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)), as T increases, the exponent gets smaller, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) decreases. So N1/N2 decreases as T increases, assuming ΔE is positive.

Wait, but wait. Let me think with numbers. Suppose ΔE is 1000 eV, k is 8.617e-5 eV/K. T is 6000 K.

ΔE/(k T) = 1000 / (8.617e-5 * 6000). Let me compute that.

8.617e-5 * 6000 = 0.51702 eV. So 1000 / 0.51702 ≈ 1934. So exp(1934) is a huge number, which is impossible because in reality, such a high energy transition would not be populated. Hmm, but perhaps the actual ΔE is much smaller. The wavelength given is 1448 Å, which is about 1448 Angstroms, which is 144.8 nm, which is in the near UV or vacuum UV. So the energy is E = hc/λ. Let's compute that.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.
c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.
λ is 1448 Angstroms = 1448e-10 m.

E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) ≈ (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1448e-10 m) ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E = 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a big energy difference. So ΔE is about 8.56 eV. That's a lot. But wait, maybe I made a mistake because the transition is between two energy levels, so E2 - E1 is this photon's energy. So ΔE = 8.56 eV.

Wait, but that's a very large energy difference. For Ti neutral atoms, such a high energy transition seems unlikely, but maybe it's correct. Let me proceed.

So when the star has no spots, T is 6000 K. When it has spots, T is 5500 K.

So I need to compute the ratio N1/N2 at T1 = 6000 K and T2 = 5500 K, then find the factor by which the ratio changes when T is T1 compared to T2.

The ratio is (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)).

But wait, perhaps the statistical weights g1 and g2 are the same, so the ratio would be exp(ΔE/(k T)). But the problem doesn't give us g1 and g2, so I think we can assume they are the same, so the ratio is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but the question is about the ratio when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So without spots, T is 6000 K (T1), with spots, T is 5500 K (T2).

So the ratio when not having spots (R1) is exp(ΔE/(k * T1)), and when having spots (R2) is exp(ΔE/(k * T2)).

The factor is R1/R2 = exp(ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(ΔE/(k T2)).

Which is exp( ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Let me compute this.

First, compute 1/T1 and 1/T2.

T1 = 6000 K → 1/T1 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1.

T2 = 5500 K → 1/T2 ≈ 1.8182e-4 K^-1.

Wait, wait, 1/6000 is approximately 0.00016667, and 1/5500 is approximately 0.00018182.

So 1/T1 - 1/T2 = (1.8182e-4 - 1.6667e-4) = (0.1515e-4) = 1.515e-5 K^-1.

So the exponent is ΔE/(k) * (1.515e-5).

Wait, let me compute that. ΔE is 8.56 eV, k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE/(k) = 8.56 / (8.617e-5) ≈ 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ approximately 99335 K.

Wait, 8.617e-5 eV/K is 8.617e-5 eV per K. So 8.56 eV divided by that is 8.56 / 8.617e-5 = approx 99,335 K.

So then, (ΔE/(k)) * (1.515e-5) = 99335 K * 1.515e-5 1/K.

Multiply 99335 by 1.515e-5:

99335 * 1.515e-5 = Let's compute:

99335 ≈ 1e5, so 1e5 * 1.515e-5 = 1.515. So approximately 99,335 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 99335 * 1.515e-5.

Let me compute 99335 * 1.515e-5:

99335 = 9.9335e4.

Multiply by 1.515e-5:

9.9335e4 * 1.515e-5 = 9.9335 * 1.515 * 1e-1 = (approx 9.9335 * 1.515) * 0.1.

Compute 9.9335 * 1.515 ≈ 15.05.

15.05 * 0.1 = 1.505.

So the exponent is approximately 1.505.

So the factor is exp(1.505) ≈ e^1.505. Let's compute that.

e^1 ≈ 2.71828.

e^0.5 ≈ 1.6487.

So e^1.5 is e^1 * e^0.5 ≈ 2.71828 * 1.6487 ≈ 4.48.

But I have 1.505, which is a bit more than 1.5. So e^1.505 ≈ 4.505.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the calculation again because I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the ratio when no spots is R1 = exp(ΔE/(k T1)),

with spots, R2 = exp(ΔE/(k T2)).

The factor is R1 / R2 = exp(ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2)) = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2)).

Wait, but wait, the exponent is ΔE/(k) multiplied by (1/T1 - 1/T2). Wait, no, it's (1/(k T1)) - (1/(k T2)) ), but actually it's (ΔE/k)(1/T1 - 1/T2).

Wait, let me recompute:

The exponent is ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * (1/(6000) - 1/(5500)) K^-1.

Wait, 1/6000 is 0.000166667, 1/5500 is 0.000181818. The difference is 0.0000151515 per K.

So ΔE/(k) is 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99335 K.

Multiply by 0.0000151515 K^-1 → 99335 * 0.0000151515 ≈ 1.505.

So yes, the exponent is about 1.505.

So exp(1.505) ≈ e^1.505 ≈ 4.505.

So the factor is approximately 4.5. So the ratio without spots is about 4.5 times higher than when spots are present.

Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher, with spots, it's lower. So the factor when the star does not have spots compared to when it does is 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} \propto \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The problem provides the following key data:

- When the star has no spots, \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
- When the star has spots, \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \).
- The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), which corresponds to \( \Delta E = 8.56 \, \text{eV} \) (calculated using \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \)).

The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \Delta E / k \)
Using \( \Delta E = 8.56 \, \text{eV} \) and \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99335 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \)
For \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.6667 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 1.8182 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = (1.6667 \times 10^{-4}) - (1.8182 \times 10^{-4}) = -1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the exponent
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = 99335 \times (-1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx -1.505.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the factor
\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(-1.505) \approx 0.222.
\]

### Step 5: Interpret the result
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \( 4.5 \) (the reciprocal of \( 0.222 \)). This means the ratio of \( N_1/N_2 \) is about 4.5 times higher when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**.
