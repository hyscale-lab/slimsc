Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, alright, let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, there's this civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud who built a super fast spacecraft. The speed is 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is really, really fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to find out how long it takes from their point of view to reach Earth.

Wait, the question says to consider the astronaut's perspective, so it's about proper time. Right, because in special relativity, time experienced by the traveler is the proper time, which is shorter than the time measured in the stationary frame.

But wait, I think I need to calculate the time from Earth's frame first, then apply time dilation. Or maybe I should use the Lorentz transformation directly.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says to find the time from the astronaut's perspective. So the proper time τ is what we're after. The proper time is the shortest time, experienced by the traveler.

First, I need to figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, do I know that? Oh right, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Let me double-check that number. Yeah, I remember that it's roughly 160,000 to 200,000 light-years, but let's go with 163,000 for this calculation.

So, distance d = 163,000 light-years. The speed v is 0.99999987 c. So, from Earth's frame, the time it takes is t = d / v.

Wait, but wait, light-year is a unit of distance, and since v is a fraction of c, t would be in years. Let me compute that.

t = 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163000 / 1 ≈ 163000 years. Wait, but wait, 0.99999987 is almost c, so the time is almost the same as the distance in light-years. So t ≈ 163,000 years from Earth's perspective.

But that can't be right because the astronaut's lifetime is 150 years. Oh wait, the astronaut's average lifetime is 150 solar years. So if the trip takes 163,000 years from Earth's frame, the astronaut would have aged much more, so they wouldn't survive. But wait, time dilation comes into play because the astronaut is moving at a high speed, so their experienced time is less.

Wait, no, the Earth frame says the trip takes 163,000 years. The astronaut's clock would run slower, so their experienced time is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but let me compute the gamma factor, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.99999987 c, let's compute v²/c².

v = 0.99999987 c → v² = (0.99999987)^2 c². Let me compute that. 0.99999987 squared is approximately 0.99999974. So v²/c² = ~0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

The square root of that is sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.00051.

So gamma ≈ 1 / 0.00051 ≈ 1960.78.

So from Earth's frame, the time is t = 163000 years. The astronaut's time is τ = t / gamma = 163000 / 1960.78 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 163000 divided by about 2000 is 81.5. Wait, 1960.78 is roughly 1960. So 163000 / 1960 is approximately 83.16 years. Wait, wait, am I doing that right? Let me calculate it accurately.

Wait, 1960 * 83 = 1960*80=156,800; 1960*3=5880 → total 162,680. So 1960*83=162,680. The numerator is 163,000. So 163,000 - 162,680 = 320. So 320/1960 ≈ 0.1633. So 83.1633 years. So approx 83.16 years.

Wait, but wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. So if the trip takes about 83 years from their perspective, they would be 22 + 83 = 105 years old. But the average lifetime is 150 years, so they would survive. But wait, option A says the astronaut will die before reaching Earth. That would be if the time experienced is longer than their lifetime.

Wait, but wait, 83 years is less than 150, so they would live. But wait, the options are A to D, and one of them is 77, 72, 81, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck the gamma calculation. Because v is 0.99999987 c, and that's very close to c. So let's compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.99999987 c → v² = (0.99999987)^2 = ?

Let me compute 0.99999987 squared. Let me write it as (1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.00000013) + (0.00000013)^2. Since 0.00000013 squared is negligible, it's approximately 1 - 0.00000026 → 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.00000026. The square root of that is sqrt(0.00000026) → Let me compute that. 0.00000026 is 2.6e-7.

What's the square root of 2.6e-7? Let me think: sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4 (since (5.1e-3)^2 is about 2.6e-5, wait, wait, no, 5.1e-4 squared is (5.1e-4)^2=26e-8=2.6e-7. Oh, right, so sqrt(2.6e-7) is 5.1e-4, which is 0.00051.

So gamma is 1 / 0.00051 ≈ 1960.78, as before.

So time from Earth's frame is t = 163,000 ly / 0.99999987 c = 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163000 years.

Wait, but wait, because 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year. So when you're moving at v, the time taken is d/(v), but d is in ly and v is in terms of c, so t would be in years. So yes, t = 163000 / 0.99999987 → which is roughly 163,000 years.

So the proper time τ is t / gamma → 163000 / 1960.78 ≈ 83.16 years.

Wait, but the options don't have 83. The closest is option C) 81, D)77, etc. Did I make an error?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 163000 / 1960.78.

Let me compute 1960.78 × 83: 1960.78 *80=156,862.4; 1960.78 *3=5,882.34 → total 162,744.74. So 83 gives 162,744.74. The actual numerator is 163,000, which is 255.26 more. So 255.26 / 1960.78 ≈ 0.13. So 83.13 years.

Hmm, but why is my calculation giving me around 83 years, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options are: A) die before, B)72, C)81, D)77.

Wait, none of the options is 83. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: maybe using the Lorentz transformation, but perhaps I should calculate the time in the astronaut's frame. Alternatively, maybe using length contraction.

Wait, from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted. So the distance d' = d * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) or d' = d / gamma.

Wait, no, the proper length is the Earth's frame length. From the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted.

So the time experienced τ is (d / gamma) / v. Wait, no, because from the astronaut's perspective, the distance is shorter. So the time is (d' ) / v, where d' = d * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → d' = d / gamma.

So τ = (d / gamma) / v. Wait, but d is in ly, and v is in terms of c, so let me compute:

d = 163,000 ly. So d' = 163,000 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → 163,000 * (1/ gamma) → 163,000 / 1960.78 → ~83.16 years.

Wait, that's the same result as before. So the astronaut's experienced time is about 83 years.

But the options don't have 83. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the speed is so close to c that the time experienced is almost the same as the distance divided by speed. Wait, but that would be 163,000 ly / 0.99999987c → which gives 163000 years, which is way too long. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, no, wait. No, in the Earth frame, the time is 163,000 years. From the astronaut's frame, the time is less. So perhaps I should calculate the Lorentz factor correctly.

Wait, let me compute v more accurately. Let me compute v as 0.99999987 c. So,

v² = (0.99999987)^2 = ?

Calculating 0.99999987 squared:

(1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x², where x = 1.3e-6.

So,

v² = (1 - 1.3e-6)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-6) + (1.3e-6)^2 = 1 - 2.6e-6 + 1.69e-12 ≈ 0.99999974.

So 1 - v² = 2.6e-6.

Ah, so 1 - v²/c² = 2.6e-6.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(2.6e-6) ≈ 0.001612.

So gamma is 1 / 0.001612 ≈ 620. So wait, wait a minute—I thought earlier that gamma was about 1960, but perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, wait, 0.001612 is approximately 1.612e-3, so 1 / 0.001612 is about 620. So I think I messed up the earlier calculation. Because 2.6e-6 is 0.0000026.

Wait, sqrt(0.0000026) → Let me compute it.

What's sqrt(0.0000026)?

Let me write it as 2.6e-6.

The square root of 2.6 is about 1.612, and square root of 1e-6 is 1e-3. So sqrt(2.6e-6) is 1.612e-3, which is 0.001612.

So gamma = 1 / 0.001612 ≈ 620.

Wait, so earlier mistake: I thought 1 - v²/c² was 2.6e-4 (0.00000026?), but no, I think I messed up the decimal points.

Wait, let me recalculate.

v = 0.99999987 c → v = 0.99999987 times the speed of light.

So, v squared is (0.99999987)^2 → let me compute this accurately.

0.99999987 is approximately 1 - 0.00000013.

So (1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x², and x is 0.00000013, so x² is negligible. So v² ≈ 1 - 2*(0.00000013) = 1 - 0.00000026 → 0.99999974.

So 1 - v² = 0.00000026, which is 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) = 0.0005099 approximately.

So gamma = 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1960. So that brings us back to gamma being about 1960.

Wait, so my first calculation was correct, and the second approach where I thought I had 620 was wrong. So the gamma is indeed about 1960.

So, time from Earth frame, t = 163000 ly / (0.99999987 c) → which is roughly 163,000 years (since 0.99999987 is almost 1).

So the proper time τ is t / gamma → 163000 / 1960 ≈ 83 years.

But the options don't have 83. So perhaps I made a mistake in the distance. Wait, the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is actually about 163,000 light-years, but maybe the problem uses a different value, perhaps 170,000 or 200,000? Or perhaps I should recalculate with a more precise approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Let me compute τ = (d / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → because τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → t = d/(v), since d is in light-years and v is in terms of c, so t is in years.

Wait, so τ = (d / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → Let me compute each part.

d is 163,000 ly. v is 0.99999987 c.

So d / v = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years.

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.0005099.

So τ = 163,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 82.96 years.

So approximately 83 years.

Looking at the options, the closest is C) 81 years. But wait, perhaps the problem uses the distance as 170,000 light-years? Let's recalculate with 170,000.

Wait, if d is 170,000 ly:

τ = (170000 / 0.99999987) * 0.0005099 → 170000 / ~1 → 170000 * 0.0005099 → 86.68 years.

Hmm, that's even further from the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different distance, say 200,000 ly. Let's see:

200,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 101.98 years.

No, that's not matching any options either.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the approach. Another way to compute τ is using the formula:

τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

But t is the time in Earth's frame, which is d/(v) → 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years.

So τ = 163,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 82.96 years.

Hmm, that's about 83 years.

Wait, but none of the options is 83. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma?

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is so close to c that a different approximation is used, like using v ≈ c, which would make the time t = d/(c) → 163000 years, and τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → which for v≈c, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is small.

Wait, but that's what I did. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the approximation for v ≈ c, so that the Lorentz factor gamma is about 1/(v (1 - v²/c²)^0.5). Or perhaps the time can be approximated using the relation between velocity and time.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the velocity as 0.99999987 c, which is 0.99999987 times c, meaning that 1 - v is 0.00000013 c, which is a very small number. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed. Let's compute gamma accurately.

v = 0.99999987 c → let's compute 1 - v²/c².

v² = (0.99999987)^2 = (0.99999987)(0.99999987) → Let me compute that.

Compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987:

Let me write it as (1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00000026 + 1.69e-12 ≈ 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.00000026.

sqrt(0.00000026) is sqrt(2.6e-7) → sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, so sqrt(2.6e-7) = 1.612e-3.5 → Wait, no, 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2, but let me compute it numerically.

Wait, 1e-7 is 0.0000001, so sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(0.00000026) = 0.0005099.

Yes, as before.

So gamma is 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1960.

So, the time in Earth's frame is 163000 years. The proper time is 163000 / 1960 ≈ 83.16 years.

So, the astronaut would experience about 83 years.

But the options don't have an 83. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem setup.

Wait, the question says "the average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years." So if the trip takes 83 years from their perspective, they would be 22 + 83 = 105, which is less than 150, so they would survive. So the answer would not be A, since they would make it.

But looking at the options, the closest is C) 81 years. Hmm, maybe I should recalculate using more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me calculate 1 - v² more accurately.

v = 0.99999987 c → v² = (0.99999987)^2.

Let me compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987:

= (1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.00000013) + (0.00000013)^2.

= 1 - 0.00000026 + 1.69e-12.

= 0.99999974000169.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.00000025999831.

Which is approximately 2.5999831e-7.

So sqrt(2.5999831e-7) = sqrt(2.5999831) * sqrt(1e-7).

sqrt(2.5999831) is approximately 1.6124 (since 1.6124^2 = ~2.5999).

sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 0.000316227766.

So sqrt(2.5999831e-7) = 1.6124 * 0.000316227766 ≈ 0.0005098.

So gamma = 1 / 0.0005098 ≈ 1960.78.

So time from Earth's frame t = 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years.

Proper time τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → 163000 * 0.0005098 ≈ 82.93 years.

Hmm, still 83 years. So perhaps the intended answer is option C) 81 years, but I'm getting 83. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation leading to 77 years.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the distance. Let me check: the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away. But sometimes, it's given as approximately 170,000. If I use 170,000 ly, then:

t = 170,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 170,000 years.

τ = 170,000 * 0.0005098 ≈ 86.67 years.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the time using a different formula, perhaps using the velocity as a decimal without considering the exact value.

Let me try to compute gamma again with v = 0.99999987, perhaps using more precise math.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation for v ≈ c, where gamma is approximately E = mc² / (1 - v) / c, but that's probably not right.

Wait, another approach: the time experienced by the astronaut τ is t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time in Earth's frame.

t = d / v → since d is in ly and v is in terms of c, t is in years.

So, τ = (d / v) * sqrt(1 - (v^2)/(c^2)).

Plugging in the numbers:

d = 163,000 ly.

v = 0.99999987 c.

So,

τ = (163000 / 0.99999987) * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2).

As before, 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years.

sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) = sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.0005098.

So,

τ ≈ 163,000 * 0.0005098 ≈ 82.93 years.

Hmm, again 83 years.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is 81, which is option C. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the distance as 200,000 ly.

Wait, let's try d=200,000 ly.

τ = (200,000 / 0.99999987) * 0.0005098 → approximately 200,000 * 0.0005098 → 101.96 years.

No, that's not matching the options either.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Perhaps using the approximation that when v is very close to c, the time experienced is approximately (d) / (v gamma), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think: since v is so close to c, perhaps I can approximate gamma as 1/(v * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)).

Wait, but that's the same as before. Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the problem uses the distance as 1.7e5 ly and v as 0.99998c, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of time from the astronaut's perspective.

Wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. If the trip takes about 83 years, they would be 105, which is under 150, so they live. So the answer would be that it takes about 83 years, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D)77, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial value of the distance was wrong. Let me check the actual distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Upon checking, the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 163,000 light-years away. So my initial assumption was correct.

Hmm, all right. So perhaps the problem expects me to choose the closest option, which is C)81 years. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1 - v² more accurately.

v = 0.99999987.

v squared = (0.99999987)^2 = ?

Let me compute it accurately.

0.99999987 * 0.99999987:

Let me compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

= (1 - 0.00000013) * (1 - 0.00000013) 

= 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 

= 1 - 0.00000026 + 1.69e-12 

≈ 0.99999974000169.

So 1 - v² = 0.00000025999831.

So sqrt(0.00000025999831) = ?

Let me compute this more precisely. The square root of 0.00000025999831.

We can write it as 2.5999831e-7.

The square root of 2.5999831e-7 is sqrt(2.5999831) * sqrt(1e-7).

sqrt(2.5999831) ≈ 1.61239999.

sqrt(1e-7) = 1e-3.5 = approximately 0.000316227766.

Multiply them: 1.61239999 * 0.000316227766 ≈ 0.0005098.

So gamma is 1 / 0.0005098 ≈ 1960.78.

So, τ = 163000 / 1960.78 ≈ 83.16 years.

So, the astronaut would take about 83 years, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the speed is 0.99999987c, which is 0.99999987 times c, and compute the time more accurately.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator for precise computation.

Compute 163000 / 1960.78.

Let me compute 1960.78 × 83 = ?

1960.78 * 80 = 156,862.4

1960.78 * 3 = 5,882.34

Total = 156,862.4 + 5,882.34 = 162,744.74.

The difference between 162,744.74 and 163,000 is 255.26.

So, 255.26 / 1960.78 ≈ 0.13.

So, τ ≈ 83.13 years.

Hmm, 83.13 is about 83 years.

So, since the options don't have 83, perhaps the intended answer is option C)81 years. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use a different approach, like the age of the astronaut being 22 and adding to the time, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the Lorentz factor. Let me recheck gamma.

Wait, 0.0005098 is the sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So gamma is 1 / 0.0005098 ≈ 1960.78.

So, I think I'm confident that the proper time is about 83 years. But given the options, perhaps the correct answer intended is C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different distance. Let me try with 170,000 ly.

τ = 170000 / 1960.78 ≈ 86.68 years.

No, that's not matching either.

Wait, perhaps the speed is given as 0.99999987c, which is 0.99999987 of the speed of light. Let me compute 1 - v as 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013. But that's in terms of c.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation for v ≈ c, where gamma ≈ 1/(v (1 - v/c)).

Wait, that might not apply here, but perhaps using that approach:

gamma = 1 / (v * (1 - v/c)) ) → but wait, v is 0.99999987 c.

So,

gamma ≈ 1 / (0.99999987 c * (1 - 0.99999987)) 

= 1 / (0.99999987 * (0.00000013) * c )

= 1 / (0.00000013 * 0.99999987 * c )

= 1/(1.3e-7 * c )

But I'm not sure if that's a valid approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation for small (1 - v/c):

gamma ≈ (c) / (1 - v) ) / (v c) ), but I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between velocity and gamma when v is close to c.

Wait, another approach: the time experienced is t' = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, t_earth = 163000 years.

t' = 163000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) = 163000 * 0.0005098 ≈ 82.93 years.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps the correct answer is (C) 81 years, as the closest option.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate the gamma factor using v = 0.99998c or something like that, leading to a different time.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the time using the formula (d / v ) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) without considering the exact value.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the time from the astronaut's frame using length contraction. So, the distance is contracted by gamma.

So, d' = d / gamma = 163000 / 1960.78 ≈ 83 years.

Wait, that's the same as before. So the astronaut's experienced time is 83 years.

Hmm, given that, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option C)81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the proper time is 77 years.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 163000 / (gamma * v).

Wait, no, because v is in terms of c, and gamma is 1960, so (gamma * v) would be 1960 * 0.99999987 ≈ 1960.

So, 163000 / 1960 ≈ 83 years.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here, but I think the proper time is approximately 83 years, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the intended answer is option D)77 years, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the speed is given as 0.99999987 c, but when computing gamma, perhaps I should use v = 0.99999987 c, and compute 1 - (v²/c²) precisely.

Wait, v = 0.99999987 c → v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² = 0.99999974000169 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.00000025999831.

sqrt(0.00000025999831) = sqrt(2.5999831e-7) → approximately 0.0005098.

So gamma is about 1960.78.

So, the calculations seem correct, leading to 83 years.

In that case, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is C)81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the time using the fact that the astronaut's lifetime is 150 years, so if the trip takes longer than that, they die before reaching. But according to my calculation, it takes about 83 years, so they survive, so the correct answer is not A.

Wait, but perhaps I miscalculated. Let me compute 163,000 / 1960.78 again.

1960.78 * 83 = 1960 *83 = 162,680. 1960.78 *83 = 162,680 + 83*0.78 ≈ 162,680 + 64.74 = 162,744.74. The numerator is 163,000, so the difference is 255.26.

255.26 / 1960.78 ≈ 0.13 years. So 83.13 years.

So, 83 years is correct.

Looking back at the options:

A) Die before: No.

B)72: No.

C)81: No.

D)77: No.

Wait, none of the options match, which is a problem. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)81, considering rounding. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me compute sqrt(0.00000025999831) more precisely.

We can use a calculator for better precision.

Let me compute 0.00000025999831.

Take natural logarithm:

ln(0.00000025999831) = ln(2.5999831e-7) = ln(2.5999831) + ln(1e-7) → approx 0.9565 + (-16.118) → -15.1615.

So sqrt(x) = exp( ln(x)/2 ) → exp( (-15.1615)/2 ) = exp(-7.58075) ≈ 4.57e-4.

Wait, but earlier calculation with a calculator would have given me about 0.0005098, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator is not feasible here.

Given the time constraints, I think the correct calculation leads to approximately 83 years, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)81 years, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to approximate gamma as 2000, leading to 163000 / 2000 ≈ 81.5 years. So option C)81 years.


To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we analyze the problem using relativistic time dilation. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance to Earth is approximately \( d = 163,000 \) light-years (ly). The astronaut's perspective requires calculating the proper time \( \tau \), which is shorter than the time measured in Earth's frame due to relativistic effects.

### Key Equations and Calculations:
1. **Time in Earth's frame**:  
   The time taken to travel to Earth from Earth's perspective is:  
   \[
   t = \frac{d}{v}
   \]  
   Substituting \( d = 163,000 \, \text{ly} \) and \( v = 0.99999987c \):  
   \[
   t = \frac{163,000}{0.99999987} \approx 163,000 \, \text{years}.
   \]

2. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:  
   The proper time experienced by the astronaut is related to the time in Earth's frame by:  
   \[
   \tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
   \]  
   First, calculate \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \):  
   \[
   v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974, \quad \text{so } 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 0.00000026.
   \]  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 0.0005098.
   \]  
   Substituting \( t = 163,000 \, \text{years} \):  
   \[
   \tau = 163,000 \cdot 0.0005098 \approx 82.93 \, \text{years}.
   \]

3. **Astronaut's Survival**:  
   The astronaut is 22 years old and has an average lifetime of 150 years. Since \( \tau \approx 83 \, \text{years} \), the astronaut would survive the trip, ruling out option A.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.  
  This is incorrect because \( \tau \approx 83 \, \text{years} \), which is less than the astronaut's average lifetime of 150 years.

- **Option B**: 72 years.  
  This is too low compared to the calculated \( \tau \approx 83 \, \text{years} \).

- **Option C**: 81 years.  
  This is the closest to the calculated \( \tau \approx 83 \, \text{years} \), likely rounded down.

- **Option D**: 77 years.  
  This is also too low compared to the calculated \( \tau \approx 83 \, \text{years} \).

### Conclusion:
The calculated proper time \( \tau \approx 83 \, \text{years} \) does not match any option exactly. However, the closest option is **C) 81 years**, which is likely intended as the correct answer.
