Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So, the question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four, so I need to figure out each one individually.

First, what's optical isomerism? Oh right, that's when a compound has chiral centers, making it able to rotate plane-polarized light. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. So each of these compounds, I need to check if they have any such centers.

Let's go through them one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Wait, the substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions, and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. So each phenyl ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group attached.

Wait, the structure is dimethyl, meaning the ester groups are OMe. Each phenyl ring likely has a substituent at 2 and 6 positions? Or wait, wait. The compound is [1,1'-biphenyl], which means two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1'. Then, on each ring, positions 2 and 6 have substituents.

Wait, the substituents are nitro and carboxylate. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So each ring is 6-nitro and 2-carboxylate. But how does that affect the structure's symmetry?

Wait, the biphenyl structure: the two benzene rings are connected in such a way that their positions 2 and 6 are adjacent, perhaps. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, in biphenyl, the positions are adjacent if the rings are connected at 1 and 1'. So for each ring, position 2 is next to the connecting bond. So if each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, then looking at the substituents' positions: ring A has 2-carboxylate and 6-nitro, ring B has 2-carbox
