Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to eliminate this compound by mutating the gene responsible. The question is about which mutation would achieve that.

So, the intact gene has a certain sequence, and four mutants are shown. I need to figure out which mutation would disrupt the gene enough to stop the anti-nutritional compound. I remember that in genetics, changing the DNA sequence can lead to changes in the protein product. If the gene's function is to produce the anti-nutritional compound, disrupting the gene should stop the production.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence and see where changes occur. The problem states that the changes are in the first exon area. Exons are the parts of the gene that code for proteins, so any mutations here could affect the protein structure.

The intact gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Let's compare each mutant.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the beginning, the original is ATGTTT. In mutant 1, it's ATGTTCTACGCT. Wait, let me count the letters. The original starts with ATG TTT, and the mutant has ATG TCT. So the third base is T in original, and maybe C in the mutant? Or wait, let me check the exact positions.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

Hmm, the first part: the first two codons are the same (ATG, which is the start, and TTT which is Phe). Then the third codon in the intact is CTC. In mutant 1, it's TAC. Wait, let me see the exact mutation.

Wait, the first part of each:

Intact: ...ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...
Mutant 1: ...ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

So, breaking it down:

Original exons would have the exons as parts that are continuous in the mRNA. So any changes within exons would affect the protein.

In Mutant 1, the third codon changes from TTT (Phe) to TCT (Ser) perhaps. Wait, but looking at the sequences, perhaps it's a substitution in the first exon.

Wait, maybe I should see where the mutations are. Let me compare each mutant to the intact gene.

Mutant 1: The first few bases after ATG are TTT in the intact, but in Mutant1 it's TTC. Wait, no, let me look again. Wait, the first part:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, the intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... 

Mutant1 has ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... 

Wait, perhaps the TTT is replaced by TTC. Wait, no, because the next part is different. Let me write the first part:

Intact:
Positions 1-15: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT
