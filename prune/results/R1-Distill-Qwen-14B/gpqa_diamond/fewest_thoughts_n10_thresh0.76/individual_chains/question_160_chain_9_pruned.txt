Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the diffraction pattern created by a polygonal aperture. Let me read the question again and understand what's being asked.

The problem says that the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light, with wavelength λ, is shining along the z-axis, and we need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. Also, we can use the small angle approximation where tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm. So when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle. Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon approaches a circle. So this problem is essentially about the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture, right?

Wait, but wait. If the polygon becomes a circle, then the apothem 'a' is the radius of the circle. Because in a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which for a circle is just the radius. So the radius r is equal to a.

Now, for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern in the far field is known as the Fraunhofer diffraction. The intensity minima occur at specific angles. The first minimum (the first dark ring) occurs at an angle given by the formula sinθ = λ/(π r). Wait, wait, no—wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the minima in a single-slit diffraction is when a sinθ = m λ, where m is an integer. But wait, that's for a single slit. For a circular aperture, it's different. Oh right, the minima for a circular aperture are given by the zeros of the Bessel functions. The first minimum occurs at a certain angle, but in the case of very small angles, perhaps we can approximate it using the single-slit formula?

Wait, no, the circular aperture's diffraction pattern's minima are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J1. The first minimum occurs when J1(k a) = 0, where k is the wave number, and a is the radius. The first zero of J1 is approximately at k a ≈ 3.8317. But wait, since k is 2π/λ, and a is the radius, but wait, the condition for the minima is when (π a sinθ
