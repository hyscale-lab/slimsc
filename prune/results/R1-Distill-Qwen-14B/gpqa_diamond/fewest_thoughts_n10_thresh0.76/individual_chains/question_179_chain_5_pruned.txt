Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about matrices and their properties in quantum mechanics. The matrices given are W, X, Y, and Z. I've got to pick the correct statement from the options A to D.

First, let me recall some concepts. In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. The evolution operator is unitary. So, to determine which statements are correct, I'll need to check the properties of each matrix.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. The exponential of a matrix. I remember that if a matrix X is Hermitian, then e^X might preserve the norm, because unitary operators (which preserve the norm) can be written as e^{iH} where H is Hermitian. But wait, if X isn't Hermitian, then e^X might not be unitary. So, the question is whether e^X is unitary. If it is, then multiplying by it preserves the norm. If not, then the norm could change.

Wait, but wait. Let's check if X is Hermitian. A Hermitian matrix equals its conjugate transpose. Let's compute X† for matrix X.

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

The conjugate of X will have each element's complex conjugate. So, the conjugate of X is:
Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Now, the transpose of X† would swap rows and columns. Let me write X†:

Original X† is:

Column 1 of X becomes row 1 of X†:

First column of X: i, 1, 2i → becomes row 1 of X†: [i*, 1*, (2i)* ] which is [-i, 1, -2i]

Wait, no, wait. The conjugate transpose is the transpose of the conjugate. So, taking X, then taking each element's conjugate, then transposing.

So first, compute X's conjugate:

i → -i
-1 → -1 (since it's real)
2i → -2i

1 → 1
0 →0
1 →1

2i → -2i
-1→-1
-i→i

So the conjugate of X is:

Row 1: (-i, -1, -2i)
Row 2: (1, 0, 1)
Row 3: (-2i, -1, i)

Then, transpose this matrix. The transpose swaps rows and columns. So, the (1,1) element becomes (1,
