Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think this through. Alright, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm. So the number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/plx⁵. 

Wait, wait. Parallax and distance are related, right? I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Like, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Oh wait, but more accurately, plx in arcseconds is approximately 1/(distance in parsecs). So if a star is at distance r (I guess r is in parsecs here), then plx = 1/r.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting plx with 1/r gives N proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's calculate that. 1/(1/r^5) is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5? Wait, but wait, no, hold on. Let me double-check.

Wait, N ∝ 1/plx⁵. So plx is 1/r. So replacing plx gives N = k * (1 / (1/r)^5 ) = k * r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmm, so they want the number of stars per unit distance, perhaps?

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me read the question again. "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Hmm, so maybe they're asking about the number of stars per unit distance, like the density as a function of distance. Or perhaps the change in number as you go a certain distance. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r. So the number of stars between r and r + dr would be a function of r. Let me think about that. 

In astronomy, the number density of stars (like the number per unit volume) can be important. But in this case, the relation N
