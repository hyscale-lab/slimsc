Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, alright, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The given data is from FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, let's start with the FTIR. It shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Ester groups typically have strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that tells me the compound has an ester functional group. Ester is R-O-C-O-R', right? So the molecule probably has an ester substituent on the aromatic ring.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It says there are six signals. Wait, for a 6-membered aromatic ring, di-substituted, aromatic protons usually show up in certain patterns. The NMR mentions two signals for aromatic-H. That suggests symmetry. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, the two aromatic protons are equivalent, giving one signal. But since it's di-substituted, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstitution or some other arrangement that gives two sets of aromatic protons.

Wait, di-substituted aromatic rings can have different substitution patterns. If it's para, like 1,4, the aromatic Hs would be two doublets, perhaps. Or if it's ortho, like 1,2, then maybe more complex splitting. But in this case, two signals for aromatic-H. Let me think: if the substitution is para, the two Hs are equivalent, giving a single peak. But if it's another di-substitution, like 1,3 (meta), then perhaps two sets of Hs. Wait, di-substituted with substituents in 1 and 3 positions would have each substituent affecting adjacent Hs, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe there are two substituents, each with their own effect, leading to two distinct aromatic environments.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like phenyl groups with an ester substituent and another group. Wait, but the aromatic ring is the main structure, and it's di-substituted. So two substituents on the ring. One of them is the ester group, perhaps. Or maybe
