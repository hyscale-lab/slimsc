Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the resolution needed in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about X⁰ decaying into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime is given as tau_0 equals 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, what do I remember about this? I think it relates to the concept of particle lifetime and how it appears in the lab frame compared to the proper frame. Oh right, time dilation. Because particles moving at relativistic speeds will have their lifetimes appear longer in the lab frame. The longer the lifetime, the longer the path they can travel before decaying, which affects how well we can detect them.

So the key here is to calculate the length of the decay path, which depends on the gamma factor (Lorentz factor) of the particle. Once we have that, we can find the minimum resolution needed so that we can observe at least 30% of the decays.

The formula I recall is c multiplied by gamma multiplied by tau_0. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²), where E is the energy and m is the mass. Oh wait, but the units here are in GeV. Do I need to convert them into standard units? Let me see.

First, let me compute gamma. Gamma is E divided by the rest mass energy. So E is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41 times 8 is about 27.28. Oh, so 27 / 3.41 is approximately 7.917, so about 7.92.

Wait, but wait: the energy is given as 27 GeV. That’s the total energy, right? Because in relativity, the total energy E is gamma times m c squared. So yes, gamma is E/(m c²). Since the units are in GeV, and m is in GeV/c², the c² cancels out when you compute E/(m c²) because E is in GeV, m is GeV/c², so E/(m) is (GeV) / (GeV/c²) ) = c². Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I can just compute gamma as E/m. Since E includes all the energy, including rest mass, then gamma is E/(m c²) * c²? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let's think again. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is equal to E/(m c²), where E is the total energy. Because E = gamma m c². So yes, gamma is E/(m c²). But since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², let's compute it.

Wait, but actually, in natural units where c=1, E = gamma m. But since the problem gives m in GeV and E in GeV, it's possible that gamma is E/m. Let me think about it. Because if m is in GeV/c², then E is in GeV, so E/(m c²) would be (GeV )/( GeV/c² * c² ) ) = (GeV )/( GeV ) ) = 1. So perhaps in this case, when E is given in GeV and m is given in GeV/c², gamma is E/(m c²) = (E in GeV) / (m in GeV/c² * c²) ) which, since E and m have units that are GeV, the c² cancels. So gamma is E/(m c²) = (E in GeV) / (m in GeV/c²) * c²/ c²? Wait, perhaps I should just go with the calculation: gamma = E / (m c²). But since E and m are in units that may already account for c², perhaps I can simplify.

Alternatively, perhaps I can just ignore the units for a moment and compute gamma as E/m. Let me proceed with that.

So E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. So approximately 7.92.

Next, the lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma * tau_0. Tau_0 is 8e-16 seconds. So tau is 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that: 7.92 *8 is 63.36, so tau is 63.36e-16 s, which is 6.336e-15 seconds.

Wait, no. Wait, 7.92 *8 is 63.36, so 63.36e-16 s is 6.336e-15 s, right? Because 63.36e-16 is the same as 6.336e-15.

Now, the decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. That's c multiplied by tau. So L = c * tau.

What's the speed of light? Approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 6.336e-15 s. Let me compute that: 3e8 *6.336e-15 = (3 *6.336) * 1e-7. 3 *6.336 is about 19.008, so 19.008e-7 meters. Which is 1.9008e-6 meters.

Wait, but wait: 1e-7 is 1e-7 meters, which is 0.0
