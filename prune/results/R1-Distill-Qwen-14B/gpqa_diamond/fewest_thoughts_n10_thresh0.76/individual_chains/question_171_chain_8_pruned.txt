Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions, and I need to figure out the order of the substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer produced. Hmm, I remember that para-substitution is influenced by directing groups on the benzene ring. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question lists six substances, each with a benzene ring attached to a different substituent. The substituents are:

1) CH3 (methyl)
2) COOEt (ethoxy carbonyl)
3) Cl (chlorine)
4) NO2 (nitro)
5) C2H5 (ethyl)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

Each of these will undergo an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. I need to consider where the bromine addsâ€”ortho, meta, or para to each substituent.

So, the key is to determine the directing effect of each substituent. Remember, substituents can be activating (directing ortho/para) or deactivating (directing meta). Deactivating groups usually have a stronger effect than activating ones.

Let's list each substituent's directing effect and activating/deactivating nature:

1) CH3: Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So, it will direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. But wait, wait. Since it's ortho/para-directing but activating, it should favor substitution in those positions. But in a bromination reaction, the ring is activated, so the reaction occurs more readily.

2) COOEt: The ethoxy carbonyl group. I think esters are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Wait, or is it activating because of the oxygen? No, wait. The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group due to the carbonyl. So, it's deactivating and meta-directing. So, it directs electrophiles to the meta position.

3) Cl: Chlorine is a deactivating but ortho/para-directing group. Because Cl has lone pairs, it can donate electrons through resonance, making the ring more reactive at ortho and para positions, but the inductive effect (being electronegative) makes the ring less reactive overall. So, it's a weaker activating group than, say, methyl, but still ortho/para-directing. Wait, no, wait: actually, Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating, making the ring less reactive than benzene. So substitution is possible but in specific positions.

4) NO2: Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. It withdraws electrons through both inductive and resonance effects, so it directs incoming electrophiles to the meta positions.

5) C2H5: Ethyl is similar to methyl, an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So, it should direct the bromine to ortho and para positions.

6) COOH: Carboxylic acid group. The -COOH is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Because the carboxylic acid has a strong electron-withdrawing effect, it deactivates the ring and directs substitution to the meta positions.

Wait a second, but wait. Let me make sure about each substituent.

Methyl groups are activating (because they're EDG or activating) and ortho/para directors. So when bromine substitutes, it will go to ortho and para positions, leading to more para isomer if possible? Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, which has the highest tendency to form the para-substituted product.

Wait, but in cases where the substituent is a meta director, the para product is not formed. No, wait, no. The substituent directs incoming groups to certain positions. So for example, if the substituent is nitro (meta director), then the bromine adds in the meta position relative to nitro, which would be the para position relative to the substituent on the benzene ring? Wait
