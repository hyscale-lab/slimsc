Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can be tricky. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about finding the correct sequence of reactions starting from benzene to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps. I need to figure out which sequence of reactions will give the desired product with high yield.

First, I should draw the target molecule to visualize it. The molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the phenyl group has substituents at positions 3 and 5. The substituents are bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5. The ethanone part is a ketone attached to the benzene ring at position 1, I think. Wait, ethan-1-one would mean the ketone is on the first carbon of the ethyl group attached to the benzene. So the structure would be benzene with a ketone attached via a CH2 group, and on the benzene ring, there's a Br at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering can vary. Let me clarify. The substituents on the benzene ring are at positions 3 and 5 relative to where the ketone is attached. So the ketone is attached at position 1, then positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2) are across from each other with two positions in between. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that if the ketone is at position 1, then positions 3 and 5 would be the meta and para positions relative to each other, but that's getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the benzene ring has substituents in the 3 and 5 positions relative to each other, regardless of the ketone position.

Wait, the name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Oh wait, perhaps the phenyl group is attached to the ethanone. So the ethanone is (propan-2-one?), no, wait. The structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is -C(O)CH3. Because ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- as a substituent. So the benzene ring has a ketone group attached at position 1, and then at positions 3 and 5 (relative to that position) are Br and NO2 groups.

So the benzene has a ketone group (COCH3) at position 1, a Br at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5.

Wait, that's one possible arrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the 3 and 5 positions on the benzene ring, regardless of the ketone's position. So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone (COCH3) at position 1, Br at position 3, and nitro at position 5.

But wait, that would mean the substituents are in the meta and para positions relative to each
