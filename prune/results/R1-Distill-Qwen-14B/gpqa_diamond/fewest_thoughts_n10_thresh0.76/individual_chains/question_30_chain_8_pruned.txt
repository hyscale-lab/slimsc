Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry and light emission. Hmm, let's see. The question says a textile dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons and emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color it absorbs. The options are red, violet, blue, or yellow.

Wait, I remember something about conjugated systems and electron transitions. The conjugated pi bonds in a molecule can absorb certain wavelengths of light. When they absorb, the electrons jump from a lower energy level to a higher one. And the energy of that photon determines the color absorbed.

Oh right, the energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength. So higher energy means shorter wavelength, which is towards the violet end of the spectrum. Lower energy is longer wavelength, like red.

The question says the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. Wait, emission and absorption are related. If a substance emits light at a certain energy, that's usually because it absorbed a higher energy photon, then re-emits a lower energy one. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the energy of the emitted light is the difference between the two energy levels. So the molecule absorbed a photon with higher energy than the emitted. Because when it absorbs, it excites an electron to a higher energy state, and then when it relaxes, it emits a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted.

So the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed energy is higher than that. So which color has higher energy than 2.34 eV?

Wait
