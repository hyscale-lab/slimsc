Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about some organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes and rearranges them when heated or exposed to light. The product usually has the double bonds shifted.

The first part of the question is about reaction A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Wait, let me draw that structure. So, benzene ring attached to an OCH2 group. The OCH2 is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me break that down. But-2-en-1-yl means a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-, attached to the oxygen. Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH? No, wait, but the position. Butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but as an ene-1-yl group, it's CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2?), no. Let me think again. The group is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So but is four carbons. The double bond is between C2 and C3. So positions 1,2,3,4. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- but with a double bond. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Or is it CH2-CH2 with a double bond elsewhere? Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? Wait, no, but the substituent is but-2-en-
