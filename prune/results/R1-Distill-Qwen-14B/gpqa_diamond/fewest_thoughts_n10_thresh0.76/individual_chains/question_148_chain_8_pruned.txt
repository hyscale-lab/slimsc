Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these types of questions. But let's take it step by step. Let me read through the problem again and see what I can figure out.

So, the question is about five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. Hmm, binary compounds mean each compound has two elements. So Y and F. The compounds are A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. 

The first part says A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25Â°C) into A2 and fluorine gas. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Wait, so A1 is an oxidizing agent because it can oxidize xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, which usually doesn't react, so A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent.

Then, A3 can also interact with xenon. So A3 is another oxidizing agent perhaps, but maybe not as strong as A1 if it needs to react under different conditions. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y with fluorine. So Y plus F2 gives A3. That suggests A3 is the most fluorinated compound, maybe the highest oxidation state of Y?

Next, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. In water, A5 decomposes into two substances. So when A5 is in water, it breaks down into two products. Also, the solution of A4 is colorless and concentrated.

I need to find the molecular weight range of A4. The options given are ranges: 140-160, 220-240, 160-180, 110-130.

Let me think about possible elements Y. Since we're dealing with fluorine compounds, Y could be a halogen, but more likely another element that forms multiple fluorides. Let's think about elements that form several binary fluorides. For example, chlorine has many, but wait, the problem says Y forms compounds with fluorine, so Y is another element besides F.

Wait, maybe Y is oxygen? No, oxygen and fluorine form OF2 and OF, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something like iodine? Iodine forms IF5, IF7, etc. Or maybe Y is nitrogen? No, nitrogen's fluorides are less common.

Wait, another thought: Xenon is a noble gas, and it's being oxidized by A1. So A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, but if A1 is a compound, perhaps it's a fluoride with high oxidation state of Y. For example, ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent, but that's chlorine. Alternatively, maybe Y is chlorine? Let me think.

Wait, in the context of fluorine compounds, another possibility is that Y is oxygen. But then the compounds would be OxFy. Hmm, but OxF compounds are less common. Alternatively, perhaps Y is iodine. Let's think: Iodine can form IF5 and IF7.

Wait, but let's go back to the reaction where Y is added to A4 to form A5. A4 is a solution, colorless and concentrated. The process involves Y in a 1:1 molar ratio. The resulting A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So maybe A5 is a salt, and when it dissolves in water, it dissociates into ions.

Wait, another angle: The compounds A1 through A5 are all binary fluorides of Y. So each has Y and F. Let me list possible binary fluorides.

Wait, when Y is added to A4, which is a concentrated solution, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. If A4 is a fluoride salt, adding Y might precipitate or form another compound.

Let me think about the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. So, the reaction is A1
