Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I remember Grubbs is involved in some kind of olefin metathesis reaction. But wait, what's metathesis again? Oh right, it's a reaction where the positions of substituents in a carbon-carbon double bond are exchanged. It can be either ring-opening or ring-closing, but since the starting material is an alkene, I think it's about breaking and reforming the double bond.

So, the starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene has a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So, the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH₂CH3? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH2CH2CH2? No, wait, but the formula is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the chain is five carbons long, with a double bond between C1 and C2. The substituent is a methyl group on C3. So, the structure should be CH₂=CH–CH(CH3)–CH₂–CH3. Wait, wait, let me count again. Carbon 1: CH₂=, carbon 2: CH–, carbon 3: CH(CH3), then two more carbons? Wait, wait that can't be right. Let's see: the formula is C5H10. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is (CH₂)₂CH–CH₂–CH3? No, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try again. The general formula for pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So, adding a methyl group on carbon 3 would change that. So, carbon 3 is CH(CH3), so the structure is CH₂=CH–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3? Wait, no, that's six carbons. Wait, wait wait. No, pent means five carbons. So, pent-1-ene: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So 3-methyl would be on the
