Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and honestly, it's a bit confusing, but I'll try to break it down step by step. I remember that these problems usually involve a series of reactions, and each step changes the molecule in a specific way. The question is about finding the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, which is product 4.

Let me start by reading the question carefully. The first part says that 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. 

Wait, so the starting material is a bicyclo compound with a tert-butoxy group. The other reagent is a cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups. Sodium iodide is present, which makes me think of a possible elimination or substitution reaction. Oh right, when you have a dibromide, NaI can cause a substitution. Maybe it's a coupling reaction?

Hmm, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction. The first molecule has a diene structure (bicyclo with 2,5-diene), so that could be the diene part. The other molecule is a dienophile, since it's a cyclohexadiene with substituents. Wait, wait, the other molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the 5 and 6 positions has a dibromomethyl group.

Wait, but how does that work? So for each of those positions, there's a -CH2Br group attached. So maybe during the reaction, the Diels-Alder occurs, and the dienophile is the cyclohexadiene with the substituents. But why two equivalents? Maybe the diene is adding to each of the two dienophiles, forming two new rings.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a coupling via elimination. The dibromomethyl groups could undergo dehydrohalogenation to form double bonds. Wait, but sodium iodide is a good nucleophile. Maybe it's a substitution where the iodide replaces the bromide on the methyl groups.

Wait, another thought: the
