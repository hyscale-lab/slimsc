Alright, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, okay, let's see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting zero. 

Alright, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, I think that's in vector notation. So, the state vector is a column vector with those three components. 

The observable P is a matrix operator. The matrix is given with three rows. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. The second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]. And the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. 

I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So, to find the probability of getting a specific eigenvalue, like zero here, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to zero and then compute the projection of the state vector onto that eigenvector.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should first find the eigenvalues of P because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues. Let me try that. 

The matrix P is 3x3. Let me write it out:

P = [[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
     [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
     [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]]

Hmm, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me construct the matrix (P - λI). The diagonal elements will be -λ, 0-λ, 0-λ. So,

-λ      1/sqrt(2)        0
1/sqrt(2)  -λ         1/sqrt(2)
0        1/sqrt(2)     -λ

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The (1,1) element is 0 - λ, so it's -λ. Similarly, the other diagonal elements are the same. So the matrix becomes:

| -λ    1/√2       0   |
| 1/√2  -λ      1/√2  |
| 0     1/√2    -λ    |

Now, the determinant of this matrix should be zero. Let's compute the determinant.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be found using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I can guess that P is a symmetric matrix, so maybe it has some symmetric eigenvectors, which might make calculation easier.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix has a pattern that allows for easier eigenvalue calculation. Let me think about the structure. The matrix P has a sort of ring structure. The diagonal is -λ, and the off-diagonal elements alternate between 1/sqrt(2) and 0.

Wait, maybe it's helpful to consider that this matrix is similar to the adjacency matrix of a graph, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find eigenvectors by assuming some symmetry. Let me consider if there's a symmetric eigenvector where all the components are the same. Let's say the eigenvector is [a; a; a]. Then, when I multiply P by this vector, what do I get?

Wait, let's compute P multiplied by [a; a; a]:

First component: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2))*a + 0*a = a/sqrt(2)
Second component: (1/sqrt(2))*a + 0*a + (1/sqrt(2))*a = (2a)/sqrt(2) = a*sqrt(2)
Third component: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2))*a + 0*a = a/sqrt(2)

So, P * [a; a; a] = [a/sqrt(2); a*sqrt(2); a/sqrt(2) ]

Hmm, for this to be equal to λ * [a; a; a], each component must satisfy:

a/sqrt(2) = λ a
a*sqrt(2) = λ a
a/sqrt(2) = λ a

From the first equation: (1/sqrt(2) - λ) a =0. For a ≠ 0, λ = 1/sqrt(2)
From the second equation: sqrt(2) - λ =0 → λ = sqrt(2)
But 1/sqrt(2) is about 0.707, while sqrt(2) is about 1.414. They're not equal, so this eigenvector assumption doesn't work. So that approach didn't find an eigenvalue. Maybe I should try another approach.

Another approach: perhaps using the fact that P is a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable with orthogonal eigenvectors. But perhaps there's a simpler way.

Wait, let me think about the trace and determinant. The trace of P is 0, because all the diagonal elements are zero. The trace is equal to the sum of eigenvalues. So sum of eigenvalues is zero.

The determinant of P is the product of eigenvalues. Let me compute the determinant of P.

Wait, but actually, when solving for the eigenvalues, the determinant of (P - λ I) is zero. So perhaps it's better to compute the determinant of that matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by noting that the matrix P is a specific form. Let me try to compute the determinant.

The matrix is:

Row 1: -λ, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, -λ

Let's compute the determinant using expansion by minors or other methods.

Expanding along the first row:

-λ * det([-λ, 1/√2; 1/√2, -λ]) 
- (1/√2) * det([1/√2, 1/√2; 0, -λ])
+ 0 * det(...)

So, first term: -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] = -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)*0 ) ] = - (1/√2) * [ (-λ/√2) ) ] = - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2 ) = ( λ ) / 2 

Third term is zero.

So the determinant is:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 

Set this equal to zero:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) =0

Let me factor out λ:

λ [ - (λ² - 1/2) + 1/2 ] = 0

Wait, let's compute:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) =0 → 

= -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ 

So, the
