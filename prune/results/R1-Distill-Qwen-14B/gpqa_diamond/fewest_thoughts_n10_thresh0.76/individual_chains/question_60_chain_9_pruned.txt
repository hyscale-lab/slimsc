Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem, and honestly, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again.

So, there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They have a super fast spacecraft traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 years, but the astronaut is 22 years old. The question is, how long will the trip take from the astronaut's perspective? And the options are whether they die before reaching Earth, or it takes about 72, 81, or 77 years.

Hmm. I think this has to do with special relativity, specifically time dilation. Because when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time passes differently for the traveler compared to someone observing from Earth.

Wait, from the astronaut's perspective, the trip time is shorter because of length contraction. Or wait, no, the other way around. Let me think. So, the Earth is a certain distance away, but from the astronaut's frame, the distance would be contracted, so the time taken would be less.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact setup. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I remember that the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Let me double-check that. Yeah, I think that's correct. So the distance is approximately 163,000 light-years.

But wait, the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c. That's really, really close to the speed of light. So from Earth's frame, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. Let's calculate that.

Time from Earth's perspective: t_earth = distance / speed = 163,000 ly / (0.99999987 * c). Since one light-year per year is c, so 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ about 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ approximately
