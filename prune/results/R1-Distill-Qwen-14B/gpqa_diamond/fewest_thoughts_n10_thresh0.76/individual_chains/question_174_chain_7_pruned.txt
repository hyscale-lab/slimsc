Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

So the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Oh wait, and I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the one calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Alright, let's break it down.

First, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions so that their momenta cancel each other out. So, their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me assign variables. Let the rest masses of the two fragments be m1 and m2. Let's say m2 is twice m1, so m2 = 2 m1. The sum m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Substituting m2 gives m1 + 2 m1 = 3 m1 = 0.99 M → m1 = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M. So m1 is approximately 0.33 M, m2 is 0.66 M.

Wait, but wait—does that mean the rest masses are 0.33 M and 0.66 M? Because the sum is 99% of M, which is 0.99 M. So yes, that makes sense.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total energy is just its rest energy, 300 GeV.

After fission, each fragment has its rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. So the total energy after fission is the sum of their rest energies plus their kinetic energies.

But wait, because the nucleus is initially at rest, the total energy after fission must equal the initial energy (conservation of energy). So the sum of the rest energies of the fragments plus their kinetic energies must equal 300 GeV.

Wait, but
