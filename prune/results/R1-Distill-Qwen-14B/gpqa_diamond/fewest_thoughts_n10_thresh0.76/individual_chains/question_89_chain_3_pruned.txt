Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and ending with an NMR analysis of product 3.

First, the initial reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane means the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Oh wait, no, wait, wait. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two non-adjacent carbons? Or maybe adjacent?

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected in a way that each carbon is bonded to three others. Wait, no, each carbon in a diamond structure is tetrahedral, but in adamantane, it's more like a diamondoid framework of cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on carbons that are three bonds apart? Or maybe adjacent?

Wait, maybe more accurately, in the adamantane structure, the positions 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbon atoms. Because when I think of the structure, each face of the adamantane has four equivalent positions, and the numbering might be such that 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbons. So, when you have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on a different carbon, and they are adjacent.

So when heated with KOH, which is a strong base, it should eliminate two molecules of HBr, forming a double bond. So the product 1 is likely a diene? Or wait, wait. Alternatively, wait, could it be forming an epoxide? Oh no, because KOH is a base, not an
