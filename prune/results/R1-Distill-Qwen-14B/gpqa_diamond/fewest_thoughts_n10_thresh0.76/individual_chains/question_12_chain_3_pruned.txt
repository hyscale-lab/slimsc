Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about the decay of a pion Pi(+): Pi(+) at rest decays into a muon mu(+) and a neutrino nu. They give the rest masses: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV, and... wait, neutrino rest mass is zero, right? Or is it negligible? I think for these kinds of problems, we usually assume neutrinos are massless, so their rest mass is zero.

So the decay equation is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since Pi is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to conserve momentum. That means their momenta p_mu and p_nu are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

I remember that in such decay processes, the energies and momenta can be found using conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total energy before decay is just its rest energy, which is m_pi c², so 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of mu and nu. Each particle's energy is the sum of their rest energy and kinetic energy, but for the neutrino, since rest mass is zero, its energy is just its kinetic energy (p c). The muon's energy would be sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) divided by c squared, I think. Wait, the units get a bit confusing here.

Let me outline the variables:

- m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²

Let me denote the kinetic energy of mu as KE_mu and that of nu as KE_nu. But wait, neutrino's kinetic energy is p_nu c, since its rest mass is zero. And since p_mu = p_nu in magnitude, let's say p = p_mu = p_nu.

Now, the total energy after decay is:

E_total = E_mu + E_nu
E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms where c=1 for simplicity. So units would be in MeV, masses in MeV/c², but with c=1, E in MeV.

So E_mu = sqrt( p² + m_mu² )
E_nu = p (since m_nu=0)

So total energy after decay is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu²) + p.

But the initial energy is m_pi, which is 139.6 MeV.

So,

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, that looks like an equation we can solve for p.

Let me let x = p. Then the equation is sqrt(x² + 105.7
