Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. It has a structure with a cyclohexene ring and some substituents. The (R) configuration is important, so I should pay attention to how the stereochemistry changes through each reaction.

The first reaction is with Pd/C under hydrogen. Oh right, that's hydrogenation. But wait, since it's a methanol solution, maybe it's a catalytic hydrogenation. I think limonene has a double bond, so this reaction probably adds hydrogen across the double bond. Limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, so maybe the double bond is in a ring. Hydrogenation would make it a single bond, leading to a saturated molecule. So, product 1 would be the hydrogenated limonene, which I think is called dihydrolimonene.

Wait, but how many equivalents of hydrogen are used? The problem says 1 equivalent is consumed. So, limonene has one double bond. So after hydrogenation, the product is the fully hydrogenated version, which would be dihydro-Limonene. But wait, limonene is a bicyclic structure, maybe with two rings. So the hydrogenation would saturate one of the rings, but which one?

Alternatively, limonene can have two double bonds. Wait, no, limonene is a bicyclic compound with one double bond. So hydrogenation would add H2 across that double bond, making it a single bond, resulting in a cyclohexane ring instead of cyclohexene.

So product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene, which would be the 'dihydro' version, but maybe it's actually a cyclohexane derivative. Let me think: the structure of limonene is (R)-5-methyl-2-(1-methylethenyl)-2-cyclohexen-1-ol? No, wait, no, limonene is actually a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene with a structure that's more like a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, but wait, no. Wait, no
