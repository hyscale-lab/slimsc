Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that's an odd state because the components are -1, 2, 1. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vector needs to be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components should equal 1. Let me check that real quick. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Adding them gives 6. Oh, so this state isn't normalized. Hmm, but maybe the problem assumes it's normalized, or perhaps I need to normalize it first. I'll keep that in mind.

The problem involves two observables, P and Q. Each has a corresponding matrix operator. The operator for P is given with specific elements. Let me write that down. The P matrix is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). That looks a bit like a symmetric matrix, which makes sense because observable operators are usually Hermitian.

The Q operator's matrix is given as diagonal: first row (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. That might make things easier because diagonal matrices are easy to work with.

The question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first and then Q. Wait, no, wait. It says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the order is measure P first, then measure Q. Or wait, no, the wording says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the order is P is measured first, and then Q. But the question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no, wait again. The wording says: "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So the P measurement gives 0, then the Q measurement gives -1. So I think I need to find the probability that when you measure P first, you get 0, then measure Q and get -1.

But wait, quantum mechanics has the concept that measuring one observable affects the state for the next measurement. So the state after measuring P will be the eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of P, right? Because when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable with the measured eigenvalue.

So the plan is: first, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P to find the possible outcomes when measuring P. Then
