Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a star's properties when it has and doesn't have dark spots. So, the star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted compared to when it is.

Hmm. So, the main points are: 

1. The star has spots, which cover 40% of its surface. Spots are cooler regions, I think, which causes the overall effective temperature to drop. So, without spots, it's 6000 K; with spots, it's 5500 K.

2. The ratio of Ti atoms in two levels decreases when the star has spots. So, when spots are present, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower than when they aren't. Wait, wait. The ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. So, the factor by which the ratio changes is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

The ratio depends on the temperature because the population of atoms in energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us how the population of different energy levels changes with temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Here, n_i is the number of atoms in level i, E_i is the energy of level i, g_i is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of level i, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

In this problem, the ratio is n1/n2. So, (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Wait, but I need to think about E1 and E2. Let's say level 1 is lower in energy than level 2, so E1 < E2. Then E1 - E2 is negative, so the exponent becomes positive. So, the ratio would be proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), which would be a value greater than 1.

But wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the temperature is lower (with spots, 5500K vs 6000K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Hmm. That makes sense because if the temperature decreases, the exponential factor becomes smaller. Because (E2 - E1)/(kT) becomes smaller as T decreases, so the exponent is smaller, so exp(smaller number) is smaller. So n1/n2 would be smaller when T is lower.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The ratio is n1/n2. So if the temperature decreases, the denominator (n2) would be larger relative to n1? Because when you have lower T, the population favors lower energy levels. So, n1 (lower energy) would be more populated than n2 (higher). So, n1/n2 increases? But the problem says the ratio decreases. Hmm, maybe I got the energy levels reversed.

Wait, perhaps level 2 is the lower energy level. Because in that case, if the ratio is n1/n2, and the transition is from level 2 to level 1 (since the wavelength is 1448 Ã…, which is in the near UV
