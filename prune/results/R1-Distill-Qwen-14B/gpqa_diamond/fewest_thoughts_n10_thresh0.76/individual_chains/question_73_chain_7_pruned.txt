Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we can't just use classical mechanics because the speeds are significant fractions of the speed of light. So, I think I'll need to use the relativistic formulas here.

First, I'll tackle the relative speed part. I recall that the relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction isn't simply the difference of their speeds. Because of the way relativity works, you can't just subtract their speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, there's the formula for adding velocities in special relativity. Wait, no, in this case, we're looking for the relative speed, so maybe it's similar to finding the relative velocity of one as seen from the other's frame.

The formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) between two objects moving at u and v in the same direction is (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait no, wait. Wait, wait. I think I might be mixing up the formulas. Let me think again. Oh wait, the formula for the velocity of one frame as seen from another is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). So if object A is moving at u and object B at v, the relative speed of A with respect to B would be that expression.

Wait, but in this case, both are moving in the same direction, right? So, let's say astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So if I want to find the speed of astronaut 1 as seen from astronaut 2's frame, I'll set u = 0.6c and v = 0.5c. So plugging into the formula, v_rel is (0.6c - 0.5c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²]. Let's compute that numerator and denominator.

The numerator is 0.1c.
