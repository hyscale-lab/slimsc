Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems, and I need to figure out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. So system_1 has a period P1 of 2 years, and system_2's period P2 is 1 year. Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, the periods are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. So for system_1, it's 2 years, and system_2 is 1 year. Oh right, so system_2's period is shorter.

Then there's radial velocity (RV) data. In system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. So the bigger star probably has the smaller velocity, since in a binary system, the more massive star moves less. So the first star has a velocity amplitude K1a =10, and the second K1b=5. Wait, but wait, in binary systems, the velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass. Because the center of mass has to balance the masses and velocities. So mass is inversely proportional to velocity. So a higher velocity means a lower mass.

Wait, the mass function is involved here. But wait, maybe I should think about the mass ratio. So the mass ratio q is the mass of the secondary divided by the mass of the primary. So q = M_secondary / M_primary.

But for the RV method, the velocity semi-amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. So if K1a is the velocity of star 1 in system 1, and K1b is velocity of star 2 in system 1. So K1a =10, K1b=5. So the mass ratio q1 would be M1b / M1a = K1a / K1b = 10/5 = 2. So M1b is twice M1a. So the primary is M1a, and the secondary is bigger.

Wait, but the mass of the system is M_total1 = M1a + M1b = M1a + 2*M1a = 3*M1a.

Similarly for system_2: their RV amplitudes are K2a=15 and K2b=10. So K2a is larger than K2b. So the mass ratio q2 is M2b / M2a = K2a / K2b =15/10= 1.5. So M2b is 1.5 times M2a. So the total mass is M_total2 = M2a + M2b = M2a + 1.5*M2a = 2.5 * M2a.

But wait, how does the period relate to the mass? Oh right, Kepler's third law for binary systems. The period squared is proportional to (M1 + M2) * (distance)^3 divided by (G * (M1 + M2)) ), wait no, Kepler's law is P² = (4π²/G(M1+M2)) ) * a³, where a is the separation between the two stars. Hmm, but I'm trying to relate the period to the mass.

Wait, but I think when you have the RV method, the mass function comes into play. The mass function allows you to find the mass of the companion. But since both stars are observed, perhaps I can get the actual masses.

Wait, but in the RV case, the velocity amplitudes K are related to the masses. Because the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star moves slower.

So the mass ratio q = M_secondary / M_primary = (K_primary) / (K_secondary). Because the product of mass and velocity must be equal for the two stars (since the center of mass doesn't move). So M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. So M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Wait, let me think again. Let me
