Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about nuclear physics, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the impulse approximation used in many-body nuclear calculations, particularly in interactions like electroweak. The approximation assumes that nucleons behave as free particles. I need to determine which of the four given assumptions jointly imply this.

The options are four statements (1,2,3,4), and the choices are combinations of them. The options are A, B, C, D, each including different subsets.

First, let me understand the impulse approximation. From what I remember, it's a model where each nucleon is treated as if it's moving independently, not considering the interactions with others except for a brief interaction. So, the idea is that each nucleon acts almost like a free particle, and the nucleus as a whole behaves transparently except for that single nucleon interacting.

So, the question is which assumptions lead to this approximation.

Looking at the four assumptions:

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
   - So, the force is acting on each nucleon separately, not collectively. This makes sense for the impulse approximation because it's treating each nucleon as a free one.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
   - I think this means that when a particle interacts with the nucleus, it only interacts with one nucleon and the rest of the nucleus doesn't affect it. So, the other nucleons are transparent, allowing the interaction to proceed as if the target is a single free nucleon. This supports the impulse approximation because it's only considering one interaction point.

3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
   - Hmm, this one is a bit confusing. Quarks are within the nucleon, and if they're non-relativistic, that might imply that their motion isn't too fast. But how does that tie into the impulse approximation? Wait, the impulse approximation is about the nucleon being treated as free, which probably assumes it's moving without much internal movement. If the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe the nucleon's structure is static or the internal motion doesn't affect the overall interaction. So, the nucleon is treated as a point particle, which aligns with the approximation.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.
   - So, the binding forces between nucleons are ignored. The selected nucleon acts as if it's free; it doesn't feel the nuclear force from its neighbors. That's a key part of the impulse approximation, because each nucleon is treated as if it's moving without being affected by others except for the brief interaction.

Now, which of these assumptions together imply the impulse approximation?

The impulse approximation requires that the nucleon interacts as if it's free. So, each nucleon is treated individually (statement 1), the nucleus is transparent except for that nucleon (statement 2), and the nucleon feels no binding forces (statement 4). So those are 1, 2, and 4. What about statement 3?

Statement 3 talks about internal quarks being non-relativistic. I'm not sure. The impulse approximation is more about the external interactions and treating the nucleon as a whole. If quarks are non-relativistic, perhaps it's a condition for the nucleon's structure being static, but I'm not certain if that's part of the impulse approximation.

Wait, let me think again. The impulse approximation assumes that during the interaction, the nucleon is moving so quickly that the internal details (like quark dynamics) don't matter. So maybe statement 3 is part of the assumptions because it's about the internal structure. Or is statement 3 irrelevant?

Alternatively, perhaps statement 3 is a condition to treat the nucleon as a point particle, which is necessary for the impulse approximation. Because if the quarks are relativistic, their internal dynamics might complicate things. So non-relativistic quarks would make
