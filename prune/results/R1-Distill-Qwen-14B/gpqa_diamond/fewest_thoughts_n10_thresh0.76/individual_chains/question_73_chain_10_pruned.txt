Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem gives me two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c in the positive x-direction. The other has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, also in the positive x-direction. Wait, does that mean they're moving in the same direction? Because if they are, then the relative speed wouldn't just be subtracting their velocities like in classical mechanics. Oh right, at relativistic speeds, I have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the relative speed of one with respect to the other. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction, then from B's frame, how fast is A moving? Or maybe from A's frame, how fast is B moving? Or perhaps since they're both moving in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference, but adjusted for relativity.

Oh yeah, the formula for relative velocity in relativity is different. The formula is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Right, so where u is the velocity of the object in the first frame, and v is the velocity of the second frame relative to the first. So, if I'm looking for the relative speed of A as seen from B, then u would be 0.6c (A's speed in the original frame), and v would be 0.5c (B's speed). Alternatively, maybe I should think of B as the frame, so u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. Let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, let's get the formula straight. The formula for velocity addition is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So if I want the speed of A relative to B, since both are moving in the same direction, from B's perspective, A is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c -0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 -0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7) c ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for the relative speed.

Now, the second part is about the total energy of the system. Hmm, total energy in relativity includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. Wait, or is it just the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut?

Wait, each astronaut's total energy is given by gamma * m c². So for each, I need to calculate gamma.

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 *3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 3 *1.1547 = 3.4641, yes.

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 m c² + 3.4641 m c² ≈ 5.9641 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2 and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem says the total energy of the system. Do I have to
