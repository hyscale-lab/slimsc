Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratios after the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino production, but let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production is mainly through the proton-proton (pp) chain. There are different branches in this chain. The pp-I branch is the main one, then pp-II and pp-III are minor, I think. The question specifies that the pp-III branch stops suddenly. So I need to figure out what effect that has on the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands.

Wait, what exactly does the pp-III branch produce? I recall that the pp chain produces helium-4, and along the way, it emits neutrinos. Specifically, the pp-I branch produces positron pairs and then goes on to make deuterium. The pp-II and pp-III branches might involve different reactions. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves a triple-alpha reaction? No, wait, triple-alpha is more about forming carbon in the CNO cycle, isn't it? Or wait, no, the pp chain stops at helium-4, while the CNO cycle is a different process. Maybe the pp-III branch produces different isotopes or contributes to different neutrino emission points.

Wait, the main neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos produced in the beta decay steps. The pp chain's main neutrino emission is from the reaction where a boron-8 captures an electron to become neutral boron-8 and emits a neutrino. Oh wait, no, that's the main source? Or is it from other steps. Let me get this straight. The pp chain produces Beryllium-7 which then captures a proton to become Boron-8, which then beta decays into Boron-8 to Carbon-8 (or something like that, not sure the exact isotopes), and in that decay, emits a neutrino. So the majority of solar neutrinos come from the Beryllium-7 -> Boron-8 -> ... chain, which is part of the pp-I branch. So if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, does that affect the production of these neutrinos?

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch produces a different type of neutrino. Wait, no, all the neutrinos from the Sun are electron neutrinos because the beta
