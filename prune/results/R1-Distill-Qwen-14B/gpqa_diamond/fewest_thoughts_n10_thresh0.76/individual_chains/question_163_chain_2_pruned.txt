Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. The goal is to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each giving a pH and a volume.

Hmm, first, I need to understand what's happening here. Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, which is a base. When it dissolves in a strong acid, it will react. The reaction should be a neutralization between a base and an acid. Since the acid is monobasic, it will donate one H+ ion, and Fe(OH)3 is a tribasic base, I think. Wait, no, actually, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Fe(OH)3 can lose three protons, so it's a triprotic base, right? So it can react with three H+ ions.

The reaction would be Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires three moles of H+.

First, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass given is 0.1 grams. Let me calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron is about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, hydrogen is 1. So Fe(OH)3 has a formula mass of 55.85 + (3*(16 + 1)) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol. Let me compute that: 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.0009359 mol. About 9.359e-4 moles.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+, the total H+ needed is 3 * 0.0009359 ≈ 0.0028077 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M, so the volume needed (V) can be found using moles = Molarity * Volume (L). Rearranging, Volume = moles / Molarity.

So V = 0.0028077 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028077 L, which is 28.077 cm³. Wait, but wait. The question asks for the minimum volume of acid needed. So that's about 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C gives 28.05 cm³, which is close. Option B is 30.09, which is higher. Option A is 32, which is way off. Option D is 20, which is less. So maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me double-check the reaction. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and can react with strong acid. The reaction is indeed 1:3. So I think that part is correct.

Wait another thing: the volume of the solution is 100 cm³. So the total solution after adding the acid will be 100 cm³. But wait, when you add the acid, you're adding some volume. So the final volume is 100 cm³, but the initial volume before adding the acid is 100 cm³
