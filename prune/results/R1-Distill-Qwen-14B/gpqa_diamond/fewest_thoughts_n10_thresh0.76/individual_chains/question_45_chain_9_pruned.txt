Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, alright, let's see what I remember. The question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical particles. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should recall that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n² * pi² * ħ²) / (2 m L²), right? Oh wait, the problem defines E as E = pi² ħ²/(2 m L²), so each energy level is E multiplied by n squared. So E_n = n² * E.

Now, these are identical spin-1/2 particles, so they are fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which means that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. But wait, in a 1D box, the quantum state is determined by the quantum number n and the spin. Since each particle is spin-1/2, each has two possible spin states: up and down.

So for each energy level n, we can have two particles with opposite spins. Because they're identical fermions, that's the maximum number allowed for each n.

Now, the problem is about four particles. So I need to figure out how these particles fill up the energy levels according to the Pauli exclusion principle.

Let's think about the ground state first. The ground state is the lowest possible energy configuration. The particles will fill the lowest energy levels possible, with two particles each (since each level can hold two due to spin).

So for four particles, how does this work?

Each energy level n can have two particles. So let's see:

- n=1: can hold 2 particles
- n=2: can hold 2 particles
- So for four particles, the first two levels are filled: n=1 and n=2, each with two particles.

Wait, but wait a second—that would be n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles), which gives 4 particles. So the ground state would have all four particles in the first two levels.

Wait, but in that case, the energies would be E_1 and E_2. Each with n=1 and n=
