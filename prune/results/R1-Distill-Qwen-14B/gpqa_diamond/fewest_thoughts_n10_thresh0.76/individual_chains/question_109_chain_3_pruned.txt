Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The intrinsic parity of X is -1. And Pauli statistics are involved, which relates to the quantum numbers.

Wait, the condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh right, T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So that's like a parity condition or something?

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to find which partial wave isn't allowed. The options give different transitions, each with a specific letter for the angular momentum state of X (like p, s, d, f).

Let me break this down. The initial state is 1S0. So according to the term symbol notation (2S+1)L(J), 1S0 would be (2*0+1)S0, which is 1S0. That means the total spin S is 0, the orbital angular momentum L is 0 (since S denotes the orbital?), wait noâ€” wait, wait. No, the term symbol notation is (2S+1)LJ. So for 1S0, S is 0, L is 0 (since it's S orbital), and J is 0. Wait, but wait, the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. So the total angular momentum is zero.

When they emit a particle X, the system goes into some state. The options are like 7D1, 3S1, etc. So the final NN state must have certain quantum numbers.

But wait, the problem says Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So that equation is mod 2, so it's about parity, perhaps.

Wait, intrinsic parity of X is -1. So when X is emitted, it contributes to the total parity. Also, parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So the overall parity of the system must be conserved if we're considering strong interactions, but perhaps here it's about the process's parity.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think step by step.

1. The initial state is 1S0. So S=0, L=0, J=0. So the initial parity is (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1. Because parity is (-1)^L for orbital angular momentum.

2. When the NN emits a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is -1. The total parity after emission would be the product of the parity of the NN system and X's parity.

Wait, but parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So the initial parity is +1, and the final state's parity would be (parity of NN state) * (parity of X) times any change due to orbital angular momentum. Wait, no. Because when a particle is emitted,
