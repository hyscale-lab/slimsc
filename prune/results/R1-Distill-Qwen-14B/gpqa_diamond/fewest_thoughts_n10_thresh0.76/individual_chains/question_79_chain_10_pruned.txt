Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again and think through each step.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction it undergoes and the resulting NMR spectra. The starting material is Compound X (C11H12O), which reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to determine what X is from the options provided.

First, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base, often used in the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides. Wait, but waitâ€”no, actually, in some cases, it can be a base that deprotonates things. Hmm, but wait, in the context of epoxides, when you have a base like this, it's often used to open epoxides via a ring-opening reaction. Oh right, the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the epoxide, making the ring open as the oxygen attacks a nearby electrophilic site. But wait, in this case, the reaction is probably an epoxide ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction, but I think the most common reaction is epoxide ring-opening with a base.

Wait, but wait. The product's NMR is given. So, what's the product? If X is an epoxide, and we're opening it with a base, perhaps it's forming something else. Or maybe the reaction is something else, like a rearrangement or elimination. Hmm.

Wait, the compound X is C11H12O. Let's look at the options. All the options are epoxides because they have "oxirane" in their names. So X is an epoxide, and the reaction is with a base, likely leading to ring-opening. Or perhaps the reaction is an elimination or some other process.

Wait, but the product's NMR data is given. So if X is an epoxide, and the reaction opens the epoxide, the product would have a structure with an adjacent diol or something else. But looking at the NMR data, let me try to analyze it.
