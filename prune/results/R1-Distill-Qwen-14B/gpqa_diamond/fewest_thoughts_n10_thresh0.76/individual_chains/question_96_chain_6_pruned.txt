Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with black hole thermodynamics, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the entropy of a supermassive black hole. The given information is the angular size of its event horizon and the distance to the galaxy. The options are all in the order of magnitude, so I don't need exact calculations, just the right ballpark.

First, what do I remember about black holes and entropy? Oh right, there's the Bekenstein-Hawking formula which says that the entropy (S) of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, c is speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is gravitational constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant.

So my first task is to find the area of the event horizon. The event horizon is a sphere, so the area is 4πr², where r is the Schwarzschild radius. But wait, I don't have r directly. Hmm.

Wait, the problem gives the angular size θ. Angular size relates to the actual size through the distance. The formula for angular size is θ ≈ s / d, where s is the size (like diameter) and d is the distance. Oh wait, no, I think the exact formula uses the small angle approximation: θ (in radians) ≈ s / d. But since θ is given in degrees and is very small, maybe I can convert it to radians first.

So let's calculate the diameter of the event horizon. The given θ is 1e-17 degrees. Let's convert that to radians. I remember that 180 degrees is π radians, so 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 1e-17 * (π / 180). That's approximately 1.745e-19 radians.

Then, the actual size (s) is θ * d. But wait, s would be the diameter of the event horizon? Or the radius? Wait, the formula for the area is 4π r², but if θ is the angular diameter, then s is the actual diameter. Because when you observe a distant object,
