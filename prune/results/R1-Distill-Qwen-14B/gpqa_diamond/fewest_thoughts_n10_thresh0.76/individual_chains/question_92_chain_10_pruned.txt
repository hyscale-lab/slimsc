Okay, so I need to calculate the enthalpy of formation of this organic compound. Hmm, the formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down.

Wait, the problem provides bond energies for various bonds. Enthalpy of formation usually involves using bond energies to calculate the heat change when forming the molecule from its elements. Right, the general formula is Î”Hf = [sum of bond energies in reactants] - [sum of bond energies in products].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, when you form a molecule from its elements, you're breaking bonds in the elements and forming bonds in the compound. So the enthalpy of formation is calculated as the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (elements) minus the sum of the bond energies of the product's bonds.

But wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for example, for a hydrocarbon, the elements are H2 and O2 (if it's a hydrocarbon), but wait, in this case, the compound is made of carbon and hydrogen. So the elements are H2 and C (though carbon is typically in graphite or diamond form, but the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization for carbon, which I think is the energy needed to break all bonds in carbon to make it into atoms).

The given
