Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology and genetics. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The setup involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector, which I think means it has two genes under a single promoter but with internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) or something similar. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. 

The vector has the ligand ORF (open reading frame) at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop cassette with loxP. Then, the receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus. The receptor has a stop cassette with lox2272.

They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested the construct expression via Western blot. So, they probably transfected primary astrocytes and checked if the proteins are expressed. The total proteins showed a signal proportional to actin, which is a loading control, so that's fine.

Then, they made a mouse model that's homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. After the offspring are born, they look under a confocal microscope for fluorescence. But they don't see a green signal. So, the eGFP isn't lighting up.

Hmm. So, the eGFP is supposed to be expressed when the receptor is expressed, right? The question is why there's no green signal.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the setup is about expression in neural crest cells. I'm not sure how this would affect the Western blot or the GFP expression. Maybe if they're secreted and acting elsewhere, but the question is about expression in the mouse model. Maybe not the main issue here.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. So, the protein is made but not transported to the cell surface. Would that prevent detection? Well, in Western blot, the antibody would still detect the protein whether it's in the ER, Golgi, or on the surface. But in the confocal, if it's stuck in Golgi, maybe it doesn't get to the cell surface, so you don't see fluorescence. But the Western blot showed expression, so maybe this isn't the issue. Wait, but the Western blot uses total proteins, so it would detect regardless of where it is. So if it's stuck in the Golgi, the Western would still show a band. So the issue is why the eGFP isn't visible under the microscope. If it's not on the cell surface, you wouldn't see it. But why would it be stuck? Maybe because of a stop cassette? Or perhaps the IRES isn't working.

Option C: The enhancer for expression is missing. If the ligand and receptor have an enhancer, but it's missing, then they wouldn't be expressed. But the vector uses the CBA promoter for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. CBA is a strong promoter, so maybe that's not the issue. Unless the enhancer is required for tissue-specific expression. But the experiment was done in primary astrocytes, and the Western blot showed expression. So in the transfected cells, the proteins were expressed. So perhaps in the mouse construct, the enhancer isn't present. Wait, the question says the ligand is under CBA promoter. So maybe the CBA is a strong constitutive promoter, so expression shouldn't be a problem. Unless the mouse model lacks the necessary regulatory elements. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, right! The stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. So, when Cre is present, it recombines the lox sites, removing the stop cassettes. So for the ligand and mCherry, the stop has loxP. For the receptor and eGFP, the stop is lox2272.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, meaning two ORFs. The first ORF is ligand (CBA promoter) with a stop cassette, then the receptor is under IRES, which doesn't have a promoter, so it's part of the same transcriptional unit. When Cre is present, the lox sites are recombined, removing the stops. So the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP.

But in the mouse, they have the construct in the genome. They crossed with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, I think. Cre would recombine the lox sites. So, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed as a fusion, and the receptor and eGFP as another fusion. 

Wait, but the detection is for eGFP. If the stop is removed, the receptor should be expressed with eGFP. But if the frames are not correct, maybe the eGFP is not being expressed. So, if the stop is removed, but the ORF isn't correctly in frame, the eGFP might not be produced. Or perhaps the receptor ORF is in a different reading frame, making it not functional. 

Wait, the vector is designed so that when the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed with eGFP. So the
