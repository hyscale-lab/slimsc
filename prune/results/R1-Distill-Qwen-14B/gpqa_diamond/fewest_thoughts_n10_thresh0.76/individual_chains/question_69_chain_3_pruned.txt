Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. The decay is given as X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. So the lifetime we observe, the dilated one, depends on the particle's speed relative to the lab frame. Right, because of time dilation from special relativity.

I remember that the lifetime observed τ is γ times τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. And γ is given by the total energy divided by the rest mass. So γ = E / m. Oh wait, E is the total energy here. So in this case, E is 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV.

Let me compute γ first. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, because 3*7=21, 0.41*7=2.87, so 23.87. 27 minus 23.87 is about 3.13. So 3.13 /3.41 is approximately 0.917. So γ is roughly 7.917. Wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate that more accurately.

Wait 3.41 multiplied by 7 is 23.87, as I thought. So 7 times 3.41 is 23.87. Then 27 - 23.87 is 3.13. So 3.13 divided by 3.41 is approximately 0.917. So 7 + 0.917 is about 7.917. So γ ≈7.917.

So the observed lifetime τ is γ τ₀. So τ =
