Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question gives a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and we're supposed to figure out what the compound is, then determine the product after a series of reactions.

First, let me look at the NMR data. The peaks are:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, okay. Let's try to interpret this. The 9.72 ppm triplet is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm as a strong deshielded peak. But wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde group.

Looking at the other peaks. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm doublets each integrating to 2H. Those could be aromatic protons. Maybe it's a para-substituted benzene ring because the doublets are for two protons each. Like, for example, if there's a substituent on the benzene, and the protons are adjacent to it.

Then there's the 6.27 ppm broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad singlet... Maybe those are protons on an oxygen-containing group, like an enol or something with an -OH group? Or perhaps they're part of a conjugated system with something else, like an enol ether or an enamine.

Wait, wait. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, two benzene rings (each with 3 degrees) plus another double bond or ring, but wait 2 benzene rings would be 6 degrees, which is more than 5. So that's not possible. So maybe one benzene ring (3 degrees) and a double bond and a ring, but wait, let me think.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Let me count: 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen.

Another approach: maybe a benzene ring (C6H5) and a substituent group. So the substituent would be C2H4NO. Let's see: C2H4NO.

Wait, but the substituent could be something like CH2-O-CH2 or similar. Hmm, but the substituent might have a double bond or ring.

Looking at the NMR, the triplet at 9.72 ppm is likely an aldehyde proton,
