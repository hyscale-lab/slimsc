Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution from my studies. Let me think this through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The excitation of a particular energy level depends exponentially on the temperature of the star. 

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, that's interesting. So the energy difference ΔE = k * T * ln(N2/N1), maybe? Or wait, the Boltzmann distribution formula is N2/N1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), right?

Wait, actually, the ratio of populations is given by the Boltzmann factor. So if star_1 has twice as excited as star_2 for a given energy level, that means the population of the excited state in star_1 is higher than in star_2. Let me define the ratio N1/N2 (or maybe it's the other way around).

Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So the number of excited atoms in star_1 is double that of star_2. So the ratio (N1/N2) = 2, where N1 is the number in star_1 and N2 in star_2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So maybe it's the excitation level, meaning the number of atoms in that specific energy level. So if the energy levels are E1 and E2 for the two stars, but wait, the energy difference is given as ΔE. 

So for each star, the excited state is a certain level above the ground state. But the energy difference between the considered energy levels is the same for both stars, right? So ΔE is the same for both, but the excitation levels depend on their temperatures.

So the Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. So for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state is given by N_upper / N_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where T is the temperature.

Wait, but in star_1, the number is twice as much. So let's think: for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for star_1, the ratio is N1_upper / N1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, it's N2_upper / N2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

But the question says that the excitation is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. So N1_upper = 2 * N2_upper? Or is
