Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about gene interactions in white lupine related to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The setup is that there are three genes: G1, G2, and G3. Each has a knockout mutant (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants. The experiment tests their resistance to the pathogen. The control has 100% resistance. The mutants have varying levels—g1 is 75%, g2 is 0%, g3 is 50%, and the doubles are 10% (g1g3), 0% (g2g3, g1g2). 

The question is about the interaction between these genes. The options involve terms like transcription factor, pleiotropy, epistasis, and gene redundancy. 

First, I remember that a transcription factor is a gene that regulates the expression of other genes. So if a gene is a transcription factor, its knockout would affect other genes downstream. So if a transcription factor is knocked out, the function of the downstream genes would be compromised.

Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if gene A is epistatic over gene B, the phenotype of a double mutant (A and B) would be the same as the mutant with A alone. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. Epistasis is about how one gene's pathway affects the expression of another. If a mutation in gene A masks the phenotype of gene B, then A is epistatic to B. Like, if you have a double mutant A and B, the phenotype is the same as A alone. Because A is upstream, perhaps.

Pleiotropy refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits. But in this case, the question is about interactions between genes related to the same trait—resistance.

Gene redundancy is when two genes have overlapping functions, such that knocking out both doesn't have a more severe effect than knocking out one alone. Wait, no. If two genes have redundant functions, a double knockout would have a more severe phenotype than either single knockout. For example, if each gene contributes to the same function, losing both would make the function impossible.

So looking at the data:

Control: 100% resistance.

g1: 75% → less resistance than control. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance. Not completely, so maybe G1 is involved but not the only factor.

g2: 0% → completely resistant. So G2 is critical. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for resistance. Without G2, the resistance is lost.

g3: 50% → so G3 contributes but it's not as critical as G2.

Now the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is same as when only G2 is knocked out. So perhaps G1 is downstream of G2. Because without G2, G1 might not function anyway. Alternatively, G2 could be upstream of G1. If G2 is a transcription factor for G1, then knocking out G2 would prevent G1 from being expressed. So in that case, the double mutant (g1g2) would be same as g2.

g1g3: 10% → this is lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So combining G1 and G3 knockouts makes it worse than either alone. Hmm, that's interesting. If the effect is additive, but 10% is less than 50% and 75%, perhaps the two genes contribute to the same pathway or are in different pathways.

g2g3: 0% → same as g2. So when both
