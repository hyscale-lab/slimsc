Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that an unknown compound was prepared, and two characterization techniques were used: FTIR and 1H NMR. The IR shows a very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. The NMR shows several signals, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Two specific signals in the NMR are a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one it is.

First, I'll break down the IR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. If it's very broad, that's more characteristic of a carboxylic acid because the O-H in carboxylic acids is more acidic and has stronger hydrogen bonding, leading to a broader peak. The sharp peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is likely a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. But since the broad peak suggests a carboxylic acid, the compound probably has a -COOH group.

Looking at the options, all of them end with COOH. So, all are carboxylic acids. That makes sense.

Now, the NMR part. The question states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So, the compound doesn't have any double bonds, meaning it's a single bond structure—probably a saturated compound. So, no alkenes, which fits with the IR data as well, since 1700 cm⁻¹ could be a ketone or possibly an ester, but in this case, since it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is from the COOH group.

Wait, but wait—the strong IR peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ could be the carbonyl (C=O) of the carboxylic acid. Typically, carboxylic acids have their carbonyl around 1700 cm⁻¹, but it can vary. So that fits. The broad peak at 3000 is the O-H stretch.

Now, looking at the NMR signals. The problem states that several signals are present, but none are vinyl. So, the structure must be free of double bonds, which all options here seem to have because their structures are based on branching with single bonds.

The specific splitting patterns: one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's a bit complex, so I need to think about what kind of coupling that would result from.

In NMR, the splitting (or multiplicity) arises from neighboring (adjacent) protons. So, each neighboring set of H's splits the signal into a certain number of peaks. For example, a triplet comes from two adjacent H's (like a CH2 group next to a CH3), splitting each peak into two, then each of those into three, etc.

Let me look at the structures of the options to figure out which one would have such complex splitting patterns.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Breaking that down: The molecule is a carboxylic acid with a CH2 group attached to the COOH. Then, the main chain is probably something like CH3-C(C2H5)-C(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. Wait, no, perhaps it's more like CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the central part is a geminal di-substituted group, perhaps.

Wait, each of those C(H)(substituent) groups would have two substituents attached to the same carbon. So the structure is something like:

CH2(COOH) is at the end, then CH(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)- etc. Hmm, maybe it's better to draw it out mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the central carbons has two substituents besides the CH groups. Let me think about the structure.

Looking at the formula for each option:

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH

Wait, no. The formula is written as CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So, the structure is:

The
