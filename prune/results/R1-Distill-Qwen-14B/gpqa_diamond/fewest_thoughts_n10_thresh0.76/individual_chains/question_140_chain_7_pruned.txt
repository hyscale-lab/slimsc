Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Hmm, the question is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are numbers, so probably adding two atomic masses together.

Let me break down each part.

First, thinking about the reaction. X reacts with Y, a liquid, and releases gas W. W's molecule has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. Wait, for a molecule, each atom contributes. But wait, maybe W is a diatomic molecule. Let me think: if W is a molecule where the total protons equal the total neutrons. Let's say W is H2O? No, hydrogen has 1 proton, oxygen 8. So each H contributes 1 proton, each O contributes 8. So in H2O, protons would be 2, neutrons would be 8 (since O has 8 neutrons if it's ^16O). No, 2 !=8. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe W is NH3? No, that's a molecule but not sure. Wait, maybe W is H2? Because each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. No, that's not equal. Wait, maybe CO2? CO2 has 22 protons (C has 6, O has 8 each, so 6 + 2*8 = 22). Neutrons: C is 6 neutrons (if ^12C), each O has 8, so 6 + 2*8=22. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. Oh! So the molecule has 22 of each. So W could be CO2, which is a gas. So the gas is CO2?

Wait, but the reaction
