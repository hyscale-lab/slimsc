Okay, so I have this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. Then there are two parts, A and B. Part A asks which compound does not show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

The compounds given are benzoquinone, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, and dimethyl fumarate.

First, let me tackle part A: which of the two compounds (benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) does not show tautomerism.

Tautomerism occurs when a proton moves between two atoms, resulting in the conversion of one functional group into another. Common examples are in carbonyl-containing compounds, like ketones and aldehydes, which can tautomerize to enols or enol ethers, or in cases where a carbonyl group can become an enamine or something similar.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, no, benzoquinone is actually a benzene ring with two ketone groups. But wait, no. Wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two adjacent ketone oxygens. Wait, no, actually, benzoquinone has a ring where two of the carbons are double-bonded to oxygen. So it's a cyclic di-ketone. Its structure is O=C6H4=O, but in a benzene ring.

Wait, no. Alternatively, benzoquinone could have a structure where the ring is fully conjugated, with two oxygens in the ring. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone is a diketone with benzene rings. Anyway, I should focus on whether it can tautomerize.

Tautomerism usually requires adjacent H and O or similar, like in enols and enol ethers. Alternatively, in quinones, which are cyclic ketones, maybe they can tautomerize. Wait, quinones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. For example, cyclohexanone can
