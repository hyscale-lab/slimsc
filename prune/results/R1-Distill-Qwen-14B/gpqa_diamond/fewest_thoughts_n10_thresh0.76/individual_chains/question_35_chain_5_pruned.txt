Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The problem says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator given by c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/(4π). And S has rows (0, -i) and (i, 0). So first, I need to write down what Ay looks like.

So, S is a 2x2 matrix:
Row 1: 0   -i
Row 2: i   0

Multiply that by c. Since c is h/(4π), the matrix Ay becomes:
Row 1: 0    c*(-i)
Row 2: c*i  0

Which simplifies to:
[ [0, -i c],
  [i c, 0] ]

Substituting c = h/(4π), so:
[ [0, -i h/(4π)],
  [i h/(4π), 0] ]

Wait, but S is the spin operator matrix. Oh wait, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices are involved. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. S is probably proportional to the Pauli matrices. Let me think, S here seems like it's the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by some factor.

Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

Which matches exactly with S. Oh, so S here is the Pauli Y matrix, which is usually written as σy. So S = σy.

So Ay = c * σy. And c is h/(4π).

But wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Since ħ is h/(2π), so let me see. The eigenvalues for σy would be ±1, right? Because σy is a Hermitian matrix, so its eigenvalues are real. So when you have an operator like (ħ/2)σy, its eigenvalues would be ± ħ/2.

Wait, but in this case, c is h/(4π) = (h/(2π)) * (1/2) = ħ * (1/2). So Ay = c
