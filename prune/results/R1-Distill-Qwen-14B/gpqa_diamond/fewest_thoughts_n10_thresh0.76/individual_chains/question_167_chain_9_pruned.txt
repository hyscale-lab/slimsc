Okay, so I have this physics problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Where N is the normalization constant. The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. Oh right, alpha is the amplitude, and phi is the phase here.

First, I need to find the normalization constant N. The formula for N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). Let me plug in the values. 

Phi is -pi/4, so 2 phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. Alpha is 0.5, so alpha squared is 0.25. Exp(-2*0.25) is exp(-0.5). Let me compute that. Exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065.

So N squared is 1 + (-1) * 0.6065 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is the square root of 0.3935. Let's calculate that. Square root of 0.3935 is about 0.6275. So N is approximately 0.6275.

Wait, but for the state's normalization, that's correct. So the state is normalized.

Next, the non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy measure. The formula is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state (the cat state) and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

But wait, I think I might be getting this wrong. I remember that the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (or sometimes called quantum non-Gaussianity) is sometimes represented as the difference between the entropies of the state and a reference Gaussian state. So maybe del_b is the relative entropy between rho and tau, which would be S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. Because the von Neumann entropy S(rho) is trace(rho ln rho), right.

So the formula given here seems to compute S(rho) - S(tau). But wait, that's only if tau is the reference state. But what is the reference Gaussian state here? Because the choice of tau can affect the value.

Wait a second, for the Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of coherent states, it's a non-Gaussian state. The reference Gaussian state is probably the state that the cat state would collapse into if it were a Gaussian state. So perhaps tau is the state obtained by taking the density matrix of |psi> and "Gaussianizing" it. Or maybe tau is the state that is the mixture of the coherent states, without the quantum superposition.

Wait, another thought: For a state like |psi> = (|alpha> + |-alpha>)/sqrt(2), which is a cat state, the reference Gaussian state is often taken as the completely mixed state. Because the cat state is a pure state, and the reference Gaussian could be the maximally mixed state with the same purity as the Gaussian state. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the density matrix that the state would have if it were a Gaussian state with the same parameters. Wait, but the cat state is a superposition of two coherent states. The density matrix for a coherent state is Gaussian. So the density matrix for a superposition of coherent states, on the other hand, is non-Gaussian.

So, for the relative entropy, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one that's closest to the cat state in some sense, like the one that minimizes the relative entropy. Hmm, but I'm not too clear on that. Alternatively, in some definitions, the reference state is the state obtained by taking the partial trace over the environment or something, but that might be more in the context of open quantum systems.

Wait, the problem statement says that tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps tau is the state that's the closest Gaussian state to rho in some sense. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe tau is the state that results from the Gaussian part of the cat state.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state that's diagonal in the phase space basis, which for the cat state would be something like a mixture of |alpha> and |-alpha>, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the non-Gaussianity is calculated as the relative entropy between the state rho and the closest Gaussian state tau. So del_b = S(rho || tau) = S(rho) - S(tau), where S(rho||tau) is the relative entropy between rho
