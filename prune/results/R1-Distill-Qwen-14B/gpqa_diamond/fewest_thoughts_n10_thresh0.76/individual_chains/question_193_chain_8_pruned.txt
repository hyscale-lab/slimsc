Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, like N ∝ 1/parallax^5. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on my astronomy terms, but I think parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if something is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

Wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So I need to relate the number of stars N to the distance r. The given relation is N proportional to 1/parallax^5. Parallax is usually denoted by 'plx' sometimes, so 1/plx^5. 

Parallax and distance are inversely related. Specifically, parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. Wait, no, more accurately, plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r. So if plx is 1/r, then 1/plx is r. Therefore, 1/plx^5 is r^5. 

So substituting, since N is proportional to 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance. Wait, no, because the number of stars per unit volume might depend on the distance. Because when you're looking at a certain region, the number of stars you can see depends on the volume, which relates to the distance. 

Wait, let's think about it. The number of stars in a region depends on the volume. Volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr^3. So if the number of stars is proportional to the volume, it would be proportional to r^3. But wait, the question says N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So substituting plx as 1/r, 1/(1/r)^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But that can't be right because if that's the case, the number of stars would increase rapidly with distance, which doesn't make sense because you can't see more stars at greater distances due to their distribution.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the relation. Let's re-express it. Given N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, then 1/plx is r. So 1/plx^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But that would suggest that as r increases, N increases as the fifth power, which seems odd. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N = K / plx^5, where K is some constant. Since plx = 1/r, then N = K r^5. So N increases with r^5. But in reality, the number of stars you observe should decrease with distance because they are more spread out. Unless the
