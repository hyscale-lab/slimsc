Okay, so I'm trying to solve this qPCR question. Let's see what the question says. A scientist is running a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and made serial dilutions. He ran three technical replicates for each. The efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, and the slope is -3.3. 

Wait, I remember that in qPCR, the efficiency is usually around 100%, so that's good. The R² being 1 means a perfect linear relationship between the dilutions and the Ct values. Slope of -3.3... Hmm, I think the typical slope is around -3.333 because each ten-fold dilution should decrease the Ct by about 3.333 cycles. Oh wait, because each dilution is 10 times less, and each cycle is a doubling, so log base 2 of 10 is about 3.32, so yeah, a slope around -3.3 is expected.

The results show the Ct values for each concentration. Let me look at the data:

At 100000 copies:
33.9, 34.2, 34.5 → average around 34.2.

At 10000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2 → average ~30.9.

At 1000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9 → ~27.6.

At 100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6 → ~24.3.

At 10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3 → ~21.

Hmm, each dilution is a factor of 10, so let's see the differences in Ct. Between 100000 and 10000, the Ct drops by about 3.3 (34.2 -30.9 = 3.3). Similarly, 30.9 to 27.6 is 3.3. 27.6 to 24.3 is 3.3. 24.3 to 21 is 3.3. So each ten-fold dilution drops by about 3.3 cycles. That's exactly what the slope is—so the data seems to fit perfectly.

But the question says, why are there discrepancies in his results? Wait, the options are talking about possible explanations. Let me read the options again.

Option A: qPCR can't be used for nucleic acid quantification. I don't think that's right because qPCR is used all the time for quantification. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Ct values not in agreement with target nucleic acid. Wait, but in this case, the Ct values are in a perfect linear relationship. So B doesn't fit because the Ct is agreeing.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, the Ct change here is exactly 3.3
