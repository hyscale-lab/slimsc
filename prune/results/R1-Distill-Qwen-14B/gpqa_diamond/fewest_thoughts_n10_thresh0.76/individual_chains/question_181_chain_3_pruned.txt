Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes if a certain branch of reactions suddenly stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question says that the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's roughly the time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if something happens in the Sun's core, we'd see the effect here about 8.5 minutes later. But how does stopping the pp-III branch affect the neutrino flux?

I remember that the pp chain is the main source of energy in the Sun, right? The pp chain has different branches. There's the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Each branch contributes differently to the production of different particles, including neutrinos.

Neutrinos are produced mainly in the proton-proton chain reactions. The pp-I branch produces positrons and neutrinos, while the pp-II and pp-III involve more steps. Oh wait, I think the pp-III branch is the dominant one that produces high-energy neutrinos. Or was it the other way around?

Wait, the main pp chain has two main branches: pp-I and pp-II. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up the branches. Let me recall. The pp-I branch leads to the emission of a positron and two neutrinos, while the pp-II branch leads to the emission of two neutrinos as
