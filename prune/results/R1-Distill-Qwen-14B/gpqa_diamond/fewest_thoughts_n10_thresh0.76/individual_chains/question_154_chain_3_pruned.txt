Okay, so I've got this problem where a chemist found an unnamed white solid in the lab, and we're supposed to figure out what it is using the spectral data provided. Let's see what I can do. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, let's look at the data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Molecular ion usually tells us the molecular weight, so 156 would be the molecular weight. But wait, 158 is 2 more than 156. Maybe it's a doublet due to something like chlorine? Because Cl has a mass of about 35, but wait, no, wait. Chlorine has an isotope at 35 and 37. Oh right, so sometimes you see peaks at m/z +2 for Cl in the mass spec, especially if there's a Cl in the molecule. So if the base peak is 156, and there's a 158, that might suggest a Cl atom because 156 + 2 is 158. But wait, 156 plus 2 would be 158. So maybe the molecular formula includes Cl.

Next, the IR data. A broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like from alcohols or carboxylic acids, or maybe an aldehyde. But wait, the problem says it's a white solid, which could be a solid acid. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that could be from an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but for carboxylic acids, the O-H stretch is usually broader and a bit around 2500-3300, which fits the first part. But the carbonyl for a carboxylic acid is around 1700 cm^-1, so 1720 might be a bit higher, but maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl or an ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. There's a peak at 11.0 ppm, which is a singlet integrating to 1H. That's a really high chemical shift—commonly seen for aldehydic protons (around 9-10) or more likely for an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid (which can be around 10-12). Wait, but carboxylic acid protons are usually broad, but here it's a singlet. Hmm. If it's a carboxylic acid, the proton might exchange quickly and could show up as a broad peak, but sometimes in DMSO or if it's deuterated, maybe it's sharp. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is usually around 9.5-10.5, but singlet. So another possibility is an aldehyde group. But let me think further.

Next in the NMR: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.72 (d, 2H). That looks like two doublets each integrating to 2H. The coupling suggests that these are para-substituted aromatic protons. So for example, in a para-substituted benzene, you have two sets of doublets. Like in benzoic acid, the two protons on the ring adjacent to the substituent would be a doublet.

Wait, trying to match this. Let's think about the options given.

Options are:
A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid
C) Phenyl chloroformate
D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid

Hmm. Let's think about each.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be Cl at position 3, OH at 2, and an aldehyde at position 1. Wait, no, numbering would be such that the aldehyde is at position 1 (since substituents are numbered with the first possible lowest number). So substituents are aldehyde (position 1), hydroxyl (position 2), and Cl at position 3. NMR would have the aromatic protons as maybe two doublets. But wait, in this case, the aromatic ring would have substituents at 1,2,3—so that would make the ring have adjacent substituents. How would that affect the NMR? It's a bit more complex, but maybe it leads to multiple peaks. Let me think. Alternatively, if the substituents are in para positions, like in option B.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So the structure would be a benzene ring with Cl at position 4 and a carboxylic acid group at position 1. So the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). That would make the aromatic protons in positions 2 and 3, 5 and 6. Wait, but for a para-substituted benzoic acid, the ring protons would be as two doublets. Because the substituents (COOH and Cl) are at opposite positions, so the protons adjacent to these would be equivalent. So in the NMR, we would see two doublets. For example, the protons ortho to the COOH group (positions 2 and 6) would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent proton, and similarly for the ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5), but wait, no, Cl is para to COOH, so positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to COOH, and positions 3 and 5 adjacent to Cl. But in this case, since it's para, the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those in 3 and 5 would be equivalent. Each would be a doublet due to coupling with each other. So that would match the NMR data: two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

Additionally, the IR would have the broad peak from 3500-2700, which would be the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. The strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 would be the carbonyl of the COOH group. Also, the 1H NMR would have a peak around 11 ppm for the COOH proton, which is a singlet because there's no neighboring protons (since it's a -COOH group; the -OH proton is usually exchanged and might not appear, but in some cases like D2O exchange, it might show up as a peak. Alternatively, maybe the 11 ppm is the aldehyde proton, but in that case, the structure would have an aldehyde, which is not the case for benzoic acid.

Wait, but for benzoic acid, the proton is in the -COOH group, which is usually a broad peak, but in the options, the NMR shows a singlet. Hmm. But in some cases, when using a certain solvent or if the solution is not D2O, the COOH proton can appear as a singlet. Or perhaps the 11 ppm is the exchange of the aldehyde proton, but in option B, there's no aldehyde. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That's ClCO-O-C6H5. So in that case, the structure would be a phenyl group attached to an O-CO-Cl. The NMR would have aromatic protons, but how? If the phenyl is para-substituted with O-CO-Cl, then the aromatic protons would be a doublet of doublets or something else. Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets, each 2H, which suggests para substitution. Maybe in this case, the substituent is at one position, leading to two doublets. Let me think about the NMR for that. The substituent is at position 1 (O-CO-Cl), so the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4? Wait, no. Phenyl chloroformate is Cl-C(O)-O-C6H5. So the substituent is at one position. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6, which would lead to a triplet perhaps if coupled. Wait, but the NMR here shows two doublets each 2H. So if the substituent is in position 4, along with another group? No, perhaps not. Maybe I need to think about this structure differently.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So substituents are Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. Then, the aromatic protons would be in positions 3,4,5,6. Wait, but with substituents at 1 and 2, the ring would have protons in positions 3,4,5,6. The coupling would lead to more complex splitting. For example, the proton at position 3 would be adjacent to Cl, and the proton at position 4 would be adjacent to COOH. So the NMR would show more than two sets of signals, perhaps two doublets and some multiplets. But the given NMR only shows two doublets, each 2H, which suggests a simpler substitution pattern, like para.

Wait, but let's think about the 1H NMR. For option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The COOH
