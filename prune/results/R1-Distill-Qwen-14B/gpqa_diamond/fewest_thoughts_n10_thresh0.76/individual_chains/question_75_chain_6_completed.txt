Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically about a problem in a transgenic mouse model experiment. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The scenario is that someone is trying to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're making a transgenic mouse model where this protein is overexpressed. To do this, they introduced a coding sequence into a plasmid, added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus, and transfected it into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine. But when they checked, the protein wasn't overexpressed. They looked into why.

The question gives the sequence of the plus strand of their construct. So I need to analyze the DNA sequence provided to find the issue.

Looking at the options, the possible issues are:

Option A: The sequence for the HA determinant has a missense mutation.
Option B: The ribosome terminated translation early.
Option C: No linker sequence causing proteolysis.
Option D: No tRNA for UAA codon in mouse.

Wait, the DNA sequence ends with ...TGA. Let me look at the very end. Let me search for the stop codon in the mRNA. Since DNA is read as mRNA in the complementary strand, the stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA. So looking at the DNA sequence, the very last codons would determine the stop.

In the DNA sequence, the last few nucleotides are TGA. So in mRNA, that would be complementary, meaning mRNA is ...ACA. Wait no, wait. Let me think: DNA is 5' to 3', and the mRNA is made complementary to the DNA's template strand. So the DNA coding strand is the same as mRNA, except T for U.

Wait, the given sequence is the plus (coding) strand. So mRNA is identical except T becomes U. So looking for the stop codons in the mRNA: UAA, UAG, UGA.

So let's look at the last part of the DNA coding strand. The sequence ends with ...TGGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the last part is 'TGA' at the very end. Let me see: in the DNA coding strand, the last three nucleotides are TGA. So when transcribed into mRNA, it would be UAG.

UAG is a stop codon. So the mRNA would have UAG as the stop codon.

But wait, in the options, option D says the tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist. Oh, but UAG is a stop codon. So the presence of UAG would terminate translation.

Wait, but why would that cause a problem? Because the construct is designed to have a HA tag at the N-terminus, so the HA should be part of the protein. If the stop codon is after HA, but the HA is at the N-terminus, then the protein should be HA followed by GADD45G.

Wait, but in the sequence, is the HA tag included? Let me see. The construct includes a sequence for a single HA determinant at the N-terminus. So in the DNA sequence, the beginning should have the HA tag.

Looking at the start: the sequence starts with 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So ATG is the start codon. Then TAC is tyrosine. Wait, HA is a peptide, so perhaps the HA tag is part of the sequence. The HA tag is a short peptide from the influenza A virus. Its sequence is YPYDVPDY A (I think). So the coding DNA sequence for HA would be something like TAC TAC TAC (for the YPY part). Wait, perhaps the initial part of the given sequence is the HA tag.

Wait, the first few codons of the given DNA are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So ATG is Methionine (start), TAC is Tyr, CCA is Pro, TAC is Tyr, GAT is Asp, GTT is Val, etc.

So the HA tag is possibly the first few amino acids. Let me see: HA is YPYDVPDY (or similar), so the initial codons would be TAC (Tyr), TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), etc. Hmm, maybe the HA is in the first few codons.

Wait, but the key point is that the construct includes the HA tag, but when they look, the protein isn't expressed. The problem could be a stop codon somewhere in the construct.

Looking at the DNA sequence, the last codon before the end is TGA in the plus strand, which would be UAG in mRNA. UAG is a stop codon, so the ribosome would stop there. So the HA tag and the GADD45G would only be translated up to that point. But wait, the HA is at the N-terminus, so that would mean the GADD45G would be at the C-terminus. If the stop codon is in the middle, the construct would be truncated, leading to a shorter protein, perhaps not functional.

Wait, but the last part of the DNA is TGA, so the last codon is TGA. Let me see, the DNA is 5' to 3', so the mRNA is the same (except T→U). So the mRNA would have ... UAG ... at the end, which is a stop codon. So the entire coding sequence would end with UAG, which would terminate translation prematurely. So the ribosome would stop at UAG, meaning the protein would not be full-length. But in this case, perhaps the HA is correctly expressed, but the rest is not.

Wait, but the problem states that the construct is modified to include the HA tag. So if the stop codon is present, but the HA is correctly added, why is the protein not expressed? Or perhaps the stop codon is in the middle, so the protein is truncated.

Wait, but the last part of the DNA is TGA, which is the stop codon. So the construct would only produce a protein up to that stop codon, which is at the very end. So why isn't the protein expressed? Because the stop codon is correctly at the end. Wait, but in that case, the protein should be expressed. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the stop codon is in the wrong place. For instance, if the construct was designed to have the HA tag followed by GADD45G, but the stop codon is in the middle of the GADD45G, so the protein is truncated and thus not functional.

Looking at the sequence, let's see where the TGA is. Let me search for TGA in the DNA. Scanning the sequence, the last part is:

...GCTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

So the last part is GAGTGA. So that's GAG and TGA. So the last three nucleotides are TGA. So the mRNA would have UAG as the last codon.

Wait, but perhaps that's correct, but why is the protein not overexpressed? Maybe the presence of the stop codon is causing the ribosome to terminate early. But if the entire coding sequence is correct, why wouldn't the protein be expressed?

Wait, another possibility is that the presence of the HA tag is causing an issue. The HA tag is a signal peptide or something that directs the protein to the ER, but perhaps in this case, it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing the protein to misfold, but that's not one of the options.

Looking at the options again:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. If the stop codon is present in the middle, that would cause that. But the TGA is at the end, so perhaps the construct is correct. Wait, unless the construct is longer, but the HA is in the beginning. No, the end is the stop.

Wait, perhaps the construct has a premature stop codon elsewhere. Let me scan the DNA for any other TGA or other stop codons.

Looking through the DNA sequence: Let me check for any occurrences of TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking:

The sequence starts with ATG, then TAC, etc. Let's scan each triplet.

Looking for any TAG, TGA, TAA.

One occurrence is near the end:

...GTGAGGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Hmm, looking for the triplet TGA. At position ...ACTGGAAGCTC... no. Then ...GTGAGG... no. Then ...GTCAGC... No. Wait, near the end: ...CGAGTGA. So that's GAG and TGA. So the last three nucleotides are TGA.

Is there any other TGA or TAG or TAA in the DNA?

Looking through:

Looking for TGA:

- The sequence after 'GCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

I see TGA at the very end. Are there any others?

Looking at earlier parts: let's see, ...GATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, I see 'TGAACGTG' somewhere. Let me look: 'TGAACGTGGAC...' So that's TGA followed by ACG. So the TGA is present in the middle as TGAAC. So the triplet is TGA, which is a stop codon.

So that would mean the coding sequence has a premature stop codon, which is not intended. So the construct has an internal stop codon in the middle of the gene, leading to a truncated protein. So the ribosome would terminate early, leading to a non-functional protein. That would explain why the overexpression isn't happening—because the protein is not being made in full length.

So looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early, which would be due to a stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence.

So the problem is that the construct contains an internal stop codon (TGA) in the middle of the coding sequence, which is causing the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated, non-functional protein.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model construct for GADD45G overexpression is not working. The construct includes a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus and was designed to express the full-length GADD45G protein. However, the protein is not being overexpressed, and the issue lies in the provided DNA sequence.

### Key Analysis:
1. **DNA Sequence Inspection**:  
   The DNA sequence provided is the coding (sense) strand. The sequence ends with `...GAGTGA`, where `TGA` is the last triplet. In mRNA, this translates to `UAG`, a stop codon.

2. **Internal Stop Codon**:  
   Scanning the sequence for stop codons (UAG, UGA, UAA), an additional `TGA` is found in the middle of the coding sequence: `...TGAACGTGGAC...`. This indicates the presence of an internal stop codon, which prematurely terminates translation. Consequently, the ribosome stops before the full-length GADD45G protein is synthesized, resulting in a truncated, non-functional protein.

3. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: A missense mutation in the HA tag sequence is not supported, as the issue lies in the presence of an internal stop codon, not the HA tag itself.  
   - **Option B**: The ribosome terminating early due to the internal stop codon (`TGA`) is consistent with the observed lack of full-length protein expression.  
   - **Option C**: The absence of a linker sequence is not relevant here, as the issue is translation termination caused by a stop codon, not proteolysis.  
   - **Option D**: The lack of a tRNA for the `UAA` codon is incorrect, as the stop codon in question is `UAG`, not `UAA`.

### Conclusion:
The construct contains an internal stop codon (`TGA`) in the middle of the coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely. This explains why the full-length GADD45G protein is not being expressed.
