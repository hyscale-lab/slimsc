Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! Wien's displacement law says that λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but if they have the same temperature, how does that affect their luminosities? I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh right, that's the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

So since both have the same temperature, the luminosity would depend on the square of their radius. Let me compute that. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Therefore, L1 should be (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options don't have 2.25 as the correct answer. Wait the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.23, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.32. Hmm, so why is the correct answer not exactly 2.25?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does radial velocity affect the observed luminosity?

Oh, right! When a star is moving towards us, there's a blueshift, and when it's moving away, a redshift. But since the luminosity, which is the intrinsic brightness, doesn't change because of the star's motion. Luminosity is the intrinsic property, not the observed flux. So flux is affected by the star's motion, but luminosity is not. So the radial velocities shouldn't affect the calculation of the luminosity ratio. So I can probably ignore the radial velocity part for this problem.

Wait, but the question states that they computed the luminosity using black body radiation. Oh, so the calculation is based on their intrinsic properties, not the observed flux. So the radial velocities shouldn't matter here because they are using the actual luminosities, not the observed fluxes which would be affected by Doppler shift.

Wait, but another thought: Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength, but since both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, perhaps that affects the calculation? But earlier I thought that since both have same observed λ_max, their temperatures are same. Because the formula λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if they have the same λ_max, T1 = T2. So that part is correct.

So going back, L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Since T is the same for both, L is proportional to R squared. So R1 is 1.5 R2, so L1 is (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times L2. So the ratio L1/L2 is 2.25. So the answer should be A) ~2.25.

But wait, the options don't have 2.25 as the first one. Option A is ~2.25. So the correct answer would be A. But wait, why are other options close to 2.25, like 2.23 or so? Could it be that I'm missing something else?

Wait, the problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies. So the calculation is straightforward. L1 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, it's just (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the correct answer is 2.25, option A.

But wait another thing: the problem says the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So 2.25 is the factor. So why are there other options close to 2.25? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Oh wait, wait, maybe I forgot that the luminosity calculation also depends on the velocity? No, because luminosity is intrinsic. Oh wait, but in some cases, if the star is moving, the observed flux changes, but luminosity is independent of that. So the calculation should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the radius. Let me recheck: R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5. Squared is 2.25. So yes. So why would the answer not be 2.25?

Wait, the problem says, "computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..." So if L1 is 2.25 * L2, the factor is 2.25. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but looking at the options: option D is ~2.23. Hmm, perhaps I made an error.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the calculation is not just radius squared, but something else. Let me think again.

Wait, another point: the mass of the stars is given, but I thought it's not relevant because the question is about luminosity as black bodies, which depends on radius and temperature. Mass is given but perhaps doesn't directly affect the luminosity here. Unless the mass relates to the radius and temperature in some way I haven't considered. But the problem states that both radius and mass are 1.5 times, but since we have a relation between luminosity and radius and temperature, perhaps the masses are just extra information.

Wait, but if the stars have the same temperature, and same mass, perhaps the radius is determined by the mass and other factors, but in this problem, R1 is given as 1.5 R2, so that's the data to use.

So, I think my initial conclusion is correct. So the factor is 2.25, so the answer is A.


The problem involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, where Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2 and a mass 1.5 times greater. The peak wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, indicating they have the same temperature (by Wien's Law). The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: 

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

Since both stars have the same temperature (\(T_1 = T_2\)), the luminosity depends only on the square of the radius. Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (\(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\)), so the luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

The radial velocities of the stars (0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2) do not affect the intrinsic luminosity, as luminosity is an intrinsic property and not dependent on motion. The mass of the stars is also irrelevant to the calculation of luminosity in this context, as the problem focuses on blackbody radiation properties.

Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25. The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
