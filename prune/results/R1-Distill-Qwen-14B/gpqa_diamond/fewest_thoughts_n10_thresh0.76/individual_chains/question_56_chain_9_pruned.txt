Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels through emission or absorption of photons, and these transitions are governed by selection rules.

Wait, the selection rules for dipole transitions—right, the Δl = ±1 rule. Oh right, so the angular momentum quantum number l can change by one unit. Also, the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1, but that depends on the transition. Oh wait, no, the selection rules for dipole transitions are: Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1. But for electric dipole transitions, the selection rule is Δl = ±1 and |Δm| ≤ 1. So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0.

So the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ needs to go to a state where l is 1, since l can only change by ±1. Because l was 0, it can only go to l=1. So the first state after the transition must have l=1.

So the possible states for the first transition would be |2,1,m⟩ because n can decrease by 1 or increase by 1, but in this case, since the initial n is 3 and the final is 1, it takes two steps, each changing n by 1. Wait, because 3 → 2 → 1. So the first transition is n=3 to n=2, and then n=2 to n=1. So for the first transition, l=0 → l=1, so the first state must be |2,1,m⟩.

Wait, but what are the possible m values for the first transition? The initial m is 0, so the next m can be -1, 0, or +1. So the possible intermediate states are |2,1, -1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩.

Then, the second transition is from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. So the second transition must have l=1 → l=0 (since 1-1=0). So the final state is l=0, m=0. So during the second transition, m must change by ±1 or 0? Wait, in the second transition, from l=1 to l=0, the selection rule allows m to change by Δm=0, ±1. So the initial m in the intermediate state must be such that m can go to 0.

So for the second transition, let's say we have state |2,1, m⟩. When transitioning to |1,0,0⟩, m must change by Δm = -m. Because the final state is m=0.

Wait, the initial m in the intermediate state is m1. After the transition, m2 = m1 + Δ
