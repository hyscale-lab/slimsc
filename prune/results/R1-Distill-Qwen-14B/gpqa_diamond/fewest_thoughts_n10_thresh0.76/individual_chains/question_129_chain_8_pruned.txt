Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. There are four reactions in a row, starting with Compound A and ending with E. Also, there are some hints provided, which should help me figure this out.

First, let's break down the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

I also have some hints:

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hmm, phosphorous ylides are usually involved in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide with an aldehyde or ketone. So, if A reacts with a ylide to give that cyclopentane compound, A must be a carbonyl compound.

Looking at the product: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The substituents on the cyclopentane are methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and a propan-2-ylidene group at position 4. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is a substituent that's a methylene group attached to a propyl group, right? Or wait, no. Propan-2-ylidene would be a group like CH2-C(CH3)2? Or perhaps the substituent is a methylene group attached to the cyclopentane, and that's connected to a propan-2-yl group? Hmm, maybe I should draw this.

Alternatively, perhaps the ylide is reacting with a ketone in compound A. So, the Wittig reaction would form an alkene. So, A must be a ketone. Or maybe an aldehyde?

Wait, the product is a cyclopentane with substituents. Maybe the starting material for the Wittig reaction is a cyclopentanone or something similar. Let's think: the Wittig reagent would attack a carbonyl group to form an alkene.

If the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, that suggests the cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. The propan-2-ylidene group is a substituent with a double bond or something else?

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the cyclopentane has a substituent that's a prop-1-enyl group (allyl group) attached at position 4. Because in the Wittig reaction, the ylide adds to the carbonyl, and then you get an alkene.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopentane with a substituent that's a propenyl group. So, the structure would be something like cyclopentane with CH2-C(CH3)2 attached? Or maybe CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the structure. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The substituents on the cyclopentane are at positions 1,2, and 4. Let me imagine the cyclopentane ring. So, positions 1 and 2 have methyl groups. Position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group. 

Propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. The ylidene group would be like =CH-CH(CH3)-something. Maybe it's a substituent where the cyclopentane is connected to a methylene group (CH2) that's attached to a propane group with branching. Hmm, perhaps it's CH2-C(CH3)2? No, that's more of an isopropyl group.

Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentane with a substituent at position 4 that is a methylene group connected to a propane group. So like CH2-CH2-CH(CH3), but that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, the propan-2-ylidene group would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 attached to the cyclopentane?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the Wittig reaction. The ylide would have a structure like PPh3+=CH-CH(CH3)2 or something. When it reacts with a carbonyl, like a ketone, it would form an alkene.

So if the product has a substituent that's a propenyl group (like CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond?), wait, the product after Wittig would be an alkene.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound A is a ketone that's part of a cyclopentane ring. For example, if A is cyclopentanone with substituents, then reacting with the ylide would form a new substituent with an alkene.

Wait, let's imagine that A is 4-methylcyclopentanone. Then the ylide (Wittig reagent) would attack the ketone, forming an alkene. So, the product would have a substituent with a double bond.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl
