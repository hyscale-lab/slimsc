Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about hydrogen atom transitions. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. The options give different transition routes and their probabilities. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions occur via dipole transitions, which are governed by selection rules. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions state that the angular momentum quantum number l must change by ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m must change by 0, ±1. Also, the principal quantum number n can change by any integer, but in practice, it's usually dropping by one each time.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. It's decaying to n=1, l=0, m=0. But it's a two-step process because 3→2→1, right? Because you can't go from 3 to 1 in one step if you're only changing n by 1 each time.

So first transition: 3,0,0 → 2, ?, ?.

What's the possible l for the first transition? Since l must change by ±1. The initial l is 0, so possible l after transition is 1 (since 0+1=1). So the first state must have l=1.

So the first state after transition is |2,1, m>. What's m? The initial m is 0, so m can change by 0, ±1. So possible m values after are -1, 0, +1.

So the possible states after the first transition are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1>.

Now, the second transition: from 2,1,m to 1,0,0.

Again, l must change by ±1. The initial l is 1, so the next l can be 0 or 2. But the final state is l=0, so the second transition must go from l=1 to l=0.

So the second transition must be from l=1 to l=0, which is allowed.

What about m? The initial m is whatever it was from the first transition. The final m is 0. So m can change by 0, ±1.

So let's think about the possible paths.

First possibility: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0.

Is that allowed? Let's see. First transition: l changes from 0 to 1 (allowed), m changes from 0 to 0 (allowed, since m can stay same or change by ±1). Second transition: l changes from 1 to 0 (allowed), m changes from 0 to 0 (allowed).

Another possibility: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 →1,0,0.

First step: m goes 0→1. Second step: m goes 1→0, which is allowed (change by -1).

Similarly, 3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0 is possible. Second step: m changes from -1 →0 (change of +1), which is allowed.

So all these options are possible, so the transition routes in the options must consider these possibilities.

Now, the question is about the probability of each path. The options give different probabilities, so I need to figure out which transitions are allowed and what their probabilities are.

Wait, the problem states that it's a two dipole transition, which means two steps, each a dipole transition.

But the options give specific paths with specific probabilities.

Now, the options are:

A) 3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0,0 with probability 1/3.

B) 3→2,1,1 →1,0,0 with 1/4.

C) 3→2,1,-1 →1,0,0 with 1/4.

D) 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0 with 2/3.

Wait, the first transition in each option is either to m=0, m=1, or m=-1.

Hmm. But in the second transition, the m must go from whatever it was to 0.

So for each path, we can compute the transition probability.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact probability calculation. Maybe I should think about the transition dipole moment or the selection rules.

Wait, the transition probability depends on the matrix elements of the dipole operator between the states. The dipole operator has components proportional to rY_{1m}(θ,φ), where Y are the
