Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about a particle moving in a two-dimensional potential, and I need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Alright, the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, r is the radial distance, and θ is the angular coordinate. So I think I should express this potential in terms that are easier to handle in quantum mechanics, maybe separate into radial and angular parts.

Let me rewrite the potential. The first term is (1/2)k r², that looks like a harmonic oscillator term in the radial direction. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Oh right, cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Let me compute that. The second term becomes (3/2)k r² * (1/2) (1 + cos2θ) which is (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). So putting it all together:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Adding the first two terms: 1/2 + 3/4 is 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, but maybe I should think about this in polar coordinates and separate the variables. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to switch to Cartesian coordinates because sometimes it's simpler to handle potentials that way. Let's see.

In two dimensions, polar coordinates can sometimes complicate things because of the angular part, but maybe I can separate the potential into terms that depend on x and y. Since r² = x² + y², and cos2θ can be expressed in terms of x and y. Let me recall that cos2θ is (x² - y²)/(x² + y²). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, another approach: The potential can be written as V(r,θ) = [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ] r². Oh wait, no, the original expression is (1/2)k r² plus (3/2)k r² cos²θ, which can be factored as r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

Hmm, another thought. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let's factor out k r²/2: so that's (k r²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Wait, 1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ. Hmm, but maybe this isn
