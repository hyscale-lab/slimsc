Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically focusing on identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted aromatic compound. Let's try to break this down step by step.

The question says that the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. So wait, a benzene ring is 6 carbons, right? So if it's di-substituted, that means two substituents are attached to the ring. But the total is 8 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 carbons in total. Hmm, because 6 (ring) + 2 (substituents) = 8.

Also, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents on the ring must include a carbonyl and a halogen. Let's think about what substituents these could be.

Wait, wait, wait. The substituents are attached to the benzene ring. So possibilities are, for example, a halogen like Cl or Br and a carbonyl group. The carbonyl could be part of a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. But given that the NMR will show certain peaks, let's think about how these groups would appear.

Let me list the possible structures. The benzene ring has two substituents. One substituent is -X (where X is a halogen, like Cl or Br), and the other is a carbonyl group. Or maybe the substituents are more complex, like a carbonyl-containing group, such as an acetyl group (COCH3) perhaps.

Wait, but the compound has 8 carbons in total. So benzene (6 C) plus substituents (2 C). So each substituent must either be one carbon (like -Cl, which is 0 carbons) or perhaps a group that contributes one carbon each. Wait, but the total is two carbons from substituents. So each substituent can't have more than one carbon, because 2 substituents Ã— 1 C each would add 2 C. But wait, a halogen substituent doesn't add any carbons. So maybe one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, which doesn't add any carbon) and the other is a group that adds two carbons. Because 6
