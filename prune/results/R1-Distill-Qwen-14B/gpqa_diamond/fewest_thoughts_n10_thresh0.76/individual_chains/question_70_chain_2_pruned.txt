Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the parts.

So, the question is about some reactions and figuring out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, these are point group symmetries, right?

Let me break down the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I need to figure out what E is, which will help me determine its molecular symmetry.

Let me start by trying to identify the compounds involved. Let's think about each reaction.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C. A is a solid, B is a gas. C is bright red. I remember some bright red compounds. Maybe something like CuO? Or perhaps something else. Wait, but 8 equivalents of B reacting with A. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A is something like iron? Let's think. If B is O2, then 8 equivalents might make sense. Wait, but iron reacting with O2 typically forms Fe3O4 or FeO, depending on conditions. Fe3O4 is black, FeO is not very stable, tends to oxidize further. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another possibility. Maybe A is sodium (Na), which is a solid. B could be chlorine gas (Cl2). 8 equivalents... but sodium reacts with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio to form NaCl. But in that case, 8 equivalents might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps A is carbon (solid), and B is something else.

Wait, wait, reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A plus two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So, when C reacts with water, it produces H+ ions from the acids. So perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a metal hydroxide, which then dissociates into metal ions and the acids.

Wait, for example, if C is a metal oxide like sodium oxide (Na2O), reacting with water gives NaOH (which is a strong base, but wait, the products are acids F and G). Hmm, no. That doesn't fit. Maybe C is a non-metal oxide, like SO3. SO3 reacts with water to form H2SO4 (a strong acid) and... wait, no, that's just H2SO4. Hmm, but in the reaction, it's producing two different acids. So maybe C is a mixed oxide?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate? No, because reacting with water might not produce two acids. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the reaction of C with water. It forms A and two acids. So, perhaps A is a metal, and the oxide (C) is a metal oxide. For example, if C is Na2O, then reacting with water would give NaOH. But that's a base, not an acid. Wait, but the problem says two acids F and G. So maybe C is a non-metal oxide.

Wait, another approach. Let me look at the other reactions. Reaction 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, etc. But if H is a solvent, perhaps it's water? But D and B reacting in 1:1 to form H. If H is H2O, then D and B would be O2 and H2? But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps H is something like HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Wait, maybe H is something else.

Wait, another thought: D is a gas reacting with B, another gas,
