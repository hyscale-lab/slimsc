Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Wait, I remember something about the speed of light in different frames of reference. Oh right, in special relativity, the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. But wait, this problem is about a medium, glass, which has an index of refraction. So I'm a bit confused now. Does the medium's motion affect the speed of light as observed?

Wait, the index of refraction n affects the speed of light in the medium when it's at rest. The speed of light in the medium when it's stationary is c/n. But if the medium is moving, does that change anything? Or does the speed of light still have to be c in any frame?

Wait, no. Because according to relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the motion of the source or medium. So in the lab frame, even though the glass is moving, the light would still have to travel at speed c. Because from the lab's perspective, the speed can't exceed c. So the answer should be B) 1, because c is 1
