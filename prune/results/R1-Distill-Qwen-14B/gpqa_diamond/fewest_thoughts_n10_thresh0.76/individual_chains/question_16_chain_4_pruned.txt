Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see... The question gives me seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active.

First, what's optical activity? Oh right, it's when a compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which means it must have chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry that leads to non-superimposable mirror images. So, I need to check each compound for chirality.

Let's go through each one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, that's a chloroalkene. The structure would be Cl-C=C-CH(CH3)-something. But wait, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. The configuration is Z, which means the higher priority groups are on the same side. Now, for a molecule to have a chiral center, it must have four different substituents on a carbon. Let me draw it out... The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-... Wait, no, wait, but-1-ene is CH2-CH2, but with substituents. Wait, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

But wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH-CH2... No, wait. Let me think again. But-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₃. But 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon (which is double bonded), and a methyl group on the second carbon.

So structure: Cl-CH₂-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH₂=C(CH3)CH2CH3. But in 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the Cl is on the first carbon, which is double-bonded. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH₂Cl at C1, and at C2, a methyl group and the double
