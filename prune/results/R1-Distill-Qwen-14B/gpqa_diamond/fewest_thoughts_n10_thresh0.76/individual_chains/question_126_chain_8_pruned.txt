Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember some basics.

So the question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Each reaction uses a different starting material and different reducing agents. Then, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns. The question is about how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Let me start by looking at Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. Hexan-3-one is a ketone, so LAH will reduce the ketone.

Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. But wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is more like:

CH2CH2-CO-OCH3 attached where? Let me draw it. I think it's:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-OCH3-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one means the ketone is on carbon 3. So numbering from left to right:

1 2 3 4 5 6
CH2-CH2-C(O)-OCH3-CH2-CH2?

Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2-CO-OCH3 on carbon 3, and the rest are CH2 groups. Maybe I should write it as:

The structure is CH2CH2-C(O-OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3? Not sure, but the main thing is that the ketone is at position 3.

When LAH reduces a ketone, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So, Reaction I should produce (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at the 5th carbon? Or wait, because (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one implies that the methoxy is at carbon 5. So the structure is:

(CH2)2-C(=O)-OCH3 at carbon 3? Hmm, perhaps it's better to visualize:

The molecule
