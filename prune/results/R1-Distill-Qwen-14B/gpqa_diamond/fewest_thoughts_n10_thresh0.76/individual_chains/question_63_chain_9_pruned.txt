Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and a quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I think I remember from my chemistry class that diatomic molecules can be modeled as a rigid rotor and a harmonic oscillator. But wait, the question says it's the non-rigid rotor model, so maybe that's a bit different.

The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. I need to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, will take the molecule to the next lowest energy state. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, energy levels have quantized states, so the molecule can only absorb specific photon energies to transition between these states.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that would probably be the next higher energy state from the fundamental. But wait, the molecule's energy states are a combination of rotation and vibration. I remember that the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational parts.

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For the vibrational part, in the harmonic oscillator model, the energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h nu, where v is the vibrational quantum number and nu is the frequency.

But wait, the question is about the fundamental state. Oh, the fundamental vibrational state is v=0. So the molecule is in the lowest vibrational state, but possibly in a certain rotational state. Hmm, but the molecule's overall state is a combination of both. Wait, but the question is about the transition when a photon is absorbed. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can change either its vibrational state, rotational state, or both. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that would be the smallest possible increase in energy, which would probably be a transition that only involves changing the rotational state, not the vibrational. Or maybe the opposite? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are closer together than the vibrational ones. Because the rotational constant B is usually much smaller than the vibrational frequency. So the energy steps between rotational states are smaller. So the smallest energy jump would be a change in rotation, not vibration.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So the fundamental state is
