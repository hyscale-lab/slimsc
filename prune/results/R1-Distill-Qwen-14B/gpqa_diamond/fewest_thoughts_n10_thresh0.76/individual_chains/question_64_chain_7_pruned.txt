Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's about.

Alright, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams was heated to 200°C without air. Heating them produced a mixture of gases, which were then passed through some tubes. The results after passing through the tubes are given, and from that, we need to figure out the total number of atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm, I think I remember that when salts are heated, especially without air, they might decompose or undergo some kind of thermal decomposition. The fact that it's an equimolar mixture suggests that the moles of A and B are the same, which might be important later.

So the gases from the heating went through three tubes. Let's break down each tube's function.

Tube №1 is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I think Mg(ClO4)2 is a desiccant, but wait, no, in this case, maybe it's a drying agent. Oh wait, no, Mg(ClO4)2 is actually used as a drying agent, but when it reacts, it can absorb moisture. Wait, no, maybe it's not that. Oh wait, no, Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong dehydrating agent. When it comes into contact with water, it can form Mg(ClO4)2·xH2O. But, in this case, the tube is anhydrous, so maybe any moisture in the gas would be absorbed here, increasing the weight of the tube. So, the weight gained in tube 1 (3.60g) is the amount of water absorbed.

Then, tube №2 is filled with Ca(OH)2 solution. Wait, wait, no, the problem says it's a solution. So, if a gas is passed through a solution of Ca(OH)2, which is a strong base, it would react with acidic gases like CO2, SO2, etc. But here, the weight of tube 2 didn't change. That suggests that no gas reacted with the solution. So, no acidic gases passed through, because if there were CO2, for example, the solution would have reacted, increasing the weight as CO2 is absorbed.

Tube №3 is red-hot copper. So, the gas passed through hot Cu. I remember that gases like CO and H2 can react with Cu when heated. CO would reduce CuO, but wait, in this case, the copper is red-hot, so maybe it's acting as a catalyst or participating in a reaction. Alternatively, maybe the gas is passing through copper, and if the gas is, say, water vapor, it wouldn't react. But if the gas is something that can react with copper, like CO, it might get consumed. The problem states that CuO formed in tube 3, so some reaction occurred there. The weight increase in tube 3
