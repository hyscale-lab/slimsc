Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through the problem again and see what it's asking.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). 

Wait, right, the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ − ⟨A⟩²). So for Pz here, I need to find ⟨Pz²⟩ and ⟨Pz⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

But wait, the system is in an eigenstate of Px. So what's the state in terms of the basis of Pz? Oh, right, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the given state is expressed in the Pz basis.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Since the operator Pz is diagonal in its own basis, the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ would be the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities of each state. Since the state is a column vector, each component squared gives the probability for each eigenstate of Pz.

Wait, but let me think. The state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. So each component is the amplitude for the corresponding Pz eigenstate.

So the first component is -1/2, so the probability is (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. The second component is 1/√2, so probability is 1/2. Third component is -1/2, probability 1/4.

What are the eigenvalues of Pz? Looking back, the matrix for Pz is diagonal. The diagonal entries are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ, corresponding to each basis state.

So ⟨Pz⟩ is the sum of (probability * eigenvalue) for each state.

Calculating that: (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 ħ - 1/4 ħ) = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. The expectation value of Pz is zero.

Now, ⟨Pz²⟩ would be the sum of (probability * (eigenvalue)^2).

So first term: (1/4)*(ħ²), second term: (1/2)*(0)^2 =0, third term: (1/4)*(ħ²). So total is (1/4 + 1/4) * ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ΔPz² = ⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩². Since ⟨Pz⟩ is zero, ΔPz² is just (1/2 ħ²). Therefore, ΔPz is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options,
