Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question has two separate reactions, A and B, and I need to figure out the major products for each. Then, match them with the given options.

First, let's tackle reaction A. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, and the reagent is ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so I think this might be a Claisen or Aldol condensation reaction. Wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, which often acts as a Michael acceptor in conjugate additions.

Wait, cyclohexanone derivatives reacting with acrylates... Maybe it's a Michael addition. The cyclohexanone has a ketone group at position 1. The substituents are ethyl at position 2, and methyl groups at 2 and 6. Wait, let me clarify the structure. The compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the ring has a carbonyl group at position 1. At position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group (since it's 2,6-dimethyl; so positions 2 and 6 each have a methyl). Wait, no, wait. The name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? Or is it that the substituents are ethyl (from 2-ethyl) and methyl groups at 2 and 6?

Wait, maybe I should draw it. So the cyclohexanone ring has a ketone at position 1. Then, at position 2: there's an ethyl group and a methyl group attached to the same carbon (since it's 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl). So, the adjacent carbons would be substituted. So, position 2 has ethyl and methyl groups.

So the structure looks like a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at C1. The C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. Then
