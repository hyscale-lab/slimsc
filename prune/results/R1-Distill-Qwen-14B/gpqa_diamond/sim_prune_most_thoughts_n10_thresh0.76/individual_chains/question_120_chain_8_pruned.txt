Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I need to determine how this number changes with parallax (plx). The options are A to D, with different exponents of 1/plx.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So the larger the parallax, the closer the star is. But wait, if the stars are uniformly distributed, that means their distances are spread out uniformly in space, right?

Wait, no, uniform distribution in space doesn't mean they're uniformly distributed in parallax. Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So the number of stars in a certain range of parallax would depend on the volume of space corresponding to that parallax range.

Let me think about this. Parallax (p) is related to distance (d) by p = 1/d. So for a given parallax p, the distance is 1/p parsecs. Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. So if I'm looking at a small change in p, say dp, what's the corresponding volume of space that stars in that parallax range would occupy?

In three dimensions, the volume of a spherical shell (which is what we're dealing with here for a given distance) is (4/3)π (d_outer³ - d_inner³). But since we're dealing with a small dp, the change in volume can be approximated as the derivative with respect to d, multiplied by the change in d.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. For a given parallax p, the distance is d = 1/p. So a change in p, dp, would correspond to a change in d, dd. Since p = 1/d, dp = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = -d² dp. But since we're considering a small range, maybe I can model this as the volume per unit p.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many stars are in a thin shell at distance d. The number of stars in a volume element depends on the volume. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is constant.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So for a given parallax p, how many stars are there per unit p?

So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is (number density) multiplied by the volume of the shell. The volume of the shell is the surface area times the thickness. The surface area is 4πd², and the thickness in terms of d would be dd. But since we're considering a change in p, which is 1/d, we need to express dd in terms of dp.

Let me write the relationships:

p = 1/d → d = 1/p

So, dp = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² dp. Since we're considering a small dp, the negative sign indicates direction but for the magnitude, we can consider the absolute value.

So, the volume of the thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd.

Substituting d = 1/p and dd = (1/p²) dp (because dd = (1/p²) * |dp|, since d = 1/p → dd = -d² dp, but taking magnitude, it's d² |dp|).

Wait, let me compute that again. dd = - (d²) dp. So the absolute value is d² |dp|.

So the volume of the shell is 4π ( (1/p)^2 ) * ( (1/p²) dp ). Wait, that's 4π * (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the surface area is 4π d². The thickness in the d direction is dd. So volume is 4π d² * dd.

But d = 1/p → d² = 1/p².

And dd is (1/p²) dp (from earlier, since dd = d² |dp| → (1/p²) dp).

So volume is 4π * (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp → 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the volume of the shell is 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Now, the number of stars in that shell is the number density multiplied by this volume. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. Let's say n is the number density (stars per unit volume). Then the number of stars in the shell is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of p (parallax). So per unit p, that would be the number of stars in the shell divided by dp. Because for each dp, you get that number.

So number per unit p is (n * 4π (1/p^4) dp ) / dp → n * 4π (1/p^4).

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So it's the number per unit p. So the expression is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. So looking back at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, which would correspond to option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when dealing with such distributions, there's a factor I might have missed. Let's think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model this using the concept of volume as a function of distance. The number of stars in a given parallax range depends on the volume of space at that distance, which increases with the cube of the distance. But since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, the volume depends inversely on the cube of parallax.

Wait, the volume element in terms of parallax. Let's see.

For a small change in p (dp), the corresponding change in d is dd = -d^2 dp, as before. The volume between d and d + dd is the surface area 4πd² multiplied by dd. So substituting, the volume V = 4πd² * (-d² dp) ) → Wait, no, because dd is negative, but the volume is positive. So, V = 4π d² * ( dd ), but dd is negative, so the volume is 4π d
