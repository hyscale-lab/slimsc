Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it again carefully.

The question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variation, right? That's a method used to detect exoplanets by observing the variations in the timing of transits of a planet in front of its star. So, it's a way to find planets that don't transit as often or where other factors cause timing changes.

There are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. The question gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 have a ratio of about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. Also, the mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is around 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. The albedo for all three is 0.3, which is similar to Earth's. 

The question asks by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. The options are A to D.

Hmm. So, I need to find the ratio of the orbital periods, Period3 / Period1. 

I remember that for planets in a system, the equilibrium temperature is related to the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The equation for equilibrium temperature (Teq) is:

Teq = [ (L * (1 - a)) / (16 * π * σ * D^2) ) ]^(1/4)

Where:
- L is the star's luminosity,
- a is the albedo,
- D is the orbital distance (semi-major axis),
- σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since all three planets have the same star, L is the same for all. Also, albedo a is 0.3 for all. So we can simplify the equation.

Taking the ratio of Teq1 to Teq2, say, would give:

(Teq1 / Teq2) = [ (D2^2) / (D1^2) ) ]^(1/4)

Because when you take the ratio, L and a and σ and π terms cancel out.

So, Teq1 / Teq2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2)

Wait, no, let's think again. Let me write it properly.

Teq is proportional to ( (1 - a) / D^2 )^(1/4 )

So,

Teq1 / Teq2 = [ ( (1 - a) / D1^2 ) / ( (1 - a) / D2^2 ) ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify inside: the (1-a) cancels, so (D2^2 / D1^2 )^(1/4) = (D2/D1)^(1/2)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me correct that.

Wait, let me write the formula correctly. The equilibrium temperature is given by:

Teq = ( (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D^2) )^(1/4 )

So, the ratio Teq1 / Teq2 is [ ( (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D1^2) ) / ( (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D2^2) ) ) ]^(1/4 )

Which simplifies to [ (D2^2) / (D1^2) ) ]^(1/4 )

Which is (D2/D1)^(1/2) because (D2²/D1²) is (D2/D1)^2, and the 1/4 power makes it (D2/D1)^(1/2).

So,

Teq1 / Teq2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Wait, because if Teq1 is higher, that would mean that D1 is smaller, because closer planets are hotter.

Wait, yes. So, if Teq1 is higher than Teq2, then D1 is smaller than D2. So, D2/D1 > 1.

So, in this problem, the ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is Teq1/Teq2 =1.4. So,

1.4 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

Squaring both sides:

(1.4)^2 = D2/D1 → 1.96 = D2/D1 → D2 = 1.96 D1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is Teq2/Teq3 =2.3.

So,

2.3 = sqrt( D3 / D2 )

Wait, wait, let me clarify: Teq2 is for Planet2, Teq3 is for Planet3. So, the ratio Teq2/Teq3 is 2.3.

Wait, no, the question says the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So I think that's Teq1/Teq2 =1.4.

Similarly, between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is about 2.3. So, Teq2/Teq3 =2.3.

So, for the first ratio: Teq1/Teq2 =1.4 → sqrt(D2/D1) =1.4 → D2 = (1.4)^2 D1 =1.96 D1.

For the second ratio: Teq2/Teq3 =2.3 → sqrt(D3/D2) =2.3 → D3 = (2.3)^2 D2 =5.29 D2.

Wait, wait, no,
