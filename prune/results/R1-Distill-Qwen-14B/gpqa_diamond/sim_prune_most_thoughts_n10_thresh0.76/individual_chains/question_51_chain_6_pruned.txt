Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says: A charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are A to D, each with a different formula.

Alright, let's start by recalling some concepts. I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor induces charges on its surface. Since the sphere is grounded, electrons can flow in or out. So, the presence of charge q will induce charges on the sphere.

Wait, right! For a conducting sphere, the induced charges will reside on the surface. So, if I place a positive charge q near the sphere, the sphere's nearer side will have an induced negative charge, and the far side will have a positive charge. But because the sphere is grounded, maybe the induced charges can adjust more freely. Oh wait, no, for a conductor, the induced charges are such that the field inside is zero. 

Wait, but since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge can leave. So, when a charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere must adjust its charge to maintain the condition that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. But wait, the sphere is neutral to start with because it's grounded. So, when an external charge is placed near it, induced charges will redistribute.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the method of images. I think that's the approach
