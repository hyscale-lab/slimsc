Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The Pi(+) is stationary. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV.

Hmm, alright, so I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, energy and momentum conservation must hold. Since the pion is at rest, the products must fly off in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Because the neutrino is massless or nearly so, but wait, muon has mass. So the muon and neutrino will have some kinetic energy.

Wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, and the pion's mass is 139.6 MeV. So the total rest mass energy is the pion's, and the products have their rest masses plus kinetic energies.

First, I think I need to calculate the energy released in the decay, which is the mass difference. So the energy available is the pion's mass minus the muon's mass, because the neutrino's rest mass is negligible.

So the available energy would be 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV. But wait, that's the rest mass difference, so that's the maximum possible energy available. But how is this energy split between the muon and the neutrino?

I remember that in decay processes, especially when the parent is at rest, the total energy is conserved, and so the kinetic energies of the products can be found by considering their energies and momenta.

So for the decay Pi+ → mu+ + nu, the pion is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. After decay, the total momentum must be zero as well. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

Let’s denote the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's momentum as p. But wait, the neutrino's mass is approximately zero, so its energy is just pc, while the muon's energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m
