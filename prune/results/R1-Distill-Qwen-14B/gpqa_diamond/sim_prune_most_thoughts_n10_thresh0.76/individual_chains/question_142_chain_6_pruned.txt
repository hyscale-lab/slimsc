Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think this looks familiar. Let me break it down. The |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are projectors, right? So each term is a projector onto the respective basis state.

I recall that a general single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere representation is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and the corresponding point on the Bloch sphere is given by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. 

But wait, this ρ isn't a pure state because it's a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. Oh right, it's a mixed state. The formula given is ρ = ½ (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). So each term has a coefficient of ½. That makes sense because the trace of the density matrix must be 1, and each projector has trace 1, so adding them and dividing by 2 gives trace 1.

Now, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch sphere. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space. The vector r determines the point on the Bloch sphere, where the magnitude of r is ≤1. For a pure state, |r|=1, and for a mixed state, |r|<1.

Let me write down the expression. For a single qubit, the density matrix can also be written as:

ρ = (I + xσ_x + yσ_y + zσ_z)/2.

So, the coefficients x, y, z are the components of the vector r = (x, y, z). 

So, let's compute ρ. Let me see, the given ρ is ½ (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let's compute each term.

|0⟩⟨0| in matrix form is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, so ρ is I/2. Comparing that with the Bloch form, (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies that r·σ = 0. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2.

r·σ is xσ_x + yσ_y + zσ_z. So for this to be zero, each coefficient x, y, z must be zero. Because
