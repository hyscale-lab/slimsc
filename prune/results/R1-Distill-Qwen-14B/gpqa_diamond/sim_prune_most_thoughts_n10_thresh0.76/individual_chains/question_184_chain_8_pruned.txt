Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis questions can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, I need to figure out how to get there starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions.

Let me visualize the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (-OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group (-NO2). Wait, wait. Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering might differ. Let me think: when numbering, the substituents should get the lowest possible numbers. So if the substituents are at 1, 2, 3, that seems correct.

But how do the substituents get added? I remember that substituents can be introduced via electrophilic substitution, and the order matters because each step affects where the next substituent goes.

I think the key is to plan the order of substituent addition. The substituents are tert-butyl, nitro, and ethoxy. So, which groups are activating and which are deactivating? The tert-butyl is a bulky, strong activating group (alkyl) because it's an electron donor. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Ethoxy is activating (since it's an O- group), but wait, ethoxy is an ether, so it's an activating group? No, wait, wait: ethoxy is an electron-donating group because of the lone pairs on oxygen. So it's an activating, ortho/para director.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, in aromatic substitution, -OEt is an activating group because it donates electrons through resonance. So it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. But wait, when the substituent is an ether, it's an activating group, right? Or is it deactivating? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: substituents with lone pairs (like -O-) can donate electrons through resonance. So they activate the ring. So, -OEt is activating, ortho/para directing.

Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Tert-butyl is a strong activating, but bulky, so it's ortho/para directing but might be more likely to direct to para because it's bulky.

Wait, but when multiple substituents are present, the directing effect depends on their positions and the order of addition. So, the order in which substituents are added will determine the positions of subsequent groups.

So, the target molecule has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. Let's figure out the order in which these should be added to achieve the correct positions.

Let me think about how to place the substituents. Let's say we add tert-butyl first. Then, next would be ethoxy, but wait, where?

Alternatively, maybe we add nitro first. But nitro is deactivating, which would make subsequent substitution harder. But maybe it's better to add activating groups first because they are easier to substitute and can guide the direction.

Wait, the problem is that I need all three substituents on the ring. Let me think about the possible orderings.

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first. Then, add nitro, then ethoxy.

Option 2: Add tert-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Option 3: Add nitro first, then tert-butyl, then ethoxy.

Wait, but adding nitro first would deactivate the ring, making it harder to add other groups. So perhaps it's better to add activating groups first.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director. Let me think about the positions. The target molecule has substituents at 1,
