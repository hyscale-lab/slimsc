Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about naming a benzene ring with multiple substituents, which can be a bit tricky. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that IUPAC nomenclature starts by numbering the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. The principal functional group gets the lowest number, and we number in a way that gives the other groups the next lowest numbers.

The problem states that the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another. So, imagine the benzene ring with three substituents: COOH, CHO, and CN. They are meta, so each is separated by a carbon (1,3,5 positions if they are all meta).

Wait, no, being meta means each is two carbons apart. So for example, if one is at position 1, the next is at 3, and the third at 5. So they're spaced every other position.

Additionally, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino group. Ortho means adjacent, so positions 2 and 6 (since the carboxylic acid is at position, say, 4? Or wait, wait, perhaps I should think about the numbering.

Wait, actually, the carboxylic acid is a substituent, so it's on the benzene ring. Let me try to sketch this mentally.

Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's say the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, meta to it would be positions 3 and 5. Wait, no, three substituents being all meta to one another would require them to be each two positions apart. So 1,3,5 would work because each is separated by two positions.

But wait, the problem says: a benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another. So all three substituents are meta to each other. That would imply they are in 1, 3, 5 positions, each two apart.

Wait, but that's impossible for three substituents because 1,3,5 are each meta to each other. So each substituent is meta to all the others. That makes sense.

So, let me assign the substit
