Alright, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics, specifically involving a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

The question describes a bicistronic vector, which means it has two coding sequences (ORFs) in a single transcript. The ligand is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' position, fused to eGFP. Both are under specific promoters and have stop cassettes with loxP sites.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is after an IRES element. Oh right, IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be translated from the same mRNA as the ligand. So the mRNA would have the ligand first, then the IRES, then the receptor.

But there's a stop cassette with loxP between ligand and mCherry. Normally, a stop cassette would prevent the downstream ORF from being expressed unless the stop is removed. Oh, right, so maybe this is for using Cre to excise the stop. Similarly, the receptor has a lox2272 stop cassette before eGFP.

So the setup is that when Cre is expressed, it would recombine with the lox sites to remove the stop cassettes, allowing the expression of the downstream markers (mCherry and eGFP). But in the experiment, the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. Oh, SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. So perhaps the Cre is expressed in neural crest-derived cells.

But in the results, when they looked under the confocal, there was no green signal. eGFP is the green fluorescent protein, so the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed or isn't getting to the surface or is maybe retained.

Wait, the question is about why there's no green signal. So let's think about the possible options.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But in this case, since the same cell is producing both ligand and receptor, maybe autocrine? Or perhaps the cells can't signal properly if they're only in paracrine. Not sure how this affects the expression in the Western blot or the GFP signal. Maybe not the main issue here.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. So the eGFP wouldn't fluoresce because the protein isn't on the cell surface. But if the protein isn't expressed, you wouldn't see any signal. Did they check Western blot? The question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the construct wasn't expressed, the Western would show no bands. But the question says they observed signals proportional to actin, meaning the loading is correct. So perhaps the expression worked, but the eGFP is not expressed. Or the fusion might be problematic.

Wait, the problem is in the mouse model. They're homozygous for the construct. When crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would excise the stop cassettes. So the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP. But in the offspring, they don't see the green signal. So either the eGFP isn't being expressed or the fusion is not working.

Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. Well, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which should be after the ligand. If the enhancer is missing, perhaps the expression is low, but the Western would have picked that up. Also, the question says the mice are homozygous and crossed with Cre, which would drive expression. Not sure if this is the main issue.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh wait, that's a possibility. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP might not be correctly expressed. So during the cloning, if the insert for the receptor wasn't correctly ligated, the reading frame could be off. So when the receptor is expressed, the eGFP wouldn't be made, or it would be a nonfunctional fusion protein. So in Western blot, you might not see the eGFP, but perhaps the receptor would be expressed.

But wait, the antibodies were against the overexpressed proteins. If the eGFP isn't expressed, but the receptor is, then in Western blot you'd see the receptor band but not eGFP. But the question says that after transfection, the expression was tested on Western blot. So if the construct was correctly made, perhaps the eGFP is not expressed because the frame is wrong.

Alternatively, in the mouse model, after Cre-mediated recombination, the stop cassette is removed, allowing for eGFP expression. But if the frame is incorrect, the eGFP won't be made. So when they look under the microscope, no green.

So why is the eGFP not expressed? Let me think about the vector setup. The bicistronic vector has the ligand first, with a stop after it, then the IRES, then the receptor with its own stop. So when Cre is present, the loxP stop is removed for the ligand, allowing mCherry to be expressed. For the receptor, the lox2272 stop is removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

But if the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, then when the stop is removed, the translation would read through but not produce eGFP. So the construct would have the receptor but not eGFP. So when they look for eGFP fluorescence, nothing is there.

So the correct answer would be D, that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Another possibility is option B, if the eGFP is retained in the Golgi. But if the construct was correctly made, you'd expect some eGFP to be expressed. Also, the Western would have shown either receptor or eGFP. But the question says that the Western blot was done after transfection, and perhaps they saw the ligand or receptor but not the tags. Or maybe the eGFP isn't expressed because the frame is wrong.

Wait, the question says that in the Western blot, the signal is proportional to actin loading, which suggests that the proteins are being loaded properly. But perhaps the expression isn't happening because of the frame issue.

So putting it all together, the most likely reason is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, when they look for green fluorescence, they see nothing.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor, with the ligand fused to mCherry and the receptor fused to eGFP. The vector is designed such that Cre-mediated recombination removes stop cassettes, allowing expression of mCherry and eGFP. When crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy. The goal is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis of Options:

- **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
  This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on nearby cells. However, the construct is designed for co-expression in the same cell, making an autocrine relationship more likely. Additionally, the lack of fluorescence is due to expression issues, not the mode of signaling. This option does not explain the absence of eGFP.

- **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
  If the receptor-eGFP were retained in the Golgi, it would not fluoresce on the cell surface. However, the Western blot would still detect the receptor if it were expressed, even if improperly localized. The question does not mention issues with the Western blot, and this option does not address the lack of eGFP expression entirely.

- **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
  The ligand is under the CBA promoter, a strong constitutive promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element, which should allow translation from the same mRNA. The absence of an enhancer is unlikely to completely prevent expression, especially after Cre-mediated recombination. This option does not fully explain the lack of eGFP.

- **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
  If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, translation of the receptor would terminate prematurely, and eGFP would not be expressed. This would result in no green signal under the microscope. Additionally, the Western blot might not detect eGFP, but the receptor could still be expressed. This explanation aligns with the observed lack of fluorescence and is the most plausible reason for the result.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the absence of the green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, preventing proper expression of eGFP.
