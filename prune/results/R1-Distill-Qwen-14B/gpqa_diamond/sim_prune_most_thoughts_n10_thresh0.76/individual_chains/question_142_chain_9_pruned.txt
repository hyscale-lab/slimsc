Okay, so I need to figure out where the given density matrix is located in the qubit space. Hmm, let's start by recalling what density matrices represent. I remember that a density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states.

The given matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think this is a mixed state because it's a sum of projectors. Each term here is a pure state, and they're being averaged with a probability of 1/2 each.

Wait, for a qubit, the state can be represented in a 2D space, right? But when visualizing in a geometrical space, I think about the Bloch sphere. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

So, let me think about the Bloch vector. The density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components. The general form for a single qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z).

Comparing that to the given ρ, let's expand it. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute each term:

|0⟩⟨0| is [[1, 0],[0, 0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (I)/2.

Wait, but in the general form, (I + r·σ)/2. If ρ is I/2, then that implies r·σ must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So r must be the zero vector.

What's the Bloch vector for a completely mixed state? Oh right, the completely mixed state is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|), which is exactly ρ here. The Bloch sphere's origin is at the completely mixed state, which would correspond to r = (0,0,0).

Looking back at the options: option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C
