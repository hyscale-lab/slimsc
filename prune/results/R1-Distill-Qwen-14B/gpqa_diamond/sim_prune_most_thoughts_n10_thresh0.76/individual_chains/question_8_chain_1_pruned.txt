Okay, so I've got this question about gene interactions in plants and their resistance to a fungal disease called anthracnose. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the setup: There are three candidate genes, G1, G2, G3. They created knockout mutants and some double mutants. Each mutant's resistance level is given. The control is 100% resistance. Lower percentages mean more susceptibility.

The results are:
- g1: 75% → so less resistance than wild type. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance.
- g2: 0% → complete susceptibility. So G2 is super important because without it, they have no resistance.
- g3: 50% → half the resistance, so G3 also plays a role.
Now the double mutants:
- g1g3: 10% → very low, much worse than either g1 or g3 alone.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2 alone.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2 alone.

Hmm. The question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So one of these genes is a regulator, probably a transcription factor, which activates other genes that contribute to resistance.

Looking at the data:

The most interesting points are the double mutants. Let's see:

When G2 is knocked out alone, resistance is 0%. When you knock out G2 and G3, it's also 0%. Same with G2 and G1. So in the double mutants that include G2, the resistance is as bad as the G2 single mutant. That suggests that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Because knocking out G2 alone makes everything fail, and adding another knockout doesn't make it worse than that. So when G2 is knocked out, the pathway is broken, so adding another knockout doesn't affect the outcome.

Wait, but looking at the g1g3 double mutant: 10% resistance. Both g1 and g3 alone have 75% and 50%, respectively. Their double is 10%, which is worse than either. So this suggests that G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways, perhaps. Because when you knock both out, the resistance drops further. So if they were in the same pathway, you might expect the double mutant to not be worse than the more severe single mutant. Since G1 knockout is 75%, G3 is 50%, so double would be 75% or worse. But 10% is much worse, so maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. Or perhaps their functions are additive. Alternatively, they might be redundant, but that doesn't fit with the data.

Wait, but another point: when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, which is the same as when G2 is knocked out with any other gene. So G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. So G2 must be a transcription factor activating G1 and/or G3. Because if G2 is a TF, then without it, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed (or their target genes), so the plant can't resist the disease.

Now, looking at the double mutants that don't involve G2: g1g3. Their resistance is 10%. Let's see: the single mutants have 75% and 50%, so their double is much worse. So if both G1 and G3 are nonfunctional, the resistance is worse than either one alone. So their functions are additive. That suggests that G1 and G3 are acting in separate pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, then knocking out both wouldn't make it worse than the more severe single mutant.

Wait, but why does the g1g3 double have 10% when each single has 75 and 50? Because 10% is much lower than either. So
