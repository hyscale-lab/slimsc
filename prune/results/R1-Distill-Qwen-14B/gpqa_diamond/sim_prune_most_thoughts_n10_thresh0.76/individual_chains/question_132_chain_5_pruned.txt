Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that a solution has a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

First, I need to figure out what these signals represent. In aromatic compounds, protons usually show up downfield, around 6.5-8.5 ppm. Two singlets suggest there are two types of aromatic protons, each with equivalent environments. Since the ratio is 1:1, it means each compound contributes one singlet, right? Or wait, no, because it's a 1:1 mixture. So maybe each compound has one set of equivalent aromatic protons, and each contributes a singlet. But the total is two signals, so each compound has a single set of aromatic protons.

Wait, but the question mentions "two signals in a 1:1 ratio." That probably refers to the integration of the peaks. So, each peak integrates to one proton each? No, wait, the integration is area under the peak. But each aromatic peak is a singlet. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe each compound contributes one singlet, and each is present in a 1:1 ratio. But how does that work? Let me think again.

Wait, no. The question says the mixture is 1:1 between the two compounds. The aromatic signals are two singlets each in a 1:1 ratio. So for each aromatic region, each compound contributes a certain number of equivalent protons. Since the total is two signals, perhaps each compound has only one set of equivalent aromatic protons?

Alternatively, maybe each compound has two sets of equivalent protons, but in the mixture, they average to two signals. Hmm, that might complicate things. But the options are all tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzenes.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let's compute the degrees of unsaturation. For C10H14: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2
