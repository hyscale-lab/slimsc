Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about Grubbs catalyst and a racemic mixture of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Let me think about what that entails.

So, the compound given is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of the two enantiomers, right? But wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene means the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3) something? Let me write it out.

3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pent has five carbons. Let's count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So the double bond is between 1 and 2. So structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. Let me number: 1 (CH2), 2 (CH), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me draw it.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would add a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or wait, wait. Wait, no. Let me count correctly. Carbon 1: CH2=, carbon 2: CH-, carbon 3: CH(CH3), then carbon 4: CH2, carbon 5: CH3. So yes, that's correct. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

But wait, when it's a racemic mixture, that means it has a chiral center, right? Because the double bond is in a position that could lead to a chiral center when it's opened up. Or wait, in 3-methylpent-1-ene, is the molecule chiral? Let me see. The double bond is at 1, and the substituents on carbons 2 and 3. Let me look at the structure again. Carbon 2 is CH- (from CH2=CH), and carbon 3 is CH(CH3)-. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but when the double bond is between C1 and C2, the structure on each side is CH3 (on C1, but wait, C1 is CH2. Wait, maybe I should draw it as:

Structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, no, wait. Let's think again. Pent is five carbons. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-
