Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, the problem is about heating a mixture of salts and figuring out the total number of atoms in the original salts. Hmm, let's read it again.

So, an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, is heated to 200°C without air. Only a mixture of gases is formed. Then, these gases go through some tubes. Tube 1 is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, which I think is a drying agent. Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution, which probably absorbs CO2 or something acidic. Tube 3 has red-hot copper, so maybe it's for reacting with certain gases like oxygen or maybe something like CO. 

The results are: tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g, and tube 2's weight doesn't change. Then there's 2.24 liters of gas C left at standard temp and pressure. 

I need to find the total number of atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15. 

Let me think about the process. When salts are heated, especially without air, they might decompose or react. The gases formed probably include some combination of things like NH3, H2O, CO2, maybe O2 or something else. But looking at the tubes:

Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) probably absorbs water because Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent. So if the gas mixture has water vapor, it would be absorbed here, increasing the tube's weight by 3.60g. So maybe H2O is part of the gases.

Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. This usually reacts with CO2 to form CaCO3 and water. So if the gas has CO2, it would be absorbed here. But the problem says the weight of tube 2 didn't change, so that suggests that no CO2 was present in the gas. Because if there was CO2, the solution would have reacted, increasing the weight. Since it didn't change, CO2 wasn't present. So that rules out CO2 as a gas in the mixture.

Wait, but what other gases react with Ca(OH)2? Maybe if the gas is acidic, like HCl or something, but I think Ca(OH)2 is more for CO2. Oh, but maybe if the gas is NH3, which is basic, it would react too. But in this case, tube 2's weight didn't change, meaning no reaction. So the gas must not have CO2, NH3, or any acidic gases that would react with Ca(OH)2 solution. Hmm.

Then tube 3 has red-hot copper, which probably reacts with oxygen or maybe something else. But wait, what's the product? It says CuO was formed, so the gas must have been something reacting with copper. Oh, maybe CO, because CO reacts with Cu at high temperatures to form CuO. Alternatively, maybe O2, but if the mixture was heated without air, maybe O2 isn't present. Wait, but if the original salts decompose to produce CO, which then reacts with copper to form CO2 and CuO? Or wait, maybe the gas is H2O vapor, but I don't think that would react with Cu. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is a reducing agent like H2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a sulfur-containing compound, but I don't have data on that.

Wait, in any case, tube 3 gained 0.80g, which is CuO. Let's see: the reaction for CO with Cu is 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. So each mole of CuO would correspond to a mole of CO. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is H2O? But I don't think H2O would react with hot Cu. So maybe the gas was CO. Let me think about that.

So, let's summarize what we know:

- Gas passes through Mg(ClO4)2 (tube 1), which absorbs H2O. So the gas initially has some water vapor. The increase is 3.60g, which is the mass of H2O. So moles of H2O would be 3.60g / 18g/mol = 0.2 mol.

- Gas then goes to Ca(OH)2 solution (tube 2), which didn't gain any weight. So no CO2, no NH3, etc., meaning the gas that passed through didn't include those. So that suggests the remaining gas after tube 1 and before tube 2 doesn't have CO2 or any acidic gas.

Then, the gas goes through tube 3 (red-hot Cu). The tube's weight increased by 0.80g, which is CuO. Let's calculate the moles of CuO: 0.80g / (80g/mol) = 0.01 mol. So if the reaction is CO + Cu → CuO + CO2 (but wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the reaction equation). Alternatively, perhaps CO is the gas. Let's see: the reaction would be 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. So for each 2 moles of CO, you get 1 mole of CuO and 1 mole of CO2. So if 0.01 mol of CuO formed, that implies 0.02 mol of CO reacted. Because 2 moles CO → 1 mole CuO.

So, the CO in the gas would have been 0.02 mol.

Then, after passing through tube 3, what's left is gas C, which is 2.24 liters at standard temp and pressure (STP). STP is 1 atm and 0°C, where 1 mole = 22.4 L. So 2.24 L is 0.1 mol.

What's this gas C? Since the only remaining gas isn't absorbed by any of the tubes, maybe it's nitrogen or another inert gas. But wait, let's think: what gases haven't been absorbed by any of these tubes. The first tube absorbs H2O, the second doesn't react, and the third reacts CO to form CuO and CO2. Wait, so after tube 3, any CO would have reacted, and perhaps the CO2 would be released or what? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. 

Wait, the process is that the gas mixture is passed through the tubes in order. So after tube
