Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in different solutions. The statement is incomplete, and we have to fill in the blanks. The first part is about thermodynamic factors in basic solutions, and the second is about kinetic factors in acidic solutions. The options are combinations of 'weaker/stronger' and 'faster/slower'.

Hmm, I remember that the strength of an oxidizing agent relates to its standard electrode potential. A higher (more positive) potential means it's a stronger oxidizing agent. So thermodynamically, a stronger oxidant would mean it's more likely to be reduced because it's more stable in that form.

Wait, the question says oxygen is a ... oxidant in basic solutions. So in basic conditions, how is oxygen's oxidizing strength? I think in basic solutions, oxygen tends to have a higher reduction potential. Because, for example, the O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH- reaction has a standard E° of about 0.401 V. But wait, in acidic solution, the same reaction would be O2 + 4H+ +4e- → 2H2O, and that E° is around 1.23 V. Oh, but wait, that's more positive, so in acidic solution, the oxidizing power is higher. So in acidic conditions, O2 is a stronger oxidant than in basic conditions.

Wait, but the first part of the question is about basic solutions. So if in basic solution, the E° is 0.401 V, and in acidic, it's 1.23 V. So in acidic, it's a stronger oxidant. So in basic solutions, is it a weaker oxidant? Because 0.401 is less than 1.23. So thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about the statement: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. So if in basic, the E° is lower than in acidic, then in basic, O2 is a weaker oxidizing agent. So the first blank would be 'weaker'.

Now the second part: Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. Kinetics has to do with reaction rates. So even if thermodynamically something is favorable, the rate depends on activation energy and other factors.

I remember that in acidic conditions, O2 might react faster because H+ can help in the reaction. Or maybe because it's a more concentrated form, but wait, another thought: The reaction of O2 might involve the transfer of protons. In acidic solutions, the presence of H+ ions could lower the activation energy for the reaction, making the reaction proceed faster.

Wait, but wait, the standard conditions for O2's reaction in acidic solution is O2 + 4H+ +4e- → 2H2O. The reaction in acidic solution would have lower activation energy compared to basic, perhaps because the protons help in the electron transfer. So O2 would react faster in acidic solutions.

So putting it together, thermodynamically, in basic solutions, O2 is a weaker oxidant (since E° is lower). Kinetically, in acidic solutions, O2 reacts faster because the reaction has a lower activation energy due to the presence of H+ ions.

So the blanks would be filled as: weaker and faster.

Looking at the options:

A) stronger – faster → first part is wrong.

B) stronger – slower → both wrong.

C) weaker – faster → this matches.

D) weaker – slower → second part wrong.

So the correct option is C.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in different solutions:

1. **Thermodynamic Behavior in Basic Solutions**:  
   The standard reduction potential of oxygen in basic solutions is lower (approximately 0.401 V) compared to its potential in acidic solutions (approximately 1.23 V). A lower reduction potential indicates that oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions.

2. **Kinetic Behavior in Acidic Solutions**:  
   Kinetically, the presence of H⁺ ions in acidic solutions can lower the activation energy for oxygen's reaction, making the reaction proceed faster. Thus, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions.

Combining these observations, the correct blanks are filled as follows:  
- Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.  
- Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.

From the given options:  
- **A)** Incorrect: "stronger – faster" is wrong because oxygen is weaker in basic solutions.  
- **B)** Incorrect: "stronger – slower" is wrong for the same reason.  
- **C)** Correct: "weaker – faster" matches the analysis.  
- **D)** Incorrect: "weaker – slower" is wrong because oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions.

**Answer: C**
