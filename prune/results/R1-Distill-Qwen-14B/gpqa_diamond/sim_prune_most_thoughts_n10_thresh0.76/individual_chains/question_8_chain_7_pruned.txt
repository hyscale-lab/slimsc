Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Let me try to break it down step by step because I'm a bit confused.

Alright, the setup is that there are three genes: G1, G2, G3. We made knockouts (g1, g2, g3) and double knockouts (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The experiment measured their resistance to anthracnose. The control is 100%, so higher numbers mean more resistance.

The results are:
- g1: 75% resistance. So less than control, but not as bad as others.
- g2: 0% resistance. So the plants are completely susceptible.
- g3: 50% resistance. So halfway between control and susceptible.
- g1g3: 10% resistance. Very bad.
- g2g3: 0% resistance. Also very bad.
- g1g2: 0% resistance. Also very bad.

Wait, the question says that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So maybe one of them regulates the others. Also, the idea is that if a gene is a transcription factor, knocking it out would affect downstream genes, possibly leading to more severe phenotypes.

Looking at the data, g2 knockout has 0% resistance. That's the worst. Similarly, any double knockout that includes g2 also has 0%. Like g1g2 and g2g3 are both 0%. Hmm. So when g2 is knocked out alone, resistance is gone. Similarly, without g2, even if another gene is knocked out, it's still 0%. 

What does that mean? Well, maybe g2 is a transcription factor that's critical for the resistance pathway. If you can't make the transcription factor (g2), then none of the downstream genes (maybe G1 or G3) can be expressed, so the plant can't resist the disease. So in g2 knockout, the plant is super susceptible.

Looking at g1 knockout: 75% resistance. So it's less resistant than wild type but not as bad as some others. So perhaps G1 is part of the pathway downstream of G2. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1, then knocking out G2 would prevent G1 from being expressed, leading to no resistance. But when only G1 is knocked out, maybe G2 can still activate another gene, like G3, which can provide some resistance. So the 75% could be due to partial function via G3.

Wait, but g3 knockout is 50% resistance. So without G3, the plant has half the resistance. Hmm. So perhaps G3 is another gene downstream, maybe of G2 as well. But how do they interact?

Let's think about the double knockouts. Take g1g3: 10% resistance. That's much worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) alone. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance plummets. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. Because if they were in the same pathway, their double knockout wouldn't be worse than either single; but here it's worse, so they're probably redundant or in parallel.

Wait, the question says that at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others. So maybe G2 is the transcription factor. Let me think: If G2 is a transcription factor, it might activate both G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed. Hence, g2 knockout has 0% resistance. But in the g1 knockout, perhaps G2 is still active and can activate G3, so the plant has some resistance (75%). Similarly, in g3 knockout, G2 can activate G1,
