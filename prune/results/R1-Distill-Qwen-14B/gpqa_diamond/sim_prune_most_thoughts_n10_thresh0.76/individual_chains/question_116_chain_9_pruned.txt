Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Compound A has two signals in the proton NMR. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is next to two others. Wait, no, actually, the splitting is determined by the neighboring Hs. So a triplet would be from two neighboring protons. Wait, no, wait. The splitting follows the n+1 rule. So a triplet would be from two neighboring groups (n=2), like two protons next to each other.

So for the triplet at 0.9 ppm, 6H. That's a lot of protons. 0.9 ppm usually suggests something like a methyl group attached to something else, like maybe CH2CH3 or more. And the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet is n=3, so each of those protons is next to a group with three protons. Wait, but 4H as a quartetâ€”so maybe it's a -CH2-CH2- group where each is next to two others. Or perhaps something else.

Wait, let me think. So the triplet is 6H. That could be two sets of three H each. Like maybe two methyl groups each attached to a CH2. Because if each CH2 is next to another CH2, then each CH2 would split into a quartet. Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the possible structures.

Wait, another approach: the total number of Hs in the NMR is 6 +4=10 H. But A is a compound that undergoes monobromination to form B. Monobromination suggests that A has only one position where bromine can add, or that it's a di-substituted alkene undergoing addition, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let's think about the structure of A. The triplet (6H) and quartet (4H). Hmm, think of a neopentyl group or something. Wait, neopentyl is (CH2CH2C(CH3)3?), no,
