Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Hmm, wait, the operator P is given for each component: P_x, P_y, and P_z. So P is a vector operator, I think. So the operator we need to consider is the component of P along the direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. 

Oh right, when you have an operator in a particular direction, you can write it as P·n, where n is a unit vector. Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. Because in spherical coordinates, the direction in x-z would have θ from the z-axis. Wait, actually, I think the standard is that θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the angle φ (azimuthal) is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator P·n would be P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, but then again, the way the problem is phrased, the operator is along n, which is in x-z plane. So maybe the direction is (nx, 0, nz), since it's in x-z, so the y-component is zero. So the vector is nx x-hat + nz z-hat, with nx^2 + nz^2 =1. So, maybe n is (cosθ, 0, sinθ) if θ is measured from the x-axis. Or wait, no, typically in spherical coordinates, θ is the angle from the z-axis. So if n is in the x-z plane, then its direction is given by θ from the z-axis, and φ=0. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So yeah, the components would be sinθ along x, 0 along y, and cosθ along z.

So the operator P·n would be P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Because P·n = P_x nx + P_y ny + P_z nz, and ny=0 here.

Wait, but the problem says the operator is P, the vector, along n. So the operator is P_n = P·n.

So the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

So our task is to find the eigenvector of P·n corresponding to +ħ/2.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin-½ operators along any direction can be expressed as combinations of the Pauli matrices. Wait, the given components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So maybe each component is (ħ/2) times a Pauli matrix.

Looking at the problem statement: P_x is (ħ/2) times [[
