Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star whose properties change when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots. When the spots aren't there, the star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is spotted, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases, and we need to find the factor by which it changes.

Hmm, I remember that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is proportional to the exponential of ( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, but waitâ€”since the star's surface isn't uniformly the same temperature anymore when there are spots, how does that affect the photosphere? Oh, right, the question says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So maybe the average temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K when the spots are present.

But wait, when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the rest (60%) is at 6000 K. But what about the temperature of the spotted areas? Do we know that? Wait, the problem doesn't specify the temperature of the spots themselves. Oh, but the question says that when the star has spots, the overall (average) Teff is 5500 K. So I think the question is considering the effective temperature of the entire star as 5500 K when 40% is spotted. But wait, maybe the spots are cooler than the rest? Because when spots are present, the overall Teff decreases, which makes sense because spots are dark and presumably cooler.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star's surface isn't covered, the Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K
