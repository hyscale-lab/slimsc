Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again. Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E, where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). The options are A to D, each with different combinations.

Hmm, right. So each particle is in a 1D infinite potential well. The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by E_n = (n² * E), where n is an integer (n=1,2,3,...). Because E is already given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²), each energy level is a multiple of E.

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, so they are fermions. That means they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state in the same system. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, but since they're spin-1/2, each can have two possible spin states (up or down).

Wait, the system is four particles. So I need to find the lowest possible energy configurations considering the Pauli exclusion.

So the ground state is the lowest possible energy where all four particles are in the lowest possible energy levels without violating the exclusion principle. Then the first and second excited states would be the next possible arrangements.

Let me think. For identical fermions, each state is characterized by their quantum numbers. In a 1D box, the quantum number is just n. But since particles are spin-1/2, each state can hold two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, in a 1D infinite well, the quantum state is determined by n and spin. So for each n, there are two possible spin states.

So for the ground state: we need to fill up the lowest energy levels with each particle in a unique state.

The energy levels for n=1, 2, 3, etc., each can hold two particles (with spin up and down).

So let's see. The first energy level is n=1, which can have two particles. The second is n=2, which can have two particles. So for four particles, the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) will be filled, each holding two particles.

So the ground state would have all four particles in n=1 and n=2. Each n level holds two particles.

So the total energy of the system in the ground state is the sum of the energies of each particle.

Each particle in n=1 has energy E*(1²) = E.
Each in n=2: E*(2²) = 4E.
There are two in n=1 and two in n=2.

So total energy is (2*E) + (2*4E) = 2E +8E= 10E.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the particles are identical, their states are filled in order. So the first two particles go into n=1 with opposite spins. The next two go into n=2. So yes, total energy is sum of each.

So ground state energy is 10E.

Now, the first excited state. The first excited state is the next possible state beyond the ground state. So what's the next possible arrangement?

Wait, the ground state is the lowest possible. The first excited state would be the next possible by moving one particle to a higher energy level.

Wait, but since we're dealing with fermions, the next possible state would have the next available quantum number.

In the ground state, all four particles are in n=1 and n=2. The next available state is n=3, but wait, each n can take two particles. So in the ground state, n=1 and 2 are filled. So to get the first excited state, perhaps one of the particles from n=2 moves up to n=3? But no, wait, because in the ground state, the n=2 is filled with two particles. The next possible would be to promote one of them to a higher state?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think step by step.

In the ground state, the four particles are in n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles). The next state (first excited) would have the lowest possible energy higher than the ground state. So to get that, perhaps we promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. But wait, because each n can take two, n=3 is empty. So putting a particle into n=3 would cost E*(3²) =9E per particle. So which particle do we move?

Wait, but the particles are indistinct. So the first excited state would be when the highest energy level is increased by one. So in the ground state, the highest is n=2. So first excited would be n=3. But wait, we can only put two particles into n=3, but since we have four particles in total, we have to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state would have n=3 as the highest, but how? Let me think.

Wait, in the ground state, the particles are in n=1 and n=2. The first excited state would have one particle promoted to n=3, but with spin. But wait, since each n has two possible spin states, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3? No, but wait, that might not be the case. Let me think in terms of filling the states.

Wait, the ground state is n=1 and n=2 filled. So the next available state is n=3. So to get the first excited state, maybe we promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, but the total number of particles is four. So in ground state, two are in n=1 and two in n=2. If I promote one from n=2 to n=3, then n=3 has one particle, n=2 has one, and n=1 has two. But wait, since each n can hold two, n=3 can take another. So perhaps the first excited state would have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

But wait, that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the highest n is 3, but with all lower states filled as much as possible.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider the possible arrangements. The ground state is the lowest possible energy, so the configuration is n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). The first excited state would be when the highest occupied state is as low as possible beyond the ground state.

In this case, the next available state after n=2 is n=3. So in the first excited state, perhaps one of the particles in n=2 is promoted to n=3. But wait, can we do that? Let me think about it.

Wait, but the particles are fermions, so their states are filled according to the Pauli exclusion. So the states are filled in order of increasing energy. So the first two are in n=1, next two in n=2. So for the first excited state, perhaps the third particle is in n=3 with spin up, and the fourth in n=3 with spin down? Wait, no. Because in the ground state, all four are filled in n=1 and n=2. So any excited state would require moving a particle to a higher n.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energies of each possible configuration.

Wait, the ground state is four particles in n=1 (2) and n=2 (2), so their energies are E and 4E. Total: 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E= 10E.

The first excited state would involve moving one particle to the next available energy level, which is n=3. But since each n can hold two, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3. But that would require moving two from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, but that would change the configuration to n=1 (2), n=3 (2). The total energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E =20E. Wait, but that's higher than the ground state. Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one is in n=3, so the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the energy is 2E + (4E) + (9E) = 15E. Hmm, but that would be higher than the ground state of 10E.

Wait, but how do I determine the order of excited states?

Let me think about the possible states beyond the ground state. The ground state is (n=1,2), each with two particles. The next possible arrangement would be when one of the n=2 particles is promoted to n=3. Because n=3 is higher, the energy increases. So the first excited state would have n=1 (2), n=2 (1), and n=3 (1). The total energy would be 2E (from n=1) + 4E (from n=2) +9E (from n=3) = 15E.

But wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the third particle is promoted to n=3, but the fourth remains in n=2? No, because the particles are in the lowest possible states.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of the possible states:

The ground state is (n=1,2) filled, each with two particles. The next possible state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So the configuration becomes (2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3). The energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E. But wait, another possibility is that in the first excited state, the third particle is in n=3 and the fourth remains in n=2. But that would mean three particles in n=1, which isn't possible because n=1 can only hold two.

Wait, no, because we already have two particles in n=1. So the only option is to promote one from n=2 to n=3. So that gives us two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So total energy is 2E + 4E +9E =15E. So the first excited state is 15E.

Then what about the second excited state? That would be the next state after that. The next possible would be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, making the configuration two in n=1, two in n=3, and none in n=2. Wait, but n=2 can hold two, so if we have two in n=3 and two in n=1, that would be four particles. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E =20E.

But wait, could there be a lower energy state than 20E after 15E?

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when we promote another particle from n=2 to n=3. So we go from 15E to 20E.

But another possibility is that perhaps the second excited state has one particle in n=4. Let me think. After the first promotion to n=3, the next would be promoting another to n=3, but n=3 can hold two. So if we promote both from n=2 to n=3, that would give us two in n=3, which would be higher energy but perhaps a lower total than promoting one to n=4.

Wait, the energy of n=4 is 16E. So if we have one particle in n=4, the energy would be 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) + 9E (n=3) +16E (n=4). But wait, that's five particles, which we don't have.

Wait, no, we have four particles. So in one scenario, we have two in n=1, two in n=3: total energy 2E + 2*9E = 2E +18E=20E.

Another scenario is one in n=3 and one in n=4, but that would require two more particles beyond n=1 and n=2, and we only have four. So in that case, two in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4. The energy would be 2E +9E +16E=27E, which is higher than 20E. So the lower energy state is 20E.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 20E. But looking at the options, none of them have 10,15,20. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E → No, starts at 30.

B) 4E, 10E, 50E → 4 as ground? No, that's lower than 10.

C)4E,10E,15E → Hmm, ground is 4E, first excited 10E, second 15E.

D)10E,15E,18E → Ground 10, first 15, second 18.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 20E. But that's not any of the options.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should think about the spin and the possible states again.

Wait, each particle is spin-1/2, so each n level can have two particles (spin up and down). So for four particles, the ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles), so total energy 2E + 2*4E =10E.

What about the first excited state? The next available state is n=3. So in this state, two particles are in n=3, but we would have to move two from n=2 to n=3. So the configuration becomes n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So the energy is 2E + 2*9E = 2E +18E=20E.

But then the first excited state is 20E, and the second excited is when we move two to n=4? That would be 2E + 2*(16E) = 2E + 32E=34E.

Wait, but the options don't have 20 or 34. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4. But that would require four particles: two in n=1, one in n=3, one in n=4. The energy would be 2E +9E +16E=27E. But that's higher than 20E, so that can't be the first excited state.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating the order of the excited states.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the energies for each possible configuration that can host four particles and determine which is the next higher energy.

The possible configurations are:

1. All four in the lowest possible n: n=1 and n=2. Energy 10E.

2. Two in n=1, two in n=3. Energy 2E + 2*9E =20E.

3. Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Energy 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but in configuration 3, n=2 is still partially filled. So which configuration is lower in energy, 15E or 20E? 15E is lower than 20E, so configuration 3 would be the first excited state, and configuration 2 would be the second.

So ground state: 10E.

First excited:15E.

Second excited:20E.

But looking at the options, none of them match this. Let's look again at the options.

Option C: 4E,10E,15E.

Option D:10E,15E,18E.

Wait, option D's second excited is 18E, which would be 2E (from n=1) + 4E (n=2) + 12E from n=3 (but wait, n=3 is 9E per particle). Wait, 18E can't be achieved with n=3 unless we have two particles in n=3. Because 2*9E=18E. So for the configuration 2E (n=1) + 2*9E (n=3) =2E +18E=20E, which is not an option.

So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the particles are distinguishable. But no, the question says identical spin-1/2 particles, which are fermions. So the Pauli exclusion applies.

Wait, another approach: the ground state is (n=1,2) filled with 2 each. So total energy is 10E.

The first excited state could be when one particle moves to n=3. So the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would then be another particle moving to n=3, making n=3 have two particles, so configuration is n=1 (2), n=3 (2). Energy is 2E + 2*9E=20E.

But if that's the case, then the options don't have this. So perhaps the options are wrong or I'm missing something.

Wait, the options are:

A) 30E, 39E,50E.

B)4E,10E,50E.

C)4E,10E,15E.

D)10E,15E,18E.

None of these match 10,15,20.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial configuration.

Wait, perhaps the particles are spin-1/2, so each can have two possible spins. But in one dimension, the quantum numbers might be different. Wait, no, for a 1D box, the quantum number is n, and the spin is separate.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the ground state. Let me think again.

Each level n can hold 2 particles (spin up and down). So four particles would fill n=1 (2) and n=2 (2), giving energy 10E.

Now, the first excited state is when one is promoted to n=3. So the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Total energy 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Next, the second excited state would be when another is promoted to n=3, making n=3 (2), n=2 (0), n=1 (2). So the energy is 2E + 2*9E=20E.

But the options don't have 15 and 20.

Wait, but perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3. Because that would require a higher jump, but maybe it's the next possible after the ground.

Wait, but the particles fill the lowest states first. So the first excited state would have the lowest possible arrangement beyond the ground state. So the first excited state is 15E, and the second is 20E.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at option D: 10E,15E,18E. So perhaps the second excited state is 18E, which would be 2E + 4E + 12E. Wait, but 12E isn't a possible n value. n=4 gives 16E.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4.

But wait, four particles would then be in n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (0). No, that's three particles. Or wait, maybe in the second excited state, one is promoted to n=4. So configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (0) — but that's only three particles, so we need another. Alternatively, two in n=2 and one in n=3, but that would require the fourth to be in n=4. Hmm, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each particle in the ground state is in the lowest possible states, and the excited states are the next possible. So maybe the first excited state is when one particle moves to the next possible state, which is n=3. So the energy is 10E (ground) → 15E (first excited). Then the second excited state is when another moves to n=3, making the configuration n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So energy 2E + 2*9E=20E.

But none of the options have 20E as the second excited state.

Hmm, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem. Maybe the question is not about the system's total energy but the individual energies. Wait no, the question says 'energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system'.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the sum of the individual energies of each particle in the state.

Wait, another approach: the particles are spin-1/2, so each can have two states. The ground state for four fermions would have them filled into the lowest orbitals. So n=1 (2), n=2 (2). So the energies are E, E, 4E,4E. Sum = 10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So energies would be E, E,4E,9E. Sum= E +E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be when another n=2 moves to n=3, so two in n=3. So the energies are E,E,9E,9E. Sum=2E + 18E=20E.

But again, the options don't have 20E.

Wait, looking at option D: 10E,15E,18E.

How could 18E be achieved?

Ah, wait, perhaps the particles can be in higher spin states, but that doesn't affect the energy because the spin doesn't contribute to the potential energy in this case. The spin only affects the number of available states.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the possible arrangements. Maybe another configuration is possible where the sum is lower than 20E.

Wait, another possibility: what if the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. So the energies would be E, E,9E,16E. Sum is 3E +25E=28E. But 28E is higher than 20E, so not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=4. But that only holds four particles if two are in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4. The sum would be 2E +9E +16E=27E.

Hmm, but that's higher than 20E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state isn't about moving particles to n=3 but maybe a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3, making the sum 2E + 2*9E=20E. So ground state 10E, first excited 20E, second excited 27E. But that would make the first excited state 20E, which again isn't in the options.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible energy sums for four particles.

Each particle has energy E_n = n² E.

The ground state is the sum of the four lowest possible n² E.

Which is 1² +1² +2² +2² = 1 +1 +4 +4 =10 → 10E.

The first excited state would have the next possible state, which would be the sum with the highest n being 3. So the sum could be 1² +1² +2² +3² = 1+1+4+9=15 →15E.

The second excited state would then be the next possible, which is 1² +2² +2² +3² =1+4+4+9=18 →18E.

Wait, that adds up to 18E. How?

Wait, if the four particles are in n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (1), and n=3 (1). So their energies are 1,1,4,9. Sum is 15. Then, perhaps the next would be when one more particle moves to n=3, making n=3 have two, so sum is 1+1+9+9=20.

But if the second excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), and n=4 (0), but that doesn't add up to four particles.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, and others are as low as possible. So configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). Sum is 1+1+4+16=22E. No, that's higher than 20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, which sums to 20E, but that's not in the options.

Wait, but the options don't have 15,20. So perhaps the correct answer is option D:10,15,18.

But where does 18E come from? Let me think of another configuration. Maybe the configuration is n=1 (2),n=2 (2), and n=3 (0), but that's the ground state. So not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a possible configuration. Let me think: the first excited state is when one particle moves up to n=3, making the sum 15E. The second excited state is when another particle moves up to n=4, making the sum 1+1+4+16=22E. But that's higher than 18E.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2. But that would require three particles, but we have four.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=2, but that would mean one in n=2, which was already in the first excited state. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the ground state being the sum of the four lowest possible, which is 10E. The first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, sum 15E. The second excited state is when another n=2 moves to n=3, sum 20E. But that's not in the options.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the correct answer isn't there, but that can't be. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the particles are not spin-1/2, but the question says spin-1/2. Oh, no, it does say spin-1/2.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the particles are in a three-dimensional box, but the question says one-dimensional.

Wait, maybe the question is about the individual energies, not the sum. No, the question says 'energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system', which refers to the total energy.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Perhaps the particles are not all in the same spin state, but that doesn't affect the energy.

Wait, the energy depends only on the quantum number n. So the sum is based on the sum of n² for each particle.

In the ground state: two in n=1, two in n=2. Sum is 1+1+4+4=10.

First excited state: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Sum is 1+1+4+9=15.

Second excited state: two in n=1, two in n=3. Sum is 1+1+9+9=20.

So the options don't have 20. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed. But that's impossible because it must be one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state isn't about moving two to n=3 but about moving one to n=3 and another to n=4. So sum is 1+1+4+16=22E. But that's higher than 20E, so not the second excited state.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, and others are in lower states. So the sum would be 1+1+4+16=22E. But again, higher than 20E.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Looking back at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E. So the second excited state is 18E. How to get 18E.

Wait, 18E is 2*9E. So maybe two particles in n=3. So configuration is two in n=1, two in n=3. Sum is 2*(1) + 2*(9) = 2+18=20E. Not 18E.

Wait, unless the configuration is one in n=2, three in n=3. No, that's more than four particles.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3. Wait, n=2 can hold two particles, so that would require two in n=2, one in n=3, and one more in n=4. Sum would be 4+4+9+16=33E. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, and the others are in n=1 and n=2. Sum would be 1+1+4+16=22E.

Hmm. I'm not seeing 18E. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the individual energies and the total. Let me think again. Another approach: list all possible configurations and their energies.

Possible configurations for four particles:

1. All four in the lowest possible levels:

n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → sum=10E.

2. One in n=3, others as low as possible:

n=1(2), n=2(1),n=3(1) → sum=15E.

3. Two in n=3, others as low as possible:

n=1(2),n=3(2) → sum=20E.

4. One in n=4, others as low as possible:

n=1(2),n=2(1),n=4(1) → sum=1+1+4+16=22E.

5. One in n=3 and one in n=4, others as low as possible:

n=1(2),n=2(1),n=3(1),n=4(1) → sum=1+1+4+9+16= not possible since we have four particles.

Wait, no, it's four particles. So in configuration 5, n=1(2), n=2(1),n=3(1). But that's three particles. So fourth can't be in n=4.

Wait, perhaps the next possible state after 15E is when another particle is promoted to n=3, making two in n=3. So sum is 20E.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, which has 10E,15E,18E. But wait, how to get 18E.

Wait, 18E is 2*9E. So perhaps two particles are in n=3, which would sum to 18E. But then where are the other two? They have to be in n=1.

So sum is 2*(1) + 2*(9) = 2E +18E=20E. Not 18E.

Wait, maybe the configuration is n=2 (2), n=3 (2). Sum is 2*(4) + 2*(9) =8E +18E=26E. Not matching.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ground state. Maybe the ground state isn't 10E but something else.

Wait, each particle's energy is E_n = n² E.

So four particles in the ground state would have their n's as 1,1,2,2. So sum is 1² +1² +2² +2² = 1+1+4+4=10.

But perhaps the question is asking about the energies of each individual state, not the sum. No, the question says 'energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system'. So it's the total energy.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D:10E,15E,18E, but I don't see how to get 18E. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So sum is 2*(4) + 2*(9)= 8E +18E=26E. Not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the states as being filled in a different way. For four particles, the first state (ground) is [n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2]. Then the first excited state is [n=1, n=1, n=2, n=3], sum 15E. Then the second excited state is [n=1, n=2, n=2, n=3], sum=1+4+4+9=18E.

Ah, that's it! So the configuration for the second excited state is n=1, n=2, n=2, n=3. So sum is 1 +4+4+9=18E.

So ground state is 10E (1,1,2,2), first excited is 15E (1,1,2,3), second excited is 18E (1,2,2,3).

That makes sense. So the energies are 10E,15E,18E.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D: 10E,15E,18E. So that's the correct answer.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Points:
1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Potential Well**:  
   The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]  
   Here, \(n = 1, 2, 3, \dots\) is the quantum number.

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are fermions (spin-1/2), no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each energy level \(n\) can hold two particles (one with spin-up and one with spin-down).

3. **Ground State**:  
   In the ground state, the four particles occupy the lowest possible energy levels. The first two particles occupy \(n=1\) (spin-up and spin-down), and the next two occupy \(n=2\) (spin-up and spin-down). The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
   \]

4. **First Excited State**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle is promoted to the next available energy level, \(n=3\). The configuration becomes:  
   \[
   \text{Two particles in } n=1, \text{ one particle in } n=2, \text{ and one particle in } n=3.
   \]  
   The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2(1^2E) + (2^2E) + (3^2E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

5. **Second Excited State**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle is promoted to \(n=3\). The configuration becomes:  
   \[
   \text{Two particles in } n=1, \text{ two particles in } n=2, \text{ and zero particles in } n=3.
   \]  
   The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
   \]  
   However, this configuration is not possible because \(n=3\) must remain unoccupied. Instead, the correct configuration is:  
   \[
   \text{One particle in } n=1, \text{ two particles in } n=2, \text{ and one particle in } n=3.
   \]  
   The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = E_1 + 2E_2 + E_3 = (1^2E) + 2(2^2E) + (3^2E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (30E, 39E, 50E)**: These values are much higher than the calculated energies and are incorrect.  
- **Option B (4E, 10E, 50E)**: The ground state energy (10E) is correct, but the first excited state (4E) is incorrect.  
- **Option C (4E, 10E, 15E)**: The ground state energy (10E) is correct, but the first excited state (4E) is incorrect.  
- **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E)**: Matches the calculated energies for the ground state (10E), first excited state (15E), and second excited state (18E).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **D**, as it matches the calculated energies:  
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 10E, \quad E_{\text{first excited}} = 15E, \quad E_{\text{second excited}} = 18E.
\]
