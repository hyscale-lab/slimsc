Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione under heat conditions. And I need to identify the exo product from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that [4+2] cycloadditions are part of the Diels-Alder reaction. Wait, wait a second—Diels-Alder is a [4+2] between a diene and a dienophile, right? So in this case, one molecule must be the diene and the other the dienophile.

Let me think about the structures. 2,5-dimethylthiophene—that's a thiophene ring with methyl groups at positions 2 and 5. Thiophene is an aromatic five-membered ring with one sulfur. So its structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, and each of the two adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 5) have methyl groups.

Furan-2,5-dione is another compound. Furan is a five-membered ring with an oxygen, and the 2,5-dione means there are ketone groups at positions 2 and 5. So that's a furan with two ketone groups opposite each other. Structure-wise, it's an oxygen-containing ring with two carbonyls.

Now, in the Diels-Alder reaction, the diene is usually conjugated and in a s-cis conformation, and the dienophile is usually something electron-deficient, like a ketone or an electron-deficient alkene.

So which one is the diene and which is the dienophile here? Let's see. Thiophene is aromatic, so it might not act as a diene because aromatic compounds are usually not good dienes. Wait, but wait—2,5-dimethylthiophene: the thiophene ring itself is aromatic, so perhaps it's acting as the dienophile? Or maybe the furan-2,5-dione is the dienophile.

Wait, furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups. That makes it a strong electron-deficient dienophile. Because the ketone groups are electron-withdrawing, activating the dienophile for the reaction. So probably, furan-2,5-dione is the dienophile here, and 2,5-dimethylthiophene is the diene?

Wait, but thiophene is a five-membered ring. How can it act as a diene? Because a diene is a conjugated system of four pi electrons. Wait, but thiophene has conjugated double bonds. So, if it's 2,5-dimethylthiophene, perhaps it can't act as a diene because the substituents are at the 2 and 5 positions, which are adjacent to the double bonds. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the 2,5-dimethylthiophene isn't acting as the diene but as the dienophile. Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility:
