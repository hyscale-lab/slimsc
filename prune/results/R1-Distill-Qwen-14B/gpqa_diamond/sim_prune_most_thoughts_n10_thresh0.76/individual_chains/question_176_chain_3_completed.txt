Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). So, that's a three-dimensional vector, right? The observables are P and Q, each represented by a 3x3 matrix. They want the probability of getting 0 when measuring P and -1 when measuring Q right after.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I remember that when measuring an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator. So, first I probably need to find the eigenvalues of P and Q.

Let me first look at the matrix for Q because it looks simpler. The matrix Q has elements:

Row 1: 1, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, -1

So, this is a diagonal matrix. The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are just the entries on the diagonal. So, the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, and -1. But wait, the second row has all zeros. So, when you measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, or -1.

But the question is about getting -1 for Q. So, that would mean that the state after measurement is the eigenvector corresponding to -1 for Q. Let me note that.

Next is the matrix for P. The matrix P has rows:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let me try to compute them. The eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

So, the matrix P minus λI would be:

Row 1: -λ, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, -λ

Calculating the determinant:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 [ ... ] = 0

Simplify each part. The first term is -λ times (λ² - (1/2)).

The second term is -(1/√2) times ( (-λ /√2 ) - 0 ) which is -(1/√2)(-λ/√2) = (λ)/2.

The third term is zero.

So putting it all together:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) = 0

Multiply through:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0 → -λ³ + λ = 0

Factor out λ: λ(-λ² +1) =0 → λ(1 - λ²) =0 → λ=0 or λ=1 or λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.

Wait, but the question is about getting 0 for P. So, the outcome would be 0, meaning the state collapses to the eigenvector associated with eigenvalue 0.

Now, the process is: first measure P, getting outcome 0, which projects the state into the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0. Then, measure Q on this new state and find the probability of getting -1.

Wait, the question says "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So, first P is measured, then Q is measured after. So, the order is important. I think that after measuring P, the state collapses to an eigenstate of P, and then measuring Q is done on that state.

So, the approach is:

1. Find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

2. Find the eigenvectors of Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1.

3. The initial state is (-1, 2, 1). First project it onto the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0. The probability of this outcome is the square of the amplitude.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial state is a vector. To find the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue for P, we project the state onto each eigenvector of P and find the norm squared.

But wait, P's eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. So, what are the eigenvectors for each?

Wait, let me compute the eigenvectors for P for λ=0.

We have (P -0I) v = 0 → P v =0.

So the matrix for P is:

0   1/√2   0

1/√2 0   1/√2

0   1/√2 0

So, the system is:

Equation 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 =0 → v2=0.

Equation 2: (1/√2)v1 +0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 =0 → v1 +v3 =0 → v1 = -v3.

Equation 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 =0 → v2=0.

So from equation 1 and 3, v2=0.

From equation 2: v1 = -v3.

So, the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) = v1*(1, 0, -1).

So, the eigenvector can be written as any scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1). Let's normalize it: the length is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

So, the projection of the initial state onto this eigenvector is the amplitude. The initial state is (-1, 2, 1).

Compute the inner product: [ (-1) * (1/√2) ) + 2*(0) + 1*( -1/√2 ) ] = (-1/√2) - (1/√2) )= (-2/√2) = -√2.

The probability is the square of the absolute value: | -√2 |^2 = 2.

Wait, but the initial vector should be normalized. Let me check: the initial state is (-1, 2, 1). Its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1 )= sqrt(6). So, the state is not normalized. So, perhaps I should consider it as a vector, but when computing probabilities, I need to normalize it first.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized, but the problem just gives a state. So maybe the state is already normalized, but let me check.

The sum of squares is 1+4+1=6. So, the norm is sqrt(6). So, the state is not normalized. So, perhaps the given state is a ket vector, and the probabilities are computed by projecting onto the eigenvectors, but the initial state is not normalized.

Wait, no. Let's think: when we have a state vector, it's supposed to be a unit vector. So, perhaps the given state is ( (-1), 2, 1 ) divided by sqrt(6). So, the actual state is ( (-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).

Because in quantum mechanics, state vectors are normalized. So perhaps the given vector is (-1, 2, 1), but it's not normalized. So, perhaps the state is |ψ> = 1/sqrt(6) * (-1, 2, 1).

So, when computing the amplitude, I should take the inner product of this normalized state with the eigenvector of P.

So, the initial state is |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6).

The eigenvector of P with λ=0 is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

So, the inner product <v | ψ> is [ (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 ] / sqrt(6)

Wait, no. Wait, the order matters. The inner product is v^† ψ.

So, v is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2). So, v^† is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2). ψ is (-1, 2, 1)/sqrt(6).

So, the inner product is [ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).

Which is [ (-1) +0 + (-1) ] / (sqrt(12)) → (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The square of the absolute value is (1/3). So, the probability of measuring 0 for P is 1/3.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the probability of both getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So, if the first measurement is 0 for P, the state collapses to the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0. Then, we measure Q on this state.

So, the next step is: after collapsing to the eigenvector (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2), what is the probability of measuring -1 for Q.

Wait, what's the operator Q's eigenstates? Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

Looking at the matrix for Q, it's diagonal:

1 0 0

0 0 0

0 0 -1

So, the eigenvectors are the basis vectors. Because for eigenvalue 1, it's (1, 0, 0). For eigenvalue 0, any vector in the second component, so (0,1,0). For eigenvalue -1, (0,0,1).

So, to find the probability of measuring -1 for Q, we need to project the collapsed state onto the eigenvector (0,0,1).

So, the collapsed state after P=0 is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

We need to compute the inner product of this state with the Q eigenstate (0,0,1).

The inner product is [ (1)(0) + (0)(0) + (-1)(1) ] / sqrt(2) * 1 → (-1)/sqrt(2). The square of the absolute value is (1/2).

So, the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.

But wait, the collapsed state after P=0 is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). So, if we measure Q's eigenstates, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

Wait, no. Because the state is in a superposition of Q's eigenstates.

So, the state is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2) |1> + 0 |0> + (-1)/sqrt(2) | -1 >.

So, the probability of each outcome is the square of the coefficient's magnitude.

So, for Q=-1, the coefficient is (-1)/sqrt(2), so magnitude squared is (1/2).

So, the probability is 1/2.

Wait, but the initial state after P=0 is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). So, when measuring Q, the probabilities are:

- For Q=1: |1/sqrt(2)|^2 = 1/2.

- For Q=0: |0|^2 = 0.

- For Q=-1: |(-1)/sqrt(2)|^2 = 1/2.

So, the probability of getting Q=-1 is 1/2.

But wait, the question is the probability of getting P=0 and then Q=-1. So, the combined probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.

Wait, no. Because in quantum mechanics, the probabilities are conditional. So, the process is:

1. Measure P. The probability of getting 0 is 1/3.

2. Then, the state collapses to the eigenvector of P=0. From that state, the probability of getting Q=-1 is 1/2.

So, the combined probability is the product: (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

Wait, but wait a second. Because, the state after measuring P=0 is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). When we measure Q, the possible outcomes are Q=1, 0, or -1. But the state is an eigenvector of Q? No, wait, the state (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2) is a combination of Q's eigenstates. So, as I said, the probability for Q=-1 is 1/2. So, the overall probability is (1/3) multiplied by (1/2) → 1/6.

But wait, the eigenvector for P=0 is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). Let me make sure. Because when you measure P and get 0, the state becomes the normalized projection onto the eigenspace. Since for P=0, the eigenspace is one-dimensional (as per the calculation earlier), so the state becomes (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

So, when we measure Q, we're in that state. So, the probability for Q=-1 is the square of the amplitude in the (0,0,1) component.

Which is [ (-1)/sqrt(2) ]^2 = 1/2.

So, the combined probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the entire process as the product of probabilities.

So, the overall probability is the probability of P=0 multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given that P=0.

Which is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Looking back at the options, option D is 1/6.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me go through each step again.

First, compute the probability of measuring P=0.

The initial state is ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6 ).

The eigenvector corresponding to P=0 is (1, 0, -1 ) / sqrt(2).

The inner product is [ (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) ] / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)).

Wait, no, wait. The inner product is <v | ψ>, where v is the eigenvector.

So, v is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

ψ is ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6).

So, the inner product is (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) all divided by sqrt(2)*sqrt(6).

Which is (-1 + 0 -1) / (sqrt(12)).

That's (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/3).

Then, after measurement, the state becomes (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

Now, measure Q in this state.

The state is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

Q's eigenstates are the standard basis vectors.

So, the state in terms of Q's eigenstates is:

(1/sqrt(2)) |1> + 0 |0> + (-1/sqrt(2)) | -1 >.

The probability of Q=-1 is ( (-1/sqrt(2)) )^2 = 1/2.

So, 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So, the answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the measurements of the observables \( P \) and \( Q \) in sequence. The system's initial state is given as \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), which is not normalized. Its norm is \( \sqrt{6} \), so the normalized state is:

\[
\psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found by solving \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \), yielding \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector is \( v_P = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

### Step 2: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the projection of \( \psi \) onto \( v_P \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle v_P | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \left[ (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) \right] = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P = 0) = \left| \langle v_P | \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \( v_P = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

### Step 3: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( Q \)
The operator \( Q \) is represented by the diagonal matrix:

\[
Q = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues are \( 1, 0, -1 \), and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \), \( \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \), and \( \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), respectively.

### Step 4: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \)
The state after \( P = 0 \) is \( v_P = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \). To measure \( Q = -1 \), we project \( v_P \) onto the eigenvector \( \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle e_Q | v_P \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 1 = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(Q = -1) = \left| \langle e_Q | v_P \rangle \right|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Combined probability
The combined probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P = 0, Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
