Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They want to choose the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited observing time. Both are detected via the RV method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Their orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radii, but the star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star.

Wait, okay, so transit probability depends on several factors. From what I remember, the probability of a planet transiting its star from our point of view is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us. But in reality, the chance is determined by the size of the star and the planet's orbital distance and size.

The transit probability formula I think is P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)), but since both orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero, so the formula simplifies. So P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1) → P = R_star / a_planet.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Another thought: the probability is actually more accurately given as (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by something else. Or wait, maybe it's (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (1 / (something)), but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Transit probability (P) is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. For a circular orbit, the probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by the ratio of the semi-major axis to the distance between the star and planet's orbital plane. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: The probability depends on the planet's orbital distance and the star's size. If the star's radius is R*, and the planet's orbital radius is a, then the probability is roughly (R* / a). Because the planet must pass directly in front, which is a small area relative to the sky. So the chance is proportional to R* / a.

But wait,
