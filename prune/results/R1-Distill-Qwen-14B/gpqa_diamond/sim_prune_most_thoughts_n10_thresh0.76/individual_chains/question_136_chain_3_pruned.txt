Okay, so I have this physics problem here about vector fields and integrals. Hmm, let's see. The question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r squared. So the magnitude is 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R.

Wait, right. Divergence. I remember that divergence is a measure of the magnitude of a vector field's source or sink at a given point. So the divergence of a vector field is calculated using the del operator on the field. Since the field is only radial and depends on r, the calculation should be simpler.

In spherical coordinates, for a vector field that only has the radial component, the divergence would just be the derivative of the radial component with respect to r, multiplied by the appropriate factors. Oh right, the formula is (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r), where A_r is the radial component of the vector field. So here, A_r is f(r) = 1/r².

So plugging that into the divergence formula: ∇·f = (1/(r²)) d/dr [r² * (1/r²)] = (1/r²) d/dr [1]. Wait, because r² times 1/r² is 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin? Because when r is zero, this formula might not hold. But the integral is over the volume of the sphere, which includes the origin. Oh, but the field might have a singularity there.

Wait, but if the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the integral over the volume would be zero, right? Because integrating zero over any volume gives zero. But wait, I'm recalling something about Gauss's law. Oh right, Gauss's law says that the integral of the divergence of E over a volume is equal to the enclosed charge. But wait, no, that's for E, not necessarily any vector field.

Alternatively, if the divergence is zero everywhere except at a point, but the integral is over a volume that includes that point. So, perhaps the divergence isn't zero in terms of the integral. Because some vector fields with zero divergence everywhere except at a
