Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow.

Alright, the question involves two reactions, and then some chromatography results. The main thing is to determine how many peaks the chemist observes in both types of HPLC columns after combining the products.

First, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent, lithium aluminum hydride. It's typically used to reduce carbonyl groups. So, hexan-3-one is a ketone, right? So, when you reduce a ketone with LAH, it becomes a secondary alcohol. But wait, this compound is (S) configuration, so it's a chiral center.

Wait, the structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Let me draw that. Hexan-3-one means the ketone is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2-OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, let me think. Hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. But wait, in this case, it's 5-methoxy. So the substituent is on carbon 5? Let me number the chain.

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: OCH3 attached? So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think correctly.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. But 5-methoxy would have the methoxy group on carbon 5. So carbon 1: CH3, carbon 2: CH2, carbon 3: C=O, carbon 4:
