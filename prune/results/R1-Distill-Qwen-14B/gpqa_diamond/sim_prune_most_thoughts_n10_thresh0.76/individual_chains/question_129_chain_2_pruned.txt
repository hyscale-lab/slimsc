Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's break it down step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with compound A and ending with compound E. I need to find out what compound E is based on the given information and the options provided.

First, let's outline the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are important too:

a) When compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's peak is around 1715 cm^-1.

Hmm, IR peaks usually indicate functional groups. The 1750 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so compound A probably has a ketone or maybe an ester. But since later steps involve things like HCN addition, maybe A is a ketone. Then, E's IR at 1715 cm^-1 is similar but perhaps a different carbonyl, maybe a cyclic ketone or something else.

Looking at hint a: the product is a cyclopentane derivative. The structure is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, I'm not too familiar with all the nomenclature, but I think a propan-2-ylidene group is an allyl group or something similar attached via a double bond. So, the structure has a cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2 (methyl groups) and another substituent at position 4 which is a propan-2-ylidene (maybe like a CH2-C(CH3)= group? Or perhaps a vinylic group attached.

Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. So, the reaction of compound A with a Wittig reagent gives that cyclopentane compound. A Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting a ylide with a carbonyl group. So, compound A must have a carbonyl group, which aligns with the IR data (1750 cm^-1 is a strong ketone or aldehyde stretch). But since it's reacting with a ylide, A is likely a ketone because aldehydes are less common in such reactions, but not impossible.

Wait, but let's think about the product. The product is a substituted cyclopentane with a substituent that's propan-2-ylidene. So, perhaps in the Wittig reaction, the ylide adds to a carbonyl group in A, forming a new double bond.

So, if A is a cyclopentanone (a cyclic ketone), then the Wittig would form a cyclopentane with an attached alkene. Let me draw this. Suppose A is cyclopentanone. Then the Wittig reagent would attack the carbonyl, forming a new double bond. But in the product given, the substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is (CH2)C=CH2? Or maybe more accurately, it's a group like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH2)= something? Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the product could be something like a cyclopentane ring where one substituent is a group that's part of a double bond. So, perhaps the Wittig forms a new double bond adjacent to the ring.

But maybe this is getting too detailed. Let's think about the overall reaction steps.

The first step: A + HCN → B. When a carbonyl (like ketone) reacts with HCN, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. So, compound B would be a cyanohydrin, adding a hydroxyl and a cyano group across the carbonyl. So, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol with a cyano group attached. Wait, no: the mechanism of HCN addition to ketones is that the H adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the CN- adds to the oxygen. So, the product would be a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol with a cyano group on the adjacent carbon.

So, if A is a cyclic ketone, B would have an -OH and a -CN group on adjacent carbons.

Next step: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's a hydrogenation catalyst. So, the cyano group (-CN) would be reduced to an amine (-CH2NH2?), wait no, hydrogenation of nitriles typically gives amines. But more precisely, H2 with Pd would reduce nitriles to amines. So, the cyanide group (-CN) becomes a primary amine (-CH2NH2?), but wait, that's if it's a nitrile. Alternatively, if it's a ketone plus HCN (forming a cyanohydrin), then the structure would have an -OH and a -CN group on adjacent carbons. Then, when reduced with H2 and Pd, the -CN would be reduced to -CH2NH2? Or perhaps the nitrile becomes an amine. Wait, maybe more accurately, hydrogenation of a nitrile (RCN) with H2 and a catalyst like Pd gives RCH2NH2. So, in this case, if B is a cyanohydrin, i.e., RCOH adds HCN to form RCH(OH)CN, right? Then when B is hydrogenated, the CN group would be reduced to CH2NH2. So, compound C would have an -OH and a -CH2NH2 group on adjacent carbons. Hmm, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation reduces the CN group to CH2NH2, but maybe the OH group is also involved. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

When a nitrile is hydrogenated, it typically goes through:

RCN + H2 → RCH2NH2 (primary amine).

So in compound B, if the structure is something like cyclopentanone adding HCN to
