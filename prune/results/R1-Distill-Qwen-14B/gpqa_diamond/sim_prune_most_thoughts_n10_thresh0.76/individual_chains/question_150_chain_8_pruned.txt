Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, and then determining the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, X (halogens) is 0, N is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and maybe an aldehyde group (another double bond?), but wait, an aldehyde is a carbonyl (which is a double bond), so that's another. Or maybe a ring plus some other structures.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That high chemical shift suggests an aldehyde proton (CHO), but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, a triplet. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because an aldehyde is typically a singlet unless coupled with something else—wait, maybe it's adjacent to another proton. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, could it be something else, like an aromatic proton in a specific situation? Hmm, but the other peaks are between 6-3.66 ppm.

Looking further, 6.98 ppm is a doublet (d, 2H), 6.51 is another doublet (d,2H). Those look like aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. Like two sets of doublets which could be a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents. Wait, but wait, the integrals are 2H each, so four H in total for the aromatic ring. So perhaps a benzene ring with substituents in para positions. So maybe each substituent is a group that causes the splitting.

Then 6.27 ppm, broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH group? Or maybe it's part of a conjugated system. Wait, but 2H as a broad singlet. Maybe it's adjacent to an electrondonating group like oxygen. Or perhaps it's an aldehyde adjacent to something else. Hmm.

3.66 ppm is a doublet integrating for 2H. That’s around the range for CH2 groups, maybe next to an oxygen. So perhaps an OCH2 group or a CH2 attached to something like an aldehyde.

Putting this together: The molecular formula C8H9NO suggests a structure with a benzene ring, some substituents, and possibly an aldehyde or ketone group. The NMR shows an aldehyde proton (maybe), aromatic protons, and some other protons. 

Wait, the 9.72 ppm triplet for 1H. If it's an aldehyde, why triplet? Maybe the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group. Like R-CHO, where R is CH2- something. Wait, but that doesn’t make sense because the aldehyde is at the end. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl group. For example, in a ketone or aldehyde, but if the proton is next to a double bond, maybe that could split into a triplet. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton that's coupled with two others. Like in a meta-substituted aromatic ring, but in that case, the coupling would be more complex, not a triplet. Or perhaps it's an al
