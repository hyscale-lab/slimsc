Okay, so I have this question about the detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph is a high-resolution instrument used on the VLT telescopes. It's designed for spectroscopy, which means it breaks down the light from stars into their spectral components to study things like their velocities and compositions.

The question is about whether each star listed (a to f) would be detectable given a certain signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. Detectable here probably means that the instrument can gather enough light to make a meaningful measurement.

Let me recall the factors that influence the S/N ratio. The S/N improves with more photons collected. More photons come from brighter objects, longer exposure times, larger telescopes, and lower background noise. But if the star is too faint, the S/N might drop below 10 even with an hour of exposure.

Each star in the options has an Absolute V magnitude. Absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 parsecs away. The formula that relates apparent magnitude m with absolute magnitude M and distance d (in parsecs) is m = M + 5 + 5 log₁₀(d). But wait, I might have that wrong. Oh right, it's m = M + 5 log₁₀(d/10), which simplifies to m = M + 5*(log₁₀ d) -5. So m = M +5 log₁₀ d -5.

Wait, but for each star, their absolute magnitude is given as 15 mag. So for each, I can compute their apparent magnitude based on their distance.

Apparent magnitude (m) is how bright the star appears from Earth. The lower the m, the brighter the star.

The V magnitude is a measure of brightness in the visual spectrum, which is what ESPRESSO would observe. So the fainter the star, the higher its apparent magnitude.

I think the key here is to find out the apparent magnitude of each star, then determine if ESPRESSO can achieve a S/N of 10 or higher per binned pixel in 1 hour.

But I'm not exactly sure how to connect the magnitude to S/N. Maybe I need to think about the flux received from the star. The S/N ratio depends on the flux (number of photons per unit time per unit area) and the exposure time, as well as the instrument's efficiency.

I remember that the formula for S/N is something like S/N = (flux * exposure time * efficiency) / sqrt(flux). Or wait, more accurately, the S/N per pixel depends on the number of photons detected. The formula is S/N = sqrt(N), where N is the number of photons. But this might depend on the background noise too, but maybe for simplicity, we can ignore that for this question.

Alternatively, for a given target, the S/N is proportional to the square root of the product of the exposure time and the collecting area of the telescope, divided by the distance modulus, which relates to the star's brightness.

Wait, maybe I should look up the typical
