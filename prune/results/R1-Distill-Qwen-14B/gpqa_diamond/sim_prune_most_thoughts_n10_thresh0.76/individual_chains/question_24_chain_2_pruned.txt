Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again carefully.

The problem says that there's this equimolar mixture X of two liquids. These liquids can decolorize bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, they undergo a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. So, mixture Y's components don't have the ability to do that.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Z is part of mixture Y and is a widely used solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturated—probably an alkane.

No conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X. So, whatever mixture X is, their structures don't have conjugated double bonds, meaning maybe isolated or no double bonds at all? Wait, but X's liquids can decolorize bromine water, which typically indicates unsaturation—like alkenes or alkynes reacting with bromine. But wait, if the mixture X can decolorize bromine, they must have double bonds. But the problem says no conjugated multiple bonds. So maybe each molecule in X has one double bond, not conjugated.

So, the reaction steps:

1. X (two liquids) → treated with Pt and heat → Y (two other liquids) via disproportionation.
2. X and Y hydrogenated → Z (same Z from both? Or just each gives Z? Wait, the wording says hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only Z. So Z is the product from both mixtures, but wait, Y already is a mixture, so maybe each component of Y, when hydrogenated, gives Z?

Hmm. Let me think about what Z is. Mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28% (which is about 1/7, since 1/7 is approx 14.29%). So, if the formula is CnHm, then the mass of H is (m/(12n + m)) * 100% = 14.28%. Let me compute that.

Assume the formula is CnHm. The percentage H is (m/(12n + m)) * 100 = 14.28. Let's compute that:

(m) / (12n + m) = 0.1428 approximately.

Multiply both sides by denominator: m = 0.1428 (12n + m)
m = 1.7136n + 0.1428 m
m - 0.1428 m = 1.7136n
0.8572 m = 1.7136n → m = (1.7136 / 0.8572) n ≈ 2n.

So m is approximately 2n. Maybe m=2n, so the formula is CnH2n. Wait, that's an alkene or alkyne. But Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react further with H2, so it's saturated—so Z must be an alkane.

Wait, but an alkane has the formula CnH2n+2. So let's recalculate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me set up the equation correctly.

Hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%: (m/(12n + m)) * 100 = 14.28.

So,

(m/(12n + m)) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by (12n + m):

m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)

Bring all m terms to left:

m - 0.1428 m = 0.1428 * 12n

0.8572 m = 1.7136 n

m = (1.7136 / 0.8572) * n ≈ 2n.

So m≈ 2n. But for an alkane, m is 2n+2. So 2n = 2n+2? That can't be. Hmm, maybe m=2n isn't right. Let me think of possible small hydrocarbons.

Wait, maybe Z is ethane (C2H6). Let's see: molecular weight is (2*12)+(6*1)=30. Hydrogen mass is 6/30=0.2 or 20%. Not 14.28%.

What about propane (C3H8)? H mass is 8/(36+8)=8/44≈18.18%. Still not 14.28%.

But wait, maybe it's a larger molecule. Let's compute 14.28% as a fraction. 14.28 is roughly 1/7. So 1/7 is approx 0.1428.

So 14.28% H implies that m/(12n + m) = 1/7.

So,

7m = 12n + m → 6m = 12n → m=2n.

So, m=2n. So the formula is CnH2n. Hmm, which is an alkene (double bond) or alkyne (triple bond). But Z doesn't react with H2, which suggests it's fully saturated. So perhaps Z is a cycloalkane, which is a ring structure. Because cycloalkanes don't react with hydrogen under normal conditions as they don't have double bonds anymore, but wait, cycloalkanes have ring structures which are generally not reactive unless under high pressure or specific catalysts. Wait, but if Z is a cycloalkane, like cyclopropane or cyclobutane, maybe.

Wait, cyclopropane is C3H6. Let's compute its hydrogen mass.

Hydrogen mass: 6/(36 + 6) =6/42=14.2857%. Oh! That's exactly 14.28% approximately. So Z is cyclopropane, C3H6. Wait, but cyclopropane is a ring with three carbons and each has a single bond but ring strain. But wait, cyclopropane is a cycloalkane, which is saturated. So it doesn't react with hydrogen under normal conditions. Yes, that fits the description.

So Z is cyclopropane, C3H6
