Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about identifying a compound X and determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The given data includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different compounds, mostly substituted benzoic acids and benzene derivatives.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The IR shows strong absorption between 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates the presence of O-H or N-H groups. But in this case, since the options are mostly benzene derivatives, maybe it's an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid. Also, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group, like a carboxylic acid or an ester. Another peak at 1610 cm-1 could be from aromatic C=C stretching. The 1450 cm-1 might be due to aromatic ring vibrations.

Looking at the NMR: The chemical shifts can tell us about the structure. A peak at 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid proton since they usually appear around 10-12 ppm. So, compound X probably has a carboxylic acid group.

The next peak is at 8.0 ppm, a doublet (d, 2H). That suggests two aromatic protons next to each other. Then 7.2 ppm is another doublet (2H), which are likely the ortho or para positions relative to the substituents on the benzene ring. 

The following peaks are at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is probably a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in an ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH, maybe a branching point. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) and 1.7 ppm (2H) could be part of a CH2CH2 group, possibly an ethyl chain.

Putting this together: The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. So the substituents are on opposite positions. One substituent is the carboxylic acid group, and the other is an alkyl group.

Looking at the NMR, the substituent besides the carboxylic acid is probably an isobutyl group. Wait, how? Let me think. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a CH(CH3)2 group. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is probably the end of a CH2CH2 group. So if we have a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, that would be a butyl group, maybe a sec-butyl.

Wait, the substituents on the benzene ring: One is the COOH group, and the other is a substituent like an isobutyl or sec-butyl group.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene has a COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl at position 4 (para).

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would have the substituent on the propanoic acid, which doesn't fit with the NMR. Because the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a COOH, so the substituent would be on the benzene.

Wait, let's think about the NMR again. The aromatic protons are split into two doublets: 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H). So they're para to each other. So if the substituents are on the para positions, one is COOH and the other is the alkyl group.

The substituent on the benzene would be a group like -COOH and -R, where R is an isobutyl or something else.

Looking at the NMR splitting: The 1.4 ppm as a doublet (3H) likely a CH(CH3)2 group, which is part of an isobutyl group. The 2.9 ppm (1H) could be the CH in the isobutyl group. The 1.7 ppm (2H) would be the CH2 next to the benzene ring.

So the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene. Wait, no. Let me think about the structure.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait: a sec-butyl is -CH(CH2CH2CH3), or is it -CH2CH(CH3)-something? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group, which is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the substituent is an isobutyl group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but the NMR for the substituent: at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) suggests a CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) a CH2 group. Then the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is CH3 attached to a CH, which would make a CH(CH3)2 group, which is part of an isobutyl group.

So the substituent is a isobutyl group attached to the benzene ring. So the structure would be 4-isobutylbenzoic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, but wait: what's the difference between isobutyl and sec-butyl.

Wait, sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, let me clarify.

Butyl groups: 

- n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3 attached via the first carbon.

- iso-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)2.

- sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, no. Let me draw it.

Butyl groups:

1. n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3, attached at the first carbon.

2. iso-butyl: (CH3)2CH
