Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So the problem is about a star with certain properties. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. The transition between the levels is at around 1448 Å, which I guess is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range. And the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation for this.

Wait, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Since the transition corresponds to a specific wavelength, I can find the energy difference between the levels using the photon energy equation: E = hc/λ.

But wait, the problem is about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. So I think when the star has spots, part of its surface is cooler because the spots are darker. But the effective temperature of the entire star decreases, so the overall T is lower. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature of the entire star drops to 5500 K. So the Teff is an average.

Wait, but how does this affect the photospheric conditions? The photosphere is the part we're looking at, right? So the star's overall Teff is a combination of the hotter (unspotted) and cooler (spotted) regions. But when the star has spots, the observed Teff is 5500 K. So when the problem says, "the overall photospheric
