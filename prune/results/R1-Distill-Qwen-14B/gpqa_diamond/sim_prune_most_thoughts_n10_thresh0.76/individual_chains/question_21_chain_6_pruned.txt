Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through each part step by step. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers, and it's asking about tautomerism and optical isomerism in given compounds.

The question mentions two parts, A and B. Let me break them down.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism. Hmm, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a neighboring atom (like a carbon) between two positions, resulting in different isomers. For example, keto-enol tautomerism involves switching between a keto group (like a ketone) and an enol form.

So, benzoquinone. Wait, benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. I think benzoquinone has two oxygen double bonds in the ring, maybe in positions 1,2 or 1,4. Oh wait, benzoquinone can have two forms: para (1,4) and ortho (1,2) quinones. But wait, does it undergo tautomerism? Benzoquinone is a diketone, right? So, maybe it can tautomerize. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a dienone, which can have keto-enol tautomerism.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. So positions 1,3,5 are all carbonyls. Does this compound undergo tautomerism? Well, if there are conjugated carbonyl groups, maybe. But wait, in 1,3,5-cyclohexatrione, the ketones are alternated with single bonds. So the structure is O=C-O-C-O-C-O, but in a ring. Wait, that's actually a cyclic trione.

Wait a minute, can such a compound tautomerize? Let me think. For keto-enol tautomerism, you need a structure where a hydrogen can move from an adjacent position to the carbonyl. But in a trione, each ketone is separated by a CH2 group maybe? Or maybe all three are adjacent? No, 1,3,5 would be every other
