Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about finding the probability of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details.

So, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, they are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

The operator in question has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so that's a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that out. For a two-level system, the matrix would look like:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0  ]

Wait, or is it? Because the condition is A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j. So, for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. Right, that's the structure.

I remember that for a 2x2 system, such a matrix often represents an operator that's related to the Pauli matrices. Let me think. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator's matrix is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the operator A is (hbar/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, but in terms of eigenstates and eigenvalues... The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So the operator A would have eigenvalues ± (hbar/2). Because when you have a matrix multiplied by a scalar, the eigenvalues also get multiplied by that scalar.

But wait, the problem says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of operator A. So first, I need to find the eigenstates of A. Alternatively, since A is proportional to σ_x, its eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x, which are the eigenstates of the spin operator in the x-direction. So, the eigenstates |+x> and
