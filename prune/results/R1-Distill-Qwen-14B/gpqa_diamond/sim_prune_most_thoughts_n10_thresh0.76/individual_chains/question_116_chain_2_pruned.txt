Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with compound A, and I need to figure out what compound D is. There are four possible options given. Let's break it down.

First, let's look at compound A. The proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the number of protons and their splitting can give clues about the structure. 

The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that these protons are probably in a methyl group (CH3) attached to something that causes splitting. Triplets often come from coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, no, wait—wait, the number of peaks in an NMR signal depends on the neighboring protons. A triplet implies that each of these protons is adjacent to two equivalent protons. So maybe each CH2 group is next to a CH3?

Wait, but 6H in a triplet—what structure has that? Maybe two equivalent methyl groups adjacent to a CH2 group. Like, perhaps, a di-substituted something. Oh, wait—maybe it's a neopentyl group? No, neopentyl is 2,2-dimethylpropyl. Wait, but neopentyl would have a central CH connected to two CH3 groups. But that might give different splitting.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a cyclopropane? No, because cyclopropane protons usually are around 0.5-2 ppm, but let's not get bogged down. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diethyl group. Wait, no—ethylethyl would give more complex splitting.

Wait, let me think again. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is for 6H. Could it be two methyl groups attached to a CH2 group. So, like CH2(CH3)2. Then, each methyl group's protons would be a triplet because they're next to the CH2 group, which has two protons. Each methyl group's H would split into a triplet.

Wait, but CH2(CH3)2 would be a neopentyl group, but that's when the CH2 is in the center. Wait
