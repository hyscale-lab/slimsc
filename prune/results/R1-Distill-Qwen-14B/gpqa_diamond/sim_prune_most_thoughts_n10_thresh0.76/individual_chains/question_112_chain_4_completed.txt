Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Then, we're asked to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, first, I need to normalize the state |alpha> because it's only given as proportional. Then, I should find the eigenstates of the given operator because the probabilities will correspond to the expansion of the state in terms of those eigenstates.

Wait, the operator's matrix is zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere off-diagonal. Let's think about that. The matrix is 2x2 because it's about spin-up and spin-down states. So the operator A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, else 0. So the matrix looks like:

[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

That's a 2x2 matrix. I remember that such a matrix is often related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of A. The eigenstates of σ_x are the |+x> and |-x> states. I think |+x> is (1/sqrt(2))( |up> + |down> ) and |-x> is (1/sqrt(2))( |up> - |down> ). Or wait, maybe the signs are different. Let me recall: σ_x |+x> = +|+x>, and σ_x |-x> = -|-x>.

So if I can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, then the coefficients would give me the probabilities when squared.

But before that, I need to normalize |alpha>. The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let me compute the normalization factor.

The state should be |alpha> = N [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ], where N is the normalization constant. The normalization condition is |N|^2 [ |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2 ] = 1.

Compute each modulus squared:

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the sum is 2+5=7. Therefore, |N|^2 *7 =1 → |N|=1/sqrt(7). So N = 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> all multiplied by 1/sqrt(7).

Now, express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>. Let me write |+x> as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> as (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

So we have:

a |+x> + b |-x> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

Expressing the right-hand side in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

We can write |up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2)
Similarly, |down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting into the state:

(1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) + (2 -i) (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

Factor out 1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)):

= [1/(sqrt(14)))] [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>) ]

Expanding the terms:

= [1/sqrt(14)] [ (1+i + 2 -i) |+x> + (1+i - (2 -i)) |-x> ]

Simplify the coefficients:

1+i +2 -i = 3 → coefficient for |+x> is 3.

1+i - (2 -i) = 1 + i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i → coefficient for |-x> is (-1 + 2i).

So:

|alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |-x> ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, let me double-check that expansion:

(1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) → (1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x>

(2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>) → (2 -i)|+x> - (2 -i)|-x>

Adding all together:

[(1+i) + (2 -i)] |+x> + [(1+i) - (2 -i)] |-x>

Compute each:

1+i +2 -i = 3.

1+i - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) +2i.

So yes, that's correct.

So the coefficients are 3 (for |+x>) and (-1 + 2i) for |-x>.

Therefore, the state |alpha> can be written as (3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |-x> ) / sqrt(14)

Now, the probability of measuring |+x> is |a|^2, where a is the coefficient of |+x>. Similarly for |-x>, it's |b|^2.

Compute |3|^2 / 14 → 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. Hmm, let me compute 9/14: 14 into 9 is 0.642857..., so 0.64 is correct.

Similarly, compute | (-1 + 2i) |^2. The modulus squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So 5/14 ≈ 0.3571, which is approximately 0.36. But wait, 5/14 is roughly 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded.

Wait, but wait, the options have 0.64, 0.36 as in option A, and others have combinations like 0.54, 0.46, etc.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion? Let me think again.

Wait, the coefficients after expansion were 3 and (-1 + 2i). But wait, the state |alpha> is expressed as 3 |+x> + (-1 +2i) |-x>, all divided by sqrt(14).

So the coefficients are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, so the amplitude for |+x> is 3/sqrt(14), so the probability is (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

The amplitude for |-x> is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). So the modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1+4)/14 =5/14≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So the first part of the answer would be probabilities 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the average value of the operator A. Since A is the operator with matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 for i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So the operator is A = (ħ/2) (|up><down| + |down><up| ) = (ħ/2) σ_x.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, and the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, then the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_x in state |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed as a superposition of |+x> and |-x>, let's compute the expectation value.

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha> = (ħ/2) [ <alpha| σ_x |alpha> ]

But σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |+x> and |-x> respectively.

So, |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>, where c_+ =3/sqrt(14), c_- = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

The expectation value is |c_+|^2 (1) + |c_-|^2 (-1) ) * (ħ/2).

Wait, because <sigma_x> = |c_+|^2 (1) + |c_-|^2 (-1) * (1?), since σ_x |+x> = +|+x>, σ_x |-x> = -| -x>.

Wait, let me compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>:

= |c_+|^2 (1) + |c_-|^2 (-1) + cross terms? Wait, no. Because when you expand <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>, it's (c_+^* < +x | + c_-^* < -x |) sigma_x ( c_+ |+x> + c_- | -x> )

Sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, sigma_x | -x> = -| -x>.

So the terms become:

c_+^* c_+ < +x | +x > + c_+^* c_- < +x | (- | -x> ) + c_-^* c_+ < -x | |+x> + c_-^* c_- < -x | (- | -x> )

But < +x | -x> is zero, so only the first and last terms survive.

So <sigma_x> = |c_+|^2 (1) + |c_-|^2 (-1) ).

So <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = |c_+|^2 - |c_-|^2.

We've already found |c_+|^2 =9/14, |c_-|^2=5/14.

So <sigma_x> = (9/14) - (5/14) )= 4/14= 2/7.

Then, the average of A is (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = ħ/7.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, |c_+|^2 is 9/14, |c_-|^2 is 5/14.

So |c_+|^2 - |c_-|^2 = (9 -5)/14 =4/14=2/7.

So <sigma_x> is 2/7. Then, <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) = ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options. Option A says the probabilities are 0.64, 0.36 and average ħ/7. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7.

Yes, that's exactly what we found.

So the correct probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429, and 5/14≈0.357, which round to 0.64 and 0.36. The average is ħ/7.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves a quantum state |α⟩, proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of an operator with matrix representation A_ij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j and 0 otherwise, as well as the average value of the operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The given state is |α⟩ = (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize, compute the normalization constant N using the condition ⟨α|α⟩ = 1. The squared moduli of the coefficients are:

- |1+i|² = 1² + 1² = 2,
- |2-i|² = 2² + (-1)² = 5.

Thus, the normalization factor is |N|² = 1/7, so N = 1/√7. The normalized state is:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩ \right).
\]

### Step 2: Express |α⟩ in terms of the eigenstates of A
The operator A has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix},
\]

which corresponds to \(\frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x\), where \(\sigma_x\) is the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of \(\sigma_x\) are the eigenstates of A, denoted as |+x⟩ and |-x⟩:

\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ + |down⟩), \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ - |down⟩).
\]

Express |α⟩ in terms of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩:

\[
|α⟩ = a|+x⟩ + b|-x⟩.
\]

Substitute |up⟩ and |down⟩ in terms of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩:

\[
|up⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+x⟩ + |-x⟩), \quad |down⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+x⟩ - |-x⟩).
\]

Substitute these into |α⟩:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x⟩ + |-x⟩) + (2-i)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x⟩ - |-x⟩) \right].
\]

Simplify:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \big[ (3)|+x⟩ + (-1 + 2i)|-x⟩ \big].
\]

Thus, the coefficients are:

\[
a = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad b = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate probabilities
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ are the squared moduli of the coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = |a|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64,
\]
\[
P(-x) = |b|^2 = \left(\frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{1 + 4}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the average value of A
The operator A is proportional to \(\sigma_x\), so its expectation value is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

The expectation value of \(\sigma_x\) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = |a|^2 - |b|^2 = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} = \frac{4}{14} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, respectively, and the average value of A is \(\hbar/7\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
