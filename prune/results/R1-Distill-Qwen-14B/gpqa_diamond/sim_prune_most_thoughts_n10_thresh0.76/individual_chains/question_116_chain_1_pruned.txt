Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question involves several reactions and NMR spectra. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the information.

First, compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. A triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that the triplet and quartet suggest coupling between different sets of protons. Maybe it's an alkyl chain with some branching. The 6H at 0.9 ppm likely comes from two equivalent methyl groups, each with 3H. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H could be a set of four equivalent protons, maybe a methylene group (CH2) next to another CH2 group. Wait, if it's a quartet, each of the 4H is coupled to two neighboring protons. So, perhaps it's a (CH2)2 group connected to something else.

Wait, maybe it's a neopentyl group? No, neopentyl is (CH2C(CH3)3), but the NMR doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diethyl group. Let me think: an ethyl group has a triplet for the CH3 and a quartet for the CH2. But compound A has two signals. So maybe it's something like a diethyl ether? Because diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O, and in NMR, the CH3 would be a triplet, and the CH2 would be a quartet. But wait, the integration is 6H for the triplet. That suggests two CH3 groups, each 3H, which would fit with diethyl ether. The quartet would be the CH2 connected to the oxygen. Diethyl ether's NMR usually has a triplet around 1.2 ppm for the CH3 and a quartet around 3.3 ppm for the CH2. Oh wait, but in the question, the quartet is at 1.3 ppm. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm off.

Alternatively, perhaps it's something like a diethyl group attached to something else. Maybe the structure is (CH2CH2CH3)2 something? No, that seems unlikely. Wait, another possibility: the triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) is two methyl groups,
