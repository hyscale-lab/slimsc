Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, right? And it fills the universe, so every photon of high-energy gamma-rays would interact with these CMB photons. 

The question is asking about the energy at which the lifetime of a gamma-ray is limited by this annihilation process. So, gamma-rays with higher energies would interact more quickly, meaning their lifetime is shorter because they're annihilating into electron-positron pairs more often. 

The process given is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. I think this is a pair production process, where two photons collide and produce a particle and its antiparticle. For pair production to occur, the combined energy of the two photons must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron (or the positron, which is the same), multiplied by two because you're creating two particles. Wait, no, the rest energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so each pair requires at least that. But wait, in the center-of-momentum frame, the sum of the energies should be sufficient.

But wait, when considering photon interactions, the energy and momentum conservation must be taken into account. Since photons are massless, their energy is equal to their momentum times c. So, when two photons collide, the total energy must be enough to create the rest mass of the electron and positron. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact condition.

The average energy of CMB photons is given as 1e-3 eV, which is really low. So the CMB photon has energy E_cmb ≈ 1e-3 eV. The gamma-ray has energy E_gamma, which is much higher.

So, for the pair production to occur, the combined energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least 2*m_e*c², where m_e is the electron mass, approximately 0.511 MeV. So 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV, which is about 1.022e6 eV.

But wait, the problem is about the photon-photon cross-section and the photon density in the universe. The lifetime of the gamma-ray is determined by the probability of it annihilating via this process. The mean free time would be the inverse of the annihilation rate, which
