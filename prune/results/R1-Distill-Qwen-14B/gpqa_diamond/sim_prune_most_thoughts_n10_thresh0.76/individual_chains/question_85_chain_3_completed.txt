Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

Alright, two planets orbiting a star. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, effective temperature 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 and Planet2. Their masses are 7 and 5 Earth masses, radii 1.7 and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.

The question mentions the transit and radial velocity methods. Oh, right, the transit method detects planets when they pass in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness. Radial velocity detects the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star.

But the specific data given are the shifts in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. Planet1 causes a 0.03 Å shift, Planet2 0.04 Å. Wait, but how does that relate to their masses?

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which is related to the mass of the planet and the star. The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude K is given by ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(c * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3))) ), but since e is zero (circular orbits), and M_planet is much smaller than M_star, I can approximate. So K ≈ ( (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )^(1/3) ) * (something). Wait, maybe I should think about the formula differently.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * P )/(2π) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since e=0, and M_planet is much smaller than M_star, it simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * P) / (2π c²) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i ) / M_star^(2/3) )

Hmm, but I don't have the orbital periods. Wait, but the question gives the Doppler shifts, which are K values in terms of wavelength shift.

Wait, the Doppler shift is related to velocity via the formula λ/λ0 = 1 + v/c, so v ≈ c (λ/λ0 - 1). But for small velocities, this is approximately v = c (Δλ/λ0).

In this case, the forbidden line is at 6300 Å. So for Planet1's shift, 0.03 Å:

v1 ≈ (0.03 / 6300) * c ≈ (0.03 / 6300) * 3e5 km/s = let's compute that.

Wait, 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-3 / 6.3e3 = approximately 4.76e-6. Multiply by c, which is 3e5 km/s. So 4.76e-6 * 3e5 = around 1.428 km/s. Similarly, Planet2's shift is 0.04 Å, so v2 ≈ (0.04/6300)*3e5 km/s. 0.04 /6300 is ~6.349e-6. Multiply by 3e5: ~1.9047 km/s.

Wait, but wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star induced by the planet. So K is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. But I don't have the periods. Hmm.

Alternatively, since the star's velocity (K) is given for each planet, and the star's mass is known, perhaps I can find the ratio of the planet masses or something else. Wait, but the question is about the equilibrium temperatures. So maybe I don't need the masses but the size of the orbit, because equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star.

Wait, equilibrium temperature is given by Te = T_star * (R_star / (2 a))^(1/2), where 'a' is the planet's orbital semi-major axis (since the orbit is circular, a is the radius). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)).

So to find the ratio Te1/Te2, it's sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 ). So Te1/Te2 = sqrt(a2/a1).

So to find the ratio, I need to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of the two planets. How?

Hmm, how can I get a from the RV data. Let's think. The RV method gives K, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. K is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2π) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) )

Since M_planet is much smaller than M_star (7 Earth masses is about 0.007 solar masses, and the star is 1.5 solar masses), we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ ( ( G * P )/(2π) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / M_star^(2/3)

But sin i is probably 1 because transits are detected, which implies that the orbit is edge-on, so i=90 degrees, sin i=1.

So K ≈ ( ( G * P )/(2π M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * M_planet^(1/3).

Wait, let me think again. Rearranging the formula. Let me write K as:

K = ( (G * M_planet sin i )/( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) (c) )) ) * (1/( (1 + M_planet/(M_star + M_planet))^(1/3) )) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to relate the orbital period and the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. 

Kepler's third law states that P² = (4π² G (M_star + M_planet))^-1 * a³. Since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So P² = (4π² G M_star )^-1 * a³ → a³ = G M_star P² / (4 π² )

But from the RV method, K is related to the velocity amplitude, which is given by:

K = (v_star) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star) ) ) * (1/P)^(1/3)

Wait, maybe I should express K in terms of a. Let's see.

From the formula:

K = (v) = ( (G M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) * ( (M_star + M_planet) / ( (M_planet) (1 + M_planet/M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3)

Wait, maybe it's easier to express a in terms of K.

From Kepler's third law: a³ = G M_star (P/(2π))².

But from K, we have K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) (M_planet sin i) / (c) * ( (M_star + M_planet) )^( -2/3 ) (1/(1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) * (1/( P^(1/3) ) )

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to write K as:

K = ( (G M_planet) / (c M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * (something with P and sin i).

Alternatively, perhaps I can write P in terms of a. Since P² = (4 π² a³)/(G M_star), so P = 2 π (a³/(G M_star)) )^(1/2)

Wait, plugging this into the K equation.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's consider the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2.

K1 = ( (M1) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * ( some factors )

Similarly for K2.

But if we take the ratio K1/K2, perhaps the factors involving M_star and other constants will cancel.

Wait, let's think about the formula again. The RV semi-amplitude K can be written as:

K = ( (27.4 m/s ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star / M_sun) )^(2/3) ) * ( (P/yr) )^(-1/3) )

Wait, I think I remember that formula from exoplanet data. So K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1/P)^(1/3).

But I don't have P. Hmm.

Wait, but I can combine the equations for a, since a is related to P via Kepler's law.

Kepler's third law in terms of P and a:

P² = (4 π² a³)/(G M_star)

Or, a³ = G M_star (P/2 π)^2

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Wait, let's try to find a in terms of K.

We have P expressed via a and M_star:

P = 2 π (a³/(G M_star)) )^(1/2)

So, substituting into the K equation:

K = (27.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (P/yr )^(-1/3)

But P is in years, so let's convert it.

P in years is (2 π (a³/(G M_star)) )^(1/2) ) / (yr in seconds)

Wait, perhaps it's better to express P in terms of a and M_star.

Wait, another approach: since I need the ratio of a1 and a2, perhaps I can find (a1/a2) in terms of K1, K2, M1, M2.

We have K proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (P)^(-1/3)

But from Kepler's law, P^2 ∝ a^3/(M_star), so P ∝ (a^3/(M_star))^(1/2)

So P^(-1/3) ∝ (a^3/M_star )^(-1/6) ) = (M_star)^(1/6) a^(-1/2)

So combining into K:

K ∝ (M_p) / M_star^(2/3) ) * (M_star)^(1/6) a^(-1/2) )

Which simplifies to:

K ∝ M_p * M_star^(- (2/3 - 1/6) ) * a^(-1/2 )

2/3 is 4/6, so 4/6 -1/6 is 3/6 = 1/2. So denominator is M_star^(1/2).

So K ∝ M_p / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) )

Which can be written as K ∝ ( M_p ) / ( sqrt(M_star a) )

So rearranged: a ∝ (M_p)² / ( K² M_star )

Wait, let me square both sides:

K^2 ∝ (M_p)^2 / ( M_star a )

So a ∝ (M_p)^2 / ( K^2 M_star )

So for each planet, a1 and a2 are proportional to (M_p)^2 / ( K^2 M_star )

So the ratio a1/a2 would be ( (M1² / (K1² M_star )) ) / ( (M2² / ( K2² M_star )) ) )

So a1/a2 = [ (M1² / K1² ) / (M2² / K2²) ) ] = (M1^2 K2^2) / (M2^2 K1^2 )

Therefore, a1/a2 = ( (M1/M2) )^2 * (K2/K1)^2 )

So, the square root of this ratio would be (M1/M2) * (K2/K1) ) = (M1 K2) / ( M2 K1 )

So, sqrt(a1/a2) = (M1 K2) / ( M2 K1 )

But wait, because the equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt( a2/a1 ), as earlier.

Wait, let me recap:

Equilibrium temperature Te is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(a) ) * (Luminosity factor), but wait, let me get the formula right.

The equilibrium temperature formula is:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) )

So, Te^2 = T_star^2 * R_star/(2a)

So, (Te1 / Te2)^2 = ( R_star/(2 a1) ) / ( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) = a2/a1

So, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt( a2 ) / sqrt( a1 )

Which is the square root of (a2/a1) ratio.

So, if I can find a1 and a2, I can compute this ratio.

But earlier, we have a1/a2 = ( (M1^2 K2^2) ) / ( (M2^2 K1^2) )

So, a2/a1 = ( M2^2 K1^2 ) / ( M1^2 K2^2 )

So, sqrt(a2/a1) = (M2 K1) / ( M1 K2 )

Which is the same as (M2/M1) * (K1/K2 )

Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, since a1/a2 = (M1² K2² )/( M2² K1² )

So a2/a1 = ( M2² K1² ) / ( M1² K2² )

Taking square root:

sqrt(a2/a1) = (M2 K1 ) / ( M1 K2 )

So the ratio Te1/Te2 is sqrt(a2/a1) = (M2 K1) / ( M1 K2 )

So, Te1/Te2 = (M2 * K1 ) / ( M1 * K2 )

Now, plugging in the numbers.

M1 = 7 Earth masses, M2 =5 Earth masses.

K1 is 0.03 Å shift, K2 is 0.04 Å shift.

Wait, but K is the velocity semi-amplitude, which we converted earlier into velocity. K1 is 1.428 km/s, K2 is 1.9047 km/s.

So let me compute:

Te1/Te2 = (M2 * K1 ) / ( M1 * K2 )

M2=5, M1=7.

So 5 * 1.428 / (7 * 1.9047 )

Compute numerator: 5 *1.428 =7.14

Denominator:7 *1.9047 ≈ 13.333

So ratio is 7.14 /13.333 ≈ 0.535.

So the ratio Te1/Te2 is approximately 0.535. So Te1 is about 0.535 times Te2.

Wait but the question asks for the equilibrium temperature ratio of Planet1 to Planet2, so Te1/Te2 ≈ 0.53.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_e = T_\text{star} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_\text{star}}{2a}}
\]

where \(a\) is the orbital semi-major axis of the planet. The equilibrium temperature ratio between the two planets is given by:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Thus, we need to find the ratio of the orbital distances \(a_1/a_2\). Using the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \(K\), which is proportional to the stellar velocity induced by the planet, we relate \(K\) to \(a\) as follows:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{M_\text{star} \cdot a}}
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
a \propto \frac{M_p^2}{K^2 \cdot M_\text{star}}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the orbital distances is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{M_1^2 \cdot K_2^2}{M_2^2 \cdot K_1^2}
\]

Taking the square root to find \(\sqrt{a_2/a_1}\), we get:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{M_2 \cdot K_1}{M_1 \cdot K_2}
\]

Now, substituting the given values:
- \(M_1 = 7\) Earth masses, \(M_2 = 5\) Earth masses
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\), \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)

First, calculate the velocities induced by the Doppler shifts:
\[
v_1 \approx \frac{0.03}{6300} \cdot 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \approx 1.428 \, \text{km/s}
\]
\[
v_2 \approx \frac{0.04}{6300} \cdot 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \approx 1.905 \, \text{km/s}
\]

Thus, \(K_1 = 1.428 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(K_2 = 1.905 \, \text{km/s}\).

Now, compute the ratio:
\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \frac{M_2 \cdot K_1}{M_1 \cdot K_2} = \frac{5 \cdot 1.428}{7 \cdot 1.905}
\]

Calculate the numerator:
\[
5 \cdot 1.428 = 7.14
\]

Calculate the denominator:
\[
7 \cdot 1.905 = 13.335
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \frac{7.14}{13.335} \approx 0.535
\]

The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately \(0.53\). Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**C) ~0.53**
