Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about a reaction between a specific compound and hydrogen bromide. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Hmm, let me visualize that structure.

So, the structure is a benzene ring with an ether group attached. The ether part is from the butenyl group. Breaking it down, the butenyl group is CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Oh wait, the butenyl part is but-3-en-1-yl. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-O- attached to benzene. Wait, no, let me think. But-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with substituents. Oh wait, 2,2-dimethyl means the second carbon (the CH2 in the chain) has two methyl groups attached.

Wait, let's number it. The butenyl group has four carbons. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no. The butenyl group is but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, but but has four carbons, so 1,2,3
