Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to figure out how many possible organic products are formed.

First, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions. But wait, that's more common with aliphatic compounds, right? Like when you have something like an alkyl halide reacting to form alkenes. But benzene rings are aromatic, so maybe this is a different kind of reaction.

Wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, wait. I think the 'd' might indicate a deuterium. Oh, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? So the structure is bromine on position 1 and deuterium on position 2 of benzene.

So the molecule has Br at position 1 and D (deuterium) at position 2. Now, when treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, what could happen?

I recall that under strongly basic conditions, aromatic rings can undergo elimination or dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of a benzyne intermediate. Oh wait, yes! I think the reaction of a dihalobenzene with a strong base can form a benzyne, which is a diradical or a triple bond in the benzene ring.
