Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, the question is about calculating the probability of measuring a certain observable, right? Let me try to unpack this step by step.

Alright, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, I think that's a vector, let's call it vector ψ. So ψ is a column vector:

ψ = [ -1 ]
      [ 2 ]
      [ 1 ]

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. Oh wait, the problem doesn't mention normalization, but I should check if ψ is normalized. The norm would be the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component. Let me compute that.

(-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. So the sum is 1+4+1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6), which means the state isn't normalized. So I should probably normalize it before proceeding, because probabilities are based on normalized states. But wait, the observable's eigenvalues and eigenvectors depend on the state, but maybe in this problem, since the operator is given, the normalization might not affect the result. Hmm, but I think I need to normalize the state vector first.

So the normalized state would be ψ_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. But wait, maybe the problem doesn't require normalization because the observable's eigenvalues are such that the probabilities are the same regardless, but I'm not sure. I'll proceed with normalization.

The observable is represented by matrix P. Let me write down matrix P. The problem states it's a 3x3 matrix. First row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Wait, I should check if P is a Hermitian matrix, because observable operators in quantum mechanics are always Hermitian. Let
