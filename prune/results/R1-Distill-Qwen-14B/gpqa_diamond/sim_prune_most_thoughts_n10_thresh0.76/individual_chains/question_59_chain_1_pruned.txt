Okay, so I've got this problem here about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let's see. The solutions are 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I should probably calculate the moles of each acid and base and see what's left after any neutralization reactions.

CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So the reaction between them would involve H+ ions and OH- ions, I think.

Let's calculate the moles for each component.

Starting with CH3COOH: Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 0.5 L. Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely, so 0.08 moles of H+ ions.

Ba(OH)2: It's a strong base, so it will dissociate into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. The formula is Ba(OH)2 â†’ Ba^2+ + 2 OH-. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. The volume is 0.3 L, so moles of Ba(OH)2 are 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So moles of OH- from this would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, I think the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. So the H+ from CH3COOH is only from its dissociation. Wait, but when you mix all these, will the strong acid's H+ react first?

Wait, maybe I should consider all the H+ and OH- ions together. Let's think about it.

The total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH, and the total OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, no. Because when you mix them, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. So the strong acid's H+ (HCl) will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2 first. Then, any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid's H+? Or wait, maybe the other way around.

Wait, no, it's better to think of the total H+ and total OH- in the solution. Let me calculate the net moles of H+ or OH- after all possible neutralization.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid
