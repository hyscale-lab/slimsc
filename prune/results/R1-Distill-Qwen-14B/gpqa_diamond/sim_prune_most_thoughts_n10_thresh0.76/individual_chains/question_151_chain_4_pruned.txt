Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, actually, that's probably a vector with three components. So the state vector is ψ = [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, meaning their length (or norm) is 1. Let me check that. The norm is the square root of the sum of the squares of each component.

So for ψ, the norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), which is greater than 1. So this state isn't normalized. That's important because when calculating probabilities, we'll need to normalize it. Otherwise, the probabilities might not add up to 1, which they should.

Next, the observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is [0, 1/√2, 0], the second row is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], and the third row is [0, 1/√2, 0]. Hmm, let me write that out:

P = [
    [0, 1/√2, 0],
    [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
    [0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Wait, so P is a 3x3 matrix. Now, I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P at time t will yield 0. 

In quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So first, I should find the eigenvalues of P because the possible measurement outcomes are those eigenvalues.

But wait, another approach is that the expectation value of the observable is calculated as the inner product of the state with P acting on the state. But the question isn't about the expectation value, it's about the probability of getting a specific outcome (0) when measuring P.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. To find the probability of measuring a particular value, say λ, when the state is |ψ>, the probability is |⟨λ|P|ψ⟩|², where |λ⟩ is an eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue λ.

So the plan is: find the eigenvalues of P, since the possible outcomes are these eigenvalues. Then, for each eigenvalue λ, find the eigenvectors, and compute the projection of ψ onto the eigenspace of λ. The square of the norm of this projection gives the probability of measuring λ.

But wait, what if P is a matrix that isn't diagonal? Because then, finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors could be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps P is diagonalizable, so each eigenvalue corresponds to an orthogonal eigenvector.

Let me try to find the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues
