Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I should figure out the structure of the target. Benzene ring with substituents. The positions are numbered 1, 2, 3. So substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me see:

- Position 1: ethoxy group (-OEt)
- Position 2: tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3)
- Position 3: nitro group (-NO2)

Wait, but how are these substituents arranged? The numbering might depend on the substituents' priorities. Nitro has higher priority than ethoxy or tert-butyl. So the lowest possible numbering would have nitro at position 1? Or wait, no. The substituents are at 1,2,3 positions, so let me think again.

Wait, maybe the numbering is such that the substituents are in the meta positions. Because in the target name, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, 3â€”so that's adjacent? No, 1,2,3 would be meta to each other on a benzene ring. Wait, benzene is a hexagon, so positions 1,2,3 are adjacent in a row, like 1-2-3 around the ring. Wait, no, because in a benzene ring, each substituent is at a carbon adjacent to the next. So positions 1,2,3 can't all be adjacent, because that would require three adjacent carbons, which isn't possible without overlapping. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of the benzene ring as a hexagon, numbered 1 through 6. So substituents at 1, 2, and 3 would be positions adjacent to each other in a way that each is next to the next. Hmm, no, perhaps the numbering is such that the nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2. Wait, perhaps the actual structure is such that the substituents are in the 1
