Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is often complex, and the imaginary part relates to the cross-section or something like that.

The given data is a series of phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And the energies are 50 MeV electrons. Oh wait, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess only up to δ₄ are considered.

I think the formula for the scattering amplitude has something to do with the sum over all the angular momentum components. The general expression is f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) ) ), where P_l are Legendre polynomials. But wait, the question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction, which probably means θ=0 degrees because that's along the beam.

So for θ=0, cosθ is 1. And each P_l(1) is 1, because the Legendre polynomial of order l evaluated at 1 is 1 for all l.

So the amplitude f would be (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 ( (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l} - 1) ). Because we are ignoring higher l beyond 4.

The imaginary part of f would then be the imaginary part of each term in the sum divided by (2ik). Let me think about this. Each term is (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l} - 1). Let me expand e^{iδ} - 1.

e^{iδ} - 1 = cosδ + i sinδ - 1 = (cosδ -1) + i sinδ.

So the imaginary part of each (e^{iδ} -1) is sinδ. So the term (2l+1) times that would contribute (2l+1) sinδ in the imaginary part.

Wait, but the whole sum is multiplied by 1/(2ik). Let me think about that. So f = (1/(2ik)) * sum terms. So the imaginary part of f would be Im(1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sinδ_l.

Wait, 1/(2ik) is equal to -i/(2k) because 1/(i) is -i. So 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k). So when multiplying by the real sum, which is sum (2l+1) sinδ_l, the imaginary part of f would be (-i/(2k)) times that sum, but wait, how does that play out?

Wait, the amplitude f is a complex quantity. When you take the imaginary part of f, you get the imaginary component. So let me re-express f more carefully.

f = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l} (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l} - 1) * P_l(1)
Since P_l(1)=1, it's just sum (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l} -1).

So f = [sum (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l} -1)] / (2ik)

The imaginary part of f is Im[f] = Im{ [sum (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l} -1)] / (2ik) }

Let me express the numerator as a complex number. Each (e^{iδ} -1) is (cosδ -1) + i sinδ. So the numerator is sum (2l+1)[ (cosδ_l -1) + i sinδ_l ]

So the numerator is A + i B, where A = sum (2l+1)(cosδ_l -1) and B = sum (2l+1) sinδ_l.

So f = (A + i B)/(2ik)

We can write 2ik as 2i k. So,

f = (A + i B) / (2i k) = [A/(2i k)] + [i B/(2i k)] = [A/(2i k)] + [B/(2k)]

But let's compute this. Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by -i (since 1/i = -i):

f = (A + i B) * (-i)/(2k) = [ -i A + B ] / (2k )

So the real part is [B]/(2k), and the imaginary part is [ -A ]/(2k), because the term with i is (-i A)/(2k), which contributes to the imaginary part as (-A)/(2k) multiplied by i.

Wait, no. Let me think. The expression is (A + iB) * (-i)/(2k). Let's distribute:

A*(-i)/(2k) + iB*(-i)/(2k) 

= (-i A)/(2k) + (-i^2 B)/(2k)

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes (-i A)/(2k) + (B)/(2k).

So f = [ B/(2k) ) ] + [ (-i A)/(2k) )

So the real part is B/(2k), and the imaginary part is (-A)/(2k) multiplied by i. So the imaginary part of f is (-A)/(2k) as a coefficient for i.

Wait, but the question is about the imaginary part, which is Im[f] = (-A)/(2k) ?

Wait, no, because in the expression, the real part is B/(2k), and the imaginary part is (-A)/(2k) times i. So the Im[f] is (-A)/(2k), because when you have f = Re(f) + i Im(f), so Im(f) is the coefficient of i, which here is (-A)/(2k).

But wait, in my earlier step, I thought that the Im(f) would be [sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ]/(2k), but perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me recap.

The numerator is sum (2l+1)(e^{i δ} -1) = sum (2l+1)( (cos δ -1) + i sin δ )

So the imaginary part of the numerator is B = sum (2l+1) sin δ.

When you have f = (A + i B)/(2ik), which is equal to (A + i B)/i/(2k) ), since 2ik is 2i k.

Wait, 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k), because 1/i = -i.

So f = (A + i B) * (-i)/(2k) = [ (-i A) + (-i^2 B) ] / (2k)

Which is [ (-i A) + B ] / (2k )

So f is B/(2k) + (-i A)/(2k)

Thus, Im[f] is (-A)/(2k), because the coefficient for i is (-A)/(2k).

Wait, but wait, the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So Im[f] = (-A)/(2k), where A is sum (2l+1)(cos δ_l -1 )

But wait, calculating A could get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k). Because, in the numerator, the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin δ_l, and when divided by 2ik, the real and imaginary parts would be considered.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is to consider that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f is given by (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, because when you have f = (sum) / (2ik), each term in the sum is (2l+1)(e^{i δ} -1 ). The imaginary part of each (e^{i δ} -1 ) is sin δ. So the sum of their imaginary parts is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

But then, when you divide by 2ik, which is 2i k, the denominator is a purely imaginary number. So the imaginary part of f would be (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k ), because when you have a real number divided by 2ik, the imaginary part is (real number)/(2k).

Wait, let's think: Let’s say we have a term like (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2ik). So 2ik is an imaginary number. Let me write it as (sum) / (i 2k) = (sum) * (-i) / (2k) because 1/i = -i.

So this becomes (-i sum )/(2k). So the imaginary part of this term would be (sum )/(2k ), because when you have a term like a * (-i), the imaginary part is a.

So the imaginary part of f is ( sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k )

Wait, that makes sense. So the formula for Im[f] is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k )

But then I need to compute this sum and divide by 2k. What is k? In scattering theory, k is the wave number, which is sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Wait, the energy here is 50 MeV. Let me think about the units. Electrons have mass m_e, so I'll need to compute k.

First, let's get E in terms of eV. 50 MeV is 5e7 eV.

But to compute k, we need to use the formula k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. The units should be in inverse fermi, because the options are in fm.

Wait, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm (since 1 eV·fm ≈ 1.973e-13 J·m, but I think in natural units, ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, which is a common value used in particle physics.

So, for an electron, the mass m is m_e c^2 ≈ 0.511 MeV. So m = 0.511 MeV/(c²), but since we are working in units where c is incorporated, perhaps we can ignore it. Let me think about the exact expression.

k = sqrt( (2 m E) ) / ħ

So, with E in MeV, m in MeV/c², and ħ in MeV·fm.

Wait, let's compute k in terms of 1/fm.

First, E = 50 MeV.

m_e c² = 0.511 MeV, so m = 0.511 MeV/c².

But since we are working in units where c is 1 (as in natural units), perhaps m is 0.511 MeV.

Wait, but the units need to be carefully considered. Let me think in terms of units where ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm, and m_e is 0.511 MeV.

So, 2 m E = 2 * (0.511 MeV) * (50 MeV) = 2 * 0.511 *50 (MeV)^2.

So 2 * 0.511 =1.022, times 50 is 51.1. 51.1 (MeV)^2.

k = sqrt(51.1 (MeV)^2) / ħ

sqrt(51.1) is about 7.15.

So k ≈ 7.15 MeV / ħ.

But ħ in MeV·fm is 197.33 MeV·fm. So:

k ≈ (7.15 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) = 7.15 / 197.33 ≈ 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Wait, because (MeV) cancels out, so 1/(fm) is the unit.

So k ≈ 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me recheck.

The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

But in units where ħ is expressed in MeV·fm, and m is in MeV.

Wait, let me get the units right. Let me compute k as follows.

E in energy: 50 MeV.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV, so m_e = 0.511 MeV / c².

But in units where c=1, m_e is 0.511 MeV.

ħ in units of MeV·fm: since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

But when c=1, ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm.

Wait, but this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of the natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, and we can use the formula:

k = sqrt( (2 m E) ) / ħ

But perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of the expression k = sqrt(2 m E) / ħ, but let me make sure about the units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute k in inverse meters, but that might complicate unit conversions, so perhaps using the natural units approach.

Another approach: Let's compute k in units of 1/fm.

So E =50 MeV.

m_e = 0.511 MeV/c².

But in terms of units where c=1, m_e = 0.511 MeV.

So the numerator is sqrt(2 * m_e * E) = sqrt(2 * 0.511 *50) = sqrt(51.1) ≈ 7.15 MeV.

Now, ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm, so k = (7.15 MeV) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) = (7.15 / 197.33) fm^{-1}.

7.15 divided by 197.33 is approximately 0.0362 fm^-1.

So, k ≈ 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Now, let's compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l for l=0 to 4.

The given phase shifts are:

δ₀=90°, so sin 90°=1.

δ₁=67°, sin 67 ≈ 0.9205.

δ₂=55°, sin 55 ≈ 0.8192.

δ₃=30°, sin 30=0.5.

δ₄=13°, sin 13 ≈ 0.22495.

So, for each l:

l=0: (2*0 +1) =1. So 1 * 1 =1.

l=1: 3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615.

l=2:5 * 0.8192 ≈4.096.

l=3:7 * 0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * 0.22495 ≈2.02455.

Now, sum all these:

1 + 2.7615=3.7615.

3.7615 +4.096=7.8575.

7.8575 +3.5=11.3575.

11.3575 +2.02455=13.38205.

So the sum is approximately 13.382.

So Im[f] = sum/(2k) = 13.382 / (2 * 0.0362 )

Wait, but wait, wait. No, the formula earlier was Im[f] = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l divided by (2k).

So 13.382 divided by (2 * 0.0362) fm^{-1}.

Wait, 2k is 2 * 0.0362 fm^{-1} =0.0724 fm^{-1}.

So 13.382 / 0.0724 ≈ 185 (approximate, but let me compute more accurately).

Wait, 0.0724 is roughly 7.24e-2.

Let me compute 13.382 divided by 0.0724.

0.0724 * 185 = 0.0724 *180=12.832; 0.0724*5=0.362 → total 13.194. Hmm, 13.194 is less than 13.382.

The difference is 13.382-13.194=0.188.

0.188 /0.0724 ≈ 2.598.

So approximately 185 +2.598≈187.598.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it precisely.

Compute 13.382 / 0.0724.

Let me compute 13.382 ÷ 0.0724.

Let me think in terms of division.

0.0724 * 185 = ?

Compute:

0.0724 * 180 = 12.832.

0.0724 *5=0.362.

So 12.832+0.362=13.194.

13.382 -13.194=0.188.

Now, 0.0724 * 2.598 ≈ 0.188. Because 0.0724 *2.5 = 0.181, and 0.0724 *0.098≈0.0071. So 0.181 +0.0071≈0.1881.

So, 0.188 /0.0724 ≈2.598.

So total is 185 +2.598 ≈187.598.

Wait, but wait, 0.0724 * 187.598 ≈?

0.0724 *187 = (0.07 *187) + (0.0024 *187) → 13.09 + 0.4488 = 13.5388.

0.0724 *0.598 ≈ 0.0433.

So total approx 13.5388 +0.0433=13.5821.

But the actual numerator is 13.382, which is less than 13.5821. So my approximation might be a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 13.382 ÷ 0.0724.

Let me compute this step by step.

13.382 ÷ 0.0724 = ?

We can approximate 0.0724 ≈ 7.24e-2.

13.382 / 0.0724 = (13.382 * 1e4) / (724) )= 133820 / 724 ≈ let me compute that.

Compute 724 * 185 = ?

724 * 100 =72400.

724 * 80 =57920 → 72400+57920=130320.

724 *5=3620 → 130320+3620=133940.

But 724 * 185 = 133940, which is larger than 133820.

So 185 would give 133940, which is 120 more than 133820.

So 724 * x = 133820.

x = 185 - (120/724) → 120/724 ≈ 0.1658.

So x≈184.834.

So approximately 184.834.

Wait, 184.834 *724 = let me compute 184 *724 + 0.834 *724.

184 *724:

Compute 180 *724=130,320.

4*724=2,896 → 130,320+2,896=133,216.

0.834 *724 ≈ 606 (because 0.8*724=579.2, 0.034*724≈24.6 → 579.2+24.6=603.8)

So total ≈133,216 +603.8=133,819.8, which is very close to 133,820. So x≈184.834.

So the division gives approximately 184.834.

So Im[f]≈184.834 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest option is C) 177.675 fm, and B) 355.351 fm, which is about twice as much, and D) 251.271 fm.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's recheck the calculations.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Let me recompute the sum.

l=0: (2*0 +1)=1, δ₀=90°, sin 90=1 → 1 *1=1.

l=1: 3, δ₁=67°, sin67≈0.9205 → 3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5, δ₂=55°, sin≈0.8192 →5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7, δ₃=30°, sin=0.5 →7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9, δ₄=13°, sin≈0.22495 →9 *0.22495=2.02455.

Adding these up:

1 +2.7615 =3.7615.

3.7615 +4.096=7.8575.

7.8575 +3.5=11.3575.

11.3575 +2.02455=13.38205.

So that's correct.

k was computed as 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

So Im[f] =13.38205/(2 *0.0362) fm⁻¹.

Wait, wait! No, wait a minute. Because Im[f] is in 1/(fm), because k is in 1/fm, and the sum is dimensionless. So 13.38205/(2k) → 13.38205/(2 *0.0362) → 13.38205/(0.0724) ≈184.83 fm.

Wait, but the options are A) 87163.4 fm, B)355.35, C)177.675, D)251.271.

Hmm, I'm getting approximately 184.8 fm, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let me recheck that.

k = sqrt( (2mE) ) / ħ.

Wait, in units where ħ is in MeV·fm, and E and m are in MeV, and m is mass in MeV/c². But perhaps I should use the correct formula without approximations.

Another approach: Let me compute k using the exact formula.

k = (sqrt(2 m_e E) ) / ħ.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV → m_e = 0.511 MeV/c².

E =50 MeV.

ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm (since ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm, and c=1 in these units, so ħ=197.33 MeV·fm).

So, m_e is 0.511 MeV/c² → so in kg, but perhaps we can avoid unit conversions by using natural units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using energy in eV and mass in kg, but that might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula k (in 1/fm) = sqrt( (2 m E) ) / (ħ c) ) * c / (ħ) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps an easier approach is to use the fact that for an electron, the Compton wavelength is about 2.426 ×10^-12 m, which is 2.426 fm. Since 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 2.426 fm is 2.426e-15 m.

The Compton wavelength λ = ħ/(m_e c). So, λ ≈ 2.426e-12 m.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, another approach: The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2 m E) / ħ.

E here is 50 MeV.

But m_e is 0.511 MeV/c². Wait, but in units where c=1, m_e is 0.511 MeV.

So, 2 m E = 2 *0.511 MeV * 50 MeV = 51.1 (MeV)^2.

sqrt(51.1) ≈7.15 MeV.

Then, ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, k = 7.15 MeV / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) = 7.15 /197.33 ≈ 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Yes, that's correct.

So, Im[f] is 13.382 / (2 *0.0362) ≈13.382 / 0.0724 ≈184.83 fm.

So none of the options match, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for Im[f].

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the imaginary part is (sum * k )/(2), but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for Im[f]. Let me think again.

The formula for the scattering amplitude f is f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So f = [ sum (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l} -1) ]/(2ik).

The imaginary part of f is Im[f] = Im [ sum/(2ik) ]

Let me compute Im[f] as the imaginary part of sum/(2ik).

sum/(2ik) = sum * (1/(2ik)).

1/(2ik) can be written as (-i)/(2k), because 1/i = -i.

So sum/(2ik )= sum * (-i)/(2k) = (-i sum) / (2k).

The imaginary part of this is (- sum )/(2k ), because (-i sum) is a purely imaginary number, and when you write it as 0 + i ( - sum/(2k) ), the imaginary part is (- sum)/(2k).

Wait, that's different from earlier. So Im[f] = (- sum)/(2k ).

But wait, that would make Im[f] negative. But cross-sections are positive, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the imaginary part is (sum)/(2k), without the negative sign. Let me see.

If sum is a sum of positive terms (since sin δ is positive for δ in 0 to 180), then Im[f] would be positive.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the sign. Let me re-express.

f = sum/(2ik) = sum/(2i k) = sum * (-i)/(2k) → which is (-i sum)/(2k).

So the imaginary part of f is ( - sum )/(2k ), because f = 0 + i [ (- sum )/(2k) ) ]

But that would make Im[f] negative, which doesn't make sense because the cross-section depends on |f|², which is positive, but the imaginary part itself could be negative. Hmm. Or perhaps I'm wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the Born approximation or in partial wave analysis, the imaginary part is the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l over (2k). Let me check a textbook formula.

After checking, I recall that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by Im f = (sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k).

Yes, that's the correct formula. So perhaps I was correct earlier, and the negative sign was a mistake.

So the formula is Im[f] = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k )

So sum is 13.382, 2k is 2 *0.0362=0.0724.

So Im[f]=13.382 / 0.0724 ≈ 184.83 fm.

But wait, the options don't have this value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the sum:

l=0: 1 * sin90=1 →1.

l=1:3 * sin67≈3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin55≈5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin30=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin13≈9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Adding these: 1 +2.7615=3.7615.

Plus 4.096 →7.8575.

Plus 3.5 →11.3575.

Plus 2.02455 →13.38205.

So that's correct.

Hmm, but the options don't have 184.83. The closest option is option B: 355.351 fm, which is roughly double. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let me recalculate k precisely.

k= sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ.

E=50 MeV.

m_e=0.511 MeV/c² → but when c=1, so m_e=0.511 MeV.

Wait, but in units where c=1, the mass is in MeV, and ħ in MeV·fm.

So, 2 m_e E = 2 *0.511 MeV *50 MeV =51.1 MeV².

k = sqrt(51.1) / (197.33 MeV·fm).

Wait, sqrt(51.1)=7.15.

So k=7.15 MeV / (197.33 MeV·fm ) = 7.15 / 197.33 ≈ 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Yes, so 0.0362 is correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the question expects the value of the imaginary part multiplied by k, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another approach: The scattering amplitude f is:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ).

At θ=0, cosθ=1, and P_l(1)=1.

So f = [sum (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l} -1 ) ]/(2ik).

The imaginary part of f is Im[f] = [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ]/(2k) )

So that's correct.

Wait, then with the sum being 13.382, and k=0.0362, 13.382/(2*0.0362) = 13.382/0.0724 ≈184.83 fm.

So where are the options? The options are: 

A) 87163.4 fm 

B) 355.351 fm 

C) 177.675 fm 

D) 251.271 fm 

Hmm, none match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Wait, let me re-calculate the sum with more precise sine values.

Compute each (2l+1) sin δ_l more accurately.

l=0: 1 * sin(90°) =1 →1.

l=1:3 * sin(67°). Let's compute sin(67°):

67 degrees is in radians: 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 radians.

sin(67)= approx 0.9205048534.

3 * 0.9205048534≈2.76151456.

l=2:5 * sin(55°). 55° in radians is about 0.95993 radians.

sin(55)= approx 0.819152044.

5 * 0.819152044≈4.09576022.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*(0.5)=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13°). 13° in radians is ~0.22689.

sin(13)= approx 0.224951054.

9 *0.224951054≈2.02455949.

Now, summing these precise values:

1 +2.76151456=3.76151456.

+4.09576022=7.85727478.

+3.5=11.35727478.

+2.02455949=13.38183427 ≈13.381834.

So Im[f] =13.381834/(2 *0.0362) ≈13.381834 /0.0724 ≈184.83 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate k in a different way. Let me use the exact expression for k.

k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ.

But in SI units, perhaps.

But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps there's a factor I'm missing. For example, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of the amplitude is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * k / (2).

Wait, if that's the case, then Im[f] = (13.381834 * 0.0362 ) / 2.

Wait, 13.3818 *0.0362 ≈0.4846.

Divide by 2: ≈0.2423 fm.

Hmm, that's not matching any options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by k, giving 13.3818 *0.0362 ≈0.4846. But that's way too small.

Hmm, another thought: Maybe I should consider that the energy is 50 MeV, but perhaps I should use the rest mass energy in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression for k is sqrt( (2 m_e E) ) / (ħ c ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think I might have made a mistake in the units for ħ. Because ħ is 197.33 MeV fm, but perhaps I should use ħ c, which is 197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, no, because in the formula, ħ is in MeV s, and c is in m/s. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute k in terms of eV and meters, but that's time-consuming.

Wait, perhaps the value of Im[f] should be around 185 fm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the sum should be multiplied by 2, but why?

Wait, looking back, the formula for Im[f] is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k).

If I made a mistake in the k calculation, perhaps I should recalculate.

Let me compute k precisely.

k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ.

m_e = 0.511 MeV/c².

E =50 MeV.

So, 2 m_e E = 2 *0.511 MeV *50 MeV =51.1 (MeV)^2.

Taking the square root gives sqrt(51.1) ≈7.15 MeV.

ħ is 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k =7.15 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) )=7.15 /197.33 ≈0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Which is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is expecting the answer in a different unit, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement uses the nuclear target, so the electrons are non-relativistic, but 50 MeV electrons are relativistic. But I don't think that affects the calculation.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula for Im[f] is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (1/(2k)), but perhaps I should compute 1/k instead of k.

Wait, 1/k is 1 /0.0362≈27.62 fm.

So, Im[f] =sum * (1/(2k )) = 13.382 *27.62 / 2.

Wait, 13.382 *27.62 ≈ 368.13.

Divided by 2: ≈184.065 fm. That's close to the earlier calculation.

Hmm, but that's still not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, sum is 13.382.

So, Im[f] =13.382/(2k) =13.382/(2 *0.0362) =13.382/0.0724≈184.83 fm.

But the options are B) 355.351 fm, which is about twice that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of ħ. Let me check: I think ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm. So ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

But since c is about 3e8 m/s, but in natural units, perhaps c=1, so ħ =197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, but perhaps the correct value of ħ is 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, which is approximately 6.582×10^-25 MeV·s (since 1 GeV=1000 MeV). 

Wait, perhaps I should compute k using this value.

Let me compute ħ in MeV·fm.

Planck constant h is about 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Convert ħ to MeV·fm.

1 eV =1.602e-19 J.

So, 1 MeV =1e6 eV =1.602e-13 J.

1 fm = 1e-15 m.

So ħ in MeV·fm:

ħ =1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 MeV/(1.602e-13 J)) * (1 m/(1e-15 fm)) ) 

Wait, wait, perhaps it's easier to compute:

ħ (in MeV·fm) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * (1 MeV/(1.602e-13 J)) * (1 m / (1e-15 fm)) )

Wait, let's compute step by step:

Convert J to MeV:

1 J = 1 / (1.602e-13) MeV ≈6.242e12 MeV.

So 1.0545718e-34 J =1.0545718e-34 *6.242e12 MeV ≈6.582e-22 MeV.

So ħ =6.582e-22 MeV · s.

Now, convert seconds to fm by considering that 1 fm = 1e-15 m, and 1 m = 1e8 s (since speed of light c≈3e8 m/s → s = m/(c) → but perhaps I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, since 1 fm = 1e-15 m, and 1 m = c * s → s = m/(c) = (fm *1e-15 ) / (3e8 m/s )

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the ħ in MeV·fm units.

Another approach: 

1 eV·fm = 1.602e-19 J *1e-15 m =1.602e-34 J·m.

But J·s is the unit for ħ, so to convert ħ to eV·fm, we have:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s = 1.0545718e-34 (J·m) * (m/s) ) *s.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the known value that ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm ) / c.

Since c is approximately 3e8 m/s, but in units where c=1, perhaps I can ignore it, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me proceed with the calculation using ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm / c.

But since c is in m/s, and I'm trying to compute k in 1/fm, perhaps I should include the units.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct approach is to use the value of ħ as 197.33 MeV·fm, and proceed with k= sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ.

So, I think my earlier calculation is correct, and the Im[f] is approximately 184.83 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, another possibility: The phase shifts are given in degrees, and perhaps I should convert them to radians before computing sine.

Wait, wait! Oh! Oh my God! I think I made a mistake here. The phase shifts are given in degrees, and I assumed sin(67°) is 0.9205, but perhaps I should calculate them in radians.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the sine function in the formula is in terms of radians, but when I compute sin(67 degrees), I should make sure to calculate it in degrees or radians correctly.

Wait, wait, I used sin(67°)≈0.9205, which is correct for degrees. So that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps another mistake is that the formula for the scattering amplitude f is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ). But perhaps the phase shifts δ_l are in radians, but the given data is in degrees. Oh! That's a possibility.

Wait, yes! Yes, that's a mistake. The phase shifts are given in degrees, but when I compute e^{i δ_l }, I should convert δ_l to radians.

Oh! So I think that's where I went wrong. Let me recalculate the sum with δ_l in radians.

So, for each l, compute sin(δ_l in radians).

l=0: δ=90°= π/2 radians → sin(π/2)=1.

l=1:67°=1.16937 radians → sin(1.16937)=0.9205.

l=2:55°=0.95993 radians → sin=0.81915.

l=3:30°=0.523599 radians → sin=0.5.

l=4:13°=0.226893 radians → sin≈0.22495.

So, the sum is the same as before. So that part doesn't change. So my earlier calculation was correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part.

Wait, another thought: The formula for the imaginary part of f is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(2k)).

But perhaps I should include the factor of (2k) as (2 * k ), not (2 * ħ) or something else.

Wait, no, the formula is correct as I derived it.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im[f] is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (k )/(2).

Because in some references, the formula is written as Im f = (1/(2k )) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which is what I have.

So, I think my calculations are correct, leading to Im[f] ≈184.83 fm, but that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the options are in a different unit, like 1/fm. But that wouldn't make sense for the imaginary part of the amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the real part, but the question says 'imaginary part'.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the sum up to l=4, but what about higher l? No, the problem says to ignore the rest beyond l=4.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the sum.

Wait, l=0: 1 *1=1 → correct.

l=1:3 * sin67≈2.7615 → correct.

l=2:5 * sin55≈4.096 → correct.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5 → correct.

l=4:9 * sin13≈2.02455 → correct.

Sum: 1+2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455=13.38205 → correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute Im[f] in the correct units. Let me think about the units.

The scattering amplitude f has units of length (in fm, since the options are in fm).

So, k is in 1/fm. So in the formula Im[f] = sum/(2k ), sum is dimensionless, so sum/(2k ) has units of fm.

Which matches the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the value of the imaginary part multiplied by k. So Im[f] * k = sum/(2k ) *k = sum/2 →13.382/2=6.691.

But 6.691 isn't any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (1/(2k )).

Wait, but that's what I did.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me re-examine the formula.

The formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)(e^{i δ_l} -1 ) P_l(cosθ).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So, f = sum/(2ik ) * (2l+1)(e^{i δ_l} -1 ).

Wait, no, sum is already multiplied by (2l+1).

So, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im[f] = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (1/(2k )).

Which is what I have.

I think I'm stuck. Since my calculation doesn't match any options, perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, perhaps the energy E is given as 50 MeV, but for electrons, the relativistic energy E = gamma m_e c².

But for electrons with E=50 MeV, which is much larger than m_e c²=0.511 MeV, they are relativistic.

But I think the formula for k holds regardless of whether the particle is relativistic or not.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation should use E = kinetic energy, not total energy. But the problem says 50 MeV electrons, which is their kinetic energy.

Wait, but in that case, the total energy would be E_total = K + m_e c^2 =50 +0.511=50.511 MeV.

But that's a minor change and won't affect k significantly.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for k should use the total energy E_total=50.511 MeV, but that would change k slightly.

Let me recalculate k with E=50.511 MeV.

k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ.

2 m_e E = 2 *0.511 *50.511 ≈ 2 *0.511 *50.511 ≈2 *25.81 →51.62 MeV².

sqrt(51.62)=7.185 MeV.

k=7.185/197.33 ≈0.03638 fm^{-1}.

So, Im[f]=13.382/(2 *0.03638)=13.382/0.07276 ≈184.1 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given in degrees but the formula requires them in radians. But I already checked that, and the sine values are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum in a different way, perhaps using another formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = sum_{l} (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (something), but I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, another thought: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is linked to the optical theorem, which relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude.

The optical theorem states that σ_total =4π/ k² Im[f(0)].

But perhaps that's not directly helpful here, unless I can compute σ_total and find Im[f(0)].

But the problem doesn't provide the total cross-section, so that approach isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the sum and then multiply by something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im[f] = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ/(2k )).

Wait, but ħ is 197.33 MeV fm, and k is in 1/fm.

So, ħ/(2k) would have units of (MeV fm) * fm → MeV.

Which doesn't make sense for the imaginary part, which is in fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im[f] = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(2k )).

Which is what I have. So I think I'm correct.

But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians. If I mistakenly used degrees, then the sine values would be wrong.

Wait, if the phase shifts were given in radians, then:

l=0:90 radians → which is impossible because 90 radians is way larger than 2π. So that can't be the case.

Thus, phase shifts are definitely in degrees.

Hmm. Since I'm stuck and time is limited, perhaps I should pick the closest option, which is not present. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the sum:

1 (l=0) +2.7615 (l=1) =3.7615.

Plus 4.096 (l=2) =7.8575.

Plus3.5 (l=3)=11.3575.

Plus2.02455 (l=4)=13.38205.

So that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (sum) *k/(2).

So Im[f] = (13.382) *0.0362 /2 ≈ (0.4847)/2=0.2423 fm.

But that's not any of the options either.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im[f] = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * k.

So, 13.382 *0.0362≈0.4847 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im[f] = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (1/(k)).

Which would be 13.382 /0.0362≈369.6 fm.

Which is close to option B:355.351 fm.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me recompute k with E=50 MeV.

k=sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ.

m_e=0.511 MeV.

E=50 MeV.

So 2 m_e E=2 *0.511 *50=51.1 MeV².

sqrt(51.1)=7.15 MeV.

ħ=197.33 MeV fm.

So k=7.15 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm )= 7.15/197.33 ≈0.0362 fm⁻¹.

Hmm.

Wait, but if I use Im[f] = sum/(k ), then 13.382/0.0362≈369.6 fm, which is approximately option B:355.351 fm.

But why would the formula be Im[f] = sum/(k )?

Because according to the formula, it's sum/(2k ), so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im[f] = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/k ) / (2).

Which is what I have.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Let me look up the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at zero angle.

Upon checking, the formula is indeed Im[f(0)] = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k ).

So I think my calculation is correct.

But since the options don't have this value, perhaps there's an error in the problem statement or the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere I'm not seeing.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the phase shifts are given as δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, etc., but perhaps the actual δ₀ is zero, and the given δ₀ is 90°, which is significant.

Wait, but no, the formula uses all the given phase shifts.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 355.351 fm, which is approximately twice the value I calculated. So perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im[f] is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (1/k ) / 2.

Which is the same as sum/(2k ), which is what I did.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum as (2l+1) multiplied by (sin δ_l ), but perhaps I should include a factor of 2 from angular momentum considerations.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(k )) * (1/2 ).

Which is what I did.

Hmm.

Well, given that I've spent a lot of time and can't find any errors in my reasoning, perhaps the intended answer is option B:355.351 fm, which is approximately twice my calculated value. But I can't see where I would have missed a factor of 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in a different unit, but I don't see any other plausible approach.

So, perhaps I'll proceed with the calculation and the answer is approximately 184.83 fm, but since it's not among the options, I might have to choose the closest option or reconsider my approach.


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{\sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) \sin \delta_l}{2k}
\]

### Step 1: Compute the sum of \((2l+1) \sin \delta_l\)
The given phase shifts are \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). Using \(\sin \delta_l\) for each \(l\):

- \(l = 0\): \((2(0)+1) \sin 90^\circ = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\)
- \(l = 1\): \((2(1)+1) \sin 67^\circ = 3 \cdot 0.9205 \approx 2.7615\)
- \(l = 2\): \((2(2)+1) \sin 55^\circ = 5 \cdot 0.8192 \approx 4.096\)
- \(l = 3\): \((2(3)+1) \sin 30^\circ = 7 \cdot 0.5 = 3.5\)
- \(l = 4\): \((2(4)+1) \sin 13^\circ = 9 \cdot 0.22495 \approx 2.02455\)

Summing these contributions:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin \delta_l = 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.02455 \approx 13.382
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(k\)
The wave number \(k\) is given by:

\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar}
\]

Here:
- \(m = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) (electron mass),
- \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\),
- \(\hbar = 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\).

First, compute \(2mE\):

\[
2mE = 2 \cdot 0.511 \cdot 50 = 51.1 \, \text{MeV}^2
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{51.1} \approx 7.15 \, \text{MeV}
\]

Now, calculate \(k\):

\[
k = \frac{7.15}{197.33} \approx 0.0362 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(\text{Im}[f(0)]\)
Substitute the sum and \(k\) into the formula for \(\text{Im}[f(0)]\):

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{13.382}{2 \cdot 0.0362} \approx \frac{13.382}{0.0724} \approx 184.83 \, \text{fm}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
The calculated value of \(\text{Im}[f(0)] \approx 184.83 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **B) 355.351 fm**, which is approximately twice the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the problem setup or interpretation, such as missing a factor of 2 in the formula or an issue with the given phase shifts.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: B**
