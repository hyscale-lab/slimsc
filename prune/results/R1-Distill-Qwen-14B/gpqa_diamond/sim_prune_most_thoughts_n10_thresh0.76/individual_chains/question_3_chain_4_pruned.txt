Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, expectation value. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average outcome if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. Right, so for a given state, the expectation value of an operator O is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩.

The state given is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let's write that as ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2. Wait, I should note that sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. So a is 0.5, and b is about 0.866. But since the coefficients are given, I can work with exact values.

The operator is 10σz +5σx. To find the expectation value, I can use linearity, so the expectation is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩, where ⟨σz⟩ is the expectation of σz and ⟨σx⟩ is the expectation of σx.

Wait, yes, because expectation is linear. So I can compute each expectation separately and then combine them.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, their expectation values are straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

The expectation of σz is a^2 * (+1) + b^2 * (-1). Because when you have ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, then ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ is |a|^2 * 1 + |b|^2 * (-1).

Let me compute a^2 and b^2. a is 0.5, so a^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. b is sqrt(3)/2, so b^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that's ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5.

Next, I need to find ⟨σx⟩. Oh wait, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are not the same as σz's. So I can't directly
