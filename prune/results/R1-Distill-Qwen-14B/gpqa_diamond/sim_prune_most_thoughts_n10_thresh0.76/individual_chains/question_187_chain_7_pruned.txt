Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes. It's designed for things like exoplanet detection, right? So the key here is the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel during a one-hour exposure. The question says a star is detectable if the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel.

Wait, what determines the S/N ratio? I think it's based on the star's brightness, or in other words, how much light it emits and how much reaches the telescope. So the formula for S/N depends on factors like the star's magnitude, the telescope's collecting area, the exposure time, and the instrument's efficiency.

I remember something about the formula for S/N ratio. Let me try to recall. I think it's something like S/N = (flux * sqrt(exposure time)) / noise. But I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: the S/N increases with the square root of the exposure time. So if exposure time doubles, S/N goes up by sqrt(2). But in this case, it's fixed at 1 hour.

Wait, what's the relation between a star's apparent magnitude and the S/N? Because if a star is brighter (lower magnitude), it will have more flux, leading to a higher S/N.

ESPRESSO's performance probably depends on the star's brightness. The question lists several stars with different distances and absolute magnitudes. Absolute magnitude is the brightness at a standard distance of 10 parsecs. So the apparent magnitude depends on how far away the star is.

The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where M is absolute magnitude and d is distance in parsecs. So I can calculate each star's m.

Once I have the apparent magnitude, I can figure out how bright it is. But wait, how does this relate to S/N? I think the S/N depends on the photon flux from the star. Brighter stars (lower m) would have higher S/N.

The ESPRESSO spectrograph's S/N depends on the V magnitude of the star. I think the V band is what's typically used. So let's calculate each star's apparent V magnitude.

Let's go through each option:

Option a) Canopus. I think Canopus is a bright star. I remember it's one of the brightest stars in the sky. Its apparent magnitude is about -0.7, maybe even brighter. So that's way below the others. Definitely, it's detectable.

Option b) Polaris. Polaris is the North Star. I think its apparent magnitude is around 2.0, give or take. So that's brighter than the Sun (which is about 4.8?), but not as bright as Canopus. But wait, how does that compare to what ESPRESSO needs?

Options c to f are stars with absolute magnitude 15 mag, varying distances. So let's compute their apparent magnitudes.

Star c: distance 1
