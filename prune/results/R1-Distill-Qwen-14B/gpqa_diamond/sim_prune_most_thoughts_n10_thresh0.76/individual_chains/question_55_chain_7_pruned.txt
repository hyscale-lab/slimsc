Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which compound it is. Let's take it step by step.

Alright, the unknown compound is one of four: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. Hmm, I remember that propenyl and butenyl are similar but differ in the chain length. Propenyl would be a three-carbon group, and butenyl is four.

The NMR data given is:
- 7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quadruplets? Or maybe a doublet with some splitting. The description is a doublet but with a 'q' perhaps? Wait, the question says dq. So that's a doublet of quadruplets? Or maybe a doublet with a quartet overlap? I'm a bit confused.
- 2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet. That's probably the acetate's methyl group, since acetates typically have a singlet around 2 ppm for the OAc group.
- 1.6 ppm: 3H, doublet. That might be a CH2 group next to another CH group, perhaps adjacent to the double bond.

Let me think about the structure of each compound. Acetate esters have the structure OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group. So the R group is connected via an oxygen to the acetate.

If it's propenyl acetate, the R group would be CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but wait, the configuration (cis or trans) would matter. But wait, propenyl is a three-carbon group with a double bond. So for propenyl, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, but for the configuration, propenyl could be either cis or trans? Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2, but a double bond in propenyl can't be in the middle because propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-...? Wait, no, wait. Wait, prop
