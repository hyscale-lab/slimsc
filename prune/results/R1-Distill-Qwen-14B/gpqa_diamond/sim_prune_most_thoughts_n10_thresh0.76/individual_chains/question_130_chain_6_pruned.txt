Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it carefully. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm. I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. But wait, if the hydrogen clouds are between us and the quasars, the quasar's light has to pass through these clouds. The Lyman alpha absorption line would then be imprinted in the quasar's spectrum. But why is redshift important here?

Redshift (z) tells us how much the wavelength of the light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The formula for redshift is (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength)/emitted wavelength. So, in this case, the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms (the Lyman alpha line), right?

But wait, the quasars themselves emit light, which includes the Lyman alpha emission line at 1216 Angstroms. However, when this light passes through neutral hydrogen clouds, those clouds absorb the same wavelength, creating absorption lines. So, the quasar's own Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms, and the hydrogen clouds will absorb that, but also shift that wavelength due to their own redshift.

Wait, but the clouds are in front of the quasars, so their redshift would be higher than the quasars', right? Or maybe the quasars are more distant, so the clouds have a lower redshift. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

No, wait, the question is about the clouds being detected via their absorption of the quasar's light. So the quasar emits light, which includes the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms. The neutral hydrogen cloud is between the quasar and us. So the cloud's own redshift (z_cloud) would cause the Lyman alpha absorption line to shift to a longer wavelength. The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is λ_rest * (1 + z_cloud).

But wait, the qu
