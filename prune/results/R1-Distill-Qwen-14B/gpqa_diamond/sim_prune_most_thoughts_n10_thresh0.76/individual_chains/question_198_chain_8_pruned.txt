Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think through it step by step. The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in a solution. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, stability constants—right, those are the formation constants. Each β represents how stable a particular complex is. So, the higher the β, the more the complex will form.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. Hmm, wait, I think dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. But wait, the complexes are probably CoSCN, Co(SCN)_2, etc. So, the blue ones are probably the Co(SCN)_n complexes where n is 2 or 4? Or wait, I think I remember that in the case of Co(II), the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is blue, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is something else. Or maybe it's the other way around. Oh, right, the blue complex is the dithiocyanato, which is the [Co(SCN)_2]^(+) complex, which is the second complex in the series. Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the complexes and their colors.

Wait, the complexes are probably ordered by the number of SCN- ligands. So, the first complex is [CoSCN]^+, the second is [Co(SCN)_2]^+, the third [Co(SCN)_3]^3- (maybe?), and the fourth [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but the β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because β4 is lower than β3. So perhaps the series isn't strictly increasing. Wait, maybe the complexes have different stoichiometries
