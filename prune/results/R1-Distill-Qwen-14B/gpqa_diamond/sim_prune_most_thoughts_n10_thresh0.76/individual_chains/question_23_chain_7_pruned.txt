Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, the TLC showed the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. Which of the options could be the products?

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, they typically undergo an addition reaction. The mechanism is usually electrophilic addition. The HBr adds across the double bond, but the position depends on the structure of the alkene and the conditions.

Looking at the starting material, the structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that mentally. The benzene ring has an ether group, O-, attached to a butenyl group. The butenyl has a double bond between C3 and C4 (but-3-enyl), and there are two methyl groups on C2. So the structure is O-benzene attached to a CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-enyl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So but-3-enyl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, numbering is different. Let me think again. But-3-enyl would have the double bond starting at carbon 3: so the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that can't be right because but-3-enyl is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, but but has four carbons. So 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-benzene. Wait, no, but the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the structure is O-benzene connected to a butenyl group where the double bond is between C3 and C4, and two methyl groups on C2.

Wait, maybe the structure is O-benzene attached to CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So it's O-benzene-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but but-3-enyl has the double bond between C3 and C4, so the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? But that doesn't make sense because but-3-enyl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but perhaps the double bond is between C2 and C3? Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, the correct structure should be the butenyl group as follows: the position of the
