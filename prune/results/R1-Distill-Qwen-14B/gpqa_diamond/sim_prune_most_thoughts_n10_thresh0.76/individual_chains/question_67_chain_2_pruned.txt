Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let's see.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Ignoring their spin, the coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has l=1 (since p orbitals have l=1). Then, the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

The problem is asking about the joint probability that both L₁z and L₂z have eigenvalues of -ħ when measured. So, I'm thinking about L₁z being the z-component of angular momentum for the first electron, and same for L₂z for the second.

Wait, the eigenvalues for L_z are mħ, right? So for each electron, the possible m values are -1, 0, +1 because l=1. So if we measure L₁z and L₂z, each could be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

But the question is about the probability that both are -ħ. So, both m₁ and m₂ would be -1 in that case. Because the eigenvalues are mħ, so m=-1 corresponds to -ħ.

Wait, but the state is |1,1,2,-1>. That's a coupled state. I remember that when combining two angular momenta, the total state is a combination of all possible |l₁, l₂, m₁, m₂> states that add up to the given l and m.

But wait, the coupled state is written as |l₁, l₂, l, m>, which is |1,1,2,-1>. So I think this state is already the eigenstate of the total angular momentum L² and L_z. So any state in this coupled basis is a specific combination of the product states in the uncoupled basis.

So the given state is |l₁=1, l₂=1, l=2, m=-1>. Now, how does this break down into the product states |m₁, m₂>?

I think the general approach is to express this coupled state as a linear combination of the uncoupled states. The uncoupled states are |m₁, m₂>, where m₁ + m₂ = M, and M is the total m in the coupled state. Wait, in the coupled state, m is the sum of m₁ and m₂. Because L_z is additive, so L_z = L₁z + L₂z, so M = m₁ + m₂.

So in our case, the coupled state has M = m = -1. So any product state |m₁, m₂> that adds up to -1 can be part of this state.

The given coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>, which is an eigenstate of L² and L_z. So when you expand this into the product states, each term will have m₁ + m₂ = -1.

The possible (m₁, m₂) pairs that sum to -1 are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), but wait,
