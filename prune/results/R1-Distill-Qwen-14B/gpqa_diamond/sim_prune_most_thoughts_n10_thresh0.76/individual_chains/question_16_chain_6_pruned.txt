Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when the compound has chiral centers, which are carbon atoms attached to four different groups. Also, if a compound has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. So I need to check each compound one by one.

Let's start with the first compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, no, wait. Wait but wait, but it's but-1-ene, so double bond between C1 and C2. So structure would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another substituent. Let me draw it: 

It's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1: Cl, double bond (so two substituents), and two single bonds to C2 and maybe another hydrogen. Wait, the structure would be Cl-C double bonded to CH(CH3), and then another CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting the first carbon with Cl and the second with methyl. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to a CH(CH3). So structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would be Cl on C1, and methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but that would make it 1-chloro-3-methylbut-1-ene? Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the structure right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl attached to the double bond. Wait, the formula is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another substituent. So is the molecule planar around the double bond? Because for optical activity, it's about chirality. If the molecule has a double bond, the substituents on either side determine if it's cis or trans. But does that lead to a chiral center?

Wait, the carbons in the double bond aren't chiral centers because they have double bonds, so they only have three substituents. So in this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and two CH2 groups? Wait, maybe not. Let me think: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So adding Cl to C1 and methyl to C2. So the structure becomes Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, because wait, but the double bond is between C1
