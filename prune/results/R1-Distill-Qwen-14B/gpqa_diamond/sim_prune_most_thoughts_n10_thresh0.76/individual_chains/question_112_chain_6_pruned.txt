Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I'm dealing with spin-½ systems here, I think. The first part is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The elements Aij are hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Then, I need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, I need to normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional. So, the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To find the actual state, I must divide by the normalization constant.

The normalization is done by taking the inner product of the state with itself. So, the inner product is (1+i)*(1-i) + (2-i)*(2+i) because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

Calculating each term: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i + i - i² = 1 +1=2. Wait, no: (1+i)(1-i)=1^2 - i^2=1-(-1)=2. Oh wait, that's correct. So that term is 2.

The next term: (2-i)(2+i) = 4 +2i -2i -i^2 = 4 - (-1)=5. So sum is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the operator's matrix is A with elements Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So A looks like:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Wait, yes. Because if i != j, which for a 2x2 matrix means the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are ħ/2, and the diagonal elements (i=j) are 0.

This matrix is Hermitian? Let me check: A_ij = (ħ/2)(1 - δ_ij), where δ is Kronecker delta. So yes, it's Hermitian because A_ij = A_ji* (but since all elements are real, it's symmetric, so Hermitian). So it's an observable, which is good because we're measuring its eigenstates.

The eigenstates of this operator A would be the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X operator, scaled appropriately, perhaps. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], which is similar to A. Wait, but A has off-diagonal elements of ħ/2. So A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, let me see: Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) X.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of X. The eigenstates of X are the |+> and |-> states, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So the operator A has eigenvalues. Let me find them. Since A = (ħ/2) X, and X has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

But wait, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Wait, but |alpha> is given in the |up> and |down> basis. The eigenstates of A are |+x> and |–x>, which are combinations of |up> and |down>.

So first, I need to express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |–x>, and then the coefficients' squares will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the probability by using the projection formula. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |alpha> and the corresponding eigenstate.

Let me proceed.

First, write |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, and then normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So, |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

The eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |–x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no: the X eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |–x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), correct.

So, to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |–x>, I can write:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |–x>.

To find a and b, I take the inner product
