Okay, so I need to find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium atom has 3 protons and usually 4 neutrons, but this one has 3 neutrons. So the isotope would be Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

Wait, but when we talk about heavy ions in colliders, we're usually considering the mass of the ion. So the ion is Li-6, which has a mass number of 6. But wait, protons and neutrons have masses, but when calculating the mass of the ion, I think we can approximate it as simply A times the mass of a nucleon. But wait, maybe that's not precise. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is given by the sum of protons and neutrons, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Maybe the question expects me to use the rest mass of the ion as A times the mass of a proton, but considering that neutrons are slightly heavier. Or perhaps I can just use the formula for relativistic energy.

Wait, the formula for relativistic energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m_0 c². But to find gamma, I need the speed v, which is 0.96c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that.

So v = 0.96c. Let me compute v squared: (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.0784 is 7.84e-2. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, right? Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1 / 0.28
