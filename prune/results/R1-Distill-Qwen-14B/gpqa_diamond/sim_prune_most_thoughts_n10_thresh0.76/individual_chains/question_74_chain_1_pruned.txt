Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay. Hmm, let me think. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The key thing is that the decay process is memoryless, right? That means the probability of the atom decaying doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. 

The problem says that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. So, if I let P(t) be the probability that the atom decays by time t, then P(100) = 0.32. 

Wait, how do I relate that to the decay constant? The formula for the probability that a nucleus has decayed by time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. 

So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Rearranging that, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100. 

Let me compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately... since ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, maybe 0.68 is a bit lower? Let's see, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. So, λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is asking about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, no, the setup is a bit tricky. So far, 50 minutes have passed without decay. So the remaining time we're considering is from 50 to 200 minutes (since 50 +150=200). 

But wait, no, the wording is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Oh wait, no, wait: the total time from now would be 150 minutes. Because 50 minutes have already passed, and the current time is t=50. We want the probability from t=50 to t=50+150=200. But because the decay is memoryless, the probability from now on (starting
