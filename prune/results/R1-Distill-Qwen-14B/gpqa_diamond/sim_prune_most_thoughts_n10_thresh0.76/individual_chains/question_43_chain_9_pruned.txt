Okay, so I need to figure out the correct IUPAC name for this benzene ring compound. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, the benzene ring has three substituents: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, and they're all meta to each other. Hmm, meta means each is separated by one carbon, so their positions are 1, 3, 5 or similar.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, meta positions are two carbons apart. So in a benzene ring, if one substituent is at position 1, the next meta would be at 3, and the third meta would be at 5. But wait, all three can't be meta in that way because benzene is a six-membered ring. Oh wait, no, in benzene, each substituent is either adjacent (ortho), next with one in between (meta), or opposite (para). So if substituents are all meta to each other, maybe each is two positions apart from the others. Let me visualize.

Alternatively, perhaps the three substituents (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano) are all at positions that are meta relative to each other. But maybe I should approach this step by step.

The main functional group here is the carboxylic acid because it has the highest priority. So the numbering of the ring should start from the carboxylic acid group as position 1. Then, the other groups will be numbered based on their positions relative to this.

Wait, the substituents are meta to each other. So if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the aldehyde and nitrile should be at positions 3 and 5, or 3 and 5 in some order.

But wait, the question says that all three are meta to one another. So for three substituents, each pair must be meta. Hmm. Let me think: on benzene, if substituent A is at position 1, substituent B (meta to A) would be at position 3, and substituent C should be meta to both A and B. Wait, but position 5 is meta to position 2, not 3. Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about the substituents relative to the carboxylic acid. Let's say the carboxylic acid
