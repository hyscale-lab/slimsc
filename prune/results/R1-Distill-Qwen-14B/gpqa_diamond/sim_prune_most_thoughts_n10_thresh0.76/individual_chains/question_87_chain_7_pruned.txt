Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question says I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm, so let's break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The total number of carbons is 8, but benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 carbons. Wait, but wait, substituents can sometimes be more complex.

Wait, wait, the ring is 6-membered, so that's the benzene ring part. The substituents are two groups attached to the ring. Let me think: if the total carbons are 8, then the substituents contribute 8 - 6 = 2 carbons. So each substituent must be a single carbon group, or maybe one is two carbons and the other is zero? But that doesn't make much sense for di-substituted.

Wait, no. Wait, another approach: the benzene ring has 6 carbons. The substituents could be two groups, each maybe one or two carbons. Let me think about possible substituents.

The FTIR shows a carbonyl group. Carbonyl is a C=O group. So one substituent is probably a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. Also, there's an aromatic-halogen bond, like a halogen substituent on the ring. So another substituent is a halogen, like Cl, Br, I. Wait, but wait: if the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen, then each is attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but wait: the carbonyl group might be part of a substituent that's larger. Like, for example, an acyl group attached via a single bond. Let's think: a benzaldehyde substituent would be a CHO group, which is a carbonyl. Alternatively, an ester group, like OCOOR, but that's three carbons if R is ethyl, for example. Wait, but the total carbons in substituents are 2. So the substituents must have a total of 2 carbons.

Wait, but the substituents can't be too big. Let me think: if one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br, I), which is just one atom, but not a carbon. Wait, the carbonyl group could be part of a substituent. Let me think: the substituents could be a -CO- group attached via a single bond, but that's a carbonyl group attached to the ring. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene has 6, so the substituents must contribute 2 carbons. So substituents are likely two groups each with one carbon, or one substituent with two carbons.

Wait, but substituents on benzene could be, for example, a methyl group and another substituent. But in this case, the substituents have to include a carbonyl group and a halogen. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone (CO-) but that would require more carbons. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a methyl group. For example, an acetyl group (CH3CO-), but that's two carb
