Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to remember.

The question says there are five exoplanets in a system, all with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that method affects this particular problem. Probably not; maybe it's just context.

These planets are in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, the periods are P1, P2 = 2P1, P3 = 2.5P1, P4 =3.5P1, and P5=5P1. So each planet's period is a multiple of P1.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 4 and Planet 2. They have the same albedo, which I know is the measure of how much light that hits a planet is reflected. Since albedo is the same, I don't have to worry about that factor in the temperature calculation.

Equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering the energy it absorbs and the energy it emits. The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (R_star) / (a) )^(1/2 ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Oh wait, another way—since all these planets are in the same star's system, I can probably model their temperatures using the inverse square law for radiation.

The formula should be T = T_earth * ( (P_planet / P_earth) )^(-1/4) ), but wait, no. Wait, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period, because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, and the planet's period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law.

Wait, let me think again. Kepler's third law says that the orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. So P^2 ∝ a^3. So a ∝ P^(2/3).

Since the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance (inverse square law), the flux F is F = L/(4πa^2). So the energy received per unit area is proportional to 1/a², which is equal to 1/(P^(4/3)) because a is proportional to P^(2/3). So F ∝ P^(-4/3).

Then, the equilibrium temperature depends on the fourth root of the absorbed energy. But since the albedo is the same, all the energy is absorbed in proportion. The planet emits as a blackbody, so the power is σT^4, and the absorbed power is F*(1 - albedo). Since albedo is same, F is proportional to T^4.

So T ∝ F^(1/4) ∝ (P^(-4/3))^(1/4) ) = P^(-1/3).

Wait, let me compute that exponent. P^(-4/3)
