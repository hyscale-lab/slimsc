Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me think. The operator is P, which is a vector operator, right? So P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

The question is asking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 when the operator P is measured along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh wait, right, in quantum mechanics, when you measure the spin along a direction n, the eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along that direction.

So, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator along a direction n is given by the dot product of the Pauli matrices and the vector (n_x, n_y, n_z), multiplied by ħ/2. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each multiplied by their respective components.

Wait, but in this problem, each component of P is given. So P is the spin operator, and we need to find the eigenvector for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvector equation is P · n |v> = (ħ/2)|v>, where n is the unit vector in the direction we're measuring. But wait, no, actually, the operator in the direction n is P·n, which equals n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. And the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So the first step is to construct the operator P·n. The direction n lies in the x-z plane, which means that the y-component of n is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z). But since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. Wait, but I'm not sure if I need to find the eigenvector in terms of n or if the question is presenting the eigenvector in a general form.

Wait, the question is asking what the elements of the normalized eigenvector are. The options are a bit abstract, so maybe the eigenvector can be expressed in terms of angles or in a specific form.

Let me think about how spin states are represented. The spin-up state along the z-axis is (1; 0), and along the x-axis is (1/√2; 1/√2). But for an arbitrary direction, we can express the eigenstate using spherical coordinates. Suppose the direction n makes an angle θ with the z-axis and φ with the x-axis. So the spin-up state would be cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) e^{iφ}.

Wait, the general form of the spin-up state along an arbitrary direction (θ, φ) is |+> = cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓⟩. So in vector terms, the components would be (cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which is missing the e^{iφ} term. Option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ), which isn't quite the same as the spin-up state. Option D has sqrt factors and theta/2, but it's scaled with hbar, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvector should be a dimensionless vector. Wait, wait, the options have hbar in them, but eigenvectors are just vectors in a Hilbert space, which are dimensionless. So options A and D have hbar, which might be a mistake. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the options A and D have hbar multiplied into their components. That doesn't seem right because eigenvectors are dimensionless. So perhaps those options are incorrect. Oh wait, the question says the operator's components are given as (ħ/2) times some matrices. So the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2, so when you solve the equation (P·n - ħ/2 I)|v> = 0, you get the eigenvector.

Wait, perhaps I should write out the operator P·n. So n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, so n = (n_x, 0, n_z). Therefore, P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Each P component is given as (ħ/2) times their respective matrices.

So substituting, P·n = (ħ/2) [ n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ].

The σ_x matrix is [[0 1],[1 0]], σ_z is [[1 0],[0 -1]]. So putting it together:

P·n = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So the matrix becomes:

[ (n_z) (ħ/2), (n_x) (ħ/2) ]
[ (n_x) (ħ/2), (-n_z) (ħ/2) ]

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

So subtract (ħ/2) times the identity matrix:

[ (n_z - 1) (ħ/2), (n_x) (ħ/2) ]
[ (n_x) (ħ/2), (-n_z - 1) (ħ/2) ]

Wait, no, wait. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so I think I have to subtract (
