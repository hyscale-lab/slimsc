Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, 32% of the atoms would have decayed on average. Wait, no, actually, that's the probability for each atom. Because radioactive decay is a probabilistic process, right? So each atom has a certain probability of decaying within a given time.

Now, in this case, the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, isn't the next 150 minutes from now, so from the 50-minute mark? So the time left we're considering is 150 minutes. But wait, is that correct? Or is the total time from the start 250 minutes (50 + 150)?

Wait, the question says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So the initial statement is about the probability over 100 minutes. Then, after 50 minutes have passed without decay, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes? So the next 150 minutes would be from the 50-minute mark to 200 minutes total. Or wait, maybe I should think of it as the remaining time.

Wait, no. Let me parse the question again. The decay probability
