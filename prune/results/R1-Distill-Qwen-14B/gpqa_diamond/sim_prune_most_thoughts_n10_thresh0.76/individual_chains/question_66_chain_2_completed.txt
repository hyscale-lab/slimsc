Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is: Which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT?

The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The multiple-choice options are combinations of these.

Hmm. I remember that the SMEFT is a framework that incorporates all possible interactions (beyond the Standard Model) into a single effective theory. It's built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian, each multiplied by some coefficient. But these operators must respect certain symmetries.

Wait, what do I know about symmetries in field theories? Well, the Standard Model itself respects certain symmetries, and the SMEFT as an effective theory should preserve these as well, unless they're explicitly broken by the new physics.

Lorentz symmetry is a big one. Effective theories must respect Lorentz symmetry because they describe physics at lower energies where Lorentz invariance holds. So all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz invariant. So option 1 is correct.

What about Poincare symmetry? Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if the theory is Lorentz invariant, it should also be Poincare invariant. Because the effective theory is a Lorentz-invariant theory, it should respect both. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

Now, CP symmetry. CP is Charge conjugation and Parity symmetry. The Standard Model isn't CP-symmetric because of certain processes like kaon oscillations. But in the SMEFT, do operators have to respect CP? I think that the SMEFT allows for CP violation, so the operators don't necessarily have to be CP-symmetric. So the operators could violate CP, meaning that symmetry isn't a must. So option 3 is not a required symmetry.

Then there's CPT symmetry. CPT is the combination of Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories because it arises from the principles of quantum mechanics and relativity. So any valid QFT must respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must be CPT-invariant. So option 4 is correct.

Putting it all together:

Which symmetries must all operators respect? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options are 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options, option C says 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4. Since 3 is CP and it's not required, the correct choice is C.

Wait, but wait a second. Do all operators in SMEFT have to respect Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes translations, which relates to momentum conservation. The SMEFT's operators are local, so they should respect all the symmetries of the underlying theory, which is the Standard Model plus whatever new physics. Since the Standard Model respects Poincare, the SMEFT should too. So yes, operators must respect Poincare.

So the correct answer should include 1, 2,4. So the answer is option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that incorporates all possible interactions beyond the Standard Model into a single effective theory. Operators in SMEFT must respect certain symmetries, which are derived from the principles of quantum field theory and the structure of the Standard Model.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, ensuring that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in different inertial frames. Since SMEFT is an effective theory describing low-energy physics, it must respect Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, all operators in SMEFT must be Poincaré-invariant.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The Standard Model is not CP-symmetric, and SMEFT allows for CP violation. Therefore, operators in SMEFT are not required to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry, which combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T), is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. Any valid quantum field theory, including SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry. Thus, all operators in SMEFT must be CPT-invariant.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct answer is the combination of these symmetries, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
