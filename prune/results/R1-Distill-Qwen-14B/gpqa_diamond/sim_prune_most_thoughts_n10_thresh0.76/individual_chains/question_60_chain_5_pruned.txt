Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time behaves differently. Oh right, that's Einstein's theory of relativity. So the astronaut is going to experience less time compared to someone watching from Earth because of time dilation.

Wait, the speed is given as 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super close to c, like really, really fast. So the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time, would be less than the time observed from Earth.

But wait, how do I calculate the proper time? Oh right, I think the formula involves the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So v is 0.99999987c, so v squared over c squared would be (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that.

Let me think: 0.99999987 squared. That's like about (1 - 1.3e-7)^2. Hmm, maybe I can approximate it. Wait, but precise calculation might be better here. Let me calculate (0.99999987)^2.

So 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. Squaring that gives approximately 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. The last term is negligible because it's 1.69e-14, so almost zero. So the square is approximately 0.99999974. So 1 - v^2/c^2 is 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. So the square root of that is sqrt(0.00000026). Hmm, square root of 2.6e-7.

Wait, sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Because sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 3.16e-4. So sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 is about 5.09e-4. So 1 divided by 5.09e-4 is approximately 1968. So gamma is around 1968.

Wait wait, wait. Let me compute it more accurately. Because 0.99999987^2 is (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14 ≈ 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. The square root of 0.00000026 is sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*sqrt(1e-7). sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, sqrt(1e-7)=1e-3.5= approximately 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 = around 5.09e-4. So 1/(5.09e-4) is approximately 1968. So gamma is about 1968.

So gamma is 1968. That's a pretty big gamma factor, meaning significant time dilation.

So the time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time tau, which is equal to t_earth / gamma. Because from Earth's frame, the time is t_earth, and the astronaut's clock runs slower, so tau = t_earth / gamma.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The spaceship's proper time is tau, which is t_earth multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Alternatively, tau = t_earth / gamma. Because gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)), so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 1/gamma, so tau = t_earth * (1/gamma) = t_earth / gamma.

So, the first thing is to compute the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. Wait, do I know how far that is? Oh right, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Wait, is that correct? I think the distance is approximately 160,000 to 200,000 light-years. Let me take 163,000 ly as the distance.

So the distance is about d = 163,000 light-years. The speed is v = 0.99999987 c. So from Earth's frame, the time taken is t_earth = d / v. Since d is in light-years and v is in terms of c, the time is (163000 ly) / (0.99999987 c) ) = approximately 163000 / ~1 years. Wait, but since v is so close to c, the time is about 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013
