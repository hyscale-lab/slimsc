Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titrations and pH calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So this is a classic acid-base titration scenario. The pH at different points will depend on the moles of acid and base reacting.

Let me start by figuring out the initial situation after dilution.

So, the initial acetic acid solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration will change.

Wait, to find the new concentration after dilution, I'll use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³ (since 20 + 20). So M2 = (0.05 * 20) /40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

So now, the solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH.

At 25% titration, how much NaOH is added?

Hmm, 25% probably refers to the volume of NaOH added relative to the equivalence point volume. So I need to find the equivalence point first.

Equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH needed: same as moles of acetic acid, so 0.001 mol.

Concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH. So 25% of that would be 2.5 cm³.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. 25% titration—does that mean 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added, or 25% of the initial acid has been neutralized?

Yes, equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized. So 25% titration would be adding 25% of the equivalence point volume. So in this case, 10 cm³ is the equivalence point, so 25% is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but wait again. Alternatively, sometimes "25% titration" refers to the point where 25% of the acid has been neutralized. So in this case, the initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. 25% would be 0.00025 mol of NaOH added. Let's calculate both ways, but I think the first approach is correct because the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized.

So, for 25% titration, we're adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Now, let's model the situation at 25% titration.

In the solution, we have a mixture of acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate ion. Because some of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate.

Let me calculate the moles.

Moles of acetic acid initially after dilution: 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Reaction: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, the moles of CH3COOH will decrease by 0.00025, and moles of CH3COO^- will increase by 0.00025.

So, moles of CH3COOH now: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.

The total solution volume is original 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So, concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that.

log(1.85e-5) is around log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.267 + (-5) = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.3333) is approximately log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Looking at the options, option A is pH 4.26 at 25% titration.

Wait, but let
