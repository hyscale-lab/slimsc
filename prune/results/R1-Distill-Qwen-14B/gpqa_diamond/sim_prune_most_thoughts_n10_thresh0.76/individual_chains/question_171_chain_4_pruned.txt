Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions, specifically involving bromine. Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positionsâ€”either ortho, meta, or para. The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed when each substance undergoes this reaction in excess bromine. I need to arrange the substances from least to most in terms of the para-isomer yield.

The substances given are numbered 1 to 6. Let me list them out again to get a clear picture.

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, wait. Wait, substance 5 is ethylbenzene? Oh yeah, that's correct. So, each has a different substituent attached to the benzene ring.

Now, each substituent is either activating or deactivating and also ortho/para-directing or meta-directing. The para-isomer's yield depends on the substituent's directing effects. But wait, when the substituent is strongly deactivating, the ring is less reactive. Also, some substituents have strong directing effects, leading to more of a particular isomer.

Let me think about each substituent:

1. CH3 (toluene): This is a activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. So, it's ortho/para-directing. That means when bromine adds, it will add more in the para position relative to the methyl group, but because it's activating, the reaction is more favorable, leading to more substitution.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Hmm, but doesn't that depend on the substituent's directing effect? Oh, but wait, no, I think the question implies that each substance forms a single product, but I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed," so perhaps the substituent is such that only one position is possible. That can't be the case because even with activating groups, you can have multiple para and ortho positions. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Or perhaps it's that each substituent directs the bromine to one position, so each gives a single product. That doesn't make sense because, for example, toluene would have multiple para and ortho positions. Maybe the question is considering the major product, not necessarily that only one product is formed. So, when bromine is in excess, perhaps the para isomer is more favored in some cases.

Wait, no, the question says "it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed." Oh, so perhaps each substituent only allows a single position for substitution, which would mean that the substituent is such that it only directs to one position. But that's not possible unless the substituent is in a position where only one spot is possible, like if it's a meta director but in a position that only allows para substitution. Wait, maybe I should think about each substituent's effect on the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the ratio of the para isomer in the mixture, but given that each substituent directs to certain positions, the para isomer's yield depends on the substituent's directing ability.

Wait, perhaps each substituent will direct the incoming Br to certain positions, and when the substituent is a strong para-director, the para product is more formed. So the question is about the tendency to form para products.

But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each compound, what's the yield of para-substituted product. Then arrange them in increasing order.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. So, the para-isomer's weight fraction is higher when the substituent is a strong para-director.

Wait, I think I need to rank each substituent based on how much they direct to the para position.

Let me list each substituent:

1) CH3 (toluene): activating, o/p-directing. So, para is a major product.

2) COOEt (ethyl benzoate): ester group. Esters are electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) because of the carbonyl. So, they are deactivating. But being meta or para? Wait, esters are ortho/para-directing deactivating groups. Wait, no: wait, actually, esters are OR groups? No, esters are like OOCR. Wait, no, the ester group is O-CO-OEt in benzoate. Wait, no, the substituent is OOCR. Wait
