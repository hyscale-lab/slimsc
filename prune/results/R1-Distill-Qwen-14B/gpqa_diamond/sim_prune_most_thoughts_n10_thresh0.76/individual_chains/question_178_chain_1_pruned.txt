Okay, so I've got this question about the Lagrangian and renormalizability. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Lagrangian given is L_int equals κ times some terms, and I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh right, σ is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. But maybe the exact form of σ isn't critical for finding the mass dimension of κ. I think I need to focus on the units of each part of the Lagrangian.

So, remember that in quantum field theory, the Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ℏ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Let me break down the components. The term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Wait, ψ is a spinor field. What's the mass dimension of a Dirac spinor ψ? Oh, right, in four dimensions, each field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D, the action is ∫ L d^4x, so each Lagrangian term must have [L] = 4. So for kinetic terms like ψ̄ iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ, each ψ has dimension 3/2, ∂_μ has dimension 1, so when you multiply ψ (3/2), ∂_mu (1), and ψ̄ (3/2), you get 3/2 +1 +3/2 = 4. That's right.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices. Each gamma matrix has dimension 0, right? Because they're just matrices, not fields. So σ_{μν} has dimension 0.

F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, for example. The field strength F has the same dimension as the field A_mu. A_mu has dimension 1 because the kinetic term is like ∂_mu A_nu ∂^mu A^nu, which needs to have dimension 4. Each ∂ is dimension 1, A is dimension 1, so (∂ A)^2 would be (1+1)^2 = 4, which is correct. So F^{mu nu} has dimension 2, since F is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, which is ∂ (dimension 1) acting on A (dimension 1), so F is dimension 2.

So putting it all together, the term ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions: ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 0 (so ψ̄ σ ψ is 3/2 + 3/2 = 3), and F is 2. So the entire term has dimension 3 + 2 =5.

Wait, that's a problem because the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So then, the term L_int = κ * (term of dimension 5). So to make [L_int] =4, [κ] must be [5 -4] = -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the term without κ is dimension 5, multiplying by κ will bring it down to 4 when [κ]=-1. So κ has mass dimension -1.

Now, about renormalizability. I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Wait, renormalizable theories require that the couplings have mass dimension less than or equal to 4 minus the number of fields, but more precisely, in four dimensions, each coupling
