Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on synthesis pathways, but let me think. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking it down, the phenyl ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5: a bromine and a nitro group. And there's an acetyl group (ethan-1-one) attached as a substituent too.

Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is CH3CO-. So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and an acetyl group attached to the same carbon where the benzene is. Or wait, no: ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- attached to the benzene ring. So the substituents are 3-bromo and 5-nitro, and the acetyl is at position 1? Or is the acetyl at the same position as one of the directing groups?

Wait, the target structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the 'phenyl' group is attached to the ethan-1-one. So the structure is (Ph group) attached to the ketone. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5, and the ketone group is at position 1?

Wait, no. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. The substituents on the benzene would be positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment. So the ketone (CH3CO-) is attached at position 1, and then the benzene has a Br at 3 and a nitro at 5, relative to that point. So the substituents are at meta positions relative to the ketone group.

So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone (acetyl) group, Br, and nitro group. The positions are such that the Br is in position 3 and the nitro in position 5, assuming the ketone is position 1.

So the strategy would be to first introduce functional groups that can be controlled with directing effects. Let me think about the order of reactions.

Benzene is the starting material. Let's think about what each step does.

Looking at the options, the steps involve things like acetylation, bromination, nitration, Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction?), NaNO2/HCl (a diazotization?), H3PO2 (which is for something like... maybe deoxygenation? Or perhaps it's for a reduction, but wait, H3PO2 is used in the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction, but not sure. Alternatively, it's a mild reducing agent, maybe for removing certain groups.)

Wait, another point: the order of introducing substituents is crucial because each substituent directs the next reaction. So functional groups that are strong meta directors should be introduced after those that are para/ortho directors.

The target has a nitro group (meta director) and a bromine (also meta director). The acetyl group is an electron-withdrawing group and acts as a meta director. Wait, no. Wait, the acetyl group (as a ketone) is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's a meta director. So when adding substituents, the order matters.

So let's think about the synthesis. We need to have the acetyl group, nitro, and bromine in the correct positions. Let's consider the steps each option suggests.

Option C: Let's check the steps. Step 1: HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration). Step 2: Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction, but nitration is meta, so where would that take us? Wait, Fe/HCl is often used for reducing nitro groups to amines. So if we nitrate benzene first, we get nitrobenzene. Then, reducing nitro to amine gives aniline. But then step 3 is CH3COCl/AlCl3, which is an acetylation, likely Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, after nitration and reduction, the ring is activated. Aniline is a strong activating group, so Friedel-Crafts would work. But wait, after reducing nitro to amine, the ring is very activated. So when you acetylate, you might get the acetyl group in a particular position.

Wait, but the target has the nitro and bromine substituents already. So perhaps this is not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the acetyl group is introduced first. Because once you have an acetyl group (a meta director), the next substituents will go meta to it.

Wait, but acetyl is an EWG (electron-withdrawing group), so it's a meta director. So if we acetylate benzene first, the next substituent (like nitration) would go meta to the acetyl group.

Wait, but our target has the acetyl group, a nitro group at position 5, and bromine at position 3. So if the acetyl is at position 1, then the nitro would be at position 3? Or position 5? Let me visualize the benzene ring.

Let's number the positions. Let's say the acetyl is at position 1. Then, the nitro would be at position 3 (meta to 1) if it's introduced second. But then the bromine would be at position 5 (another meta from 1). Wait, but nitro is meta, and bromine is also meta.

Wait, but if the acetyl is introduced first, when we nitrate next, the nitro would go meta to the acetyl, position 3. Then, if we brominate, where would it go? Wait, but the ring now has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 3. The nitro is a meta director, so bromination would be directed meta to nitro, which is position 6? Or maybe position 5 (since position 3 has nitro, which directs meta, so bromine goes to position 6's meta... Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is to first nitrate, then brominate, then acetylate? No, because acetylation is a Friedel-Crafts, which requires the ring to be activated. Wait, nitration gives nitrobenzene, which is a deactivating group. So Friedel-Crafts acylation won't proceed on nitrobenzene because the ring is deactivated. So maybe the acetyl group needs to be introduced before any deactivating groups.

So the first step should be acetylation. Introduce the acetyl group as the first substituent.

So benzene → acetylate → acetophenone (phenyl ketone).

Then, nitrate the acetophenone. Since the acetyl group is a meta director, the nitration will occur at position 3 or 5 relative to the acetyl group.

Wait, acetophenone is a meta director. So nitration would add nitro group in the meta position relative to the acetyl group. Let's say that is position 3. Then, perhaps another nitration would add in position 5? But no, the target only has one nitro group. Wait, target has nitro and bromine.

Wait, but the target has both nitro and bromine. So after acetylation, maybe nitration and bromination steps.

Wait, but let's think about the order of nitration and bromination. Nitration is a meta director, bromination (using FeBr3) is also a meta director, but it's a bit harder because Br2/FeBr3 is a strong electrophilic substitution.

Wait, but if you have two meta directors, how do the substituents arrange? Let's say after acetylation, the ring is at position 1 (acetyl). Next, nitration adds nitro at position 3. Then, bromination would be directed by the acetyl and nitro groups. Both are meta directors. So the bromine would be added in a position that is meta to both. But that might not be possible, so it would go to the most available position.

Alternatively, perhaps after introducing the acetyl group, you nitrate first, then brominate. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: maybe the nitro group is introduced last. Because nitration is a strong meta director, and perhaps it's better to have it in a specific position. Alternatively, the bromine is introduced in a step that's directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Acetylate benzene (Friedel-Crafts acylation) → acetophenone.

2. Nitrate → nitro group added meta to acetyl (position 3).

3. Then brominate → but where? The ring now has acetyl (1) and nitro (3). The acetyl is a meta director, the nitro is a meta director. So bromine would go into position 5, which is meta to both? Or perhaps position 5 is para to nitro (since position 3 is already occupied). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, benzene ring with substituents:

Positions 1 (acetyl), 3 (nitro). The next substitution would be Br. The acetyl directs meta (positions 3, 5), and nitro directs meta (positions 1, 5). So the most favored position would be position 5, which is meta to both. So Br would be at position 5. But wait, in the target, the Br is at position 3 and nitro at 5. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I got the numbering wrong. Let me try again. If the acetyl is at position 1, then the nitro is at position 3. Then, the bromine would go to position 5, which is meta to the acetyl and para to the nitro. But that would give substituents at positions 1 (acetyl), 3 (nitro), 5 (Br). Wait, but the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is introduced before the nitro. So after acetylation, the ring is activated. Then brominate using Br2/FeBr3. Since acetyl is meta, bromine would go to position 3. Then nitrate: nitro would be where? Acetyl directs meta, which is position 5. Because nitration is done after bromination, so the existing substituents (acetyl and Br) direct. Acetyl is a stronger director? Or Br is a stronger meta director.

Wait, Br is a substituent that's more deactivating than acetyl? No, wait, acetyl is EWG, deactivating, and Br is a EWG, but ortho/para director. Wait, no. Wait, Br is an EWG, but it's an ortho/para director. Wait, no, wait: wait, the nitro group is a strong meta director. Bromine is an ortho/para director because it's a halogen. Wait, no! Wait, wait, wait. I'm getting confused.

Wait, the substituent's directing effects depend on their nature. Acetyl (EWG, meta director). Nitro is a strong meta director. Bromine, being a halogen, is an ortho/para director, but deactivating.

So if after acetylation, the ring is acetylated (position 1), then bromination (Br2/FeBr3) would introduce Br in the ortho or para positions relative to the acetyl. So positions 2 or 4.

But wait, the acetyl group is a meta director, so the bromine would be at position 3 or 5? Wait, no, wait. No, wait: the acetyl group is a meta director, so when you do electrophilic substitution, the incoming group will go to the meta positions relative to the acetyl group.

Wait, so when you brominate acetophenone (acetyl at position 1), the Br would enter at position 3 or 5, because those are meta to the acetyl. So after acetylation, bromination would place Br at position 3. Then, nitration would occur. Now, the substituents are acetyl (1), Br (3). Both are meta directors.

So nitration would be directed to which position? The available positions are 2, 4, 5, 6. Let's see, considering the existing substituents. The acetyl (1) directs to 3 and 5. The Br (3) directs to 1, 5, and 6 (since Br is a meta director? Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait: Br is a halogen, so it's an ortho/para director. So when Br is present at position 3, the nitration would be directed to positions 2 (ortho to Br), 4 (para to Br), and 6.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think again.

After acetylation and bromination, we have substituents at positions 1 (acetyl) and 3 (Br). Now, nitration needs to be done. The ring has two substituents: acetyl (meta director) and Br (ortho/para director). So where would the nitro group go?

The acetyl directs to positions 3 and 5. The Br directs to positions 2 (ortho), 4 (para), and 6 (meta to Br). So the positions available for nitration are 2, 4, 5, 6. But the acetyl directs meta, which is 3 and 5. So the nitration will go into position 5, as it's meta to acetyl and para to Br? Or perhaps I'm mixing things.

Alternatively, the nitro group might end up at position 5 because that's the only position that's meta to the acetyl and para to the Br. Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is: acetylate first, then nitrate, then brominate.

So after acetylation, nitration would add nitro at position 3. Then, bromination would be directed by the acetyl and nitro groups. Acetyl is meta, nitro is meta. So the bromine would go to position 5, which is meta to nitro (position 3) and meta to acetyl (position 1). Wait, but position 5 is meta to acetyl (1) and para to nitro (3). Hmm.

Wait, if you have substituents at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (nitro), then the bromine would go into position 5, which is meta to the acetyl and para to the nitro. Because, for nitro (3), the meta positions are 6 and maybe 1 (but 1 is acetyl), so bromine would go to 5.

But the target has bromine at 3 and nitro at 5. So that would not match.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let's try another approach.

The target molecule: the substituents are 3-bromo, 5-nitro, and 1-acetyl (assuming the acetyl is at position 1). So the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5.

So, to get all three substituents in the correct positions, perhaps the steps are:

1. Acetylate benzene (position 1) → acetophenone.

2. Nitrate acetophenone → nitro group added meta to acetyl (position 3).

3. Brominate → bromine goes meta to acetyl and para to nitro. So position 5.

Wait, that would give substituents at 1 (acetyl), 3 (nitro), and 5 (Br). But the target has substituents at 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), and 5 (nitro). So that doesn't match. So perhaps this approach leads to incorrect substituent positions.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is introduced after bromine.

Wait, let me consider another approach. Maybe the correct order is:

1. Nitration of benzene → nitro group at position 1.

2. Bromination → Br at position 3 (meta to nitro).

3. Then, acetylate. But wait, nitrobenzene is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts acylation won't proceed. So that's not possible. So acetylation must come before nitration.

So acetylate first, then nitrate, then brominate. But as above, that would lead to Br at position 5, which is not the target.

Hmm, perhaps I should look at the options and see which sequence places the substituents correctly.

Looking at option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro group to amine.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation.

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again?

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → something.

Wait, let's think about the steps in option C.

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine: Fe/HCl → aniline.

3. Acetylate aniline: CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetanilide? No, because aniline is a strong activating group. Wait, wait, no. Acetanilide is formed by acetylation of aniline, and it is a meta director. Wait, but acetanilide is an activating group? No, because the acetyl is EWG. So, acetanilide is a meta director.

Wait, but after acetylation (step iii), we have acetanilide (a meta director). Then step iv is bromination: Br2/FeBr3. So the bromine would be introduced meta to the acetanilide group. So position where?

But benzene initially was nitrated (step i), reduced to amine (step ii), acetylated (step iii), then brominated (step iv). So the substituents after step iii are amine (nitrogen) acetylated to acetanilide, which is at position 1. So when brominating, Br would go to position 3 (meta to acetanilide). Then, step v is nitration again: nitro would go to position 5 (meta to acetanilide, which is at 1). So after steps i to iv, the substituents are acetanilide (1), Br (3). Then step v adds nitro at 5. So the structure becomes 1-acetanilide, 3-Br, 5-nitro.

But wait, the target is 1-acetyl, 3-Br, 5-nitro. So if acetanilide is at 1, and we deprotect it (remove the acetyl group), perhaps by hydrolysis. But in the options, I don't see a hydrolysis step. Wait, in step vi of option C, it's NaNO2/HCl, which is diazotization, but that's usually for amines. If we have an acetylated amine (acetanilide), maybe we can hydrolyze it. But in the options, after step v, step vi is NaNO2/HCl, which would form a diazonium salt. Then step vii is H3PO2.

Wait, perhaps that's a problem because after nitration (step v), we have nitro group at 5. Then step vi: NaNO2/HCl would require an amine, but after step iii, we've acetylated the amine, so the amine is now an acetanilide. So step vi would not have an amine available. Hmm, this might not work.

Alternatively, maybe step vi is for something else.

Wait, perhaps after getting the nitro groups in place, we need to remove the acetyl group. But without a step for that, it's unclear.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the target molecule. The substituents are Br at 3, nitro at 5, and acetyl at 1. So in the correct order, we must have introduced the acetyl first, then nitro, then bromine. Or another order.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

2. Nitrate → nitro group at position 3.

3. Brominate → bromine at position 5.

Then, perhaps we need to adjust the substituents. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is introduced after bromine. Let me think.

Option B's steps:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate benzene → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate bromobenzene. Bromine is an ortho/para director, so nitro would go to positions 2 or 4.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate. Now, the ring has Br (position 1), nitro (say position 2), and acetyl (position 3? Wait, perhaps not. Friedel-Crafts would require an activated ring. But after nitration, the ring is deactivated.

Wait, nitro is a strong deactivating group, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't proceed on bromobenzene after nitration. So step iii in option B would require the ring to be activated, which it isn't. So option B is probably wrong.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetyl.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate. So after acetylation, Br would go meta to acetyl, position 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Now, the ring has acetyl (1) and Br (3). Both are meta directors. So nitration would be directed to position 5.

So after steps i, ii, iii, the substituents are 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). That's exactly the target. But wait, the options have more steps.

Wait, option A has seven steps. Steps i to vii.

So after steps i, ii, iii, we have the correct substituents. But then steps iv, v, vi, vii are Fe/HCl, HNO3/H2SO4 again, NaNO2/HCl, and H3PO2.

Wait, that makes no sense. Because after steps i, ii, iii, we already have the desired substituents. Why would we do more steps?

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Because sometimes, the order of substituents can cause issues. Let me think. After i, ii, iii, you have the correct substituents. But perhaps the nitro group is actually introduced after the bromine. Or maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Acetophenone.

2. Brominate → Br at 3.

3. Nitrate → nitro at 5.

That would give the correct substituents.

Looking back at the options, option A's first three steps are acetylation, bromination, nitration. That would give substituents at 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). So that's correct.

But then, why are there more steps? Let's look at the entire option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

Wait, that can't be right. Because steps iv to vii would modify the existing substituents. After step iii, the ring already has all the substituents. So what is the purpose of steps iv to vii?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reaction steps. Let me think about each step.

In option A:

After step iii, we have 1-acetyl, 3-Br, 5-nitro. Then step iv is Fe/HCl → FeCl. That's for reduction. So perhaps it's reducing the nitro group to an amine. So now, we have 1-acetyl, 3-Br, 5-amino.

Then step v is HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. But the ring is already substituted with amines (which are strong activating groups), so the nitration would occur in a different position. But the target doesn't have a second nitro group.

This doesn't make sense. So option A's steps after iii are probably leading to incorrect products. So option A is not the correct sequence.

Looking at option C again. Let me re-examine.

Option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate aniline → acetanilide.

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate acetanilide. Acetanilide is a meta director, so Br would go to position 3 (meta to acetanilide at position 1).

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate acetanilide and Br. Now, the ring has acetanilide (1), Br (3). Nitration would add nitro group meta to acetanilide → position 5.

So after step v, substituents are 1 (acetanilide), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro).

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. But acetanilide is present; perhaps it's for converting the amine to a diazonium salt. But if acetanilide is present, the amine is blocked. So this step might not work. Alternatively, maybe it's not an amine anymore.

vii) H3PO2 → not sure. Maybe a reducing step.

Wait, but the target is 1-acetyl, 3-Br, 5-nitro. So in option C, after step v, we have acetanilide, Br, nitro. So to get the acetyl group, perhaps we remove the acetyl from acetanilide. But how?

Wait, in step iii, the amine was acetylated. So to get the acetyl group on the benzene, we'd have to hydrolyze the acetanilide back to aniline, but that would require acidic conditions, perhaps with H+/heat, but that's not part of the steps in option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl group is introduced as a ketone, but in option C, it's acetanilide, which is a methyl group attached to a nitrogen, not a ketone. So maybe option C is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's consider the target molecule again: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The substituents are acetyl (position 1), Br (3), nitro (5).

So the correct order should be:

1. Acetophenone (acetylation of benzene).

2. Nitrate acetophenone → nitro at position 3.

3. Brominate acetophenon-nitro → bromine at position 5.

But wait, looking at the options, does any option have this sequence?

Option A's first three steps are acetylate, brominate, nitrate. So that would give Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. If I have acetophenone, then bromination (step ii in option A) would add Br at position 3 (meta to acetyl). Then, nitrate (step iii in option A) would add nitro at position 5 (meta to acetyl). So after steps i, ii, iii, we have the correct substituents.

But why does option A have more steps? Because after that comes Fe/HCl, which would reduce nitro to amine. That would be a problem because the target has a nitro group, not an amine.

Wait, the target requires a nitro group, so any steps after steps i, ii, iii in option A would change substituents, which is not desired. So option A is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in assuming the steps after i, ii, iii. Let me look more carefully.

Option A's steps:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate → Br at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → nitro at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro (5) to amine.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again. This would add another nitro group, but the target only has one.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of amine.

vii) H3PO2 → reduction.

So this sequence seems incorrect because it introduces and then removes substituents, which is not necessary.

So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the correct order of substituents is to nitrate first, then brominate, then acetylate. But that won't work because nitro is deactivating, so acetylation via Friedel-Crafts won't proceed.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the nitro group is introduced via nitration after acetylation, but in such a way that it's in the correct position.

Wait, if I have acetophenone (acetyl at 1), then nitrate → nitro at 3. Then brominate → Br at 5. So the substituents are correct. So the steps would be i, ii, iii in option A. But then the extra steps in option A are not needed and would lead to incorrect products.

Looking at the options again, perhaps option C is the correct one. Let me think through that.

Option C:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitro at 1.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) Acetylate aniline → acetanilide (acetyl at 1, amine is blocked).

iv) Brominate → Br at 3 (meta to acetanilide).

v) Nitrate → nitro at 5 (meta to acetanilide).

vi) Diazotize → but acetanilide is present, so the amine is blocked. Can't proceed.

Hmm, maybe after nitration (step v), we have nitro at 5, and substituents at 1 (acetanilide), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). Then, steps vi and vii: NaNO2/HCl would require an amine, which is blocked as acetanilide. So this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps step vi is not about the amine but something else. Or perhaps the acetyl group is introduced in a different way.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. Think about the substituents and their directing effects.

Acetyl: meta director.

Nitro: meta director.

Br: ortho/para director (since it's a halogen).

So after acetylation, the next substituent (nitro) would go meta to acetyl. Then, bromine, being a halogen, would be directed by acetyl and nitro.

Wait, but after acetylation and nitration, the ring has acetyl (1), nitro (3). Now, brominating would be directed by both. Acetyl directs meta (3 and 5), nitro directs meta (1,5). So the most favored position would be 5.

So substituents at 1 (acetyl), 3 (nitro), 5 (Br). But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So this is opposite. So perhaps the order should be acetylate, brominate, then nitrate.

Wait, if after acetylation (1), brominate (3), then nitrate. Where would nitration go?

Bromine at 3 is an ortho/para director. So nitration would go to position 1 (para to Br), but position 1 is already acetyl. So next would be position 5 (meta to acetyl, and para to Br). So nitration would add at 5.

So substituents would be 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro), which is the target. So that's correct.

So the correct sequence would be:

1. Acetylate → acetyl at 1.

2. Brominate → Br at 3.

3. Nitrate → nitro at 5.

Looking at the options, which option has this sequence?

Looking at option A: steps i, ii, iii are acetylate, brominate, nitrate. So that matches.

But then, why does option A have more steps? Because in the target, we have everything after step iii. But option A's steps iv, v, vi, vii would change things.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the nitro group is being introduced, but after that, the steps in option A would reduce it, which is not desired. So the correct sequence would be only steps i, ii, iii, but that's not an option because the options all have seven steps. So perhaps the correct option is not A.

Wait, wait. Let me check again. The question says the sequence of reactions should lead to the target. So if the correct steps are i, ii, iii in option A, but the other steps would change the structure, perhaps option A is not the correct one.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for another option.

Option D: 

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce → aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize.

iv) H3PO2 → ?

v) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate.

vii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

This seems to involve multiple nitrations and reductions, which may not lead to the target.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro in ortho/para to Br.

iii) CH3COCl → acetylate. But Friedel-Crafts won't work on nitro group, which is deactivating. So step iii would fail.

So option B is out.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → aniline.

iii) CH3COCl → acetanilide.

iv) Br2 → Br at 3.

v) HNO3 → nitro at 5.

vi) NaNO2 → ?

vii) H3PO2 → ?

But after step v, we have nitro at 5, Br at 3, acetanilide at 1. Then steps vi and vii: perhaps the amine is released. But without a step to hydrolyze the acetyl, we won't get the ketone.

Wait, unless H3PO2 is a reducing agent. H3PO2 is used in the Wittig reaction but also can be a mild reducing agent. Maybe step vii is for removing a group.

Alternatively, after step v, the structure is acetanilide (1), Br (3), nitro (5). Then step vi: NaNO2/HCl would diazotize the amine, but the amine is part of acetanilide, so can't be done. So probably, option C is incorrect.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the initial analysis, the correct sequence should be acetylate, brominate, nitrate. Which is steps i, ii, iii of option A. But the target requires only those steps. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but the subsequent steps in option A are distractors and not needed. Or perhaps I'm missing something about why those steps are included.

Wait, perhaps the extra steps in option A are for protecting groups or to avoid side reactions. Alternatively, maybe the nitration is done after some reduction. Alternatively, perhaps the initial nitration is a wrong step, and the real nitration is in another position.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C. Let me think again.

In option C:

After steps i to v, we have acetanilide (1), Br (3), nitro (5). Then step vi: NaNO2/HCl. But acetanilide has a blocked amine. So can't do diazotization. So step vi is probably not applicable, making option C incorrect.

So in the end, the only option that introduces the substituents in the correct order (acetyl, Br, nitro) is option A, but the problem is that option A includes steps that would change the structure after the correct substituents are in place.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps. Maybe in option A, the nitration is done before the bromination. Let me re-examine option A's steps:

Option A:

i) acetylate → 1-acetyl.

ii) brominate → 3-Br.

iii) nitrate → 5-nitro.

Then steps iv onwards: reduce nitro to amine, nitrate again, diazotize, H3PO2.

But that would change the nitro group to amine and then perhaps something else. So the correct product would not have nitro but an amine, which is not what we need.

So perhaps the correct option is not A, but another.

Wait, maybe the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which has substituents at 3 and 5. So perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene.

2. Brominate.

3. Acetylate.

But after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so acetylation can't happen via Friedel-Crafts. So that's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the acetyl and bromine. But that would require activating the ring, which is not possible with nitro groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Brominate benzene → bromobenzene.

2. Nitrate → nitro at ortho or para to Br.

3. Acetylate → but the ring is deactivated by nitro, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So can't do that.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me re-examine.

In option C, steps i to v:

i) Nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Reduce → amine at 1.

iii) Acetylate → acetanilide at 1.

iv) Brominate → Br at 3 (meta to acetanilide).

v) Nitrate → nitro at 5 (meta to acetanilide).

So after step v: substituents are acetanilide (1), Br (3), nitro (5).

But the target has acetyl, Br, nitro, not acetanilide. So we need to remove the acetyl group from acetanilide to get the acetyl on the benzene.

Wait, acetanilide is a benzene ring with an acetyl group attached to the NH2. No, wait: acetanilide is benzene with NHCOCH3 group. To get an acetyl group (COCH3), you would need to do something like formylation and reduction, which is not part of the steps in option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylation step in option C is not introducing an acetyl group but something else. Wait, CH3COCl/AlCl3 is Friedel-Crafts acylation, introducing an acetyl group. So after step iii, acetanilide would have the structure where the nitrogen is attached to the acetyl. But that's not the same as the acetyl group being directly attached to the benzene.

So, to get the acetyl directly on the benzene, the correct functional group must be introduced via Friedel-Crafts, which requires the ring to be activated. So the only way is to acetylate before any deactivating groups are introduced.

So, unless the nitro group is introduced in a way that doesn't deactivate the ring, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but the subsequent steps are red herrings. Because the target is achieved after steps i, ii, iii, and the rest of the steps are extra and perhaps not actually performed. But the question says 'which sequence of reactions' would lead to the target, implying that all steps must be followed.

Hmm, this is really tricky. After thinking for a long time, I'll try to make an educated guess.

The correct sequence is to first acetylate, then brominate, then nitrate. Which matches steps i, ii, iii of option A. But in option A, the following steps would change the structure, which is not desired. So perhaps option A is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the target has the nitro group and Br in positions 3 and 5. If we have the acetyl group at position 1, then the nitro is at 3 (meta), and Br is at 5 (meta). So the correct order is acetylate, nitrate, brominate.

Looking for an option where the steps are acetylate, nitrate, brominate.

Does any option do that? Let's check the options.

Option A: acetylate, brominate, nitrate. No.

Option B: brominate, nitrate, acetylate. No.

Option C: nitrate, reduce, acetylate, brominate, nitrate. No.

Option D: nitrate, reduce, diazo, H3PO2, brominate, acetylate, nitrate. No.

So none of the options have the order acetylate, nitrate, brominate.

Then why is that? Did I make a mistake in thinking about the directing effects?

Wait, when you nitrate after bromination, perhaps the Br directs the nitration to a different position. Let me think again.

If you brominate after acetylation, then nitro is added meta to Br.

Wait, if the steps are acetylate, brominate, nitrate:

After acetylation (1), bromination adds Br at 3 (meta to acetyl). Then, nitrate adds nitro where? The ring has acetyl (1) and Br (3). Both are meta directors. So nitration would go to position 5 (meta to both). So the substituents are 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro), which is the target.

So the sequence is correct. So the correct option would have steps: acetylate, brominate, nitrate.

Looking at the options, option A's steps i, ii, iii are acetylate, brominate, nitrate. So that's the correct sequence. But the rest of the steps in option A are not needed. But the question asks for the sequence to lead to the target, so perhaps the extra steps are not needed, but the options list all steps.

Wait, but the options all have seven steps. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the nitration in step iii of option A is not the correct nitration. Maybe it's not the nitration step but another step.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence in option C is actually correct, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is option A.


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The target molecule has an acetyl group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. The order of introducing substituents is critical due to the directing effects of functional groups.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Acetylation of benzene (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces the acetyl group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine at position 3, meta to the acetyl group.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group at position 5, meta to both the acetyl and bromine groups.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps involve reducing the nitro group to an amine, nitrating again, diazotization, and treatment with H₃PO₂. These additional steps are unnecessary and would alter the desired product, making this option incorrect.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) introduces bromine at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group at position 2 or 4, ortho or para to bromine.
3. **Step iii**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) fails because the nitro group is a strong deactivator, preventing Friedel-Crafts acylation.
4. This option is invalid due to the failure of acetylation.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) introduces a nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) introduces an acetyl group at position 1, forming acetanilide.
4. **Step iv**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine at position 3, meta to acetanilide.
5. **Step v**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) adds the nitro group at position 5, meta to acetanilide.
6. **Steps vi–vii**: Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) and treatment with H₃PO₂ are unnecessary and would alter the product, making this option incorrect.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) introduces a nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (Fe/HCl) converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) forms a diazonium salt.
4. **Step iv**: Treatment with H₃PO₂ is unclear and unlikely to produce the desired product.
5. **Step v**: Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) adds bromine, but the sequence does not align with the desired substituent pattern.
6. **Step vi**: Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) fails due to the presence of deactivating groups.
7. **Step vii**: Additional nitration disrupts the desired structure. This option is invalid.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is **acetylation, bromination, and nitration**, which matches steps i, ii, iii of **Option A**. However, the subsequent steps in Option A (iv–vii) are unnecessary and would alter the product. Despite this, Option A is the only sequence that introduces the substituents in the correct order to achieve the target molecule.

**Answer: A**
