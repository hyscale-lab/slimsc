Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the transgenic mouse model. Let me go through the information given step by step.

The researcher created a transgenic mouse model to overexpress GADD45G. They introduced a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigen at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. The construct was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine. However, when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. They looked at the plus strand sequence of their construct and noticed something was wrong.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I'm thinking about possible issues that would prevent the protein from being expressed. The options are A to D, so I need to evaluate each.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. That would mean a change in the amino acid, but would that prevent expression? Maybe if the HA is part of the coding sequence, a mutation could cause a frame shift or a premature stop. Or perhaps the HA is causing the protein to be recognized as foreign and degraded by the cell's proteasomes. But the issue here is that the protein isn't being expressed at all, not necessarily that it's not functional.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would imply a premature stop codon. So looking at the DNA sequence, I should check for any in-frame stop codons (TGA, TAG, TAA) that could cause this. Let me scan through the sequence.

Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA triplets. Let's break it into parts. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let me look for any of those stop codons later on. Hmm, the sequence is quite long, so I need to be careful. Let me see... I'll go through the DNA sequence in triplets, keeping in mind that the mRNA is the coding strand (so the DNA sequence is the same as mRNA except T for U). Wait, actually, the plus strand is the same as mRNA except T becomes U. So the mRNA would be the same as the provided DNA sequence, except T becomes U. So any TGA in the DNA would be TGA in mRNA, which is a stop codon.

Looking through the sequence:

Wait, I think I missed a part. Let me check again. I stopped at the TGA near the end. Let's see: looking for TGA in the sequence. Let me go through the sequence carefully.

Looking for 'TGA' in the DNA:

I see that towards the end, there's a 'TGA' at the end: ...GCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the last few bases are GAGTGA. So the last part is ...GAGTGA.

Looking at the end of the DNA plus strand, the last triplet is TGA. So in the DNA, the sequence is TGA, which in mRNA would be UGA, a stop codon. But wait, the DNA is plus strand, so mRNA would be the same as plus strand (with Tâ†’U). So the mRNA ends with ...UGA, which is a stop codon.

But when does this happen? The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the HA is at the beginning. The GADD45G coding sequence comes after. If the stop codon is present in the middle of the coding sequence, that would cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein if the stop is before the HA.

Wait, but the HA is at the N-terminus. So the sequence starts with HA followed by GADD
