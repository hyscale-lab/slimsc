Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let's see what the options are.

The question lists four options: a, b, c, d. Each describes a different planet with varying masses and densities. The options provided for the answer are A to D, each pointing to one of the four.

Wait, first, I should remember that density is mass divided by volume. Right, density = mass/volume. So for each of these planets, I need to find their density and compare.

Option a) says it's an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's density is known, I think. Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet would have the same density as Earth.

Option b) is a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but the question says "which has the highest density." Oh, wait no, option b gives the density already as 5.5. So that's the same as Earth. But maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read it again. No, the question asks which has the highest density, so perhaps I need to compute the density for each based on their given masses and radii.

Wait, no. Let me read all the options carefully.

Option a: Earth mass and radius. So same as Earth, density ≈5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, density 5.5. Wait, but if density is given, maybe that's the key. Or perhaps
