Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and see what it's asking.

The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Hmm. Wait, dithiocyanato would be with two SCN- ions. So I'm looking for the [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ species, right? Or maybe it's [Co(SCN)_2]^ something. But the exact charge probably doesn't matter for the calculation here.

Stability constants, β, tell us about the stability of the complex ions. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. Each β corresponds to a different complex. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. Wait, what are the complexes in order?

Assuming that β1 is the formation constant for the first complex, which would be [Co(SCN)]^2+. Then β2 would be for [Co(SCN)_2]^something, and so on. But wait, let me think. The stability constants are for the step-wise formation. Or are they overall?

Wait, I think these are overall stability constants. So for each complex, the β is the product of the step-wise formation constants. So for the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^2+ has a β of 9. The second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^something, has β2=40, which is the overall constant for forming up to two SCN- ions. Similarly, β3=63 for three SCN-, and β4=16 for four SCN-.

Wait a minute, wait. Let me clarify. The stability constant for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex from the metal ion and the ligands. So for Co^2+ and SCN^-:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-
