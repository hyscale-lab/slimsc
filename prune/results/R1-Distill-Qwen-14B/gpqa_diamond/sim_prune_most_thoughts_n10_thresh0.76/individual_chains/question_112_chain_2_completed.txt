Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think is the Sz operator. So Sz has eigenvalues ħ/2 for |up> and -ħ/2 for |down>. But the state is given in terms of these eigenstates, and it's proportional, which probably means it's not normalized yet.

Then, I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator whose matrix is given by A_ij. The matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds a bit odd. Let me parse that. So the matrix is for the operator, and it's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-½ particles.

So for a 2x2 matrix, i and j can be 1 and 2, representing |up> and |down>, I suppose. So A_ij is zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0     ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0 ]

Hmm, that's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. What kind of operator is that? Oh, wait, that looks like the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A is (ħ/2) * σx.

So the operator in question is A = (ħ/2) σx. Therefore, the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σx, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. The eigenstates would be |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

The first part of the question is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A. So that would mean finding the probabilities of the state |alpha> being projected onto |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, since the operator A's eigenstates are the same as those of σx, perhaps we can approach this by expressing |alpha> in terms of the eigenbasis of σx.

But wait, before that, maybe I should normalize the |alpha> state first. Because right now, it's given as proportional to that combination, so I need to find the normalization factor.

So let me first normalize |alpha>.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

The inner product <alpha|alpha> is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2 because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

Calculating each modulus squared:

|1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.

|2 - i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the operator A has eigenstates which are the eigenstates of σx. The eigenstates of σx are |+x> and |-x>, and they can be written as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, is that right? Let me recall. The spin-x eigenstates are:

|+x> = (|↑> + |↓>)/√2
|-x> = (|↑> - |↓>)/√2

Yes, that's correct.

So to find the probability of measuring the system in |+x> or |-x>, I need to find the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate.

Alternatively, since A is given by (ħ/2) σx, which is the same as the spin-x operator multiplied by ħ/2, perhaps the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. But wait, the eigenvalues of σx are +1 and -1. So A has eigenvalues (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which are ±ħ/2.

But the question is about the probability of measuring each eigenstate. So the probabilities are the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |alpha> and each eigenstate.

So for |+x>, the state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So the inner product < +x | alpha> is [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) ]

Let me compute that.

So < +x | alpha> = [1/sqrt(2)] [ (1 + 0) (1+i) + (0 + 1) (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, no. Let me write it step by step.

Compute the inner product:

( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) times [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1+i) <up|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <down|down> ] / sqrt(7)

But <up|up> = 1, <up|down> =0, same for the others. So this simplifies to:

(1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1+i) *1 + (2 -i)*1 ] / sqrt(7)

Because only the terms where the bra and ket are same survive. So:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)
= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+2) + (i -i) ] / sqrt(7)
= (1/sqrt(2)) [3 + 0 ] / sqrt(7)
= 3/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))

So the probability is |< +x | alpha> |^2.

Which is (3^2)/( (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))^2 ) )= 9/(2*7) )= 9/14 ≈0.642857.

Wait, 9 divided by 14 is exactly 0.642857... which is about 0.64. Hmm, looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which sum to 1, which is correct. But let me check the other eigenstate.

Similarly, compute for |-x>:

| -x > is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < -x | alpha> = [ ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Again, compute the inner product:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (1+i) <up|down> - (2 -i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Again, only the diagonal terms survive.

So:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)*1 - (2 -i)*1 ] / sqrt(7)
= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i -2 +i) ] / sqrt(7)
= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-1 + 2i) ] / sqrt(7)

The inner product is ( (-1 + 2i) ) / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

The probability is |(-1 + 2i)|^2 / (2 *7 )

Compute | -1 + 2i |^2: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5.

So probability is 5/(14) ≈0.3571428... which is approximately 0.36. So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36.

So that would match option A, which gives 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, I should be careful. Let me check the calculations again, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, for the < +x | alpha> inner product, I had:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 3, so [3] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)), which squared gives 9/(14). Correct.

For the < -x | alpha> inner product, I had:

(1+i) - (2 -i) = (1 +i -2 +i) = (-1 + 2i). So the absolute value squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5, so 5/(14).

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which is approximately 0.6428 and 0.3571, which rounds to 0.64 and 0.36.

So the first part is 9/14 and 5/14. So the first part of the answer is 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but let me look at the options. Option A is 0.64, 0.36, and average value hbar/7.

Now the second part is finding the average value of operator A.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σx, the average value is (ħ/2) <alpha| σx |alpha>.

But σx is the Pauli X matrix, whose expectation value in a state can be found via the formula. Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, perhaps it's easier.

So let's compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

A = (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So in vector form, with |up> being the first basis vector (index 1) and |down> being the second (index 2), the state vector is [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

So when we compute A |alpha>, which is (ħ/2) σx |alpha>, it's (ħ/2) times [ ( (2 -i), (1+i) )^T ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, because σx swaps the components. So applying σx to [a; b] gives [b; a]. So:

A |alpha> = (ħ/2) * [ (2 -i), (1 +i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is [ (1+i)*, (2 -i)* ] / sqrt(7) multiplied by (ħ/2) [ (2 -i), (1 +i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

Wait, that's the conjugate transpose (bra) times the ket.

So:

= (ħ/2) [ (1 -i) (2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] / (7)

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 2 -i - 2i +i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = (2-1) -3i = 1 -3i.

Wait, no, let me compute that again.

Wait, (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i²
= 2 -3i + (-1) [since i²=-1]
= (2 -1) -3i
= 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i
=2 + 2i +i + i²
=2 +3i + (-1)
= (2-1) +3i
=1 +3i.

So adding these two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2 +0i = 2.

So <alpha| A |alpha> = (ħ/2) * (2) /7 = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7.

So that matches.

But wait, what about the other options? Let me check if I made any mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the inner product for the expectation value is [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ] all multiplied by (ħ/2) and divided by 7.

Wait, I think I did it correctly. Let me compute each term again.

(1-i)(2 -i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i²
= 2 -3i -1 = 1-3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i
=2 +2i +i + i²
=2 +3i -1 =1 +3i.

Adding these gives 1-3i + 1+3i = 2. So yes, correct.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2)(2/7) = ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that must be the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by calculating the inner product \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle \), which gives:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Next, we calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

The probability of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) is given by \( |\langle +x | \alpha \rangle|^2 \). Calculating \( \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \):

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{7}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
|\langle +x | \alpha \rangle|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

Similarly, the probability of measuring the particle in \( |-x\rangle \) is given by \( |\langle -x | \alpha \rangle|^2 \). Calculating \( \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \):

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{7}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
|\langle -x | \alpha \rangle|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is calculated as \( \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the normalized state \( |\alpha\rangle \), we find:

\[
\langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)}{7} \right).
\]

Simplifying the terms:

\[
(1-i)(2-i) = 1-3i, \quad (2+i)(1+i) = 1+3i, \quad \text{so } (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) = 2.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \hbar/7 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
