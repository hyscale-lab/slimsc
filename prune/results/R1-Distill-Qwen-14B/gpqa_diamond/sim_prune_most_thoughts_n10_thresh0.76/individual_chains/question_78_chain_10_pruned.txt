Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expressions, especially for the vector potential.

The question is giving me a scenario where a point charge q is moving along some trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a field point r. The field is observed at time t, which is after the time tr when the charge was at the point that generated the field. So, the vector d is from that earlier point to r.

I think the potentials are calculated based on the retarded time concept. Oh right, because the fields take time to propagate, so the potentials at the current time t depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr. Tr is such that the light travel time from the charge's position at tr to the point r is t - tr.

Wait, but the problem says t > tr. So, the time tr is before t. So the charge is at some position at tr, and from there, the potentials are radiated out to r by time t.

The scalar potential V and vector potential A are to be found. I remember that the scalar potential is related to the electric field, and the vector potential to the magnetic field. Also, the potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at time tr.

The scalar potential for a static charge is q/(4πε₀ r), but when the charge is moving, there might be some correction terms. Oh wait, but in the static case, d would be r, but when considering motion, we have to account for the fact that the charge was moving, so the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point is d, not r.

Wait, more accurately, the scalar potential due to a moving charge would involve the velocity. Let me think about the Lienard potentials. Lienard's formulas give expressions for the potentials of an arbitrarily moving charge.

The scalar potential, I think, is (q/(4πε₀)) [1/(d - (v·d)/(c²))], where d is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me get the exact expression.

Another approach:
