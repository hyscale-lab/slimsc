Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem gives me the state |psi> as (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. I remember that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, which are Gaussian states. So the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, which makes it a non-Gaussian state, right? Because Gaussian states are things like coherent states, squeezed states, etc., and superpositions of them are non-Gaussian.

The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). Let me write that down: N = sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) e^{-2α²} ). So for given phi and alpha, I can compute N.

The question asks for the non-Gaussianity (nG) when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5. The measure given is the relative entropy, del_b, which is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is that of a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but wait. I think the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is calculated as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state and that of a reference Gaussian state. So del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the entropy. Because the formula is trace(rho ln rho) minus the same for tau.

But which Gaussian state should I take as the reference? For a superposition state, sometimes the reference is the state you would get if you take the density matrix of the state and then replace the state with its Gaussian approximation. Or perhaps the reference is the state obtained by taking the same state but with the same first and second moments, i.e., the closest Gaussian state in some sense.

Wait, another thought: for a two-mode squeezed state or a coherent state, the reference is clear. But for a superposition of coherent states, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the mixture of the two coherent states with appropriate weights. Let me think.

The state |psi> is ( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. So the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

The reference Gaussian state tau could be the classical mixture. That is, the state where the two coherent states are in a mixed state with probabilities |cos(phi)|^2 and |sin(phi)|^2. Because the state rho is a pure state, while the reference tau is a mixed state. So tau would be |cos(phi)|^2 |alpha><alpha| + |sin(phi)|^2 |-alpha><-alpha|.

So the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (nG) would be S(rho) - S(tau).

Now, the von Neumann entropy S(rho) for a pure state rho is zero because rho is a pure state, so S(rho) = 0. Wait, wait no. Wait, rho is a pure state, yes, so its entropy is zero. But tau is a mixed state, so S(tau) is some positive value. So del_b would be 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But wait, that can't be right because the problem states that nG is del_b, which is positive. Hmm, maybe I have the formula wrong. Perhaps the formula is S(rho) - S(tau), but if rho is pure, S(rho)=0, and S(tau) is positive, so it's negative. But nG is a non-negative measure. Maybe I got the signs wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S(tau) - S(rho), but since S(rho) is zero, it's S(tau). Wait, but then the problem defines del_b as trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), which would be 0 - S(tau), so -S(tau). But that would be negative, which doesn't make sense for a non-Gaussianity measure. So perhaps I have the formula reversed.

Wait, let me recheck. The question says: "the relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]". So rho is the non-Gaussian state, and tau is the Gaussian reference. So for rho being non-Gaussian, and tau being Gaussian, what's the value?

Wait, von Neumann entropy is S(rho) = - trace(rho ln rho). So if rho is pure, S(rho) is zero. For tau, which is a mixed Gaussian state, S(tau) is positive.

So del_b = [S(rho)] - [S(tau)]? Because S(rho) is zero, del_b would be - S(tau). But that would give a negative number, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong, or perhaps the question defines it differently.

Wait, maybe the problem defines it as the relative entropy of the non-Gaussian state with respect to the Gaussian state. Normally, relative entropy D(rho || tau) is trace(rho log rho/rho log tau) = S(rho) - S(rho) with respect to tau. Wait, no, the formula is D(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). Oh wait, in the problem, the formula is [ trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau) ].

Wait that's different from the standard relative entropy. Because relative entropy usually is rho ln rho - rho ln tau, and it's D(rho || tau). But the problem's formula is rho ln rho minus tau ln tau, which is
