Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chiral centers or some kind of stereoisomerism. Let me go through each compound one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. I think the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe it's CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-, no, wait but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon of the double bond. So structure is Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, perhaps it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2? No, but-1-ene has double bond between carbons 1 and 2. So 1-chloro would be on the first carbon of the double bond.

So the structure is Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (CH2), but wait, no, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but the correct structure of 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is part of the double bond. So it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of the structure: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, so Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond. Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon: so Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, maybe the structure is Cl
