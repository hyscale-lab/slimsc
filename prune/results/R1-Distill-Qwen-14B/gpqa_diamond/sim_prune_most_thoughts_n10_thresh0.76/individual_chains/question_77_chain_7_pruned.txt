Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this. Let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction, and I need to determine the major products A and B.

First, let me read the question again. The first part is reaction A: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene is treated with BuLi followed by H+. The second part is a more complex molecule undergoing a Cope rearrangement when heated to give product B. I have four options (A, B, C, D) each giving different A and B products.

Starting with reaction A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw the structure. So, benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy connected to a methyl group. Wait, no. Wait: it's ( (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy ) methyl attached to benzene.

Wait, the structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Let me think. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy, so the group is O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But the benzene is connected to O, which is then connected to a methyl group (OCH2-)? No, wait the starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So benzene-O-CH2-(but-2-en-1-yl with 3-methyl). Wait, but perhaps more accurately, it's benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or is the substituent OCH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2? Hmm, perhaps it's better to think as the structure being benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-? No, wait but but-2
