Okay, so I need to figure out which of these molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, C3h symmetry. Wait, what's that? I remember that symmetry in molecules refers to the different operations that leave the molecule looking the same. C3h is one of those symmetry groups. Let's think about what C3h symmetry entails.

C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. The 'C' stands for 'proper rotation', so a C3 axis would mean the molecule can be rotated by 120 degrees (since 360/3=120) around that axis and look the same. The 'h' indicates that there's a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule must have a threefold rotation axis and at least one horizontal mirror plane.

Now, looking at the options: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, the two hexaones. I should go through each one.

First, triisopropyl borate. I'm not exactly sure of its structure, but triisopropyl borate is usually (i-Pr)3B(OH)2 or something similar. Wait, no, wait. I think triisopropyl borate is (i-PrO)3B. So it's a borate with three isopropyl groups attached. The structure is a central boron atom with three isopropyl oxygens attached. Boron is in the center with trigonal planar geometry. Each isopropyl group is like two methyl groups attached to a CH2-O- group. So, the molecule would have three identical substituents around the boron. So, does that give it C3 symmetry? Well, the arrangement is trigonal, so yes, a threefold rotation axis. But do they have a mirror plane? Since all three substituents are the same, any plane that passes through the boron and a substituent's axis would work as a mirror plane. Wait, but in C3h, the mirror plane is horizontal. So, the molecule's geometry must have a horizontal plane. Let me visualize: the boron is in the center, and each O is connected to an isopropyl group. The molecule would be planar with the boron in the middle. So, a horizontal mirror plane might be the plane that's perpendicular to the boron's plane, cutting through the boron. Or maybe the mirror plane is in the boron's plane. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of inversion and other symmetry elements. But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe triisopropyl borate has C3v symmetry instead, which would include a vertical mirror plane. But the question is about C3h. Hmm.

Next, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure, right? It's a norbornane-like structure but with an amine group. Its structure is a bridgehead with two cyclohexane rings. Wait, no, quinuclidine is a seven-membered bicyclic amine. The structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]heptane, I think, with an NH group. So, the molecule has a threefold axis? Let me think. The molecule has a bridge that's three carbons long on each bridge. So, each bridge is two carbons, not three. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. The molecule is symmetric, but what's its point group? Quinuclidine has a bridge structure, which often gives it a C3 symmetry. Because each bridge is the same. So, rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. Also, does it have a mirror plane? Or maybe not. Wait, if it's C3 without any mirror planes, then it would be C3, not C3h. But I'm not sure. Maybe C3h isn't the case here.

Now, the third option is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The name is a bit complex, but the structure probably has three furan rings attached to a central structure. Let's break down the name. Benzo rings are fused with three furan rings. The numbering suggests that each benzo is connected to two furan rings. Wait, I'm not too confident about this structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a tricyclic system with three furan rings connected in a way that forms a symmetric molecule. If the molecule has threefold rotation symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry.

The fourth option is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. So, a triphenylene fused with three furan rings. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure, often with three benzene rings connected in a way that makes the molecule symmetric. If this is combined with three furan rings, perhaps the overall structure has a threefold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, leading to C3h symmetry.

Wait, but how to figure out which one has C3h symmetry? Maybe I should think about the examples.

Triisopropyl borate: as the central B with three identical substituents. Each substituent is an O-isopropyl group. So, the molecule has a trigonal planar structure around B. So, the symmetry would include a C3 axis (since rotating by 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself). Are there any mirror planes? The molecule could have three vertical mirror planes, each passing through each O and the boron. But those would be vertical mirrors, which are not the horizontal ones. So, for C3h, the mirror plane needs to be horizontal, which is a plane that doesn't pass through the main atom. Alternatively, perhaps not. Wait, maybe the mirror plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis. So, in a trigonal planar molecule, the C3 axis is perpendicular to the plane. The horizontal mirror plane would be the same as the trigonal plane. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe the triisopropyl borate has C3v symmetry (vertical mirrors) but not C3h.

Quinuclidine: I think it's a C2v symmetry. Because the molecule has a bridge structure which is symmetric with inversion centers and mirror planes. Alternatively, I might be wrong. Let me think again. Quinuclidine's structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]hept-5-amine. So the molecule has a bridge with three bridges of two carbons each. Wait, no. Bicyclo[2.2.2]heptane has three bridges each of two carbons. So the molecule has a threefold axis because each bridge is the same. So, rotation by 120 degrees (which is 360/3) would leave the molecule invariant. Also, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is symmetric, perhaps the plane that bisects the structure. Quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry that's perpendicular to the axis passing through the nitrogen and the opposite carbon. Hmm, maybe the molecule doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane but has a vertical one. So, if the molecule has a threefold axis and a vertical mirror plane, it would belong to the C3v point group, not C3h.

The third option, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone: I'm not sure about the structure. Maybe it's a tricyclic system with a central benzene ring connected to three furans. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more complex arrangement. If the molecule has threefold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would be C3h.

The fourth option is triphenyleno[....]trifuran-...: Triphenylene is a symmetric structure. Triphenylene is a [2.2.2]tricyclic system with three benzene rings. If each benzene is connected to a furan ring, then the overall structure could have threefold symmetry. Let me visualize: each benzene ring is attached to a furan, so the molecule would have threefold symmetry if each substituent is arranged symmetrically. If there's a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would be C3h.

Alternatively, the first option is triphenyleno... If that's the case, then perhaps that's the correct structure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I can think about the number of symmetry elements. C3h has a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, any of the molecules with threefold symmetry and a horizontal mirror would fit.

Another approach: think about whether each molecule has a plane of symmetry that's horizontal. For instance, triisopropyl borate is planar, so a horizontal mirror plane would be possible. Wait, but the B is in the center with three identical substituents. Therefore, the molecule is symmetric upon rotation by 120 degrees. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? That would be a plane that's perpendicular to the plane of rotation. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct molecule is option A, triphenyleno[...], because it's a larger, more symmetric structure.

Wait, another thought: triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure, so the boron is in a plane with the three oxygen atoms attached. The symmetry here would be D3h, which includes a threefold rotation, a horizontal mirror plane, and others. Because D3h includes a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, which is exactly what we're looking for here. Wait, D3h is the point group for molecules with a trigonal planar geometry with a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but wait. Triisopropyl borate: The structure has a central B with three identical O-isopropyl groups. So, the molecule is trigonal planar, which is D3h symmetry. D3h includes C3, sigma h (horizontal mirror), and others. So that would mean that triisopropyl borate has C3h symmetry because it's part of D3h.

Wait, but the question is asking which molecule has C3h symmetry. So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, then it also has C3h as part of its symmetry. So triisopropyl borate would fit.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is triisopropyl borate. So, if that's the case, then the answer would be option C.

But I thought quinuclidine might have C3 symmetry. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzo[...]trifuran has a threefold symmetry but no horizontal mirror plane. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall: D3h symmetry is for trigonal planar molecules (like boron trifluoride) with a horizontal mirror plane. So, triisopropyl borate would be D3h. So, any of the symmetry elements in D3h, including C3, C2, etc., but the question specifically asks for C3h.

Wait, but C3h is a subgroup of D3h. So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it definitely has C3h.

So, if triisopropyl borate is D3h, then it has C3h symmetry.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is triisopropyl borate.

So, the correct answer would be option C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the symmetry elements required for **C₃h**: a threefold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σᵣ). Each option is evaluated based on its structure and symmetry.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule is a tricyclic system with a triphenylene core fused to three furan rings. The triphenylene structure is symmetric, and the arrangement of the furan rings suggests threefold rotational symmetry. However, there is no clear evidence of a horizontal mirror plane in this structure. Thus, it does not satisfy the **C₃h** symmetry requirements.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a benzo ring fused to three furan rings. While the structure may exhibit some symmetry, it does not clearly possess a threefold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl Borate  
The structure of triisopropyl borate features a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. This arrangement gives the molecule a trigonal planar geometry with a threefold rotation axis (C₃). Additionally, the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane (σᵣ), making it consistent with **D₃h** symmetry, which inherently includes **C₃h** symmetry. Thus, triisopropyl borate satisfies the **C₃h** symmetry requirements.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bicyclo[2.2.2]heptane framework. While it has some symmetry, it does not possess a threefold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Its symmetry is better described as **C₂v**, which does not include **C₃h**.

### Conclusion  
Among the given options, only **triisopropyl borate** has the required **C₃h** symmetry due to its trigonal planar geometry with a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: C**
