Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like a N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length a. A monochromatic light with wavelength Î» is shining along the z-axis, and we need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N approaches infinity. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.

Wait, first, what's an apothem? Oh right, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides. So if all apothems are the same length a, that means each side is equidistant from the center. When N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon approaches a circle. So essentially, the problem is about a circular aperture when N is very large.

But wait, the question says it's a polygon with N sides, but when N approaches infinity, it's a circle. So maybe this is about a circular aperture's diffraction pattern. I remember that for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot and then alternating dark and bright rings. The minima (the dark rings) occur at specific angles.

Wait, but in the context of a polygonal aperture, perhaps when N is infinite, it's a circle, so the diffraction pattern is similar. So perhaps the question is about the first minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Wait, yes, for a circular aperture, the first minima (the first dark ring
