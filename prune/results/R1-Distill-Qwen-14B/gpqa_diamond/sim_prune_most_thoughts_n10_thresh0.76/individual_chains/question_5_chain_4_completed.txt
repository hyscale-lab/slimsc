Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about finding an eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The operator is P, which is a vector operator, so it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. The problem is asking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 when the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, so the direction is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane, meaning the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and phi would be zero because it's in the x-z plane, right? Or maybe phi isn't involved since it's in x-z, which is the plane where y is zero, so yeah phi is zero.

Wait, but the direction is arbitrary, so maybe the eigenvector is expressed in terms of θ or something else. Hmm. So, the operator along direction n would be the component P·n, which is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P·n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

But each component P_x, P_y, P_z are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So I should probably write each component as a matrix first.

Given:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the operator P·n would be (ħ/2)(n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Because n is in x-z plane, so n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). And since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So, P·n = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

We're looking for the eigenvector of this matrix when the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, so the eigenvalue equation is (P·n - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So let's write the matrix P·n as (ħ/2) * M, where M is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. So the matrix for (P·n) is (ħ/2) M.

The eigenvalue equation is then:

( (ħ/2) M ) |ψ> = ( ħ/2 ) |ψ>

So, (M) |ψ> = |ψ>

Wait, I think I should subtract the identity matrix multiplied by the eigenvalue. So, the equation is (M - I) |ψ> = 0.

Because eigenvalue equation is (P·n - λ I)|ψ> = 0. Here, λ is +ħ/2. So ( (ħ/2) M - (ħ/2) I ) |ψ> =0 → (M - I) |ψ> =0.

So, the matrix (M - I) is [[n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]].

We need to find non-trivial solutions (eigenvectors) for (M - I) |ψ> =0.

Let me denote the components of the eigenvector as [a; b]. Then:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

So we have two equations:

1) (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
2) n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

We can write this as a system:

Equation 1: (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ) ] b

Equation 2: n_x a = (n_z + 1) b → a = [ (n_z +1) / n_x ] b

Wait, but from equation 1, a is proportional to b via (-n_x)/(n_z-1), and from equation 2, a is proportional to b via (n_z +1)/n_x.

So setting these equal: (-n_x)/(n_z -1) = (n_z +1)/n_x.

Multiply both sides by n_x (n_z -1):

(-n_x^2) = (n_z +1)(n_z -1) → -n_x² = n_z² -1

But n_x² + n_z² =1 (since n is a unit vector), so substituting:

-n_x² = (1 - n_x²) -1 → Wait, let me compute n_z² = 1 - n_x² because n_x² +n_z²=1.

So equation becomes:

-n_x² = (1 -n_x²) -1 → n_z² = 1 - n_x².

Wait, substituting into the equation:

-n_x^2 = (n_z^2 - 1) → since n_z^2 =1 -n_x^2, substituting:

-n_x^2 = (1 -n_x^2 -1 ) → -n_x^2 = (-n_x^2) → 0=0. So the equations are consistent, which is good.

So, the ratio a/b is either from equation 1: a = (-n_x)/(n_z -1) * b.

But let me think about this. Let me take a = k b, where k is a constant.

So, from equation 1: k = [ -n_x ] / (n_z -1 )

From equation 2: k = (n_z +1)/n_x

So setting equal:

[ -n_x ] / (n_z -1 ) = (n_z +1)/n_x → cross-multiplying:

- n_x² = (n_z +1)(n_z -1) → -n_x² = n_z² -1 → from n_x² +n_z²=1, n_z²=1 -n_x².

Substitute: -n_x² = (1 -n_x²) -1 → -n_x² = -n_x² → 0=0. So any ratios are consistent as long as the equations are satisfied.

So, perhaps it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of one variable.

Let me choose b as the free variable. Let b =1 (or any non-zero value). Then from equation 1:

a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] * b → a = -n_x/(n_z -1 )

But n_z = sqrt(1 -n_x²), since n_z is along z and in x-z plane, but I'm not sure about the sign. Wait, n is a unit vector in x-z plane, so n_z can be positive or negative, but I think in this case, since we're looking for the eigenvalue +ħ/2, perhaps n_z is positive, but I'm not certain. Hmm, but maybe the direction is arbitrary, so perhaps we'll keep it general.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize n in terms of an angle θ. Let me try that. Let θ be the polar angle from the z-axis. Since n is in the x-z plane, the angle θ is between 0 and π/2, because if θ=0, n is along z, and if θ=π/2, n is along x.

So, n_x = sin θ (since for polar coordinates, x = r sinθ cos phi, but phi is zero because in x-z plane, so x = sinθ *1, since r=1), and n_z = cos θ.

So substituting n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Then, the ratio a/b becomes:

a = [ - sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 ) * b.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let me consider the matrix M - I, which is [[cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1]]

We can find the eigenvalues of this matrix, but wait, we've already found that the eigenvalue is 1, I think, because the eigenvalue of (P·n) is ħ/2, so (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, which implies that M |ψ> = |ψ>, so the eigenvalue is 1.

Wait, but when we set up the equation (M - I) |ψ> =0, the eigenvalues would be the solutions. So, perhaps let's compute the determinant of (M - I) and set it to zero to find the possible values, but wait, since we're looking for eigenvectors, the system must be consistent, so the determinant must be zero.

Wait, but for a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is ( (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) ) - (n_x)^2 )

So determinant = ( -n_z² -n_z + n_z +1 ) - n_x² → determinant = ( -n_z² +1 ) - n_x² → but since n_x² +n_z²=1, n_x² =1 -n_z² → substitute:

determinant = ( -n_z² +1 ) - (1 -n_z² ) = -n_z² +1 -1 +n_z² =0 → determinant is zero. So, as expected, there's a non-trivial solution.

So, the eigenvectors are found by solving (M - I)|ψ> = 0.

So, let's express the eigenvector in terms of a and b. Let me write the equations again:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0 → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b =0 → sinθ a + ( - (cosθ +1) ) b =0

From the first equation: (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b.

Hmm, but cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). Let me substitute:

a = [ - (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) / ( -2 sin²(θ/2) ) ) ] * b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The negatives cancel, and 2 cancels. So:

a = [ ( sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) / ( sin²(θ/2) ) ) ] * b → a = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] * b → a = cot(θ/2) * b.

But cot(θ/2) is cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2). So, a = cot(θ/2) * b.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [ a; b ] = [ cot(θ/2) * b; b ].

Let me factor out b:

= b [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]^T.

But since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple, we can set b=1 for simplicity, so the vector is [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

But we need to normalize this vector. So the normalization condition is:

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1 → |cot(θ/2)|^2 + 1 = 1.

Wait, but that's not correct because the vector is [ cot(θ/2), 1 ], and each component is a complex number? Wait, no, wait, in this case, the components are real because n is in x-z plane, so the eigenvector should have real components.

Wait, but let's check. The matrix M is real, so eigenvectors corresponding to real eigenvalues are real.

So, the components are real. So, the normalization is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1 → (cot^2(θ/2) ) + 1 = (csc^2(θ/2)) → 1/(sin^2(θ/2)).

So, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(1/(sin^2(θ/2))) ) → sqrt(sin^2(θ/2)) ) = |sin(θ/2)|. Since θ is between 0 and π, sin(θ/2) is positive, so the factor is sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is:

( a, b ) = ( cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ) → simplifying:

cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), so a = [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2) ] * sin(θ/2) ) = cos(θ/2)

b = sin(θ/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, that makes sense because for θ=0 (along z), the eigenvector would be [1, 0], which is correct because P_z |+> = (ħ/2) |+> and the eigenstate is [1;0].

Similarly, for θ=π/2 (along x), the eigenvector is [0,1], and P_x |+> = (ħ/2) |+>.

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Now, looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but wait, the options are:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

But wait, the eigenvector is a column vector with these components. So, in terms of the given options, option C seems correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

But in the problem statement, the options are written as:

A) (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ )

B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))

C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

D) (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Wait, but in our analysis, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So option C matches exactly.

But wait, looking again, the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector is expressed in terms of theta, which is the angle of n from the z-axis.

So the correct answer would be option C, which is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but wait another moment. The problem statement says the eigenvector is normalized, so we have to ensure that the option is normalized.

In our case, the vector [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] has a norm of sqrt( cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) ) = 1, so it's normalized.

So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The operator along the direction $\vec{n}$ is expressed as $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z$, since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane (implying $n_y = 0$). 

The components of $\vec{n}$ are $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Substituting these into the operator, $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) | \psi \rangle = 0,
\]

where $I$ is the identity matrix. Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2} I$ from the operator matrix, the eigenvalue equation becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z - 1 & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0,
\]

where $| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ is the eigenvector. Solving this system of equations, we find that the components of the eigenvector satisfy:

\[
a = \cos\theta/2, \quad b = \sin\theta/2.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the norm:

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2)} = 1.
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is incorrect because the eigenvector depends on $\theta/2$, not $\theta$.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches exactly with the derived eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ is incorrect because the components are scaled unnecessarily.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
