Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations.

First, I need to remember what optical isomerism is. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning they're non-superimposable mirror images. These compounds are also called enantiomers, and they can rotate plane-polarized light, hence the term optical isomerism.

So, each compound needs to be evaluated for the presence of chiral centers.

Let's go through each one:

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
Hmm. Let me visualize this. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 6 and 2 on each ring. The substituents are nitro groups and carboxylate esters. Wait, the molecule is symmetrical? If the two rings are connected, and the substituents are on symmetric positions, could that lead to a plane of symmetry? If there's a plane of symmetry, the molecule would be achiral. But wait, if the substituents are such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral.

Wait, the positions are 6,6' and 2,2'. Biphenyl's single bond allows rotation, but the substituents here are in positions that might make the molecule chiral. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, 6 and 6' are across from each other on each ring, right? And 2 and 2' are in the same place on each ring. So maybe the molecule is symmetrical, which would mean no chiral centers. Wait, but the actual substituents: the nitro groups are in 6 and 6', and the carboxylate groups are in 2 and 2'.

Wait, perhaps the biphenyl has substituents in positions that make it chiral. For a biphenyl to be chiral, the substituents should not lie on a plane of symmetry. So if each ring has two substituents, perhaps the arrangement makes the molecule asymmetric. I'm a bit
