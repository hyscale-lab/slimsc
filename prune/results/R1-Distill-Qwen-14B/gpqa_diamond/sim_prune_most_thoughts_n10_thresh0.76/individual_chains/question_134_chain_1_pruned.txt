Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step.

First, what's enthalpy of neutralization? Oh right, it's the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical value I remember is about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but wait, that's per mole, so I guess I need to find the moles involved here.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, mixing all three? That might complicate things. Oh wait, wait—HCl is an acid, H2SO4 is also an acid, but Ba(OH)2 is a base. So the acids are reacting with the base. Interesting.

But wait, wait a minute. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right. And HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids. So when you mix them, they'll react.

But wait, how do the reactions work here? Let's think about each acid and the base.

First, let's calculate the moles of each component.

HCl: 500 mL of 0.2 M. Moles HCl = volume (L) × molarity. So 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol of HCl.

H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M. So 0.3 L * 0.3 = 0.09 mol of H2SO4.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL of 0.5 M. So 0.2 L * 0.5 = 0.1 mol of Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of it would provide 2 moles of OH- ions. Because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-. So 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 mol OH^-.

Now, the acids: HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives 1 mole H+. So 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4 is also a strong acid, but wait, it's diprotic. But in solution, does it dissociate completely? Well, the first dissociation is complete, but the second? Hmmm... Wait, for the sake of neutralization reactions, typically, H2SO4 is considered as providing 2 H+ ions per mole. But wait, in dilute solutions, the second H+ might not be fully dissociated, but I think for this problem, since we're dealing with strong acids, they'll fully dissociate. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+.

Wait, but wait. Wait, when we calculate neutralization, we need to consider the equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Let me see. So:

HCl: 0.1 mol
