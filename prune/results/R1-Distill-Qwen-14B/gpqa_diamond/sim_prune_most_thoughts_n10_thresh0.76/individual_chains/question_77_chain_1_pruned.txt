Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice chemistry problem about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

The question gives two reactions and asks about the major products A and B. Let's break it down.

First reaction: (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene is treated with BuLi and then H+. Second reaction: a complex structure is heated, leading to product B.

Starting with Reaction A. The starting material is (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw that structure. So, benzene ring with a substituent: an OCH2 group. The O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C=CH2? Wait, maybe I should recheck.

Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, but wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But with 3-methyl, so the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, but for but-2-en-1-yl, the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, no. Let's think of butene as CH2=CHCH2CH3 but the ene is in the 2 position. So the substituent would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the substituents wrong.

Wait, the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. But but has four carbons. So numbering from 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between 2 and 3, so positions 2 and 3. And a methyl
