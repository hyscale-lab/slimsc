Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. So mu = γ S_z. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's moment is aligned with it. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. Now, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. I need to find the oscillation frequency.

Wait, spin-1/2 particles... I remember that their spin can be either up or down, and the magnetic moment relates to that. When a magnetic field is applied, the spin will align with the field because of the Zeeman effect.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the energy levels are determined by the interaction energy, which is -mu·B. So for the initial state, the particle is in the eigenstate of S_z, probably with eigenvalue +ħ/2 or -ħ/2, but since it's aligned, it must be the higher energy state, right? So mu points in the same direction as B.

Then the field is switched to +Y. Oh, wait, the field is turned off and then another turned on. So the system is now in a magnetic field along Y. But how does that affect the spin state?

Wait, the spin state was along Z before. But when the field changes direction, the Hamiltonian changes. The initial state might not be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, causing it to precess or oscillate.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <mu_z>, and its oscillation frequency.

I think this has to do with the time evolution of the state under the new Hamiltonian. The magnetic moment is mu = γ S_z, so mu_z is γ times S_z. So the average <mu_z> would be γ times <S_z>.

So the question reduces to finding the time dependence of <S_z>, which would oscillate.

The system's time evolution is governed by the new Hamiltonian H. What's H in this case? Well, the magnetic field is along Y now. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu·B. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The potential energy is U = -mu·B, but in quantum mechanics, H is often taken as the Zeeman term. So H = - gamma S · B, since mu = gamma S. Wait, no, mu is gamma S, so H is proportional to S · B.

Wait, the magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times S_z initially. Wait, no, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So perhaps mu = gamma S, but when B is along a different direction, like Y, then the interaction is H = -mu · B, which would be H = -gamma S · B.

Wait, let's clarify. The magnetic dipole moment is mu = gamma S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. Then the energy is U = - mu · B.

So H = - mu · B. Since mu is gamma S, H = - gamma S · B.

In this case, when B is along +Y, B = B (0,1,0) (in x,y,z components). So H = -gamma B (S_x *0 + S_y *1 + S_z *0) = -gamma B S_y.

So the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Or wait, sometimes the sign might be different depending on context. Alternatively, sometimes H is written as H = omega S · n, where omega is the Larmor frequency and n is the direction of the field.

Let me think again. The interaction energy is U = - mu · B. Since mu = gamma S, so U = -gamma S · B. So H = -gamma B S · n, where n is the direction, say (0,1,
