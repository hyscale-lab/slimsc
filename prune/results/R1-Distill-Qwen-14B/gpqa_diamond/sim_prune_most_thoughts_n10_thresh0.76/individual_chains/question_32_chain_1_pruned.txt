Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. I remember that the atomic mass is approximately the mass of the nucleus, so I might need the mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

Next, I'm supposed to find the energy of the RHIC. RHIC collides heavy ions, so I think it's about the kinetic energy of the nucleus. Wait, but when it comes to high-energy particles, we usually deal with relativistic energies. So I probably need to use the relativistic energy equations.

The speed given is 0.96c, which is pretty high. So I should use the relativistic kinetic energy formula. Let me recall that the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. Kinetic energy is total energy minus rest energy, but sometimes in these problems, the energy refers to the total energy. Wait, the question says "energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So I think it's the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm, maybe I should think about both possibilities.

Wait, the problem says "energy of the RHIC". RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy, which usually refers to their kinetic energy. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh, but in particle physics, sometimes the energy is the kinetic plus rest mass. No, wait, no, I think for heavy ions, like heavy nuclei, the rest mass is significant, but for high-energy colliders, the kinetic energy can be a large fraction of the total.

But maybe for this problem, I can proceed with calculating the total energy and then subtract the rest energy to get kinetic. Or perhaps the question directly wants the total energy. Let me think. The problem says what is the energy of RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c. So perhaps it's the kinetic energy, but I need to clarify.

Wait, the energy of the collider is usually given for each beam, and in terms of kinetic energy. But I'm not
