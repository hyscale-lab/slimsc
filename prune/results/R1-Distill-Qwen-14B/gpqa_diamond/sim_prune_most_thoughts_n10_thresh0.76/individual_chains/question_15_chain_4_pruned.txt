Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher chance of transiting. Let's see what I remember about transits and the factors that influence the probability.

Transit probability depends on a few things, right? I think the main factors are the size of the planet compared to the star and the orbital distance. Oh wait, but wait. The probability is also influenced by the orientation of the orbit relative to our line of sight. Because if the orbit's plane is edge-on, we have a chance to see the transit. If it's more face-on, we won't.

Wait, but in this question, both planets have already been detected via the RV method. RV detects planets based on the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star. That method is sensitive to the mass of the planet and the orbital period, but not the inclination. Oh, wait, but for the RV method, you can only get the minimum mass because the inclination (i) is a factor. If the orbit is exactly edge-on, the mass is the actual mass; if it's more face-on, you get a lower value. So, the RV method gives a lower limit on the mass.

But for transit probability, inclination is super important. The probability that the orbit is aligned such that we see a transit depends on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance. The formula I remember is something like the probability P is roughly (R_star / a) * (1 / sin i), but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by some function of the orbital inclination. Wait, perhaps more accurately, the probability is (R*/a) / (something involving the impact parameter and the orbital parameters).

Wait, I think the formula for the probability of a transit is approximately (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 - eÂ²)^(1/2)), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. So, it simplifies to R*/a. Oh wait, is that correct? So, wait, the transit probability is proportional to (R*/a) multiplied by another factor. Or maybe it's (R*/a) / (something else). Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, another approach
