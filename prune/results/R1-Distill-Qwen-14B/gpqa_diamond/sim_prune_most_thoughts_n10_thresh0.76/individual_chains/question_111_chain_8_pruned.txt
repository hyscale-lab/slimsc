Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question has two parts, A and B, each involving a reaction, and I need to pick the major products from the given options. Let's take it step by step.

First, let's look at reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate under the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So this might be a conjugate addition or maybe an aldol reaction. Wait, wait, the starting material is a ketone. Ethyl acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. Oh right, when a ketone reacts with an enolate or something like that, maybe it's a Michael addition or a conjugate addition.

Wait, no, the starting material is a ketone, and ethyl acrylate is the other reactant. Oh wait, wait, maybe it's a Claisen-Schmidt condensation? No, that's between two ketones or an aromatic aldehyde and ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition of the enolate of ethyl acrylate into the ketone.

Wait, but I think the base, t-BuOK, would deprotonate the more acidic proton. In ethyl acrylate, the α-protons are acidic. When deprotonated, it forms an enolate, which can attack the carbonyl carbon of the ketone in a conjugate addition. So this would be a Michael addition. But wait, the ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexanone has substituents at positions 2 (ethyl), 6 (methyl?), wait the numbering is a bit tricky. Let me think.

The starting compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1. The substituents at 2 would be ethyl and methyl? Wait, the numbering: cyclohexan-1-one means the ketone is at position 1. Then positions 2 and 6 have substituents. So position 2 is ethyl and methyl? Because it's 2-ethyl and
