Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The NMR and IR data are given. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent. The options are A to D.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what each step does.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When dibrominated compounds react with a strong base like KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, elimination might occur. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's causing an elimination reaction, removing HBr and forming a double bond.

Wait, elimination of two equivalents of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form an allene or maybe a diene. Wait, but wait, elimination typically forms a double bond. But since it's 1,3-dibromo, perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between carbons 1 and 3. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide, so elimination would form a double bond between the two adjacent carbons. But in adamantane, positions 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on opposite ends. Hmm, maybe upon elimination, it forms an exo-methylene group?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a structure with four six-membered cyclohexane-like rings, and the 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons, but perhaps in a way that allows for elimination.

Wait, maybe when KOH is used, it's a double dehydrohalogenation. So each Br is replaced by elimination, forming a double bond. So if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination of two HBr molecules would give 1,3-diamantadiene? Or perhaps a conjugated diene in the adamantane structure.

Wait, but elimination reactions usually form one double bond. But with two Br atoms in vicinal positions, heating with KOH would likely cause a double elimination, forming a diene. So perhaps the product is 1,3-diamantadiene, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, it could form an allene, but that's less likely.

Wait, let me think about the IR data. The IR shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. What functional groups have that? Typically, a carbonyl group (C=O) absorbs around 1700 cm⁻¹. So maybe product 1 is a ketone or an ester or something with a carbonyl.

Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is reacting with KOH. Maybe it's not elimination but substitution. If KOH is in excess, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But with two bromines, maybe it's a double substitution, but that might not form a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a ketone. How? Oh, wait, maybe the bromide is adjacent to a bridgehead, and elimination leads to ring contraction or expansion, which could form a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that upon elimination, a carbonyl is formed.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of an epoxide? No, epoxides are usually formed from alkenes via peracid or other reagents, but KOH probably doesn't do that.

Wait, the 1H NMR of product 1 shows signals: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let me think about possible structures. The 4.79 ppm is a singlet, maybe for an -OCH2- group. Because OCH2 would typically be around 3-4 ppm, but maybe deshielded. Or perhaps it's a CH2 next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Alternatively, maybe an epoxide's protons, but those are usually more downfield, maybe around 4.5-5.5 ppm. Or perhaps it's a carbonyl compound, like a ketone.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl. So product 1 might be a ketone. How does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon treatment with KOH?

Wait, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. For example, in the presence of a strong base, two HBr eliminations could form a carbonyl group. Let me think: when a dihalide undergoes double dehydrohalogenation, it can form an alkyne, but that would require two eliminations with the same base. Alternatively, if the dihalide is vicinal, elimination could form a double bond, but that's not a carbonyl.

Wait, but wait, if the dihalide is not on adjacent carbons but on positions that allow for a conjugate elimination, maybe it forms a conjugated diene, but that doesn't result in a carbonyl.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or a ketone. Wait, in a ketone, the protons adjacent are usually not present because ketones have R2C=O. So perhaps the 4.79 is part of an OCH2 group, like in an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a diketone, then the 4.79 might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal diol, but that would require adding water, which may not be the case here.

Wait, maybe product 1 isn't a ketone but an alcohol. But the IR doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantanone. Because if you eliminate two HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, you would form a carbonyl group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr to form 1-adamantanone or something similar.

Wait, adamantane has four cyclohexane rings. So 1-adamantanone would have a ketone group at the bridgehead. Let me think about the structure. So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr, perhaps it forms 1,3-diketone? Or maybe a single ketone if one Br is eliminated as HBr and the other as another.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's say the molecule is CBr2(C)..., so elimination would form a double bond, but that requires two adjacent Brs. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on carbons 1 and 3, but are they adjacent? In adamantane, the structure is such that each bridgehead is connected to three other carbons, so 1 and 3 might not be adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the two Brs are on bridgeheads, and elimination would form a carbonyl group. For example, each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, and elimination would form a carbonyl, leading to a diketone. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps only one Br is eliminated, but that doesn't explain the IR.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more like a nucleophilic substitution. If KOH is in excess, perhaps it's a double substitution. For 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which has two Br atoms, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group. But then product 1 would be 1,3-diol, but that doesn't fit the IR data of a carbonyl.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or something else, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) might be an -OCH2- group. The 1.94 (2H)
