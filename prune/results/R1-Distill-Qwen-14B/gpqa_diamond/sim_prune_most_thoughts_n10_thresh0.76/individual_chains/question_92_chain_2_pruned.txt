Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize the structure. It looks like a molecule with two double bonds and several branches. Maybe it's some sort of polystyrene or a similar structure, but I'm not entirely sure. But I don't think the exact structure matters as much as the number of atoms and bonds involved here.

The question provides bond energies for different bonds. Enthalpy of atomization is also given, which is the energy required to break all bonds in an atom. So for carbon, each atom requires 1000 kJ/mol to atomize.

The enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. For a hydrocarbon, that means forming it from carbon ( graphite ) and hydrogen gas.

So the formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of all bonds broken in reactants] - [sum of bond energies of all bonds formed in products]

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. When you form a molecule from its elements, you break the bonds in the elements and form the bonds in the molecule.

For example, for methane, CH4:

Breaking C (atomization) and H2 bonds, then forming C-H bonds.

So more precisely:

ΔHf° = [Σ (Bond energies of bonds broken in elements) ] - [Σ (Bond energies of bonds formed in compound) ]

Wait, actually, bond energies are for the bonds in the molecule. So I think the correct approach is:

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of all bonds broken in forming the molecule) - (sum of bond energies of all bonds in the molecule).

But wait, I'm getting confused. The standard approach is to calculate the enthalpy change as the sum of the bond energies of the reactant bonds (elements) minus the sum of the bond energies of the product bonds (the molecule).

Wait, actually, no. The way I remember it is:

ΔHf° = [ (number of C atoms × enthalpy of atomization of C)
