Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it carefully.

The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which are a type of pericyclic reaction. I remember that in these reactions, a pi bond moves into a sigma bond. Examples given are Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which are both sigma-tropic.

There are three separate reactions to complete, each producing a product labeled A, B, and C. I need to match these products with the options given.

Let's break down each reaction one by one.

**Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat â†’ A**

Hmm, so the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. The reagents are H+ and heat. I'm thinking that under acidic conditions, we might be looking at some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine has two methoxy groups on a central carbon, which is also attached to an amine. So its structure is like (CH3O)2CH-NH2. But wait, no: the formula is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So ethanamine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So, the structure is (CH3O)2CHNH2. But wait, ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. So at position 1, which is the first carbon (the CH2 in ethanamine), both the groups are methoxy and amine? Or wait, maybe it's more accurately:

The structure would be CH2(NH2)(OCH3)2, because ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, but 1,1-dimethoxy means two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So the molecule is (CH3O)2CH2NH2? Or perhaps (CH3O)2C-NH2? Wait, ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be when both methoxy groups are on the same carbon as the NH2. So the
