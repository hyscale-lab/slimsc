Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find out the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required for this. Also, we need to determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide. It's a weak base, I think. So when a strong acid is added, it should react with the hydroxide. The reaction would probably produce Fe^3+ ions and water. Let me write the reaction equation.

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh right, because Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, so each would react with a H+ ion. So yeah, the stoichiometric ratio is 1:3.

So, the first step is to calculate how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. Then, determine how many moles of H+ are needed to completely dissolve it. Then, calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid required to provide that H+.

Let me start with the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron (Fe) has an atomic mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and Hydrogen (H) is 1.008 g/mol. So for Fe(OH)3, it's Fe + 3(OH-), which is Fe + 3O + 3H.

Calculating molar mass: 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1.008) = 55.85 + 3*(17.008) = 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol. Hmm, wait wait, 17.008 times 3 is 51.024? Let me check: 17 *3 is 51, 0.008 *3=0.024. Yes, that's correct.

So, 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 / 106.874 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me compute that: 0.1 divided by 106.874 is approximately 9.358e-4. So about 0.0009358 moles.

Now, from the equation, each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+. So the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 0.0009358 = 0.0028074 moles.

The acid is monobasic and strong, so it will dissociate completely. Let's assume the acid is HCl, which is monobasic. So the concentration is 0.1 M, and we need 0.0028074 moles. The volume (V) can be found using Molarity = moles / volume (in liters). So volume = moles / Molarity.

So, V = 0.0028074 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028074 liters = 28.074 cm³. Wait, but the options have higher volumes. Hmm, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because the options are like 28, 30, etc., and one of them is 28.05 which is very close. So that would point to option C, which is 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04.

Wait, but wait, the solution is 100 cm³ (0.1 L). So when we add 28 cm³ of acid, the total volume is 128 cm³. But wait, the problem says 100 cm³ total volume, so perhaps I misunderstood. Or maybe the acid volume is being added to the 100 cm³, but maybe the reaction is done in 100 cm³, so the total volume after adding acid would be more than 100, but the problem states the solution is 100 cm³. Oh, wait, no. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution's final volume is 100 cm³. So when adding the acid, the volume after reaction is 100 cm³.

Wait, but how? Because adding the acid would change the volume, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the volume change is negligible, or that the total volume remains 100 cm³. Alternatively, maybe they are considering that the acid is added in such a way that the total volume is kept at 100 cm³. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with my initial calculation.

So according to my calculation, the required H+ is 0.0028074 mol. The acid is 0.1 M, so V = 0.028074 L = 28.074 cm³. So option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So that's probably the correct volume.

Now, the next part: what's the pH of the resulting solution?

Well, after dissolving Fe(OH)3 in the acid, the solution will contain Fe^3+ ions and excess H+ ions if any.

Wait, let's think. Fe(OH)3 reacts with H+ to produce Fe^3+ and water. We have 0.0009358 moles of Fe(OH)3, which requires 0.0028074 moles of H+. The acid solution contributes H+ ions in the following way: each mole of the acid (like HCl) gives one mole of H+.

Wait, because the acid is monobasic and strong, so each mole of acid gives one mole H+.

So the amount of H+ in the acid is V_acid * 0.1 M. If V_acid is 28.074 cm³, which is 0.028074 L, then moles H+ = 0.1 * 0.028074 = 0.0028074 mol, which is exactly the amount needed to react with Fe(OH)3. So in this case, all the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, and there is no excess H+.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the acid is exactly stoichiometric, then the solution would have Fe^3+ and water. But what about the pH? If all the H+ is consumed, then the solution would have Fe^3+ hydrolyzing in water, making it acidic.

So, the solution would have Fe^3+ ions, which are hydrolyzing:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

So the pH would depend on the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, but if the solution is at 0.1 L (100 cm³), and the moles of Fe^3+ are 0.0009358 mol, then the concentration is 0.0009358 / 0.1 = 0.009358 M.

Hmm, that's approximately 9.358e-3 M.

The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered as a weak acid. The hydrolysis reaction produces H+ ions, so the solution will be acidic, and the pH can be calculated using the hydrolysis constant.

But wait, I don't recall the exact K for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Iron(III) hydrolysis in water. The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is a multi-step process, but perhaps we can approximate it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH by considering the hydrolysis reaction. Let's write the reaction:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But I don't remember the exact value of K for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Let me think. I think the K is around 1e-33 or something, but I'm not sure. Wait, that can't be right. Because that would make it extremely weak, leading to a very low pH. Alternatively, perhaps K is around 6.8e-38 at 25°C. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M. If the hydrolysis is significant, we can calculate the H+ concentration from that.

Wait, perhaps the hydrolysis can be approximated by:

The concentration of H+ is given by sqrt(3*K * c), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe the pH is calculated using the formula for a weak acid.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis can be considered as a reaction where Fe^3+ acts as an acid, donating H+ ions.

Let me think in terms of H+ concentration.

The solution after reaction is 0.1 L (100 cm³) with 0.0009358 mol Fe^3+.

So the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M.

The hydrolysis equation can be considered as:

Fe^3+ → Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

But wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think of the hydrolysis as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is the hydrolysis constant, K_h.

I think the hydrolysis constant for Fe^3+ is around 6.8e-38 at 25°C. Let me check that. Wait, I'm not certain, but I'll proceed with that value for the sake of calculation.

So K_h = 6.8e-38.

The expression for K is:

K_h = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

Assuming that the concentration of Fe(OH)3 is negligible compared to [H+], but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can make the assumption that [Fe(OH)3] is negligible, so the reaction is:

Fe^3+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

Wait, that's a stepwise approach. Maybe each hydroxide comes off step by step. But perhaps it's easier to model the overall reaction.

Wait, but given that K_h is very small, the H+ concentration from the hydrolysis would be low, but wait, no, because Fe^3+ is a strong enough acid to produce H+.

Wait, perhaps the approximation is that [Fe^3+] is much larger than [H+], so the reaction quotient is approximately [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] ≈ K.

So [H+]^3 ≈ K * [Fe^3+].

So [H+] = (K * [Fe^3+])^(1/3).

Plugging in the numbers:

K = 6.8e-38,

[Fe^3+] = 0.009358 M.

So [H+]^3 = 6.8e-38 * 0.009358.

Compute that: 6.8e-38 * 0.009358 ≈ 6.36824e-40.

So [H+] = cube root of (6.36824e-40) = (6.36824e-40)^(1/3).

Let me compute that. 1e-40 is (1e-13.333)^3. So cube root of 6.368e-40 is approximately 4.01e-13.333, wait, let me compute step by step.

Cube root of 6.368 is about 1.855, and cube root of 1e-40 is 1e-13.333... (since (1e-13.333)^3 = 1e-40). So 1.855e-13.333.

Wait, 1e-13 is 1e-13, which is 1e-13.

Wait, 1e-13.333 is approximately 4.64e-14. Wait, no: 10^(-13.333) is the same as 10^(-40/3) = (10^(-40))^(1/3).

Wait, perhaps it's better to use logarithms. Let me compute:

log10(6.368e-40) = log(6.368) + (-40) ≈ 0.8043 -40 = -39.1957.

Divide by 3: log10([H+]) = (-39.1957)/3 ≈ -13.065.

So [H+] = 10^(-13.065) ≈ 8.69e-14 M.

Wait, but wait, 10^(-13.065) is approximately 8.69e-14?

Wait, 10^-13 is 1e-13, 10^-13.1 is about 7.94e-14, 10^-13.065 is about 8.69e-14, yes.

So [H+] = 8.69e-14 M.

Then, pH = -log10([H+]) = -log(8.69e-14) ≈ 13.065. Wait, but that can't be right because Fe^3+ is a strong enough acid that the solution would be acidic, not basic.

Wait, that must mean I made a mistake. Because Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and hydrolyzes in water to produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic. So the pH should be less than 7.

Wait, but according to this calculation, pH is about 13.06, which is basic. That doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake in the K_h value.

Ah, I think I messed up the K_h. Maybe the hydrolysis constant is actually 6.8e-38, but that's for Fe(OH)3 ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3OH^-? That would explain why I get a high pH. Wait, maybe I inverted the reaction.

Wait, the correct reaction for hydrolysis of Fe^3+ should produce H+ ions, not OH-.

So perhaps the correct K is for Fe^3+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. So the K for this reaction is very small, making the solution acidic.

Wait, but what is the actual value of K for this reaction? Let me think. I think the correct K is approximately 6.8e-38, but perhaps it's the K for the reverse reaction, which would be the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, wait, Fe(OH)3 has a Ksp which is the solubility product. Let me look that up in my memory. I think Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is about 6.8e-38, correct.

Wait, Ksp is for Fe(OH)3 ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3OH^-. So Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6.8e-38.

So if I want to find the pH after the reaction, I need to consider the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, but after adding the exact stoichiometric amount of H+, all the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, and the solution contains Fe^3+ and excess H+? No, because if the acid is exactly stoichiometric, all the Fe(OH)3 is converted to Fe^3+ and water, and the H+ is all used up. Wait, but that can't be right because the reaction would require 3 H+ per Fe(OH)3.

Wait, let me re-examine the initial reaction.

The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, 3 moles of H+ are consumed. If I added 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, then all the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, and the solution contains Fe^3+ and any excess H+.

Wait, in this case, the moles of H+ added were exactly 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So all the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, and the solution has Fe^3+ and no excess H+.

Wait, but that can't be right, because when you add a strong acid to a solution of a weak base, the reaction goes to completion, and any excess acid would contribute to H+.

Wait, no, in this case, the moles of H+ added are exactly 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So, all Fe(OH)3 reacts, and the H+ is consumed. So the solution contains Fe^3+ and any H+ from water (but that's negligible).

But then, the Fe^3+ would hydrolyze, producing H+.

So, to find the pH, I need to calculate the H+ concentration from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So, the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.0009358 mol in 0.1 L, which is 0.009358 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But I think K for this reaction is equal to 1/Ksp, because the Ksp is for the reverse reaction (Fe(OH)3 dissociating into Fe^3+ and OH^-).

Wait, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6.8e-38.

So the reverse reaction, which is the formation of Fe(OH)3 from Fe^3+ and H2O, would have a K equal to 1/Ksp.

So K = 1/(6.8e-38) ≈ 1.47e37.

Wait, that's a very large K, which suggests the reaction strongly favors products, but that can't be right because Fe(OH)3 is only sparingly soluble. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the hydrolysis as the reverse of the dissolution.

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ (aq) + 3 OH^- (aq), Ksp = 6.8e-38.

So the reverse reaction would be:

Fe^3+ (aq) + 3 OH^- (aq) ⇌ Fe(OH)3 (s), K = 1/Ksp = 1.47e37.

But in our case, we have Fe^3+ in water, and we want to find the H+ concentration because of the hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ in terms of H+.

The hydrolysis reaction can be written as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its concentration is constant and can be incorporated into the K. So K = K_h = ([H+]^3) / [Fe^3+].

So, K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

We can rearrange this to [H+] = cube root( K_h * [Fe^3+] ).

But wait, what is K_h? Since Ksp is 6.8e-38 for Fe(OH)3 dissociating into Fe^3+ and OH^-, then for the reverse reaction, the formation of Fe(OH)3 from Fe^3+ and OH^- has K = 1/Ksp = 1.47e37.

But the hydrolysis reaction I'm considering produces H+.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the acid dissociation. The Fe^3+ can be considered as an acid:

Fe^3+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

The K for this reaction would be the hydrolysis constant K_h.

Wait, but without knowing the exact K_h, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I should look for an approximate approach.

Wait, another idea: the solution after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with exactly the required H+ has a concentration of Fe^3+ of 0.009358 M. Let's assume that the hydrolysis is significant, so the [H+] comes mainly from the hydrolysis.

Let me assume that [H+] is much larger than the H+ from water, but in this case, because Fe^3+ is a weak acid, maybe the H+ concentration is low.

Wait, but if K_h is 6.8e-38, which is very small, then [H+] would be small, leading to a high pH. But that can't be right because Fe^3+ should make the solution acidic.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the K expressions.

Wait, perhaps the hydrolysis equation should be written as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it's not included in the expression. So the K becomes [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = K.

But wait, in the presence of excess H+, the reaction might not proceed. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that the concentration of H+ is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So, let me set up the equation.

[H+]^3 = K * [Fe^3+].

But K for the reaction is K = Kw / Ksp.

Hmm, wait, perhaps K is related to Kw and Ksp.

Wait, the K for Fe(OH)3 dissociating is Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The K for the reverse reaction is K = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 / Ksp = 1. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction can be written as:

K = ([Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3) / [Fe^3+] )

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it's excluded, so K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But how to find K?

Alternatively, using the Ksp expression.

We know that:

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6.8e-38.

We can express [OH^-] in terms of [H+] using Kw = [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14.

So [OH^-] = 1e-14 / [H+].

Substituting into Ksp:

[Fe^3+](1e-14 / [H+])^3 = 6.8e-38.

Rearranging,

[Fe^3+] = 6.8e-38 * [H+]^3 / (1e-42) )

Wait, wait: (1e-14)^3 is 1e-42.

So,

[Fe^3+] = (6.8e-38) * [H+]^3 / 1e-42.

=> [Fe^3+] = 6.8e-38 / 1e-42 * [H+]^3.

6.8e-38 / 1e-42 = 6.8e4 = 68000.

So,

[Fe^3+] = 6.8e4 * [H+]^3.

But we know that [Fe^3+] is 0.009358 M.

So,

0.009358 = 6.8e4 * [H+]^3.

Solving for [H+]^3:

[H+]^3 = 0.009358 / 6.8e4 ≈ 1.376e-6.

Taking cube root:

[H+] ≈ (1.376e-6)^(1/3) ≈ 1.11e-2.

So [H+] ≈ 0.0111 M.

Then, pH = -log(0.0111) ≈ 1.96.

Which is approximately 2.0.

Looking at the options, option C has pH 2.04 and volume 28.05 cm³. That seems to match.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

[H+]^3 = 0.009358 / 6.8e4.

0.009358 is 9.358e-3.

So 9.358e-3 / 6.8e4 = (9.358 / 6.8e7) )e-3 / e0? Wait, I'm getting confused with the exponents.

Wait, 9.358e-3 divided by 6.8e4 is equal to (9.358 / 6.8) ) * 1e-7.

9.358 /6.8 ≈ 1.376.

So 1.376e-7.

Wait, wait, no, because 6.8e4 is 6.8 * 1e4, so 9.358e-3 / 6.8e4 = (9.358 /6.8 ) * 1e-7 ≈ (1.376) *1e-7 = 1.376e-7.

So [H+]^3 = 1.376e-7.

Taking cube root: (1.376e-7)^(1/3) ≈ 5.16e-3.

So [H+] ≈ 0.00516 M.

pH = -log(0.00516) ≈ 2.287. That's about 2.29, which isn't matching any of the options. Hmm, this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Let me go back.

We have [Fe^3+] = 6.8e4 * [H+]^3.

Wait, [Fe^3+] = 6.8e4 * [H+]^3.

So solving for [H+]^3:

[H+]^3 = [Fe^3+] / 6.8e4.

[H+]^3 = 0.009358 / 6.8e4.

Wait, 0.009358 is 9.358e-3, so 9.358e-3 / 6.8e4 = (9.358 /6.8 ) * 1e-7.

9.358 /6.8 ≈ 1.376.

So [H+]^3 ≈ 1.376e-7.

Cube root of 1.376e-7 is approximately 5.16e-3.

So [H+] ≈ 0.00516 M.

pH = -log(0.00516) ≈ 2.287.

Hmm, but none of the options have 2.28. The closest option is B with pH 2.69, and C with pH 2.04.

Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere in the setup?

Alternative approach: perhaps I should consider the hydrolysis as a stepwise process.

Each Fe^3+ can donate a proton stepwise:

Fe^3+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

The K for each step is Ka1, Ka2, etc.

But I'm not sure about the exact values of the K_a for Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps the first hydrolysis step is:

Fe^3+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

The K for this step is Ka1 ≈ 1e-3. But I'm not certain. Let me assume that.

If Ka1 is about 1e-3, then we can calculate [H+] using the formula for a weak acid.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M.

The reaction is:

Fe^3+ → Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

Assuming that x is the concentration of H+ produced:

Ka1 = x^2 / (0.009358 - x) ≈ (x^2) / 0.009358.

Because x is small compared to 0.009358.

So x^2 ≈ 1e-3 * 0.009358.

x^2 = 9.358e-6.

x = sqrt(9.358e-6) ≈ 3.06e-3.

So [H+] = 0.00306 M.

pH = -log(0.00306) ≈ 2.516.

That's about 2.52, which is closer to option B's pH of 2.69.

Wait, but I'm assuming Ka1 is 1e-3, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the first hydrolysis step has a Ka of around 6.8e-4, as I've read somewhere.

Wait, I think I remember that the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be approximated with a K of 6.8e-4 for the first step.

So let's try that.

Ka1 = 6.8e-4.

Then, x^2 = 6.8e-4 * 0.009358.

x^2 = 6.8e-4 * 9.358e-3 = 6.8 *9.358e-7 ≈ 6.36e-6.

x = sqrt(6.36e-6) ≈ 2.52e-3.

So [H+] = 2.52e-3 M.

pH = -log(0.00252) ≈ 2.598, about 2.60.

That's getting close to option B's pH of 2.69.

Hmm, but there's another possibility: perhaps the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ leads to multiple H+ ions, so the overall effect is more significant.

Alternatively, maybe the solution isn't just from the first hydrolysis step but from all three steps. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ to produce 3 H+ ions per Fe^3+.

Wait, the reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is 1/Ksp.

Wait, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

At 25°C, Ksp is 6.8e-38.

So, [OH^-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe^3+].

[OH^-]^3 = (6.8e-38) / (0.009358) ≈ 7.26e-36.

[OH^-] ≈ (7.26e-36)^(1/3) ≈ 8.99e-12.

Then, pOH = -log(8.99e-12) ≈ 11.05.

So pH = 14 - 11.05 = 2.95.

Hmm, but that's around 2.95, which isn't matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the solution differently. After the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, the solution contains Fe^3+ ions. These ions will hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic. The concentration of H+ will determine the pH.

The formula to calculate the pH is based on the hydrolysis reaction:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it's not included in the expression, so K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

But K for this reaction is equal to 1/Ksp because Ksp is for the reverse reaction (dissolution of Fe(OH)3).

Wait, no. Ksp is the solubility product, which is the product of the concentrations of the ions when the solid is in equilibrium with the solution. So the K for the dissolution is Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The reverse reaction (formation of Fe(OH)3 from Fe^3+ and OH^-) has K = 1/Ksp.

So the hydrolysis reaction is the reverse of the dissolution:

Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H2O.

But that's not producing H+. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is that the hydrolysis reaction produces H+.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it using the relation between H+ and OH^-.

Wait, since Kw is 1e-14, [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for alternative ways to approximate the pH.

Another approach is to calculate the concentration of H+ using the formula for a salt of a weak acid. Since Fe^3+ is a cation of a weak acid (Fe(OH)3), it will hydrolyze in water to produce H+.

The formula for the concentration of H+ in such a solution is:

[H+] = sqrt( n * Kw / Ksp )

Wait, where n is the number of H+ ions produced per formula unit.

Wait, in this case, each Fe^3+ produces 3 H+ ions, as per the reaction Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

So n=3.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this formula applies directly. Let me think about the general approach.

The hydrolysis can be treated as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Assuming that the hydrolysis is complete enough that [H+] can be considered as 3x, and [Fe^3+] ≈ c (since x is small compared to initial concentration c).

Then, K = (3x)^3 / c ≈ (27x^3)/c.

But K is 1/Ksp, because Ksp is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again.

Perhaps I'll try to find the pH using the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid.

In this case, Fe^3+ is the conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3, which is a weak base. So the solution of Fe^3+ will be acidic.

The pH can be found using the formula:

pH = (pKa + p) / 2,

where pKa is the pKa of the conjugate acid and p is the number of hydroxide ions per formula unit. But I'm not sure if this applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:

[H+] = [Fe^3+]^(1/3) * sqrt(Kw * something).

Wait, this is getting too vague.

Given the time I'm spending on this, perhaps I should refer back to the options. My initial calculation for the volume was 28.07 cm³, which matches option C, but the pH I'm getting isn't matching.

Wait, but in the options, option C has pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm³, which is very close to my initial volume calculation.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is in the way I calculated the pH. Let me try a different approach.

If the solution is at equilibrium, the [H+] can be found using the Ksp expression.

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6.8e-38.

Let me express [OH^-] in terms of [H+]:

[OH^-] = 1e-14 / [H+].

Substituting into Ksp:

0.009358 * (1e-14 / [H+])^3 = 6.8e-38.

Simplify:

0.009358 * (1e-42) / [H+]^3 = 6.8e-38.

Multiply both sides by [H+]^3:

0.009358 * 1e-42 = 6.8e-38 * [H+]^3.

Rearranged:

[H+]^3 = (0.009358 * 1e-42) / (6.8e-38).

Calculating numerator: 0.009358 * 1e-42 = 9.358e-45.

Denominator: 6.8e-38.

So [H+]^3 = (9.358e-45) / (6.8e-38) = (9.358 /6.8) * 1e-7.

9.358 /6.8 ≈ 1.376.

So [H+]^3 = 1.376e-7.

Taking cube root: [H+] ≈ (1.376e-7)^(1/3) ≈ 5.16e-3.

So [H+] ≈ 0.00516 M.

pH = -log(0.00516) ≈ 2.287.

But the options don't have this value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, let me recompute [H+]^3.

[H+]^3 = (0.009358 * 1e-42) / (6.8e-38) = (9.358e-3 * 1e-42) / (6.8e-38 ) = (9.358e-45) / (6.8e-38) = (9.358 /6.8 ) * 1e-7 = 1.376 *1e-7.

So [H+]^3 = 1.376e-7.

Cube root of 1.376e-7 is (1.376)^(1/3) * (1e-7)^(1/3).

(1e-7)^(1/3) = 1e-2.333... = approx 4.64e-3.

(1.376)^(1/3) ≈ 1.11.

So 1.11 *4.64e-3 ≈ 5.15e-3.

So [H+] is indeed approximately 0.00515 M.

pH = -log(0.00515) ≈ 2.287.

But none of the options match this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption. Maybe after adding the exact stoichiometric amount of H+, all the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, but there's some excess H+ from the acid.

Wait, no, because the amount of H+ added is exactly 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3, so all H+ is consumed.

Wait, but then the solution would have Fe^3+ and water, and the H+ comes only from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So perhaps the pH is around 2.28, but none of the options match that. The options are pH 3.16, 2.69, 2.04, and 4.94.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp value. Let me check the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Upon checking, I think the correct Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is indeed around 6.8e-38.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let me calculate the concentration of H+ using the hydrolysis reaction considering the exact stoichiometry.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M.

The reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Assuming that x is the concentration of Fe^3+ that reacts. So,

[Fe^3+] = 0.009358 - x.

[Fe(OH)3] is a solid, so it's not considered.

[H+] = 3x.

The K expression is:

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = (3x)^3 / (0.009358 - x).

But K for this reaction is 1/Ksp = 1/(6.8e-38) ≈ 1.47e37.

Wait, no, because Ksp is for the reverse reaction (dissolving Fe(OH)3 into Fe^3+ and OH^-).

Wait, perhaps the correct K for the hydrolysis reaction is K = 1/Ksp.

So K = 1/(6.8e-38) = 1.47e37.

Setting up the equation:

(3x)^3 / (0.009358 - x) = 1.47e37.

Assuming x is very small compared to 0.009358, so:

(27x^3) / 0.009358 ≈ 1.47e37.

Solving for x^3:

x^3 ≈ (1.47e37 * 0.009358) / 27.

Compute numerator: 1.47e37 * 0.009358 ≈ 1.47 *9.358e-3 *1e37 = 13.76e34.

So x^3 ≈ (13.76e34) / 27 ≈ 5.096e33.

x ≈ cube root(5.096e33) ≈ 1.719e11 M.

Wait, that can't be possible because the concentration of Fe^3+ is only 0.009358 M, and x can't be larger than that.

This suggests that the assumption that x is small is invalid. So we can't neglect x compared to 0.009358.

So, the previous approach doesn't work. Therefore, perhaps the solution is more complicated and requires solving a cubic equation.

But given the time constraints, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C, with pH around 2.04 and volume around 28 cm³.

Wait, but earlier calculations gave pH around 2.28, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the K expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid after the reaction. Wait, no, because in the stoichiometric case, all H+ is consumed.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the reaction is not 100% complete. Let me think: if I add less than the stoichiometric amount of H+, then some Fe(OH)3 remains, and the solution will have excess Fe(OH)3 and some Fe^3+.

But the question asks for the minimum volume of acid needed to dissolve all Fe(OH)3. So we have to add enough H+ to completely dissolve it.

So the volume is 28.05 cm³, as calculated earlier.

Now, about the pH: if all the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, the solution contains Fe^3+ and any excess H+.

But since the acid added is exactly stoichiometric, there's no excess H+.

So the pH is determined solely by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Let me calculate the concentration of H+ contributed by Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Given that [Fe^3+] = 0.009358 M, and Ksp = 6.8e-38.

The pH is calculated as follows:

At equilibrium,

[Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6.8e-38.

But [OH^-] = (6.8e-38) / [Fe^3+] )^(1/3).

So [OH^-] = (6.8e-38 / 0.009358 )^(1/3).

Calculating inside the cube root:

6.8e-38 / 0.009358 ≈ 7.26e-36.

Cube root of 7.26e-36 is approximately 8.99e-12.

So [OH^-] ≈ 8.99e-12 M.

pOH = -log(8.99e-12) ≈ 11.05.

pH = 14 - 11.05 = 2.95.

Hmm, around 2.95. But none of the options have that. The closest is option A at pH 3.16.

Wait, perhaps a more precise calculation would get closer to 3.16.

Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 6.8e-38 / 0.009358.

6.8e-38 / 9.358e-3 = (6.8 /9.358) )e-35.

6.8 /9.358 ≈ 0.7268.

So 0.7268e-35 = 7.268e-36.

Cube root of 7.268e-36.

Let me compute cube root of 7.268e-36.

The cube root of 7.268 is approximately 1.936.

Cube root of 1e-36 is 1e-12.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.936e-12 M.

pOH = -log(1.936e-12) ≈ 11.715.

pH = 14 - 11.715 ≈ 2.285.

Which again gives pH around 2.28, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is not at 25°C, but the question states it is. So temperature shouldn't be an issue.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value for Ksp.

Wait, perhaps the correct Ksp is 6.8e-38, but let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the cube root more accurately.

7.268e-36 = 7.268 * 1e-36.

Cube root of 7.268 ≈ 1.936.

Cube root of 1e-36 is 1e-12.

So [OH^-] = 1.936e-12.

pOH = log(1/(1.936e-12)).

Wait, no, pOH = -log(1.936e-12) = 11.715.

pH = 14 - 11.715 ≈ 2.285.

Still around 2.28, which doesn't match any options.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the required volume.

Wait, let me double-check the volume calculation.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(16 +1.008) = 55.85 + 3*(17.008) =55.85 +51.024= 106.874 g/mol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.

Moles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.0028074 mol.

Volume of 0.1 M HCl: 0.0028074 / 0.1 = 0.028074 L = 28.074 cm³.

So that's correct, which points to option C.

But the pH I'm getting isn't matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is not 100 cm³. Wait, the problem states that the solution has a total volume of 100 cm³, so the volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³. So when I add V cm³ of acid, the total volume is 100 cm³, not V +100.

Wait, no, wait. If I have 100 cm³ of solution and add V cm³ of acid, the total volume becomes (100 + V) cm³, but the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. That complicates things because the volume after adding acid must be 100 cm³. So the solution is prepared by adding acid to 100 cm³.

Wait, no, the question says: we want to dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume. So the solution must be 100 cm³.

So when adding V cm³ of acid, the total volume is adjusted to 100 cm³. So perhaps the concentration of H+ is calculated based on V cm³ of acid added, but the solution is diluted to 100 cm³.

Wait, that's a different scenario. So the volume of acid is V cm³, and then the total solution is made up to 100 cm³. So the actual concentration of H+ would be (V * 0.1 M ) / 0.1 L = V * 0.1 / 0.1 = V * 1 M?

Wait, no, because if you add V cm³ (V mL) of acid to a solution and make up to 100 cm³, the concentration is (V * 0.1 M) / (0.1 L) = V * 0.1 /0.1 = V M.

Wait, that can't be right because if V is 28 cm³, then [H+] = 28 M, which is impossible.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think.

If I have a solution made by adding V mL of 0.1 M HCl to enough water to make the total volume 100 mL, then the concentration of HCl is (V mL * 0.1 M) / 100 mL = 0.001 V M.

Because moles of HCl = 0.1 M * V * 1e-3 L = 0.00001 V mol.

Concentration in 0.1 L is 0.00001 V / 0.1 = 0.0001 V M = 1e-4 V M.

Wait, but that seems off.

Wait, 0.1 M is 0.1 mol/L. V cm³ is V * 1e-3 L. So moles of HCl = 0.1 * (V * 1e-3) ) = 1e-5 V.

Then, when diluted to 0.1 L (100 cm³), the concentration is (1e-5 V) / 0.1 = 1e-4 V M.

So [H+] = 1e-4 V, because HCl is strong and dissociates completely.

Wait, but earlier I thought the required H+ is 0.0028074 mol. So, [H+] needed is 0.0028074 mol in 0.1 L, which would be 0.028074 M.

So 1e-4 V = 0.028074 → V = 0.028074 / 1e-4 = 280.74 cm³.

But that's way more than the solution volume. That can't be right. So I think I'm making a mistake in considering the dilution.

Wait, I think the correct way is:

The acid is added to the solution, but the total volume must be 100 cm³. So the acid volume plus the solution volume before adding acid equals 100 cm³. But I'm not sure about the initial solution volume.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is prepared by adding the acid to the Fe(OH)3 solid and then making up the total volume to 100 cm³.

In that case, the acid contributes H+ ions in a solution of 100 cm³.

So, the moles of H+ needed are 0.0028074 mol, as calculated before.

The concentration of H+ would be 0.0028074 mol / 0.1 L = 0.028074 M.

But that's only if all the H+ comes from the acid. But when we dissolve Fe(OH)3, some H+ will come from its hydrolysis, but since we're adding enough acid to completely dissolve it, perhaps the H+ from hydrolysis is negligible.

Wait, but in that case, the H+ concentration is 0.028074 M, and the pH would be -log(0.028074) ≈ 1.55.

But that's not matching any options either.

I'm getting stuck here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C: pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm³.

But according to my calculations, the pH is around 2.28, which isn't an option. However, option C is the only one with the correct volume. So perhaps the pH given in option C is correct due to a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ after the reaction. But in the stoichiometric case, there's no excess H+.

Wait, perhaps the solution isn't at 25°C. No, the problem states it is.

At this point, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the volume matching option C and perhaps the pH calculation being slightly off due to approximations.


To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution, we first calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:

- Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3(16.00 + 1.008) = 106.874 g/mol.  
- Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.

The reaction between Fe(OH)₃ and a strong monobasic acid (e.g., HCl) is:  
**Fe(OH)₃ + 3 H⁺ → Fe³⁺ + 3 H₂O.**  

From the stoichiometry, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺. Thus, the moles of H⁺ required are:  
**Moles of H⁺ = 3 × 0.0009358 ≈ 0.0028074 mol.**

The acid is 0.1 M, so the volume of acid required is:  
**Volume of acid = moles of H⁺ / molarity = 0.0028074 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028074 L = 28.074 cm³.**  
This matches closely with the volume given in option C (28.05 cm³).

Next, we calculate the pH of the resulting solution. After dissolving Fe(OH)₃, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions, which hydrolyze in water:  
**Fe³⁺ + 3 H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃ + 3 H⁺.**  
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is related to the solubility product of Fe(OH)₃:  
**K = [H⁺]³ / [Fe³⁺].**

The concentration of Fe³⁺ is:  
**[Fe³⁺] = moles of Fe³⁺ / total volume = 0.0009358 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009358 M.**

The solubility product of Fe(OH)₃ is given as **Ksp = 6.8 × 10⁻³⁸**. Using the relationship:  
**Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 6.8 × 10⁻³⁸.**  
At 25°C, **[H⁺][OH⁻] = 10⁻¹⁴**, so **[OH⁻] = 10⁻¹⁴ / [H⁺].** Substituting into the Ksp expression:  
**[Fe³⁺] × (10⁻¹⁴ / [H⁺])³ = 6.8 × 10⁻³⁸.**

Rearranging for [H⁺]:  
**[H⁺]³ = [Fe³⁺] × (10⁻¹⁴)³ / 6.8 × 10⁻³⁸.**  
**[H⁺]³ = (0.009358) × (10⁻⁴²) / 6.8 × 10⁻³⁸.**  
**[H⁺]³ = (9.358 × 10⁻³ × 10⁻⁴²) / 6.8 × 10⁻³⁸.**  
**[H⁺]³ = (9.358 × 10⁻⁴⁵) / 6.8 × 10⁻³⁸.**  
**[H⁺]³ ≈ 1.376 × 10⁻⁷.**  
Taking the cube root:  
**[H⁺] ≈ (1.376 × 10⁻⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 5.16 × 10⁻³ M.**

Finally, the pH is:  
**pH = -log[H⁺] = -log(5.16 × 10⁻³) ≈ 2.28.**

However, none of the options match this pH exactly. The closest option is **C (pH 2.04, 28.05 cm³)**, which aligns with the calculated volume and is reasonable given potential approximations in the pH calculation.

**Answer: C**
