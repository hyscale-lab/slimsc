Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of elimination reaction, maybe a dehydrohalogenation or something like that. Or wait, red phosphorus is often used in the formation of ylides, which can lead to elimination reactions, like the formation of alkenes from alcohols or halides.

So, first, I need to figure out what Compound X is. Let's look at the IR data. The IR peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, so maybe an -OH stretch or some kind of C-H stretch. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which makes me think of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe an acid. Then 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So perhaps the compound is an aromatic ketone, maybe a benzaldehyde derivative or something else.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows several peaks. Starting with the highest ppm: 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That high chemical shift usually corresponds to an aldehyde proton, but wait, in an aldehyde, the proton is usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton, which is usually around 10-12 ppm. But the singlet suggests no neighboring protons. So if it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit. But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. A carboxylic acid typically has a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm-1, which is in the 3400–2500 range given. So that could fit.

Wait, but another possibility is an aldehyde. Let me consider both options.

The 10.5 ppm peak could be either. Let's check the rest of the NMR. There's a peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. In aromatic regions, this often suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So if it's para-substituted, with two substituents, each having two protons each in adjacent positions. Wait, no, wait.
