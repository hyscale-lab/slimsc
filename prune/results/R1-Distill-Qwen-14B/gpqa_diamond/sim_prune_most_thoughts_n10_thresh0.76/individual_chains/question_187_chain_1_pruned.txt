Okay, I'm trying to figure out how many of these stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph when used with an 8m VLT telescope. I remember that the key here is the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel, and it needs to be at least 10 after a one-hour exposure.

First, I should probably understand what factors determine the S/N. I think the S/N depends on the brightness of the star, which is related to its apparent magnitude. The lower the apparent magnitude, the brighter the star, and the higher the S/N. 

ESPRESSO's performance is probably tied to the telescope's light-gathering power and the instrument's efficiency. Since it's an 8m telescope, the collecting area is important. The bigger the area, the more photons it can gather, leading to a higher S/N.

I recall that the formula for signal-to-noise ratio in astronomy is something like S/N = (flux) * sqrt(exposure time) / noise. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Oh wait, I think the noise is proportional to the square root of the flux too. Hmm, maybe the S/N is related to the square root of the number of photons detected. 

Wait, right, the S/N per pixel can be approximated by S/N ≈ (10^(-0.4 * m) ) * sqrt(t) * A_eff * ε * ... other factors, but perhaps I should look for some rule of thumb or formula specific to ESPRESSO.

Alternatively, I think I remember that for a spectrograph, the S/N depends on the photon flux, which is a function of the star's apparent magnitude. The formula I've come across before is S/N per pixel = ( (10^(-0.4 m)) * (A^2) ) / (t * R * ... ), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to know the typical limiting magnitude for a spectrograph. I think ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, so it's designed for very bright stars but maybe not the faintest. But wait, the question is about specific stars, so I'll have to calculate each one's apparent magnitude.

First, let me calculate the apparent magnitude (m) for each star. The apparent magnitude depends on the star's absolute magnitude (M),
