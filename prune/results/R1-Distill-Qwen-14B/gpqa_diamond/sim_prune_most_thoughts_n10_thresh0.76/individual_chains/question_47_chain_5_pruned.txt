Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The task is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound. I've got IR and 1H NMR data, so I'll need to analyze both.

First, let me write down the data:

IR:
- Medium to strong bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1.
- Strong band at 1720 cm-1.

1H NMR:
- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H)
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, maybe some exchange or coupling?
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) – quartet, probably adjacent to an electronegative atom.
- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) – aromatic protons; each as doublets, suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring.

So, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, X=0. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11)/2 = 9/2=4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2.

Wait, the general formula for a hydrocarbon is CnH2n+2. So each degree of unsaturation is a ring or a double bond, each contributing 1, and each triple bond 2, etc. Also, each N adds a hydrogen, but in the formula, it's part of the structure.

Wait, the formula for degrees of unsaturation is DoU = [2C + 2 - H - X + N]/2.

So for C9H11NO2:

C =9, H=11, N=1, O=2, X=0.

So DoU = (2*9 +2 -11 +1 -0)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = (10)/2=5.

So five degrees of unsaturation. That would be, for example, a benzene ring (which has 3 DoU, since benzene is three double bonds), plus maybe an ester or amide group (which would add another DoU for the carbonyl), and perhaps a double bond or another ring. Hmm, but looking at the options, they all seem to have a benzene ring, so that explains three. Then, the other two would be from the functional group, like an ester (which is a carbonyl plus an ether) or an amide.

Looking at the IR data:

The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). So either an ester, amide, ketone, or aldehyde. But looking at the options, these compounds are esters or amides.

The other IR bands are at 3420 and 3325, which are broad, suggesting N-H or O-H stretches. But those could be from an amide or an alcohol. Wait, but the NMR has a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which might be due to an NH group, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe an O-H exchange, but in the NMR, I don't see any broad peak around 1-5 ppm except the 4.0 and 4.5 peaks.

Wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet (bs) with 2H. Maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, but broad suggests exchange, perhaps an OH or an NH group. But in the IR, there's no strong O-H stretch (like a broad peak around 3200-3600). The IR shows two bands, which might indicate two sets of N-H groups, but in an amide, you usually have two N-H stretches for the NH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol and an amine, but that seems less likely.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at the 3 position. So benzamide has a CONH2 group, which would have N-H stretches. So the IR would show two peaks from the amide NH, which would fit the two strong bands in the IR.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl) formamide. So the structure would be formamide (HCONHR), where R is the 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the N would have two H (from the amide), so IR would show two N-H peaks. But wait, formamide has one NH? Wait, no, formamide is HCONH2, so yes, two NH groups. So IR would have strong peaks around 3400.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So that's a propionyl group (CH2CH2COO-) attached to a benzene ring with an NH2 group at para position. The structure is like CH2CH2COO-NH-(Ph). Wait, no, more accurately, it would be Ph-NH-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, the formula is 4-aminophenyl propionate, which is PhNH2 with a propionate ester, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps it's PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? No, maybe it's the amino group attached to the phenyl, and the propionate as the ester. So the structure would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene ring, and an NH2 group at the para position. Hmm, but the molecular formula would then have the ester group and the amino group.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is the benzoate ester (OEt) attached to a benzene ring with an amino group at the para position. So the structure is OEt-C6H4-NH2. So the benzoate ester has a carbonyl, and the amino group would have N-H.

So looking at the IR data, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl, which is present in all the options. The other IR peaks at 3420 and 3325 are probably N-H stretching, which are present in amides and amines.

Now, looking at the NMR:

The 1.20 ppm triplet (t, 3H) suggests a CH2CH3 group, likely an ethyl group attached to an electronegative atom. So perhaps an ethyl ester (OCH2CH3) or an ethyl amide (NCH2CH3), but more likely an ester.

The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen or nitrogen. If it's part of an ester, like OCH2, but as a quartet (q) elsewhere. Wait, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q, 2H), which would suggest coupling with two neighboring protons. So perhaps it's a methylene (CH2) group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ester's OCH2CH3. Wait, the quartet at 4.5 ppm, with 2H, and the triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) would fit an ethyl group. For example, OCH2CH3 would have the CH3 as triplet, and the OCH2 as quartet.

Wait, let's model an ethyl
