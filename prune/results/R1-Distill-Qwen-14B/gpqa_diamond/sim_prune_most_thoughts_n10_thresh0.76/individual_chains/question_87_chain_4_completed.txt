Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. So, wait, the ring is 6-membered, which is like benzene, right? And it's di-substituted, meaning two substituents are attached to the ring. The total number of carbons is 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 more carbons in total.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-X). So, the substituents on the benzene ring must include a carbonyl group and a halogen. Hmm, wait, but wait, the substituents could also be groups that have these features. For example, a carbonyl could be part of a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc., and the halogen could be directly attached as a substituent like -Cl, -Br, etc.

Wait, but wait, the compound's total carbon count is 8. Benzene (6) plus substituents (2) equals 8. So each substituent must be a single carbon group, or perhaps the substituents together contribute 2 carbons. Let me think. If the substituents are -X (like Cl, which is a halogen and has one carbon? Wait, no, Cl is a substituent but doesn't add a carbon. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait a second, aromatic-halogen bond would mean the substituent is an aryl halide, like -Cl, -Br, etc. So each halogen substituent is just a single atom attached to the ring. But if that's the case, then the substituents would be -X and something else that has a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the substituents are two, each possibly being a halogen and a carbonyl-containing group. Wait, but the carbonyl group is part of the substituent. So let's see: the ring has two substituents — one with a carbonyl and one with a halogen.

Wait, but wait, the substituents could also be a group that itself has both a carbonyl and a halogen. Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is a different group. Let me think: the substituents could be, for example, an aldehyde group (–CHO) and a halogen (–X). But wait, an aldehyde is –CHO, which is a carbonyl. So that's one substituent. The other substituent is –X, say –Cl. So the ring would have –CHO and –Cl as substituents. But wait, wait, each substituent is a single atom? No, substituents can be groups. So for example, the substituents could be –X (like –Cl) and –COR, where R is some group.

Wait, but let's think about the total carbons. The benzene ring is 6 carbons. The substituents add 2 more, so the substituents combined should have 2 carbons. So each substituent could be a methyl group, but that doesn't have a carbonyl or halogen. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but a ketone substituent on benzene would be like a –C(O)– group. Wait, but that would require more carbons. Like, for example, if the substituent is an acetyl group, that's –COCH3. That would be two carbons: the carbonyl and the methyl. But then that's two carbons. So if the substituents are –COCH3 and –X, that's two substituents, adding three carbons (since –COCH3 has two carbons, but wait, wait, benzene has six, substituents add two, so total is eight). Wait, if one substituent is –COCH3 (three carbons in the substituent: the carbonyl and two in the methyl?), no, wait, –COCH3 is a substituent with two carbons attached to the ring: the carbonyl is part of the substituent. So the substituent –COCH3 has two more carbons (the carbonyl is one, and the methyl is another). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, wait, let's think again. The compound is a di-substituted benzene with two substituents, each adding a certain number of carbons. The total number of carbons in the molecule is 8. The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the substituents add 2 carbons in total. So each substituent must add a certain number of carbons. For example, if one substituent is a methyl group (–CH3, which is one carbon), and the other is a carbonyl group, but wait, a carbonyl group is just a functional group. Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like –CO–something) and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but how can a substituent be just a halogen without adding a carbon? Because the halogen is an atom, not a carbon. So, for example, –Cl is a substituent but doesn't add any carbons. So if one substituent is –Cl, that's zero additional carbons. The other substituent would have to add two carbons. So, perhaps the substituent is –COCH3 (acetyl group). So the substituents would be –Cl and –COCH3. Let's check the carbons: 6 (benzene) + 0 (Cl) + 2 (COCH3 has two carbons: the C in CO is one, and the CH3 is another) → total 6 + 0 + 2 = 8. That works.

So the structure would be 1-chloro-3-acetylbenzene or something like that. Wait, but wait, wait. Let me check: the substituents are on the benzene ring, so the positions would depend on where they are attached. But the question is about the NMR, so perhaps the positions don't matter as much as the expected signals.

Alternatively, another possibility is that one substituent is an aldehyde group, –CHO, which is a carbonyl but that's just one carbon. Then the other substituent must add one carbon. But the other substituent is a halogen, which adds zero. So total would be 6 + 1 (CHO) + 0 (X) = 7, which is less than 8. So that doesn't add up. So that can't be.

Hmm, so the other substituent must have more than one carbon. Like, perhaps the substituent is a ketone, but that would be –CO– something. Let's think: the substituent could be –CO–R, where R is a methyl group. So –COCH3 is substituent. That's two carbons added: the CO and the CH3. So the substituents are –Cl and –COCH3, totaling two carbons, making the molecule have 8 carbons in total.

Now, looking at the NMR options, which one matches this structure?

Let me think about the expected NMR signals.

First, the aromatic protons: In a di-substituted benzene, depending on the substituents, the protons can be in different environments. If the substituents are in the para positions, then the aromatic protons would be as a pair of doublets, perhaps. Wait, but if the substituents are in adjacent positions (ortho) or across (para), the splitting would vary. Alternatively, if the substituents are meta, but that's less likely because ortho and para are more common due to stability.

Wait, but if the substituents are –Cl and –COCH3, their positions on the ring would influence the NMR signals. Let's assume they are para to each other for maximum symmetry, which would lead to two sets of equivalent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the ortho positions, leading to different splitting.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the substituents: the –COCH3 group would have a CH3 group attached to the carbonyl, which would be a singlet in the NMR because the three protons are equivalent and not split by neighboring protons (since the carbonyl is attached to the ring, the CH3 is probably not adjacent to any other protons). But wait, in the NMR, the CH3 would appear around δ 2.3-2.6 ppm as a singlet. Looking at the options, option C has a singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H), which would fit a CH3 group attached to a carbonyl.

Then, the aromatic protons: depending on the substituents, the ring protons would show up as a certain pattern. If the substituents are in the para position, the ring would have protons in two sets: two sets of doublets. For example, in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, leading to two equivalent protons on one side and another two equivalent on the other. So in the NMR, you might see two doublets: one integrating for 2H and another for 2H. So looking at the options, let's check each one.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s) → maybe an aldehyde proton. But wait, in this case, we don't have an aldehyde substituent. Because we have a carbonyl in the substituent, but not as an aldehyde (which would be an –CHO group). So option A has a singlet at 9.9, which is typical for an aldehyde proton. But in our case, the substituent is –COCH3, so the aldehyde isn't present, so option A is probably not correct.

Option B: 4.8 and 4.6 ppm doublets, integrating for 2H each. These are probably protons next to an oxygen, like in an ether or something. Also, 1.3 ppm singlet for 3H. Not sure if this fits. But our compound doesn't have substituents like that. So option B might not be correct.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). The aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating for 2H. This suggests that the ring has two sets of equivalent protons, which would happen if the substituents are para. The 2.3 ppm singlet is a CH3 group, which fits the –COCH3 substituent. So this looks promising.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The singlet at 6.9 could be an aromatic proton, but the presence of two doublets at 4.8 and 4.6 suggests maybe a group like –OCH2CH2O– or something, but that doesn't fit our substituents. So probably not option D.

So option C seems to match. The aromatic protons are in two doublets, which would be expected for a para-substituted di-substituted benzene (like para-substituted with –Cl and –COCH3). The CH3 group from the acetyl would show up as a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

Wait, but wait: in the substituent –COCH3, the CH3 is adjacent to the carbonyl, so deshielded, so it would appear around δ 2.3. That fits option C's 2.3 ppm (3H, s).

So putting it all together, the correct NMR spectrum would be option C, which shows the aromatic protons as two doublets (each 2H), and a singlet at 2.3 ppm for the methyl group of the acetyl.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons, so the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X). Based on this, the substituents are likely a halogen (e.g., –Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group, such as an acetyl group (–COCH3). 

The acetyl group contributes two carbons (one from the carbonyl and one from the methyl group), and the halogen contributes no additional carbons. This satisfies the total carbon count of 8. The structure is therefore a para-substituted benzene with –Cl and –COCH3 as substituents, given the symmetry and stability of this arrangement.

In the 1H NMR spectrum:
- The aromatic protons will appear as two doublets (each integrating for 2H) due to the para substitution pattern.
- The methyl group (CH3) of the acetyl group will appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Contains a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton. Since the compound does not have an aldehyde group, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Shows signals at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm, which are typical for protons near an oxygen atom (e.g., in an ether). These signals do not match the expected substituents, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Shows two doublets for aromatic protons (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating for 2H) and a singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H), consistent with the methyl group of the acetyl substituent. This matches the expected NMR spectrum.
- **Option D**: Contains signals at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm, which again suggest protons near an oxygen atom, and a singlet at 1.3 ppm. These signals do not align with the expected substituents, so this option is incorrect.

The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, as it matches the expected signals for a para-substituted benzene with –Cl and –COCH3 substituents.

Answer: C
