Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many 13C-NMR signals compound E has. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The problem gives a series of reactions starting with propionaldehyde. Let me write down each step to visualize what's happening.

First reaction: Propionaldehyde reacts with EDT and BF3 to form A. Hmm, EDT is probably ethyl diethyl tin, which I think is used in the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction. That reaction typically forms alkenes from aldehydes and other carbonyl compounds. Wait, propionaldehyde is an aldehyde, so when it reacts with a Wittig reagent, it should form an alkene. So A must be an alkene. Propionaldehyde has the structure CH2CH2CHO. The Wittig reaction would replace the aldehyde group (CHO) with CH2CH2CH2? Wait, no, wait. Propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. So when the Wittig reagent (EDT, which I think is a ylide) reacts, it would form a new double bond. So the product would be CH2=CHCH2CH3. Wait no, wait, propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. The Wittig would form CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me think: the aldehyde is RCHO, so the Wittig would form RCH2CH2... Wait, no, the Wittig reagent, like ethylidene (from diethyltin and an alkyne?), but propionaldehyde would react to form CH2=CHCH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. The Wittig would replace the OCHO with CH2CH2, but wait, no, the Wittig forms an alkene. So propionaldehyde (RCHO) reacts to form RCH2CH2... Wait, no. The general reaction is RCHO + Wittig â†’ RCH=CH2. Oh wait, no. Wait, the Wittig reaction between an aldehyde and a ylide (like from diethyltin and an alkene) would form an alkene. So for propionaldehyde, which is CH3CH2CHO, the aldehyde (CHO) is at the end. So the Wittig would form CH2=CHCH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the aldehyde
