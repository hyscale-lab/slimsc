Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says that observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical range. At wavelengths shorter than that, the flux drops a lot. Oh wait, I remember that when we observe objects at high redshifts, their emitted light gets shifted to longer wavelengths due to the expansion of the universe. So if the peak is in the near infrared, that might indicate that the quasar is emitting in the optical or UV range but we're seeing it redshifted.

Wait, what's the typical emission peak for quasars? I think quasars often emit strongly in the optical, like around 500 nm (green light). If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that suggests a redshift. Let's calculate the redshift. Redshift z is given by (observed wavelength / emitted wavelength) - 1. So if the emitted peak was at, say, around 500 nm, then 790 / 500 is 1.58. Subtract 1 to get z ≈ 0.58. But wait, I'm not sure if the quasar's peak is necessarily in the optical. Some might emit in UV, but assuming it's around 400 nm, then 790/400 is 1.975, so z ≈ 0.975. Hmm, perhaps I need to think about the Lyman-alpha forest or other features, but maybe I'm complicating it.

The question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance D_C is what we use to calculate distances in an expanding universe. The formula depends on the cosmological parameters given: Hubble constant H0, matter density Ω_m, dark energy Ω_Λ, and the flatness (which implies Ω_m + Ω_Λ =1 here). 

Wait, the question gives H0 as 70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m =0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, and a flat universe. So we're in a standard Lambda-CDM model.

The comoving distance for a given redshift z is calculated using an integral involving the expansion history of the universe. The formula is D_C = (c/H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ). 

But wait, I'm trying to find the comoving distance for a quasar at a certain redshift. But the question doesn't directly give the redshift, so I need to find it based on the observed data.

Wait, the peak in the spectrum—could that be due to the Lyman-alpha emission line? The Lyman-alpha line is a prominent emission line in quasars, with a rest wavelength of about 121 nm (far UV). If this line is observed at 790 nm, then the redshift z would be (790 / 121) - 1 ≈ 6.52. Oh, that's a high redshift! But wait, quasars at such high redshifts are extremely far away. But wait, the options are around 6-9 Gpc. Let me think: the comoving distance for z=6 is about 15 Gpc, but maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Wait, I think I need to recall some approximate formula or calculator for comoving distance.

Alternatively, maybe the peak isn't from Lyman-alpha. Another possibility is the Balmer break, which is the break in the spectrum from hydrogen's Balmer series. The Balmer break occurs at about 400 nm in the rest frame. If that is observed at 790 nm, then z = (790 / 400) - 1 = 0.975. So z ≈ 0.98.

Wait, but how do I get
