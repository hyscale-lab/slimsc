Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a reaction involving a specific compound and hydrogen bromide. Hmm.

The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw its structure in my mind. So, benzene ring with an ether group attached. The ether is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl group is probably at position 3, since it's but-3-en-1-yl. Wait, butenyl has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Or is it between 2 and 3? Wait, but the formula is but-3-en-1-yl. Oh right, butenyl groups are numbered such that the double bond starts at the lowest possible number. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but wait, no, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-? No, wait. Let me think again. The structure is (but-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the butenyl group is attached to the oxygen. The butenyl is CH2CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond starting at position 3. Wait, but butenyl has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons
