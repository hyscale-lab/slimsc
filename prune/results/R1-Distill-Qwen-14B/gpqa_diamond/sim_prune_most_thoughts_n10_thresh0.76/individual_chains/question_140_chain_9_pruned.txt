Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So the problem is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and another substance B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when X reacts with a certain keto acid, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog.

Hmm. Let me break it down. I'll try to identify each component based on the given clues.

First, the reaction between X and Y. It's violent, which suggests maybe a strong acid and a metal? Or perhaps something like a halogen and a hydrocarbon? Wait, but the product W is a gas whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So W is a molecule where protons equal neutrons.

Wait, if W is a molecule, let's think about common gases. Could it be H2O? No, because H is 1, O is 8. Neutrons in H are 0, O has 8. So H2O has (1+0)*2 + (8+8) = 18? Not sure. Wait, the molecule has same protons and neutrons. So for each atom in the molecule, protons equal neutrons.

Wait, the molecule as a whole has same number of protons and neutrons? Or each atom in the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, the question says, "gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." Oh, so the molecule as a whole has equal number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, for a molecule, the total protons would be the sum of protons in each atom, same for neutrons.

So for example, if W is H2O, total protons are 2 (from H2) + 8 (O) = 10. Neutrons: each H has 0, O has 8. Total neutrons would be 0 +8=8. Not equal.

Another possibility: CO2. Protons:12 (C) + 16*2 (O2) = 12 +32=44. Neutrons: C has 6 (since C is usually 12, so 6 neutrons
