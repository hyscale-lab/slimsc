Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: Consider the annihilation process p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass energy of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Hmm, okay. So, let's break this down. First, I remember that annihilation processes usually involve particles and their antiparticles colliding and producing other particles. In this case, a proton and an antiproton are annihilating into four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. 

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Wait, does that mean it's non-relativistic, or maybe we can make some approximations? If it's moving slowly, its kinetic energy might be much less than its rest mass energy. But I'm not sure yet; I'll have to think about that more.

The mass energy of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. So each A particle has a rest mass energy of 300 MeV. But what about the proton and antiproton? Their rest mass energy is about 938 MeV each, right? Because the proton mass is roughly 938 MeV/c².

So the initial state is a proton and an antiproton. Let me think about the conservation laws here. Since it's an annihilation, energy and momentum must be conserved. Also, charge must be conserved. The proton has charge +e, the antiproton -e, so the total charge is zero. On the right side, we have two A⁺ and two A⁻. So each A⁺ is +e/2 and each A⁻ is -e/2. Wait, no, because 2*(+e/2) + 2*(-e/2) would be zero. Oh, wait, no, 2*(+e) + 2*(-e) would be zero as well. Wait, maybe each A⁺ has charge +e, and each A⁻ charge -e. So two of each would give a total charge of zero, matching the initial. So that works.

Now, the initial momentum: since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the proton is at rest? Or perhaps the system is such that the total initial momentum is just that of the antiproton. Wait, in the problem statement, it says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity. So the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton.

Wait, but wait. If both the proton and antiproton are involved in the collision, their momenta would add. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some velocity much less than c. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the entire system's initial momentum is zero? No, because the antiproton is moving, so the proton must be moving oppositely. But the problem says the antiproton is moving, so perhaps the proton is at rest. Hmm, the wording says the antiproton is "slowly" moving. I'm not entirely sure, but I'll proceed under the assumption that the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton, since the proton is at rest.

So, let's model the initial momentum. Let me denote m_p as the mass of the proton (and antiproton, since they're the same). So m_p c² is about 938 MeV, as I thought earlier. If the proton is at rest, its momentum is zero. The antiproton has some velocity v, so its momentum is gamma * m_p * v in the opposite direction? Wait, no, the momentum p would be gamma m_p v, where v is the velocity of the antiproton. Since the antiproton is moving towards the proton, let's say the direction is positive.

Wait, but in any case, the initial total
