Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and I think the key is to identify the compounds involved based on the clues. Once I know what E is, I can figure out its molecular symmetry group.

Let's start with the first reaction: solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, bright red makes me think of something like copper(II) sulfate, but wait, maybe it's another compound. Oh wait! I remember that when metals react with certain gases, they form compounds. For instance, copper can react with sulfur vapor to form CuS, but that's more black. Another thought: maybe it's a reaction involving sulfur and something else. Alternatively, could it be the formation of a sulfide? No, because the product is bright red.

Wait, maybe A is copper metal. Let me think: copper metal reacting with sulfur (gas B?) in a heated condition forms copper(I) sulfide, which is usually red. Oh right, when copper is heated with sulfur, it forms Cu2S, which is bright red. So, if A is Cu, B is S (sulfur vapor?), then C is Cu2S.

But wait, the reaction uses 8 equivalents of B. Let me think about stoichiometry. If Cu reacts with S, the reaction is 2 Cu + S → Cu2S. So for 2 moles of Cu, 1 mole of S is used. So if 8 equivalents of B are used, perhaps that's 4 moles of Cu reacting with 8 moles of S? Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Let me do the math. Suppose the reaction is 8 Cu + S → ... No, wait, maybe each mole of S reacts with 2 moles of Cu. So for each mole of S, two moles of Cu are consumed. If there are 8 equivalents of S, that would mean 8 moles of S reacting with 16 moles of Cu (because 8 × 2 = 16). Then the product would be 8 moles of Cu2S. That seems a bit off, but maybe the number of equivalents is 8 for the gas, so perhaps the stoichiometry is different.

Wait, maybe 8 equivalents of B is 8 moles. So the reaction is 2 Cu(s) + S(g) → Cu2S(s). So for each mole of S, 2 moles of Cu are needed. So 8 moles of S would require 16 moles of Cu. So the product would be 8 moles of Cu2S. That seems plausible. So A is Cu, B is S, and C is Cu2S.

Moving on, the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So C is Cu2S. What could D be? Gas D reacts with Cu2S to form E. Maybe D is Cl2? Because Cu2S reacting with Cl2 under certain conditions can form CuCl and S, but I don't know if that's extremely hazardous. Alternatively, maybe D is O2? If D is O2, then Cu2S could react to form CuO and SO2 or something else. SO2 is a gas, but I'm not sure if that's extremely hazardous. Alternatively, if D is a halogen, like Cl2, then perhaps the reaction forms HCl and some copper chloride.

Wait, another approach. The product E is extremely hazardous. That makes me think of something like H2O, but that's not right. Wait, maybe E is something like SO3? Or perhaps it's something like phosgene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN? No, that doesn't fit here. Let me think about the reaction between Cu2S and another gas.

Another possibility: If D is Cl2, then when Cu2S reacts with Cl2, it can form CuCl and S. But I'm not sure about the products. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with concentrated HCl, but D is a gas, so it's probably Cl2.

Wait, what's the reaction between Cu2S and Cl2? I think it forms CuCl and
