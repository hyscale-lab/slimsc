Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answers. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves two separate reactions, both leading to products A and B. I need to choose the correct options from A to D.

First part: The reaction is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene treated with BuLi followed by H+. The second part is a more complex molecule undergoing a Cope rearrangement when heated, resulting in product B.

I'll tackle each part one by one.

Starting with product A:

The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw this structure to visualize it better. The benzene ring has a substituent which is an OCH2 group connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group.

Breaking it down, the substituent is OCH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2. Wait, no. Let me get that right. The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond at position 2. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl). So that's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Let me think. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but the substituent is at position 3, so the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-... Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So correct structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-. But since it's 3-methyl, the substituent is a methyl group on C3. So, it's CH2-CH2-C(CH3)-H2? Wait, maybe the structure is (CH2)2C(CH3)=CH2? Or is it CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, I think I should write it more correctly.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is: the substituent is on carbon 1, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, 1-yl means the substituent is attached at the first carbon. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2- as the substituent. So, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond between 2 and 3. Wait, but 3-methyl would mean a methyl group on carbon 3. So, the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)-H2? No, perhaps it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, that can't be. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, and 3-methyl would add a methyl group on the third carbon. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-H2. So, the substituent is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2-?

Wait, maybe I should write the substituent as (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl). So, the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH3)-CH2-OCH2-C6H5? No, wait. Let me number the but-2-en-1-yl group. Carbon 1 is the
