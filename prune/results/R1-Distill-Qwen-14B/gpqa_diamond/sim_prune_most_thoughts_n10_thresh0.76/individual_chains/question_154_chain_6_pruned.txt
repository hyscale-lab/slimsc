Okay, so I'm trying to help figure out this chemistry problem. Let me go through the information step by step. 

The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are four different compounds, so I need to analyze each clue to see which one fits.

First, looking at the mass spectrometry data: the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%). There's also a peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, molecular ions usually correspond to the molecular weight. So the molecular weight is around 156. But wait, the second peak is 158, which is two units higher. That might suggest some kind of isotope or maybe an adduct. Alternatively, it could be a fragment with something else. I'm not too sure about that yet. Let's hold onto that thought.

Next, the IR spectrum shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. O-H can be from alcohols, phenols, or maybe carboxylic acids. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak. 1720 is a bit lower than a ketone, which is around 1700-1750. Wait, maybe that's a carboxylic acid? No, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches too, which would be broad and maybe in the same region as the broad peak. Alternatively, an ester or maybe an aldehyde? Wait, aldehydes have a strong peak around 2800-2720, which is a bit lower than 1720. Wait, no, the carbonyl for aldehydes is around 1720 as well. Hmm.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there's a peak at 11.0 ppm, a singlet integrating for 1H. That's a very high chemical shift. I remember that aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm, but this is 11, which is even higher. Alternatively, a phenolic O-H would be broad and maybe around 5-10 ppm, but sometimes they can be higher. Wait, no, phenolic O-H is usually a broad peak, but in D2O exchange it disappears. Wait, but in the NMR, the peak at 11 is a singlet. That's more like a carboxylic acid O-H, because aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 and a singlet. Or maybe a phenolic OH, but in that case, I'd expect a broad peak, but the description says it's 's', so maybe it's an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait. Carboxylic acids have O-H protons, but they are usually broad, but in the NMR, this is a singlet. So maybe it's not a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but looking at the options: option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzal
