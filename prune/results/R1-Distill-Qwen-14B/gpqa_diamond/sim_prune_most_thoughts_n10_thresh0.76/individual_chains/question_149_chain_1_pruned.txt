Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me read it carefully and think through each part. 

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly correct except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is what's expected. So, the integral isn't the issue here. They ruled out spin-spin coupling because the coupling pattern doesn't fit. So it's not like one proton is splitting another into two.

Then the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum matching the expected molecule. Hmm, so same mass but different something else. 

So, what could cause the same mass but two different peaks in LC-MS? Maybe isomerism. Because if it's the same mass, it's the same molecular formula, so likely constitutional isomers or stereoisomers. But wait, the NMR shows two alpha-proton peaks. Let me think about possible isomers.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it was a precursor, the mass would be different because it's a different molecule. So the mass spectrum wouldn't match. So A is probably not correct.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same mass, and same NMR chemical shifts because they're mirror images. But in an achiral environment, they might not show different peaks. Wait, if the compound is a pair of enantiomers, would the LC-MS show two peaks? LC columns can sometimes separate enantiomers if they are chiral, but if the column is achiral, they might not. But in this case, the LC-MS shows two peaks. So maybe the column is chiral, leading to separation. But in the NMR, if they were enantiomers, the alpha protons would be in the same environment, so why are there two peaks? Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. Enantiomers would have identical NMR shifts, so their signals should overlap. So why two peaks? So maybe B isn't the right answer. Unless the NMR is a mixture of diastereomers or something else.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, double coupling sounds like maybe there's
