Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the final product is after Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let's start by looking at the given data and think through the problem.

First, the IR spectrum of Compound X. I remember that IR can tell us about functional groups. The peaks given are between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which is a broad region for O-H or N-H stretches. But the major peaks are at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm⁻¹. The 1720 peak is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester or something like that. The 1610 and 1450 might be aromatic C=C stretching. Hmm.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an -OH proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Or maybe an aldehyde, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm and might split differently. Alternatively, an acidic proton like in phenol, but phenol protons are usually around 5-7 ppm. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, that would explain the broad peak. The broadness suggests hydrogen bonding, which fits with a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest two sets of equivalent protons, which would be the case in a para-substituted benzene. So maybe para-substituted with something.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, probably a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe a CH2CH3 group or some branching nearby.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps CH2 groups.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, likely a methyl group attached to something that causes splitting, like a CH2 group next to it. Maybe a CH(CH3) group.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, which suggests a terminal methyl group, like at the end of an ethyl chain (CH2CH3).

Putting the NMR pieces together. The aromatic protons being para-substituted suggests a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. The 10.5 ppm peak is a strong clue for a carboxylic acid group. So the substituents on the benzene are a -COOH group and something else. Wait, but in the IR there's a 1720 cm⁻¹ peak, which would support a carbonyl, like a ketone, but if the compound has a carboxylic acid, that would have a carbonyl as well. Wait, but carboxylic acids have their carbonyl around 1700 cm⁻¹, which fits with 1720. However, their O-H stretches are usually broader and might appear in the IR around 2500-3300 as a very broad peak. But the IR given has a region from 3400–2500, which is a broad peak covering that area. So that might be the
