Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me think. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli matrices, n is a unit vector, and ε has the dimension of energy. 

Wait, Pauli matrices. Right, the Pauli spin matrices are σx, σy, σz. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. And when you take the dot product with a unit vector, it's a linear combination of these matrices. So σ · n would be n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. 

I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are ±1. But wait, in this case, the Hamiltonian is a scaled version of the Pauli vector. So each component is multiplied by ε and the unit vector components. But since n is a unit vector, the sum of the squares of its components is 1. So when we compute the square of H, it might help in finding the eigenvalues.

Let me think about the properties of the Pauli matrices. Each Pauli matrix squares to the identity matrix. So σx² = σy² = σz² = I. So, when we compute H² = (ε σ · n)^2, that should be ε² (σ · n)^2. 

Expanding that, (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz)^2. The cross terms would involve σi σj where i≠j. But I recall that σi σj = i ε_{ijk} σk when i≠j. However, when we square the sum, cross terms come in pairs. So (σ · n)^2 = (n_x^2 σx² + n_y^2 σy² + n_z^2 σz²) + sum over i≠j (n_i n_j σi σj). 

Each σi squared is I, so the first part is (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I. But since n is a unit vector, that sum is 1. So that part is just I. 

The cross terms would be n_i n_j (σi σj) for i≠j. Wait, but σi σj + σj σi = 2 δ_{ij} I. Because when i≠j, σi σj + σj σi = 0. Wait, no. Let me think again. The anticommutator {σi, σj} = 2 δ_{ij} I. So σi σj + σj σi = 2 δ_{ij} I. 

So for i≠j, σi σj = i ε_{ijk} σk, but when you have σi σj + σj σi, it equals zero for i≠j. So each cross term n_i n_j (σi σj) + n_j n_i (σj σi) ) = 2 n_i n_j (σi σj) ? No, wait, I'm getting confused. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that (σ · n)^2 = I, because (σ · n) is a vector operator, and any such dot product squared gives the identity. So (σ · n)^2 = I. Because σ · n is a traceless matrix with trace zero, so its square would be I. Wait, actually, let me compute it for a specific case. Suppose n is along z, so n=(0,0,1). Then σ · n = σz, and σz² is I. So yes, in that case, (σ · n)^2 is I. So in general, (σ · n)^2 = I because n is a unit vector.

So then, H squared is (ε)^2 (σ · n)^2 = ε^2 I. Therefore, H² = ε² I. 

So the eigenvalues of H squared must be ε². Since H is a 2x2 matrix (Pauli matrices are 2x2), its eigenvalues can be found by taking square roots of H²'s eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues of H are ± ε. Because if H² is ε² I, then H's eigenvalues are sqrt(ε²) and -sqrt(ε²), which are ±ε. 

Wait, but wait a second. Are the eigenvalues of H directly ±ε? Because H is ε times (σ · n), which is a traceless matrix. The trace of H should be zero because σ · n has trace zero (each Pauli matrix has trace zero, so the sum does too). So the eigenvalues must be symmetric around zero. So they're λ and -λ. 

So the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε. So looking at the options:

Option B says +ε and -ε. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought sometimes the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, and when multiplied by a factor, say a, the eigenvalues would be ±a. So in this case, since H is ε times (σ · n), the eigenvalues of H would be ± ε. So that's option B.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with the dimension of energy. To determine the eigenvalues of \( H \), we analyze its properties.

The Pauli matrices (\( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \)) are 2x2 traceless matrices with eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). The dot product \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) represents a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of the unit vector \( \vec{n} \). Since \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, the square of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is the identity matrix, i.e., \( (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I \).

Thus, \( H^2 = (\varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = \varepsilon^2 I \). The eigenvalues of \( H^2 \) are therefore \( \varepsilon^2 \). Taking the square root, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \). Additionally, since \( H \) is traceless (as \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is traceless), its eigenvalues must be symmetric around zero, confirming that the eigenvalues are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A)** \( +1, -1 \): Incorrect, as the eigenvalues depend on \( \varepsilon \), not just \( \pm 1 \).  
**B)** \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \): Correct, as derived above.  
**C)** \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \): Incorrect, as \( \hbar \) is not present in the Hamiltonian.  
**D)** \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \): Incorrect, as \( \hbar \) is not relevant here.

Answer: B
