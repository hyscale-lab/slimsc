Okay, so I have this NMR problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which two compounds are in the mixture based on the given spectral data. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

The molecular formula of each compound is C10H14, so each is a tetramethylbenzene derivative. Wait, wait. Let me clarify. Benzene has six carbons, so four methyl groups would make it C10H14? Because each methyl is CH3, so four would be 4*3 =12 H, but benzene is C6H6. Wait, 6 + 4*1 (for the benzene rings) plus 4*3=12. So 6 carbons for benzene, 4 methyl groups (C4H12), so total is C10H14. Yes, that makes sense.

The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm at a 1:1 ratio. So, the aromatic protons. Since they're both singlets, that suggests that the aromatic protons are equivalent in each compound. Wait, but each compound is a different tetramethylbenzene, so their aromatic protons might have different environments. Hmm.

Wait, but in the mixture, each compound contributes their own signals. So if each compound's aromatic region is a singlet, then each would give a singlet in the NMR. But the problem says two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio. Oh, I see. So each of the two compounds has a singlet in the aromatic region, and their signals are integrated as 1:1 because they're mixed 1:1. So each compound's aromatic protons are equivalent, leading to a singlet. 

Wait, but wait, for a benzene ring with substituents, when do the aromatic protons become equivalent? Maybe when all the protons are equivalent, like in a fully symmetric structure. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the ring's protons are all equivalent, such as in a para-substituted scenario or perhaps a more symmetric structure.

But wait, the molecular formula is C10H14, which as I thought earlier, is a benzene ring with four methyl groups. Because 6 carbons from benzene, 4*(CH3)
