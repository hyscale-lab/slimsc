Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember rhombohedral structures have all sides equal but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Interesting.

The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think interplanar distance refers to the spacing between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. Oh right, it's like the distance between two planes in a crystal, which is important for things like X-ray diffraction.

I remember there's a formula for interplanar distance in crystals, something like d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² + ... ), but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, maybe it's more precise. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + (2 h k u + 2 h l v + 2 k l w) ) ), but wait, no, that might be for a more general case. Wait, no, that sounds complicated. Maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, for a cubic system, the interplanar distance is simply a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²) because the angles are all 90 degrees. But this is a rhombohedral structure, so the angles are different. So the formula should account for the angles between the lattice vectors.

I think the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( [h² + k² + l²] - 2(hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ) ) ), but wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Or perhaps it's d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos γ + hk cos ... wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach. The interplanar distance formula can be derived using the structure factor or from the metric tensor. Oh right, the metric tensor is used to calculate the lattice parameters. The metric tensor for a rhombohedral crystal has components:

a^2  a² cos γ   a² cos β
a² cos γ   a²      a² cos α
a² cos β   a² cos α   a²
