Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its area. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When only one hemisphere is spotted, photometric observations show brightness variations as the star rotates. The problem states that this situation can look like an exoplanet in terms of the light curve. Now, they're asking, if the star wasn't spotted, what would be the radius of a planet that would cause the same brightness variation as the spots do.

Hmm. So, the idea is that both the spots and the planet would cause dips in brightness when they pass in front of the star. But wait, the planet would cause a transit, which is a dip when it passes in front, while the spots would modulate the brightness as they rotate into and out of view.

But the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variations. So, when the star has spots, the brightness change is because when the spots are facing us, they contribute less light, causing the overall brightness to dip a bit. The planet, on the other hand, would block some of the star's light when it transits, causing a dip. The question is, what planet size would cause the same dip amplitude as the spots do.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. But wait, the star's surface area is a sphere, so each hemisphere is half the star's surface. So, the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π R²), but wait, only one hemisphere is affected. Or wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%—so that would be 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area would be 0.2 * (π R² / 2), since each hemisphere is half of the sphere.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So, the area of the hemisphere is (4π R²)/2 = 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But the star's total surface area is 4π R². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.4 /4 = 0.1, so 10% of the entire star's surface is covered by spots.

Wait, no, the problem says that one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%—so that's 20% of that hemisphere's area. So the area covered is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R². The total area of the star is 4π R². So 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots. So the spots take up 10% of the star's total surface area.

Each spot is cooler: 6000K star, spots are 5000K (since the temperature difference is 1000K). Hmm, wait, the temperature difference is 1000K, so if the star is 6000K, the spots are 5000K. So the flux from a spot is less.

But wait, the total flux from the star would change as the spotted hemisphere comes into view. When the star is viewed from Earth, when the spotted side is towards us, the brightness would dip because those spots are emitting less flux. The change in brightness (ΔF) would depend on the area of the spots and the temperature difference.

But in the problem, the situation can resemble an exoplanet.
