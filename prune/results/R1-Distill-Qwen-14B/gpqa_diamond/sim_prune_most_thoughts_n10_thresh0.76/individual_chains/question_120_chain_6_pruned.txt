Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and I'm supposed to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of parallax, so distance d = 1/plx. So when plx is small, the star is far away, and when plx is large, the star is nearby.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So, the number of stars in a certain range of parallax. Let's say we have a range from plx to plx + dplx, and we want the number in that range.

I think the key here is how the volume of space changes with distance. Because stars are spread out, the number we see depends on how much volume we're looking at. Volume increases with the cube of the distance, right? So if you go twice as far, the volume is eight times bigger.

But wait, how does this translate to parallax? Since distance is 1/plx, higher plx means closer distance. So as plx increases, the distance decreases. Because plx is inversely proportional to distance. So when plx doubles, the distance halves.

Let me model this. The number density of stars in space is probably uniform if they're uniformly distributed. So, the number of stars in a volume element would be proportional to that volume.

So, the volume between distance d and d + dd would be the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd. The formula for the volume of a spherical shell is 4π d² dd. Since d is 1/plx, let me substitute that in.

So, d = 1/plx, so dd is the change in distance. Let me find dd in terms of plx. Since d =1/plx, dd = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx. Wait, because plx increases as d decreases. So when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by (dplx/(plx^2)). Hmm, but I'm not sure about the sign. Maybe I can ignore the sign for now and focus on the magnitude.

So the volume element dV is 4π (d)^2 dd. Substituting d=1/plx and dd = -(1/plx^2) dplx.

Wait, let's not get into negative signs because we're dealing with magnitudes. So, dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx. Wait, that would be (1/plx^2) from d squared, and (1/plx^2) from dd, so multiplied together that's 1/plx^4. But then we have a dV proportional to (dplx) / plx^4.

So the number of stars in that volume depends on dV. Since the number density (n) is uniform, the number N is n * dV. So N is proportional to dV, which is proportional to 1/plx^4 * dplx.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx, which is like the number per unit of dplx. So the number in a small range dplx would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the options are about how the number changes with plx. So the number density per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should express the number of stars in terms of parallax. So the number of stars in a small range of parallax around plx would be proportional to the area (since in a shell) times the thickness, but perhaps I'm mixing up something.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars in a given parallax interval [plx, plx + dplx] is the number of stars in the shell between distance d=1/plx and
