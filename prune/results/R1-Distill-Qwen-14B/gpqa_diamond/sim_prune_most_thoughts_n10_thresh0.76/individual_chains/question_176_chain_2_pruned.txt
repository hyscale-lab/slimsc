Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that can't be right because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized. The sum of the squares of the magnitudes should be 1. Let's check: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Sum is 1+4+1=6. Oh, so the state isn't normalized. That's important because the probabilities depend on the state being normalized. So maybe the actual state is this vector divided by the square root of 6? Or perhaps I should consider that the given vector is already normalized, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Hmm, well, the problem statement might have given it that way, but I think in real quantum mechanics, states need to be normalized. So I'll proceed by normalizing the state vector.

Wait, but maybe I should proceed as the question says. Let me read again. The state is (-1, 2, 1). So the vector is |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Wait, but the vector's norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1) = sqrt(6). So the actual state might be |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1; 2; 1 ]. Because in quantum mechanics, the state must have a norm of 1. So I'll proceed by assuming that the state is (1/sqrt(6)) multiplied by that vector. Because otherwise the probabilities would be off.

Next, the problem is about measuring observables P and Q. The question is, when you measure Q after P, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no. The question says, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements. So first, measure P, then Q, and find the probability that P is 0 and Q is -1.

So I need to compute the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, then given that, the probability of getting -1 when measuring Q.

Wait, but when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So the order matters. First, measure P, which will collapse the state into an eigenstate of P. Then, measure Q on that new state.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the probabilities step by step. Let me think.

So first, we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q.

Let me look at the matrices for P and Q.

Operator P's matrix is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, that's a 3x3 matrix. And operator Q's matrix is diagonal:

Row 1:
