Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. The particle is in a specific superposition state, and I need to calculate the expectation value of 10σz + 5σx. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve taking the conjugate transpose of the state, multiplying by the operator, and then the state again. But wait, maybe I should break it down into parts because the operator is a sum of two terms. Oh right, linearity applies here, so I can compute the expectation of each term separately and then add them up.

So, the state given is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let me write that as a vector. Since σz has eigenstates |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively, maybe that's useful for the σz part. For σx, I think the eigenstates are different, like the |+⟩ and |−⟩ states, but maybe I can express σx in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

Wait, I should probably write the state as a column vector. Let's see: |↑⟩ is usually [1, 0]^T and |↓⟩ is [0, 1]^T. So the state ψ is 0.5 [1, 0] + (sqrt(3)/2) [0, 1], which gives [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. But wait, wait—does the state need to be normalized? Let me check. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Squaring them: 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. Oh, so it's already normalized. Good, no need to worry about that.

Now, the operator is 10σz +5σx. The expectation value ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩. So I can compute ⟨ψ|10σz |ψ⟩ + ⟨ψ|5σx |ψ⟩. 

Let's compute each part separately. Let's start with σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates, the expectation value of σz is just the probability of being in |↑⟩ times +1 plus the probability of |↓⟩ times -1. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. So probabilities are (0.5)^2 = 0.25 and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. So expectation of σz is 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Then, 10 times that is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Next is σx. Hmm, σx is a bit trickier. Its matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when we apply σx to a state, it swaps the up and down components. The expectation value ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ can be calculated using the components. Let me write this out.

The state ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. So ⟨ψ| is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], but wait no, because it's the conjugate transpose. Oh wait, in this case, the coefficients are real, so it's just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. 

So, σx applied to |ψ⟩ is [0 1;1 0] multiplied by [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], which gives [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then, the inner product of ⟨ψ| with this result is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5). Let me compute that
