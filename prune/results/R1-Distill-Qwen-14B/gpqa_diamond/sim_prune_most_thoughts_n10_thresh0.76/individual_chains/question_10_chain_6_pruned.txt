Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. There are four options, a to d, and the choices are A to D as the possible answers. Hmm. I need to figure out each option's density and then compare them.

First, I should recall that density is mass divided by volume. So, density = mass/volume. And for planets, the volume depends on the radius (since volume is (4/3)πr³). So, if two planets have the same composition, their densities would be similar because both mass and radius would scale accordingly. But if the mass and radius change differently, density changes.

Let me look at each option:

Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. That's straightforward: same as Earth's density. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So this one's density is 5.5.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but wait. No, that's not possible. Because if the mass is 2 Earth masses, but the density is the same as Earth, then the radius must be larger. Because density is mass/volume. So if density is same, mass is double, so volume must be double. So radius would be cube root of (2), which is about 1.26 times Earth's radius. But regardless, the given density is 5.5, so this planet's density is 5.5.

Wait, but the question is about which has the highest density. Oh, but option b says the planet's density is 5.5, so same as Earth. So maybe another option could be higher.

Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition implies same density. Because composition affects both mass and radius. So if it's 5 times Earth's mass, its radius would be larger. Since density is mass/volume, and volume scales with radius cubed. Let's see: Earth's density is 5.5, so this planet would have the same density. So its density is 5.5.

Option d) Same composition as Earth, but half the mass. Again, same density. So as Earth, 5.5. 

Wait, but that can't be right because all options a, c, d have the same density. But wait, wait. Let me read the options again. Option b says it has a density of 5.5, so that's same as all others? But the question is about which has the highest density. So all have 5.5 except maybe option a, which is Earth, so 5.5 as well. But wait, I'm getting all four options as 5.5. That can't be right because the question must have a different answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says: among the following exoplanets, which has the highest density? The options are a to d, each describing certain parameters.

Wait, let me read the options again carefully.

a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth. Density is 5.5.

b) A planet with 2
