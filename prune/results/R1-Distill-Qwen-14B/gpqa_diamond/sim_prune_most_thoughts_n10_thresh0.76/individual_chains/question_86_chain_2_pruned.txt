Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves two reactions with different reducing agents, and I need to determine the starting materials A and B.

Hmm, the products of both reactions are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, so both are the same molecule but with opposite configurations? Or maybe one is R and the other is S? Wait, no, the question says A and LiBH4 with H+ gives (R), and B with BH3 and H+ gives (S). Oh right, because the products have the same structure but different stereochemistry.

I remember that reducing agents can affect the stereochemistry of the product, especially in ketones. Oh wait, this must be a reduction of a carbonyl group. But wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic hemiacetal or something like that. Wait, pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. So tetrahydro-pyran would mean it's a saturated ring, so it's more like a cyclic ether with the ring closed. Wait, but it's a 2H-pyran-2-one, so there's a ketone at position 2. So the structure would be a 5-membered ring? Wait, no, pyran is six-membered. Oh wait, 2H-pyran-2-one would have the ketone at position 2, so the ring is six-membered with oxygen at position 1, I think. So the structure is a cyclic ether with a ketone. 

Wait, the starting material must have been a carbonyl group. So when a carbonyl is reduced, it becomes an alcohol. But wait, the product is a ketone. Oh, wait, maybe the starting material is an epoxide or something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting off track. Let me think again.

So the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a six-membered ring with an oxygen, and a ketone at C2. The ethyl group is at C4. So the ring would have substituents at C2 (the ketone)
