Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and break it down.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. Hmm, but wait, the question is about luminosity, so maybe the mass doesn't directly factor in here. But I'll keep that in mind in case it's a red herring.

The problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Oh right, the wavelength where a star's emission is strongest is related to its temperature. That's Wien's Law, right? Wien's displacement law states that λ_max * T = constant (approximately 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2. That's an important point.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted; if moving away, redshifted. But since Star_1 has zero radial velocity, its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is usually the component along the line of sight. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its light would be blueshifted. But wait, the problem says they have the same wavelengths at which they appear brightest. Wait, no, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Wait, no, the problem says "they found that they are the same." So the observed λ_max for both is the same. Hmm, but I thought λ_max depends on temperature. So if λ_max is same as observed, but Star_2 has a radial velocity, how does that play in?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me first think about the luminosity calculation. Luminosity for a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Since both stars have the same λ_max, and since λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature, their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2. So when I compute the luminosity ratio, L1/L2 would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But since T1=T2, that part is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So that would suggest the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. But wait, that's one of the options, option A. But wait, the answer choices suggest it's more complicated than that.

Wait,
