Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves a 1,5-diene undergoing a [3,3] sigmatropic shift. Right, so the molecule rearranges in such a way that the diene parts shift positions.

The compound given here is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to visualize that structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene is like norbornene, right? So the structure has two rings: a five-membered ring and a six-membered bridge. The substituents on that molecule are a vinyl group and an azabicyclo group.

Wait, the molecule has a bridge structure. So the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene has two bridgehead carbons. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a vinyl group (CH2-CH2?), and position 5 has an azabicyclo... Wait, no, the structure is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo, which means that the nitrogen is at position 2 as well. Oh wait, the numbering might be a bit tricky. So the bicyclo has three bridgehead carbons, right? Because bicyclo[m.n.p] means that there are three bridges with m, n, p carbons in each. For [2.2.1], the two bridges have two carbons each, and the third has one. So the structure is norbornene, which is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene.

The substituents here are at position 2. So, 2-azabicyclo... meaning that the nitrogen is part of the bicyclo structure. Hmm, so the molecule has a bridge where one of the bridgehead atoms is a nitrogen, and another substituent is a vinyl group attached to the same bridgehead.

Wait, let me draw this structure. So the bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has a double bond between carbons 5 and 6 (if I'm numbering correctly). The bridgehead positions are 1, 2, and
