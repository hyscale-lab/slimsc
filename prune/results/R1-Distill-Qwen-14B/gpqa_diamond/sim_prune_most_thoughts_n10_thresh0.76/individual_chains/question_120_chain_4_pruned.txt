Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. I remember from my astronomy class that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (pl) is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, like, if I have a range of parallaxes, how does the number of stars in each slice of that range vary?

I think this has to do with how volume works with distance. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So higher parallax means closer, which is a smaller distance.

But wait, when you count stars, the number you can see within a certain distance depends on the volume of space you're looking at. Volume increases with the cube of the radius. Because volume is 4/3 π r³, right?

So if I'm considering a shell between distance d and d + dr, the volume is 4 π d² dr. But how does this relate to parallax? Since plx is 1/d, the shell's volume in terms of parallax would be... let me think.

If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So the volume of a thin shell in terms of plx would involve the derivative of d with respect to plx. Hmm, maybe I should express the volume in terms of plx instead.

Let me see. The shell at distance d has thickness dr. Since plx is 1/d, a change in plx dplx would correspond to a change in d. Let's compute dr in terms of dplx.

So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. Differentiating both sides: d d = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx. So dr = - (1/(plx^2)) dplx. Wait, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases, which makes sense.

But when considering how many stars are in a given range of plx, the volume would depend on the number of stars in each shell. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is constant. So the number of stars in a shell is proportional to the volume of the shell.

The volume of a shell is 4π d² dr. Substituting d = 1/plx and dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but for the number of stars, we can ignore the negative sign because we're considering absolute changes. So volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, no, wait: d is 1/plx, so d squared is (1/plx)^2, and dr is (1/plx²) dplx. So the volume is 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx²) dplx? Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express this.

The volume of a shell is 4π d² dr. But dr is in terms of dplx. So substituting d = 1/plx, and dr = (1/(plx)^2) dplx (since the negative just indicates direction, but we're considering magnitude).

So the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) dplx. Wait, that would be 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. Hmm, but that seems a bit high. So number of stars in that shell would be proportional to volume, so proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) would be proportional to 1/plx^4. Because each dplx contributes a volume proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit plx is 1 over plx to the fourth.

Wait, but I'm a little confused. Let me think again. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (stars per unit volume
