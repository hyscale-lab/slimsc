Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what it's about.

The question involves two mixtures, X and Y. Mixture X is an equimolar mix of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. When treated with platinum and heat, X undergoes a reaction to form Y, which is also an equimolar mixture but of two different liquids. Importantly, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions with platinum, they each produce only one substance, Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%, is part of Y, and is a common solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturated, probably an alkane.

The question is about finding the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Hmm, let me break this down. I think I should start by figuring out what Z is. Because if Z is a constituent of Y and comes from the hydrogenation of both X and Y, then Z must be an alkane since it doesn't react further with H2. Also, its hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%, which is about 1/7. So let's calculate the molecular formula of Z.

Hydrogen's molar mass is about 1, and carbon is 12. Let's say the formula is CnH2m. Wait, no, wait. For a hydrocarbon, it's usually CnH2n+2 for alkanes. Because alkanes are saturated, so each carbon is bonded to four others, etc.

So, the mass fraction of hydrogen is (mass of H)/(mass of compound) = 14.28% which is 0.1428. Let's suppose Z is CnH2n+2.

So the mass of H is (2n+2)*1/(12n + 2n + 2) ) = (2n+2)/(14n + 2) ) = (2n+2)/(14n+2) = 0.1428.

Let me set up the equation:

(2n + 2) / (14n + 2) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by (14n + 2):

2n + 2 = 0.1428 * (14n + 2)

Let me compute 0.1428 *14: 0.1428 *14 is approximately 2, because 14 * (1/7) = 2, and 0.1428 is approximately 1/7. So 0.1428 *14n = 2n. And 0.1428 *2 = approximately 0.2856.

So equation becomes:

2n + 2 = 2n + 0.2856

Subtract 2n from both sides: 2 = 0.2856. Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I should calculate it more precisely.

Wait, 0.1428 is approximately 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈0.142857). So let's take 0.1428 as exactly 1/7.

So, (2n+2)/(14n+2) = 1/7.

Cross-multiplying:

7(2n + 2) = 14n +2

14n +14 =14n +2

Subtract 14n: 14 =2. That's impossible. Hmm, so I must have done something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps my assumption about Z's formula is incorrect. Maybe Z isn't an alkane? No, because if Z is a product of hydrogenation of X and Y, and it doesn't react further, it must be fully saturated, so an alkane.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass fraction calculation. Let me try a different approach. Let's denote the formula as CnHm, and calculate m such that (m)/(12n + m) = 14.28/100 = 0.1428.

So, m/(12n + m) = 0.1428.

Let's rearrange:

m = 0.1428*(12n + m )

m = 0.1428 *12n + 0.1428 m

m - 0.1428 m = 1.7136 n

0.8572 m = 1.7136 n

m = (1.7136 / 0.8572) * n

Let me compute that:

1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.0.

Because 0.8572 * 2 = 1.7144, which is close to 1.7136. So m ≈ 2n.

Wait, but that's not possible because for alkanes, m=2n+2. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, maybe Z is not an alkane but an aromatic compound? No, because then it would have double bonds and react further with hydrogen.

Wait, if Z is an alkane, let's go back. Let's compute.

The mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is 1/7. So, (mass of H) / (mass of Z) = 1/7.

Mass of H is (number of H atoms) * 1 g/mol.

The molecular formula is CnH2n+2.

So,

(2n +2)*1 / (12n + (2n +2)) ) = 1/7

Simplify denominator: 12n +2n +2 =14n +2.

So, (2n+2)/(14n +2) = 1/7

Cross-multiply:

7(2n +2) =14n +2

14n +14 =14n +2

14=2 → which is impossible.

Hmm. So either my formula is wrong, or maybe Z is a different type of compound. Wait, perhaps Z is a cycloalkane? No, cycloalkanes are still alkanes, so same problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe Z's formula
