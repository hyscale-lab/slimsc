Okay, so I've got this problem about three spins and their partition function. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says we have three spins S1, S2, S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), right? Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where E is the energy of that state. So each state contributes exp(-β E) to Z.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so each has two choices. For three spins, the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. So I'll have to consider all 8 possible combinations of S1, S2, S3.

But maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8. Let me think about the energy expression. The energy is E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). Since J is a coupling constant, I assume it's positive, but maybe that depends on the context. Not sure yet, but perhaps it doesn't matter for now.

Wait, let's think about each possible state and compute the energy for each. Each of the three terms S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1 because each S is +1 or -1. So each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be 3, 1, -1, or -3, depending on how many of the terms are +1 and how many are -1.

Wait, no, let's see. Let me think about each term:

If all three terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 are +1, then the sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

If two terms are +1 and one is -1, sum is 2-1=1. So E=-J*(1) = -J.

If one term is +1 and two are -1, sum is 1-2= -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

If all three terms are -1, sum is -3. So E = -J*(-3) = 3J.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to count the number of states that lead to each sum. Let me make a table.

Each spin can be +1 or -1. Let me list all possible 8 states and compute their energy.

But this might take time. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the number of states that yield each possible value of the sum.

Let me consider the sum H = S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S
