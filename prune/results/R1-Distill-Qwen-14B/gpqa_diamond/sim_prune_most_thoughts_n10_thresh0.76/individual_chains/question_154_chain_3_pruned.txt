Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the chemist found a white solid, and we need to determine what it is based on spectral data. Let's see what each of these pieces of information tells us.

First, the Mass Spec. Molecular ion is at m/z 156, which is the most intense peak at 100%. Then there's a peak at 158 at 32%. Wait, the molecular ion is M+, so the molecular weight is 156. The 158 peak is probably a fragment. What could cause a peak two units higher? Maybe a Cl isotope because chlorine has isotopes. Chlorine-35 is the most common, but Cl-37 would add two mass units. So if the molecule has a Cl, the molecular ion would have about 75% abundance (since Cl has about 3/4 Cl-35 and 1/4 Cl-37). But wait, in the options, all the compounds except maybe one have Cl. Let's check the options.

Looking at the options: A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure has Cl, OH, and CHO groups. B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which has Cl and COOH. C is phenyl chloroformate, which is ClCOOPh. D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid, so Cl and COOH.

So all options except maybe C have Cl. Wait, option C: chloroformate is ClCO-O-Ph. So the molecular formula would be C8H7ClO3? Let's calculate the molecular weight for each option.

Option A: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. But with Cl and OH, formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate: C7 (12*7=84) + H5 (5) + Cl (35.5) + O2 (32) â†’ 84+5=89+35.5=124.5+32=156.5. So molecular weight is about 156.5. So the molecular ion at 156 makes sense, but wait, in mass spec, the molecular ion is usually for the most abundant isotope. So maybe for option A, the formula is C7H5ClO2.

But wait, another option: option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl makes C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight would be same as option A: same formula, same molecular weight. So both A and B have the same molecular weight. Then why in the mass spec, the molecular ion is 156, which is 156.5 rounded? Well, the exact mass might differ based on isotopes.

But looking at the other peak at 158 (32%). That's two units higher. Chlorine's isotopic distribution is about 75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37. So
