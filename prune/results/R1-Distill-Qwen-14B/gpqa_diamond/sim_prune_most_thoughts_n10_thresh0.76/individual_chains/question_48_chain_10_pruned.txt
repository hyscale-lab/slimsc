Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4 after a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. Hmm, let me think through each step carefully.

First, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so its structure is a six-membered ring with a ketone group (O) attached. So the starting point is a chair conformation, but the exact structure might not matter right now.

Step one: cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, forming product 1. I think when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br2), it's probably an addition reaction. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when a ketone is treated with bromine in a certain solvent, it undergoes a halohydrin formation? Or maybe it's an addition to the carbonyl group. Wait another thought: Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxylation. No, no, wait, wait. Oh, wait! Cyclohexanone reacting with bromine in a non-polar solvent might undergo addition across the carbonyl. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, wait. I think I'm confusing this with other reactions. Oh wait, another possibility: when ketones react with bromine, maybe it's a bromination via enol formation. Oh, right! The enol form of ketones can react with electrophiles. So, cyclohexanone would form an enol, which would react with Br2.

Wait, but how does that go? The enol has an alpha hydrogen, right? So, when cyclohexanone forms the enol (which is conjugated with the carbonyl), the enol's double bond would attack the electrophilic bromine. So, the bromine adds across the double bond of the enol. So, adding Br across the enol would lead to the formation of a dibromide. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition. Or perhaps it's an addition to the carbonyl, giving a bromohydrin. Wait, that makes more sense. Because the carbonyl oxygen is a good nucleophile. So, when you have a ketone reacting with bromine (like in a nucleophilic attack maybe?), you get a bromohydrin. So the product would have an OH and a Br attached to the same carbon as the carbonyl. Oh wait, no, wait
