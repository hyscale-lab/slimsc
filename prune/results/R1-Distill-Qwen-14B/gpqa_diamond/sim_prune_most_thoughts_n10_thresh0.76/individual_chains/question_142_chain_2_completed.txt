Okay, so I have this question about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this looks like a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>.

Each term |i><i| is a projectors or outer product, right? So |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere, and similarly for |1><1|. Adding those gives a matrix that's diagonal with 1s in both the (0,0) and (1,1) positions. Multiplying by 1/2 scales them down, so each diagonal entry becomes 1/2.

So the matrix ρ would look like:
[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Wait, but what's the geometrical position of this in qubit space? I think qubit space is three-dimensional, right? Because qubits can be represented on the Bloch sphere, which is a 2-sphere embedded in 3D space.

The Bloch sphere representation comes from the density matrix. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r. The formula is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix.

So let's write out the Pauli matrices. σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Given ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, let's compute that. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So (I + r·σ)/2 would be:

[ [ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],
  [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

Comparing this to our given ρ, which has diagonal elements 1/2 and off-diagonal 0. So let's set up the equations.

From the diagonal elements:
(1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.
(1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 → same result, r_z=0.

The off-diagonal elements are (r_x - i r_y)/2. In our ρ, the off-diagonal elements are zero. So:
(r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 → r_x = 0 and r_y = 0.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would mean the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, but the origin in Bloch sphere terms is the completely mixed state. Because when r is zero, ρ is (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which is a maximally mixed state. That makes sense because our ρ is a 50-50 mixture of |0> and |1>, which is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which matches. So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, as it is a statistical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) with equal probabilities. The corresponding density matrix in operator form is:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. Expanding this, the density matrix becomes:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1 + r_z}{2} & \frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} \\
\frac{r_x + i r_y}{2} & \frac{1 - r_z}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we observe the following:

1. The diagonal elements \(\frac{1 + r_z}{2}\) and \(\frac{1 - r_z}{2}\) must equal \(\frac{1}{2}\), which implies \(r_z = 0\).
2. The off-diagonal elements \(\frac{r_x - i r_y}{2}\) and \(\frac{r_x + i r_y}{2}\) must equal 0, which implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This represents the maximally mixed state, which matches the given density matrix.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
