Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out what the product is when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, what's that reaction? Oh right, red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. Or wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Wait, another thought: when alkenes react with HI, they undergo addition. But if the compound has an ester group, like maybe a benzene ring with an ester substituent, then maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction.

First, I need to figure out what compound X is. Let's look at the spectral data.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500, 1720, 1610, 1450 cm-1. The broad peak between 3400–2500 suggests either an -OH stretch or an N-H stretch. Wait, but in this case, maybe it's a carbonyl or something else. Oh wait, 3400-2500 is a broad region, so that's probably an -OH group, maybe a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But then the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually very broad, around 2500-3300. So given that the IR has both a broad peak in that region and the 1720 cm-1, which would be a carbonyl. But wait, if the compound is an ester, then the carbonyl is around 1720, and maybe the broad peak is from an -OH elsewhere, but that doesn't fit for an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone or an aldehyde. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, but the carbonyl would be around 1700. Hmm, so the 1720 is a bit higher, more like an ester or a ketone. Wait, but let me think again: carboxylic acids have lower wavenumbers for their carbonyl, around 1700. Esters are higher, around 1730-1750. So 1720 is on the lower side for an ester, maybe a conjugated ester or something else.

Wait, but let's not get stuck on IR yet. Let's look at the NMR data to see what functional groups we're dealing with.

The 1H NMR has several signals. The first one is 10.5 ppm, a broad singlet, 1H. That's very high, which makes me think of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and split into a doublet. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH proton, but that's usually a broad peak. Wait, but in a carboxylic acid, the -OH is broad and around 10-12 ppm, right? So that could fit. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but let's see the other signals. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) are probably from a para-substituted benzene ring. So like two sets of doublets, which is typical for an aromatic ring with two substituents in the para positions. For example, if the benzene ring has two substituents at the para positions, each with two H's. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two groups attached, such as a substituent and another substituent.

Wait, the protons at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 could be ortho to substituents. Let me think, in a para-substituted benzene, like toluene with another group, the neighboring protons (ortho and meta) would have different shifts. Alternatively, if the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl, then the adjacent protons would be deshielded, appearing around 8 ppm. So perhaps the benzene ring has a carbonyl group in the para position.

Wait, but looking at the IR, the 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. So if the ring has a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester, but then the 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde. Wait, but that would be two carbonyl groups? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an -OH (like a carboxylic acid), and the 1720 is an ester.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, 1H. So maybe it's an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually have a singlet because there are no neighboring protons (except maybe in some cases), but the shift is around 9-10 ppm. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would be broad and at around 10-12 ppm. So maybe the 10.5 is an -OH. Then 1720 would be the carbonyl of the acid. But wait, a carboxylic acid would have a broad -OH around 12 ppm, but the 10.5 is a singlet. Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 is an acidic proton, like in a phenol group. But phenols have broad -OH signals around 5 ppm. Wait, no, phenol protons are around 6-8 ppm as aromatic protons, and the -OH is usually around 5 ppm, but it can vary. Wait, but in this case, the 10.5 is a singlet with 1H, which doesn't fit for a phenol's -OH. Because a phenol's -OH is usually a broad peak around 4-7 ppm, but not 10.5. So that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps it's a carbonyl group with an alpha proton. Wait, no, if it's a ketone, the alpha protons would be around 2.1 ppm or so. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 is an aldehyde. Let me think about the rest of the NMR.

Then, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) indicate a para-substituted aromatic ring. So maybe the ring has two substituents in the para positions. Wait, or perhaps it's a single substituent that's a di-substituted group. Hmm, not sure. Let me proceed.

The other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). 

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is probably a methyl group attached to a CH2. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH(CH3) group, maybe. So perhaps a CH(CH3) connected to something else.

The 2.9 (m, 1H) and 1.7 (m, 2H) are more like a chain of protons. So maybe a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, but
