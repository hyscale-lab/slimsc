Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let's try to think it through. 

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of T1 equals 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. They give Φ0 as π/4 and U0 as 190 kV. We need to find how many revolutions the proton makes. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that in cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons, the particles move in a magnetic field and are accelerated by an electric field. The key here is probably the relationship between the voltage, the energy gained, and the number of revolutions.

So the proton starts with negligible KE. It's accelerated by the voltage, which is alternating. Each time it goes through the potential difference, it gains some energy. But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the electric field is adjusted as the proton's speed increases because the cyclotron frequency depends on the mass and charge. So the frequency ν(α) is a function of the particle's radius α.

But how does that help me find the number of revolutions? I think each revolution would correspond to being accelerated once by the voltage. So the number of times the proton goes around the track is the number of times it's accelerated. 

Wait, but the voltage is applied at a certain frequency, and the proton's motion is such that each time it passes through the gap, it gets a push. So the number of revolutions would be the number of times it's accelerated. But since the frequency is changing, maybe it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the number of revolutions is calculated based on the energy gained. Each time the proton goes around, it gains energy from the voltage. Let's think about energy.

At each acceleration, the proton gains energy equal to the voltage applied. Because the electric potential energy difference is qU, where q is charge and U is voltage. Since the proton has charge e, each acceleration gives it eU0 energy.

Wait, but wait. The voltage is time-dependent. It's U0 cos(...). So the average voltage might be the peak divided by sqrt
