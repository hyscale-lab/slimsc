Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in various compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry. So I need to check each compound for chirality.

Let me go one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, what's the structure here? The double bond is between C1 and C2. Chlorine is on C1, and a methyl on C2. So structure is Cl-C=C-CH2-CH3. Wait, but wait, the double bond is between 1 and 2, so the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are Cl and CH2CH3 on C1, and CH(CH3) and maybe another H on C2? Hmm, wait no, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So butene is four carbons. Structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no, wait, it's but-1-ene, which is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl substituted on C1. So it's Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right because the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, but the compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So C1 is Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and then two more carbons perhaps. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So the 1-chloro is Cl on the first carbon, which is part of the double bond. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the formula can be written as Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, but the double bond is between 1 and 2. So maybe the
