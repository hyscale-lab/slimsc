Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll think it through.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 could be propene or cyclopropane. Wait, no, cyclopropane is C3H6 too. Oh wait, but the first reaction is bromination in CCl4. Oh right, that's a typical addition reaction for alkenes. So Compound A must be propene because cyclopropane would undergo ring-opening in bromination, but I'm not as sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-propene, which is propene. So, Compound A is probably propene (CH2=CH2CH3). 

When propene undergoes bromination in CCl4, it should add bromine across the double bond. So Compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Or wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3). So structure of B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So this is probably an elimination reaction. So in the presence of KOH, B would undergo dehydrohalogenation. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating HBr from adjacent positions. So we can lose two HBr molecules perhaps? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane has Br on adjacent carbons. So when KOH (in alcohol) is added, it should cause elimination, likely forming an alkene. So which structure? The possible alkenes would be 1-propene or 2-propene (propene and allyl structures). Wait, the arrangement: 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCHBrCH3. So elimination of HBr from either Br could form either 1-propene or perhaps something else.

Wait, let me think. When you have vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromopropane) and treat with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it will lose two equivalents of HBr. So the product would be propene. But wait
