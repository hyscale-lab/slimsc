Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at around 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. And the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. I remember that when quasars or active galactic nuclei (AGN) show such features, it's often because of something called the Lyman break. The Lyman series is from hydrogen, and the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm in the rest frame. But if the observed wavelength is longer than that, it's because of redshift. 

Wait, wait. The peak here is at 790 nm. So that must be the Lyman break moving into the near-infrared. So the quasar's spectrum is being redshifted. The rest wavelength for the Lyman break is about 912 Angstroms, which is 91.2 nm, right? Wait, no, the Lyman limit is about 91 nm, but the Lyman-alpha is 121 nm. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The Lyman series is for transitions ending in n=1, so the Lyman-alpha is 1 -> 2, which is about 121 nm. But the Lyman break in quasars is typically the edge of the rest frame UV emission, which is around 900-1200 Angstroms (90-120 nm). So if the observed wavelength
