Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, I think parallax (plx) is measured in arcseconds, right? And parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So if plx is small, the distance r is large.

The formula given is number of stars N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, that's interesting. So N is proportional to plx to the -5th power.

But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So they want the relationship between N and r, where r is the distance. Because parallax and distance are inversely related, I'll need to find how N depends on r instead of plx.

I remember that parallax plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. Wait, yeah, because 1 parsec is the distance where 1 AU subtends 1 arcsecond. So that's the relation.

So if plx = 1/r, then plx^5 = (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5) which is r^5. Because 1/(1/r^5) is r^5.

Wait, let me double-check that. So N ∝ 1/(plx^5) → replacing plx with 1/r, that becomes N ∝ 1/( (1/r)^5 ) → which is r^5. Oh right, because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, and the reciprocal is r^5.

So N is proportional to r^5. So as the distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of r. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because when you look further away, shouldn't the number of stars decrease for a given volume? Or maybe the question is about the number per unit distance. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, the question specifically says "per unit range of distance, r." So it's
