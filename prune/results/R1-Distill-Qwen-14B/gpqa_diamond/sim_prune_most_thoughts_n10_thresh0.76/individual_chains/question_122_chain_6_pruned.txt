Okay, let's try to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, I remember that each step involves some kind of reaction, and the final product's NMR will depend on its structure. Let's break down each step.

First, acetic acid is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. I think that's a bromination reaction. Oh right, when acetic acid reacts with Br2 in the presence of pyridine (which probably absorbs the HBr generated), it's probably undergoing an acetylation first. Wait, or is it more about substitution? Oh wait, wait. Acetic acid has an -OH group. When treated with Br2 and a base like pyridine, maybe it's undergoing a substitution where the -OH is replaced by Br. But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid; would that substitution happen? Alternatively, I've heard that acetic anhydride can act as an acetylating agent. So maybe the first step is a substitution where the -OH of acetic acid is replaced by Br, but wait, acetic anhydride is also present. Oh, perhaps it's a two-step process. Oh wait! Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that's for aromatic rings. Hmm, wait, no, acetic acid is not an aromatic compound. Alternatively, perhaps the conditions are for introducing a bromine into the molecule. Oh, wait, when an alcohol reacts with HBr in the presence of a base, it's an SN2 substitution. So acetic acid's -OH is a good leaving group if activated. But wait, acetic anhydride is a strong acetylating agent. So perhaps the first step is acetylating something. Wait, acetic acid has an -OH on the CH3COOH. If we treat it with acetic anhydride, perhaps it's forming an acetylated acetic acid. Wait, but the presence of Br2 and pyridine... Wait, maybe the acetic acid is being converted into an acetyl bromide. Oh! Maybe the -OH of acetic acid is being replaced by bromine. So, the product would be CH3COBr? That makes sense because acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with Br2 and pyridine would substitute the -OH with Br, making acetyl bromide. So product 1 is acetyl bromide (CH3COBr).

Next, product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2. So, acetyl bromide (CH3COBr) reacting with ethanol. Ethanol is a nucleophile, probably in an SN2 reaction. So the bromide leaves, and ethanol's -OH attacks, leading to the substitution. Wait, but when you have an acid catalyst, maybe it's more of an esterification. Oh wait, wait, no. CH3COBr (acetyl bromide) reacting with ethanol would form an ester. So the reaction would be CH3COBr + EtOH â†’ CH3COOEt + HBr. But wait, sulfuric acid is a catalyst for such reactions, so yes, product 2 would be ethyl acetate, CH3COOEt.

Then, product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN), forming product 3. Sodium cyanide is
