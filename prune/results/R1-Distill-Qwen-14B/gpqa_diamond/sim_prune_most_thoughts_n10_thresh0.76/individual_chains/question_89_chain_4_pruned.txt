Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and going through several steps. I need to figure out the NMR coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the final product.

First, I'll break down each step. The initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with excess KOH at 240°C should cause an elimination reaction because KOH is a strong base. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a base, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. So, this step probably forms an adamantane derivative with a double bond.

The product 1 has an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, that's a strong peak. The carbonyl group (C=O) usually shows up around 1700 cm⁻¹. So maybe product 1 isn't an alkene after all. Oh, wait—maybe I got the reaction wrong. KOH in such conditions might cause a different kind of elimination or maybe even a substitution. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—could it be a di-substitution leading to a ketone?

Wait, no, let me think again. Oh, wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with a strong base like KOH, perhaps it's an E2 elimination, forming an alkene. But the IR doesn't show a peak for a C=C stretch. Instead, 1720 is more like a carbonyl, maybe an ester or ketone. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the structure.

Wait another thought: adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons in a way that allows elimination. When KOH is used, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond. But the IR doesn't show a C=C peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where two bromides are replaced by hydroxide, but that would form a diol
