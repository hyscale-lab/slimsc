Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

So, the question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that could be mistaken for an exoplanet transiting the star.

The question is asking what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots. So, if there were no spots, what planet size would cause the same change in light.

Hmm. I remember that the brightness variation (the dip in light curve) when a planet transits a star is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula I think is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area blocked is the area of the planet's disk compared to the star's.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots, so the dip when the spots are transiting is different. The brightness change depends on the temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star.

So, the star's normal brightness is based on its effective temperature. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, they contribute less light. So the total brightness variation would be due to the difference in flux from the spotted area versus the non-spotted area.

Let me think: the star emits a certain amount of flux. The spots are cooler, so each spot emits less flux. When the star rotates and the spots come into view, the total flux observed decreases compared to when the spots are not visible.

To model this, I need to calculate the net change in flux when the spots are visible. The total flux from the star without spots is F_total = 4πR_star² σ Teff^4. But wait, actually, when calculating the brightness change, it's the change in flux that matters, not the absolute flux.

The star's surface without spots has a certain flux per unit area. The spots have a lower flux. So, the difference in flux when the spots are visible versus when they're not is what causes the variation.

First, let's calculate the contribution of the spots. The filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere, but since only one hemisphere is spotted, the total area covered in spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) / 2? Wait, let me think.

Wait, the star is a sphere. Each hemisphere is 2π steradians. So one hemisphere is π steradians. Wait, no, the surface area of a sphere is 4π R². A hemisphere's area is 2π R². So each hemisphere is 2π R².

The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the spotted area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². Wait, no—if the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere, the area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2
