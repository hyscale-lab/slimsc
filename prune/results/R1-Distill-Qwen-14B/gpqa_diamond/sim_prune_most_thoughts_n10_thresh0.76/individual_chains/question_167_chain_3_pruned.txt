Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. So the question is about calculating the amount of non-Gaussianity in a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are those that have a Wigner function which is Gaussian, like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. Non-Gaussian states are things like Fock states or cat states, which are superpositions of coherent states.

The given state is |ψ> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. And N is the normalization constant, which is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha²)). So the parameters are phi and alpha. The problem asks for the non-Gaussianity when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5.

The non-Gaussianity measure here is given by the relative entropy, del_b, which is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state, and rho is the non-Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, so I'm supposed to calculate the non-Gaussianity as the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of the closest Gaussian state. But wait, I'm a bit confused about how to find tau, the reference Gaussian state. Maybe for the Schrödinger cat state, the closest Gaussian state is a specific one. Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is calculated with respect to the maximally mixed Gaussian state or something else. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact approach here. Let me think about the density matrices first. The state |ψ> is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>. So the density matrix rho is |ψ><ψ|.

I need to compute the relative entropy between rho and tau, which is a Gaussian state. But the question is, what is tau? Because the relative entropy will depend on what tau we choose. Wait, the problem says the relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So tau is the reference Gaussian state. But I'm not told which Gaussian state to use as a reference. Oh wait, perhaps it's the maximally mixed Gaussian state? Or maybe the closest
