Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, higher density means either more mass or less volume, or both. Let me think through each option.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. The options are a to d, and the choices are A to D, each pointing to a different option.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. That's our own Earth, so density is the same as Earth's. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I think. So this planet's density is 5.5.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, wait. The given density is the same as Earth's. So the planet is more massive but same density. So since density is mass/volume, if mass is 2 times Earth and density same, volume must be 2 times. But wait, Earth's radius is R, so volume is (4/3)πR³. If mass is 2 times and density same as Earth, volume should be 2 times Earth's volume. So the radius would be larger than Earth's. But the question here says the density is 5.5. So option b's density is 5.5. Same as Earth. So in comparison to others, maybe it's same as Earth.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density as Earth. Because density depends on what it's made of. So if it's same composition, density is same as Earth—5.5. So this planet would have a higher mass but same density. Wait, but the question is about which has the highest density. So if all these have the same density, but no—wait, maybe not.

Wait, looking again. Option c says same composition, so same density as Earth. So same as Earth, which is 5.5. So same density as option a and b.

Option d: A planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. Same composition, same density. So 5.5. So all options a, b, c, d have same density, but wait, that can't be right. Because I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The question is about the planet's density. So, for same composition, same density. So
