Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Alright, the problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution containing two different potassium phosphate salts. Hmm, I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH, so I think I need to consider the dissociation of these salts and how they affect the concentration.

The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. There's 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with two water molecules. Oh, right, the temperature is 25°C, but I'm not sure how that affects it here. The Ka values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8, and 1.8x10^-12. I think those are the three dissociation steps.

So, the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-. Wait, but wait: orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? Or is that referring to the phosphate ion PO4^3-? Hmm, sometimes orthophosphate refers to the fully deprotonated ion. So I might need to find [PO4^3-].

Wait, but the solution is made from a mixture of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So I should probably find out how much each of these contributes to the phosphate species in solution.

First, I should calculate the moles of each salt.

For KH2PO4: moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.007334 mol. Wait, wait: 136.09 is the molar mass. So 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007334 mol. So that's about 0.007334 moles of KH2PO4.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let me see, 1/177.99 is approximately 0.005617 mol. Hmm, so about 0.005617 moles of that salt.

Now, what do these salts dissociate into in solution? 

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So each mole of this salt gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But how does that relate to the concentration of PO4^3-?

I remember that in solution, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The various species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

The presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests that the solution is in a buffer region. The phosphate buffer system is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, maybe I should consider the equilibrium here. The relevant equilibrium for the phosphate ions would be the second dissociation of H3PO4: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for this step is the third dissociation, which is given as 1.8x10^-12. Wait, no. Let me think: H3PO4 dissociates first to H2PO4^- with Ka1, then H2PO4^- to HPO4^2- with Ka2, and then HPO4^2- to PO4^3- with Ka3.

So the third dissociation is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-, with Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So the concentration of PO4^3- will depend on the concentration of HPO4^2- and the pH of the solution.

But wait, how do I find the pH of the solution here? Because the solution is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are the two components of a buffer. So the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

In this case, the buffer system is H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base). The pKa would be the pKa2, since that's the dissociation step between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) = approximately 7.207.

Wait, no: pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

So the ratio [base]/[acid] is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].

Calculating the moles: From KH2PO4, we have 0.007334 mol of H2PO4^-.

From Na2HPO4, we have 0.005617 mol of HPO4^2-.

So the ratio is (0.005617)/(0.007334) ≈ 0.766.

So plugging into the Henderson equation:

pH = 7.207 + log(0.766)

log(0.766) is about log(0.75) is -0.1249, log(0.766) is a bit higher. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Using log(0.766): ln(0.766) is about -0.266, so log ≈ (-0.266)/2.3026 ≈ -0.1155.

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.1155 ≈ 7.0915.

So the pH of the solution is approximately 7.09.

Now, with the pH known, we can find the concentration of PO4^3- using the third dissociation.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

At pH 7.09, [H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.2388e-8 M.

The equilibrium expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But wait, [HPO4^2-] is the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution.

Wait, but in the solution, some of the HPO4^2- from the Na2HPO4 will dissociate into PO4^3- and H+. So the actual [HPO4^2-] is less than the initial concentration. However, since Ka3 is very small (1.8e-12), the dissociation is minimal, so [HPO4^2-] ≈ initial concentration.

Wait, let me think: the initial concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005617 mol in 0.2 L. So 0.005617 / 0.2 ≈ 0.028085 M.

Similarly, [H+] is 8.2388e-8 M.

So plugging into the equation:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.2388e-8)

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 ≈ 5.0553e-14.

Denominator: 8.2388e-8.

So 5.0553e-14 / 8.2388e-8 = (5.0553 / 8.2388) * 1e-6.

5.0553 /8.2388 ≈ 0.6135.

So 0.6135e-6 ≈ 6.135e-7 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Because this gives PO4^3- concentration around 6.135e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is close. But wait, I might have made a miscalculation in the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the total concentration of phosphate species. Let me go through again.

Wait, the initial moles of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4) is 0.005617 mol. The moles of H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) is 0.007334 mol.

In solution, these will dissociate according to the buffer system, but the [PO4^3-] comes from the HPO4^2- dissociating further.

Another approach: in the buffer solution, the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] determines the pH. Once we have the pH, we can find [PO4^3-] from the third dissociation.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentrations properly.

Total volume is 0.2 L.

Concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007334 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03667 M.

Concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005617 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028085 M.

So the Henderson equation gives pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is about 7.207.

Ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028085 / 0.03667 ≈ 0.766.

So pH = 7.207 + log(0.766) ≈ 7.207 -0.115 ≈ 7.092.

So [H+] is 10^-7.092 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

Now, for the third dissociation, HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

The concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028085 M, but some of it dissociates. Let me denote the change as x. So,

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 - x ≈ 0.028085 (since x is very small, as Ka3 is 1.8e-12).

[H+] = 8.23e-8 + x ≈ 8.23e-8.

[PO4^3-] = x.

So, Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

1.8e-12 = (8.23e-8)(x) / 0.028085.

Solving for x:

x = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / 8.23e-8.

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.

Denominator: 8.23e-8.

So x = 5.0553e-14 / 8.23e-8 ≈ 6.14e-7 M.

Wait, that's around 6.14e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close.

But wait, perhaps my calculations have some approximation errors. Let me recheck the exact numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should compute [H+] more precisely. The pH was calculated as 7.0915, so [H+] is 10^-7.0915.

Let me compute that more accurately. 10^-7.0915 = 10^(-7 -0.0915) = 10^-7 * 10^-0.0915.

10^-0.0915 is about 0.813 (since 10^-0.1 ≈ 0.794, 0.0915 is a bit less than 0.1, so maybe ≈ 0.823? Let me compute it more accurately.)

Use the natural logarithm approximation: ln(10^x) = x ln(10). So 10^x = e^{x ln10}.

x = -0.0915.

ln(10) ≈ 2.302585.

So x ln10 ≈ -0.0915 * 2.302585 ≈ -0.2107.

e^-0.2107 ≈ 0.8103.

So 10^-0.0915 ≈ 0.8103.

So 10^-7.0915 = 1e-7 * 0.8103 ≈ 8.103e-8 M.

So [H+] is 8.103e-8.

Now, x = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / 8.103e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.

Now, 5.0553e-14 / 8.103e-8 = (5.0553 / 8.103) * 1e-6.

5.0553 / 8.103 ≈ 0.624.

So 0.624e-6 = 6.24e-7 M.

Ah, so that's 6.24e-7 M, which matches option A.

But wait, the options also include option D, which is 3.97e-7. Hmm, why did I get 6.24e-7?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation. Let me double-check.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1/136.09 ≈ 0.007334 mol. That's correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 = 0.005617 mol. Correct.

So [HPO4^2-] is 0.005617 / 0.2 L = 0.028085 M. Correct.

Wait, but wait: in the solution, the HPO4^2- comes from the Na salt, and H2PO4^- from the K salt. So their concentrations are correct.

So the main calculation seems correct, leading to 6.24e-7 M, which is option A.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and use the provided equilibrium constants.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007334 \, \text{mol} \).  
  This dissociates into \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \) ions, so \( [\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-] = \frac{0.007334}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.03667 \, \text{M} \).

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005617 \, \text{mol} \).  
  This dissociates into \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \) ions, so \( [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] = \frac{0.005617}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.028085 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the solution
The solution is a buffer system involving \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \) (acid) and \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \) (base). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]} \right),
\]  
where \( K_a = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \) (for the second dissociation of \( \text{H}_3\text{PO}_4 \)), so \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207 \).  

The ratio \( \frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]} = \frac{0.028085}{0.03667} \approx 0.766 \). Substituting:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log(0.766) \approx 7.207 - 0.115 \approx 7.092.
\]  
Thus, \( [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.23 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \).

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of \( \text{PO}_4^{3-} \)
The third dissociation of \( \text{H}_3\text{PO}_4 \) is:  
\[
\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{PO}_4^{3-}, \quad K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}.
\]  
Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO}_4^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]},
\]  
we solve for \( [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{K_a \cdot [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}.
\]  
Substitute \( K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \), \( [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] = 0.028085 \, \text{M} \), and \( [\text{H}^+] = 8.23 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \):  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.028085)}{8.23 \times 10^{-8}} \approx \frac{5.0553 \times 10^{-14}}{8.23 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The concentration of orthophosphate ions is **6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M**, which corresponds to option **A**.

Answer: A
