Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me read the question again.

The question says: If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.

The options are A through D, each with a different formula involving k, q squared, R, d, and other terms. Right, potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to bring charges together. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact approach here.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with grounded conductors, the sphere is connected to the ground, which means it can have induced charges but the potential on the surface is zero. So the sphere's potential is zero because it's grounded. But how does that affect the potential energy?

I think about the setup. We have a charge q outside the sphere. The sphere being a conductor, the charges will redistribute. Since it's grounded, any induced charges on the sphere will adjust such that the surface is an equipotential at zero potential.

So the sphere will have an induced charge. How? Let's see, the charge q will induce a charge on the sphere. The sphere initially has zero net charge because it's neutral? Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, no, wait. The sphere is conducting and grounded, so any induced charges can flow in or out. So when we bring charge q near, the sphere will have an induced charge. But because the sphere is neutral, the induced charge would be opposite in sign. Or wait, no. The sphere can have a net charge? No, wait, when a charge is placed near a grounded conductor, the conductor's surface will have induced charges, but since it's grounded, the conductor can lose or gain electrons to maintain the grounding.

So in this case, if the charge q is positive, it would repel electrons to the far side of the sphere, making the near side positive and the far side negative. But since the sphere is grounded, the excess negative charge can flow to the ground, and positive can't leave (since grounding is usually about allowing negative charges to leave). Wait, no, actually, when a positive charge is brought near, the conductor's electrons (negative) will be attracted to the near side, increasing the negative charge there. But since the sphere is grounded, the excess electrons can leave the sphere through the ground. So the sphere will have a net negative charge? Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The sphere is neutral initially. When a charge q is placed near, the charges in the sphere redistribute. For a conducting sphere, the charges will be on the surface. The induced charges will be opposite to q on the near side and same as q on the far side? No, wait, no, that's for a non-conducting shell. Oh wait, no, for a conducting sphere, the induced charge is such that the field inside the conductor is zero. So the induced charges create an opposite field to the external field.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the grounded sphere as having an induced charge -q on its surface. Hmm, wait no. Let's think about image charges. For a conducting sphere, the potential on the surface is the same as the potential due to the charge and the induced charges. But since it's grounded, the potential
