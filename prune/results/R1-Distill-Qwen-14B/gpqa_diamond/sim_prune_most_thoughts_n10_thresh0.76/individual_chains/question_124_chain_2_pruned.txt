Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these relativity concepts. Let's see what the question is asking.

The setup: Particles are collided in the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls?

Hmm. So, the key here is probably the relationship between the particles' speed (or their Lorentz factor) and the time it takes for them to reach the detector walls. Since they're moving at relativistic speeds, time dilation and length contraction might come into play.

Wait, the detector is spherical with a radius of 30 meters. So, the particles are moving from the center to the edge, which is 30 meters away in the lab frame. But from the particle's frame, the distance might be contracted. Or wait, from the lab frame, the particle's speed is high, so the time it takes to reach the walls is t = distance / speed. But relativistic effects might change how we view the distance or the time.

Wait, another thought: The particles are moving at a certain speed, and if they decay before reaching the walls, we won't detect them. The problem states that about one third reach the walls when the Lorentz factor is 20. So, perhaps the particles have a certain proper lifetime, and their lifetime as observed in the lab frame determines whether they make it to the walls.

So, the proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau, because of time dilation. Gamma is the Lorentz factor here.

The time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by the speed. The speed is approximately c for ultra-relativistic particles, so v â‰ˆ c. So, t = R/(v) = 30 m / (c). Let me compute that. The speed of light is about 3e8 meters per second. So 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds. Wait, that's 0.1 nanoseconds. Hmm, that's a very short time. But the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, so their lifetime as seen in the lab frame must be longer than this time for them to reach the
