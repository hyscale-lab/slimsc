Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

Alright, the problem says we have 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So first, I need to figure out how much acid and base there is in total after mixing all these together.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So maybe I should calculate the moles of each acid and base, and see which is in excess.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each solution. Oh, right, moles equals concentration (M) multiplied by volume (L). But I need to convert the volumes from mL to liters first.

For CH3COOH: 500 mL is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's acetic acid, which is a monoprotic acid, each mole gives one mole of H+.

For HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, giving 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH- because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH^-. So moles of OH- would be 0.3 L * 0.3 M * 2 = 0.18 moles. Wait, actually, wait. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Each mole gives two hydroxide ions. So yes, 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, multiplied by 2 gives 0.18 moles OH-.

So now, total H+ comes from CH3COOH and HCl. Let's add those together: 0.05 (from CH3COOH) + 0.08 (from HCl) = 0.13 moles of H+.

The OH- is 0.18 moles. Now, when H+ and OH- react, they neutralize each other. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the H+ will neutralize as much OH- as possible, but which one is in excess?

Let's see: H+ is 0.13 moles, OH- is 0.18. So OH- is in excess by 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 moles. So the solution will be basic because there's excess OH-.

Now, the total volume of the solution is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Wait, but wait. Because when the strong base neutralizes the H+ from the strong acid and weak acid, we also need to consider if any H+ remains after neutralization. But in this case, all the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH is neutralized, but wait no. Let me think again. The H+ comes from both HCl and CH3COOH. Since HCl is a strong acid, it fully dissociates, so all its
