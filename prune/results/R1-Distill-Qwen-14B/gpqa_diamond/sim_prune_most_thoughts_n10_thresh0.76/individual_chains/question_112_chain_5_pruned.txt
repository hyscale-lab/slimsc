Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that we have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I remember that these are the standard basis states for spin-1/2 particles. So the state |up> has spin up along z, and |down> has spin down along z.

The question asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and zero otherwise. Hmm, wait, that sounds familiar. Let me think about matrix forms.

Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. What operator has this form? Oh right, the Pauli X operator multiplied by some factor. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply it by hbar/2, we get this matrix. So the operator in question is (hbar/2) * sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Now, the eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of this operator, because multiplying by a scalar doesn't change the eigenstates. So I need to find the eigenstates of sigma_x.

Wait, but the given state |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis. To find the probabilities, I think I need to express |alpha> in the basis of the eigenstates of the operator A. Because when you measure in a particular basis, the probabilities come from the square of the amplitudes in that basis.

Alternatively, another approach is to find the eigenvectors of A, express |alpha> in terms of those eigenvectors, and then the probabilities are the square of the coefficients.

So first, let's find the eigenstates of operator A.

Operator A is (hbar/2) * [[0,
