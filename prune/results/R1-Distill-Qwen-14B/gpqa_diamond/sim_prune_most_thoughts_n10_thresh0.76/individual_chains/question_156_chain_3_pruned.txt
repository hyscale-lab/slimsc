Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about two reactions involving mCPBA and oct-4-ene in both E and Z configurations. Then the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns. I need to figure out how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

First, I should remember what mCPBA does. Oh right, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide.

Wait, but wait, the reaction conditions also mention aqueous acid after treating with mCPBA. Oh right, that must be an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. So the initial step forms an epoxide, and then it's opened in acidic conditions.

Now, let's think about each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with one equivalent of mCPBA. Because mCPBA is a peracid, it adds across the double bond to form an epoxide. The E and Z configuration of the starting alkene will influence the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, no, wait. For epoxidation, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the epoxide's stereochemistry. If the starting alkene is E, the two new oxygen atoms add in a way that depends on the geometry. So an E-alkene (trans) would form an epoxide where the two new oxygen groups are on opposite sides.

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. When mCPBA adds to a double bond, it's a peracid doing an epoxidation. The mechanism is a concerted addition, so the peracid's oxygen attacks the double bond. The reaction is stereospecific, meaning the configuration of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide will be trans? Or cis?

Wait, wait, I think that the epoxidation of a trans (E) alkene leads to a trans epoxide, and a cis (Z) alkene leads to a cis epoxide. Or maybe it's the opposite. Hmm. No, wait, I think that's correct. Because in the epoxidation, the two new oxygen atoms add to the same face of the double bond. So, if the starting alkene is E (trans), the two substituents on each carbon are on opposite sides. Adding the two oxygen atoms from the same face would lead the oxygen atoms to end up on the same side of each adjacent carbon. So, for E-alkene, the substituents on each carbon are opposite, so the epoxide would have the oxygen atoms on opposite sides, making it trans. Wait, maybe I should draw this mentally.

Wait, actually, I think that the configuration of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. For a trans (E) starting alkene, the epoxide will have the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides of the ring, making it a trans epoxide. Similarly, a cis starting alkene (Z) will form a cis epoxide.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm getting that backwards. Let me think again. The addition of the peracid to the double bond occurs from the same face (since the peracid adds across the double bond in a syn addition). So for a trans (E) double bond, the two substituents on each end of the double bond are on opposite sides. When the peracid adds, the oxygen comes from the same face. So, the epoxide will have the two new oxygen groups on opposite faces of the ring. Hmm, maybe that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide's configuration is a result of the starting alkene's geometry.

Alternatively, perhaps the stereospecific addition leads to retention of the double bond geometry in the epoxide. So, if the double bond is E, the epoxide is trans (i.e., the substituents are on opposite sides). Similarly
