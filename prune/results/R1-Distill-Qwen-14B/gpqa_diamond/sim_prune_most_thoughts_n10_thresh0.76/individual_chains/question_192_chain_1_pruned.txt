Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity of radius r, and the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The conductor is uncharged, so initially, it has no net charge. Then, a small amount of positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity.

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and l is its distance from the cavity's center. Also, l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options given are A to D, each with different expressions involving these variables.

Alright, I remember that when a conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges reside on the surface. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, placing a charge inside the cavity would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, right. The inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge of -q because the conductor is a conductor and the charges would move to the inner surface to cancel the field inside the conductor. But since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is initially neutral. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q so that the total charge remains zero (since the conductor's net charge is zero overall). Or wait, that's only if the conductor is isolated. Wait, no, in this case, the conductor is just neutral, but when you put +q inside, the inner surface gets -q, and to keep the conductor's net charge zero, the outer surface must have +q. So the conductor's outer surface has +q.

But wait, the conductor is uncharged, and when you put +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface gets -q, and the outer surface must have +q to make the conductor's net charge zero. Or wait, no: the conductor is neutral,
