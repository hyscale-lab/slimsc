Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through step by step. 

The question is about identifying compound X based on the NMR data of the product after a reaction. The reaction uses 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, wait, what's that reagent? Oh right, that's a known ring-opening agent for epoxides. It's used in the ring-opening of epoxides, especially in what's called the "epoxide ring-opening reaction." So the product here is probably the result of the epoxide opening.

So the starting material is compound X, which when treated with this reagent forms a product. The NMR data given is for the product. Wait, no, wait—the question says the theoretical NMR is for the resulting product. So what's the product? Oh, right, because X is reacting with the ring-opening agent. So X must be an epoxide, right? Because that's what typically reacts with such a reagent.

Wait, no, wait: Wait, actually, the product would be the ring-opened form. So the starting material is an epoxide, and the product after reaction is some diol? Because when an epoxide opens, it usually forms a diol. But wait, the NMR data doesn't show any OH groups. Hmm, maybe the solvent is nonpolar, but in the reaction, after opening, perhaps the diol is formed, or maybe it's a different kind of product. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't an epoxide opening... Wait, what else does that reagent do? I think it's used for epoxide ring-opening, but perhaps under certain conditions it can also do something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't ring-opening but something else. Wait, but I think in this case, the product is the ring-opened diol.

Wait, but the NMR data doesn't show any broad peaks that would indicate OH groups. So maybe the diol has been protonated or is in a different form. Or perhaps the reaction doesn't involve OH groups. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I'm thinking in the wrong direction. Let me look at the NMR data again.

The 1H NMR: The signals are δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So that's six signals in the aromatic region, two singlets for the methyl groups, and one doublet around 6.75. Let me break it down.

First, the aromatic region: 6.75 is a doublet, 7.08 is a 2H doublet, 7.68 is another doublet, and 7.71 is a 2H doublet. So maybe some coupling between these aromatic protons. Let me try to imagine the structure.

If there's a substituent on a benzene ring, perhaps a substituent that causes the ring to split into a pattern of doublets. Wait, but it's the product after the reaction. If the starting material was an epoxide, then the product might be a diol. But where would the diol be in the molecule?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is not a diol but the result of a different kind of reaction. Wait, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is also known as a catalyst for some reactions, like in the opening of epoxides, or as a base. Wait, perhaps in this case, the reaction is a ring-opening of the epoxide to form something else.

Wait, let's think about the given options. The options are all different epoxides, so X is an epoxide, and the reaction is ring-opening, so the product is the diol. But the product
