Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through this step by step. 

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis means breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds, right? So, the catalyst helps the alkene rearrange.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But since the molecule is symmetric, maybe the enantiomers are actually the same? Let me think. 3-methylpent-1-ene has the structure CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, wait, pent-1-ene has five carbons, with the double bond starting at carbon 1. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait no, wait 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me draw it.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. 3-methyl would add a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that can't be right because the chain is five carbons. Let's count: Carbon 1 (double bond), carbon 2, carbon 3 (with CH3), then carbons 4 and 5. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Because 3-methyl would be the third carbon from the start. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So positions are 1 (CH2=), 2 (CH-), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3). So yeah, that's the structure.

But since it's racemic, it's a 50-50 mix of the two enantiomers. But wait, is
