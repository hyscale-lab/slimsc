Okay, so I have this science problem in front of me. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it.

The question is about a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. The researcher introduced a coding sequence that includes a single influenza hemagglutinin (HA) determinant at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. They looked at the DNA sequence of the plus strand and found a problem. The options suggest possible reasons.

First, let me understand the setup. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so it's probably at the beginning of the coding sequence. HA tags are often used for immunoprecipitation, so maybe that's why they added it here. They want to purify the GADD45G protein along with its binding partners after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The issue is that the construct isn't overexpressing the protein. So, I need to look at the sequence provided and find a problem. Let's look at the sequence.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Then, the next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, but HA is a specific sequence. HA is the hemagglutinin from the influenza virus. Its coding sequence is known, so perhaps the HA sequence is not correctly present.

But wait, the first part of the sequence after ATG is TAC. Let me think: the HA tag is supposed to be added at the N-terminus. The HA coding sequence is usually something like ATG TAC CAA GAA GAA GAA etc., but I'm not exactly sure. Let me think: the HA tag is part of the HA protein from the influenza virus. Its amino acid sequence is D Y Y L (something). So the DNA sequence for HA would start after the ATG, maybe.

Wait, the given sequence starts with ATG, then TAC. So the first amino acid after the start is ty
