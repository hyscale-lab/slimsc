Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, let's see. The question is about figuring out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Both systems are binary stars, meaning they each have two stars orbiting around each other.

Wait, the problem gives me some data. Let me read it again. So, system_1 has a period of 2 years between eclipses, and system_2 has a period of 1 year. The radial velocity (RV) variations for system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s for the two stars. For system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s.

I remember that in binary star systems, the stars orbit their common center of mass. The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shifts of the stars' spectra as they move towards and away from us. The amplitude of these shifts depends on the mass of the other star and the orbital period.

Oh right! The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for each star is related to the mass of the other star. The formula I think is K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) )

Wait, but since both stars orbit the center of mass, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So the more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude. That makes sense because the heavier object would move less.

So, if K1 and K2 are the RV amplitudes of the two stars in a system, then K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2, right? Because M1 is bigger, K1 is smaller, so they balance each other out.

Wait, wait, let me think. In a binary system, the masses are inversely proportional to their velocities. So M1/M2 = v2/v1. Or is it M1/M2 = K2/K1?

Hmm. Let's think about it. Since the center of mass is the balance point, M1 * R1 = M2 * R2, where R is the distance from the center. The velocities are proportional to R because they're moving in circular orbits (assuming), so v = 2πR/P. So v1 = (2π R1)/P and v2 = (2π R2)/P.

So M1 R1 = M2 R2 → M1/M2 = R2/R1. But v1 = 2π R1 / P and v2 = 2π R2 / P. So v1/v2 = R1/R2 = M2/M1. So v1 = (M2/M1) v2.

Wait, but in the radial velocity measurements, each star's velocity is measured. So if one star has a velocity amplitude K1 and the other K2, then K1/K2 = M2/M1.

Yes, that's right. So K1 = (M2/M1) * K2.

So the ratio of the masses M1/M2 = K2 / K1.

But wait, what are K1 and K2 in each system?

In system_1, the RV
