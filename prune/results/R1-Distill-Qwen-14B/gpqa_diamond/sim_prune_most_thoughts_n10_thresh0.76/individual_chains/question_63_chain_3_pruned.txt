Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that the non-rigid rotor model is an extension of the rigid rotor, allowing for some stretching. But wait, the question is about the molecule being in its fundamental state and what photon momentum is needed for it to switch to the next state with the lowest energy.

Let me think. The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, right? So the molecule is in the ground state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would probably be the next higher energy level. But wait, in quantum mechanics, for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are quantized and depend on both rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model. Oh, that's the Morse potential model, I think. So the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. But I'm not entirely sure how the transitions work here.

Wait, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to a higher energy state. The photon's energy must match the energy difference between the initial and final states. But the question is specifically about the momentum of the photon. Oh, because momentum is related to the energy and frequency of the photon.

So first, I need to find the energy difference between the initial and final state. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be the next state possible. But wait, for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are quantized as a sum of rotational and vibrational contributions. But which one contributes more
