Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Let me go through it step by step. 

So, Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a very high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, like below 1e-9 Torr. The idea is to get rid of as many gas molecules as possible to improve the electron microscopy because fewer gas particles mean less scattering of electrons, right?

But even after doing that, some gas particles are still there. They detected that with a mass spectrometer. So Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I think. It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment.

Then when he starts the electron beam, he notices something odd. The mean free path changes. It's now λ2 instead of λ1. But the temperature hasn't changed, so that shouldn't affect it. Hmm, why would the mean free path change?

Wait, mean free path formula. I remember that the mean free path, λ, is given by λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. But wait, another formula I've heard is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as λ = (1) / (sqrt(2)*π*n*d^2), where n is the number density. 

Wait, because pressure P is related to number density n via the ideal gas law: P = n*k*T. So substituting that in, λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d^2*(n*k*T)) ) → 1/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2 n). So λ is inversely proportional to the number density n.

But in this scenario, Mike is using a vacuum pump to reach a certain pressure. But when he turns on the electron beam, maybe something changes. Oh wait, the electron beam could be ionizing the gas molecules. If the gas gets ionized, the ions might have a different effect on the electron beam. But how does that affect the gas molecules' mean free path?

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is active, it causes the gas to become partially ionized. Because the electron beam has high energy, especially at 1000 kV, which is a very high voltage. So the electrons are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, and they can knock electrons off the gas molecules, creating ions.

Wait, if the gas is getting ionized, the mean free path would change. Because when the gas is ionized, the collision processes change. For example, if ions are present, their cross-sections for scattering electrons might be different. Or, in terms of the gas molecules themselves, being ionized might change the effective diameter or how they interact.

Wait, but the mean free path is about how often the gas molecules collide with each other. Oh wait, no, the mean free path is
