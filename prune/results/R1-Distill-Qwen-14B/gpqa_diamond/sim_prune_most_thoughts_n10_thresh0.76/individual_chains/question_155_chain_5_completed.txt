Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty principle involves the expectation values of the operator and its square. So the formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Right.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector given is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So I need to compute the expectation value of P_z and P_z squared.

Wait, but wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state given is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That might simplify things because in that basis, P_z is diagonal. Let me think, if the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, then each component of the state corresponds to an eigenvalue. So the state |ψ> can be written as a linear combination of these eigenvectors.

So the matrix P_z is diagonal with elements ħ, 0, -ħ on the diagonal. Because eigenvectors as basis vectors mean that P_z is diagonal in this basis. So the diagonal entries are the eigenvalues. So P_z |i> = (eigenvalue_i) |i> where |i> is the basis vector in position i.

So the state is a column vector with components a, b, c: a=-1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

Wait, in this basis, each component of the state vector corresponds to a coefficient in front of each eigenvector. So the state can be written as a linear combination: ψ = a |1> + b |2> + c |3>. 

Since each |i> is an eigenstate of P_z with eigenvalue p_i, then the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of |a|^2 p_1 + |b|^2 p_2 + |c|^2 p_3.

Wait, no, wait. Because in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value <P_z> is simply the sum of the probabilities (mod squares of the coefficients) multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. So that's because each state |i> is an eigenstate, so when you measure P_z, you get p_i with probability |<i|ψ>|².

So the state vector components are a, b, c. So the probabilities are |a|², |b|², |c|².

So first, calculate |a|², |b|², |c|².

a = -1/2, so |a|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

b = 1/√2, so |b|² is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

c = -1/2, so |c|² is again 1/4.

Now, the eigenvalues of P_z are given by the diagonal of its matrix. Looking back, P_z matrix is:
[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ for the three basis vectors.

So the expectation value <P_z> is:

(1/4)* ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) 

Let's compute this:

(1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ = 0. So <P_z> is zero.

Next, compute <P_z²>. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared will be the squares of the eigenvalues on the diagonal.

So P_z² matrix is:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, ( -ħ )^2 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ ħ², 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, ħ² ]

So the eigenvalues are ħ², 0, ħ².

So <P_z²> is the sum of |a|² * (ħ²) + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * (ħ²).

Plugging in the values:

(1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)* ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4)ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, compute ΔP_z:

sqrt( <P_z²> - (<P_z>)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

So the uncertainty is ħ over square root of 2. Looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2. So the answer should be B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value of $P_z$ ($\langle P_z \rangle$)
The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state vector is given as:

\[
\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the diagonal entries of the $P_z$ matrix. The coefficients of the state vector represent the probabilities of the system being in each eigenstate of $P_z$. The probabilities are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

The expectation value of $P_z$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of $P_z^2$ ($\langle P_z^2 \rangle$)
The matrix $P_z^2$ is diagonal with entries $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value of $P_z^2$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for the uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**B) $\hbar/\sqrt{2}$**

Answer: B
