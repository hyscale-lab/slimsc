Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. I need to figure out which sequence of reactions does that.

First, I should draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are such that tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at 1, and nitro at 3. Wait, numbering might be important here. Alternatively, maybe the numbering is such that the substituents are in specific positions relative to each other. Let me think about the numbering: if ethoxy is at 1 (ortho to position 2), then nitro at 3 would be meta to ethoxy. Hmm, or maybe the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3 in a way that's 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro. That makes sense.

So, the substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions. But wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering can vary depending on which substituent you start with. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3 in a specific order. So the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3.

To get these substituents in the correct positions, I need to plan the order of reactions. Benzene can undergo electrophilic substitution, and each substituent will direct the incoming group based on their nature.

Let me think about the directing effects. The nitro group is a meta director, tert-butyl is a strong activating group (since it's an alkyl group) and ortho/para directing. Ethoxy is an activating group as well, since it's an electron-donating group, and it's ortho/para directing.

Wait, but the order of adding substituents matters because each new substituent affects where the next one will go. So I need to decide in which order to add these groups
