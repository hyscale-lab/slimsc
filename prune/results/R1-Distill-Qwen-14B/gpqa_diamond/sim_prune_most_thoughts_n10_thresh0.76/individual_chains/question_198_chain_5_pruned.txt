Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the stability of cobalt complexes with thiocyanate ions, specifically finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex.

Let me read the question again. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are [Co] = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are given as beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^n+ or maybe a different number. Wait, wait. The options are about the percentage of the blue complex among all cobalt species.

Hmm, stability constants. Right, stability constant (formation constant) tells us how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable. So the complexes form stepwise, right? Each β represents the formation from the previous complex.

The species present would be Co²+ and various complexes: Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, etc., up to Co(SCN)_4, I suppose, since there are four β values. Wait, no, each β is for adding each SCN- step. So the complexes would be:

Co²+ (free ion)
Co(SCN)²+ (n=1)
Co(SCN)₂³+ (n=2)
Co(SCN)₃⁴+ (n=3)
Co(SCN)₄^5+ (n=4)

Wait, no, I think the charge depends on the number of SCN- added. SCN- is a monodentate ligand, so each adds a negative charge. So Co²+ plus n SCN- would be Co(SCN)_n^(2-n). Wait, no, because Co²+ is +2. Each SCN- is -, so for n SCN-, the charge is 2 - n.

So for n=1, it's Co(SCN)²+ → charge +2-1=+1? Wait, no, wait. Wait, Co²+ has +2 charge. Each SCN- has -1. So when you have n SCN- attached, the complex charge is 2 - n
