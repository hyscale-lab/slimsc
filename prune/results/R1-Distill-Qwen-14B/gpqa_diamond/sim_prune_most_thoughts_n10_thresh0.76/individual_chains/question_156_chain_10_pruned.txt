Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a chemist performs two reactions using mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The starting materials are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Then, the products are combined and run on both a standard (achiral) HPLC and a chiral HPLC. I need to determine what the chemist observes in each chromatogram.

Hmm, right. mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. I remember that mCPBA is a peracid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So when alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides. But wait, what about the stereochemistry here?

Wait, the reactions are with one equivalent of mCPBA, and then aqueous acid. Oh, right, epoxidation is the first step. Then, perhaps acid-catalyzed ring opening? But wait, no, in the problem statement, each reaction goes to 100% completion. So what's the next step?

Wait, when epoxides are treated with aqueous acid, they usually go through an acid-catalyzed ring-opening. Let's think about that. The acid would protonate the oxygen in the epoxide, making it more electrophilic. Then, water (or another nucleophile) attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized when the leaving group leaves.

Wait, but wait. The initial reaction is between mCPBA and the alkene. mCPBA adds across the double bond, leading to an epoxide. Then, in aqueous acid, the epoxide ring opens. So each reaction starts with an epoxide formation and then ring-opening.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the specifics. Let me think again. So the first step is epoxidation, which is a syn addition. So the configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. So (E) has the two substituents on opposite sides, and (Z) has them on the same side. When mCPBA adds to each, it adds an oxygen across the double bond in a syn fashion, creating
