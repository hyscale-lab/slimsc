Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think carefully.

The question is about three genes G1, G2, and G3 in white lupine plants. They're looking for genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose. They made mutants where each gene is knocked out (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The results are about how resistant each mutant is compared to the wild type.

The setup says that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, I'm thinking that a transcription factor would regulate the expression of other genes. Transcription factors are usually upstream in a pathway, activating or repressing other genes.

The resistance levels are given as percentages of the control (wild type). The wild type has 100% resistance, meaning it's resistant. Lower percentages mean more susceptibility.

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% → less resistant than wild type but not completely susceptible. So, knocking out G1 reduces resistance.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible. So, without G2, no resistance. That suggests G2 is essential for resistance.
- g3: 50% → so some resistance lost, but not as bad as g1.
- The double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% → very susceptible. Worse than either single mutant.
  - g2g3: 0% → same as g2 alone. So, when both g2 and g3 are knocked out, it's as bad as g2 alone.
  - g1g2: 0% → same as g2 alone. So, when g1 and g2 are both out, it's as susceptible as when just g2 is out.

Hmm, so what does this mean? Let me think about possible interactions.

First, G2 seems critical because when it's knocked out (g2), resistance drops to 0%. So G2 might be a key gene, perhaps the transcription factor, since it's upstream.

Wait, but the problem states that at least one is a transcription factor. If G2 is the transcription factor, then it probably activates other genes, like G1 and G3. But looking at the data, when G2 is KO'd, the resistance is 0%, but in the double mutants, sometimes the resistance is still 0%, which might suggest that G2 is upstream.

But looking at the double mutants:

In g1g2 (both knocked out), resistance is 0%. But when only g2 is knocked out, it's also 0%. So the presence of g1 doesn't help when g2 is KO'd. So perhaps G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

Wait, but when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, which is lower than wild type but not zero. So G1 isn't as crucial as G2. G3, when knocked out, gives 50% resistance.

Now, the double mutant g2g3 has 0% resistance, same as g2 alone. So knocking out both G2 and G3 doesn't make it worse than just G2 alone. Hmm. That might suggest that G3 is downstream of G2. Because if G3 is downstream, then when G2 is already knocked out, G3's function isn't contributing anything. So the effect of knocking out G2 and G3 is the same as just G2.

Similarly, in the g1g2 double mutant, the resistance is 0%, same as g2 alone. So knocking out G1 when G2 is already knocked out doesn't change the outcome. So G1's function must be dependent on G2. So G2 is upstream of G1.

Wait, but when G1 is
