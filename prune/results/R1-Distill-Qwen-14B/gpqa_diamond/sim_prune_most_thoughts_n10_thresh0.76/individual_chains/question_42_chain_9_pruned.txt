Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup is that we have three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure how that affects this problem—maybe it's just context.

The question gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 are in a ratio of about 1.4. So Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times Planet2's. Then, between Planet2 and Planet3, the temperature ratio is about 2.3. So Planet2 is 2.3 times hotter than Planet3, or is it the other way around? Wait, the ratio is Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4, so Planet1 is hotter than Planet2? Or is it the other way? Hmm. Wait, equilibrium temperature is given by T = T_star * ( (L star) / (16πσ a²) )^0.25, but I think the formula I remember is T = T_eff * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but perhaps I should think about the inverse square law for flux. Or maybe use the formula where T² is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²)) ?

Wait, equilibrium temperature is often given by the formula T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) , but I think I might have that wrong. Alternatively, the formula I've seen is T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25 / ( ... something? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis, assuming the star's luminosity and other factors are constant.

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature (Te) is generally given by:

Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )

Assuming no greenhouse effect and a circular orbit. Since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), that factor is the same for all. So the albedo doesn't affect the ratio between the planets.

So the ratio of their temperatures should be related to the square root of the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes.

Wait, let's think about the formula again. The equilibrium temperature is proportional to ( (L / (16πσ))^(1/4) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) ) / (2a)^(1/2) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the formula for equilibrium temperature as:

Te = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ a^2) ]^(1/4 )

But wait, L is the star's luminosity, which is same for all planets. So for two planets, say planet i and j, their Te ratio is:

Te_i / Te_j = [ ( (L (1 - a_i) ) / (16
