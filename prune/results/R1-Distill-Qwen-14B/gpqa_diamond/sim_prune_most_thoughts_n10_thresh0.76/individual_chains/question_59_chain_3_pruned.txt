Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations, especially when multiple acids and bases are involved. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, right. So, I think I should first figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture because when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely as well. Oh right, so I need to calculate the moles contributed by each solution.

Let me calculate the moles for each component first.

Starting with CH3COOH: the volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M, so moles = Molarity Ã— Volume. That's 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

Then, HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L. 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it donates H+ ions, so 0.08 moles of H+.

Next, Ba(OH)2: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Barium hydroxide has two OH- ions per formula unit. So, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. That's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait a second. When you mix an acid and a base, they'll react. The OH- from the base will neutralize H+ from the acids. So I should calculate the net H+ or OH- after this neutralization.

Let me sum up the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH. Oh wait, wait. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't contribute as much H+ as a strong acid. But when calculating the neutralization with OH-, I think I should consider all H+ available, including that from the weak acid. Or maybe I should consider the initial H+ only from the strong acids for the neutralization, then the weak acid's H+ comes into play after. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it as follows: first, calculate all the H+ and OH- in the solution before mixing. Then, determine if there's an excess of acid or base. Because any excess would affect the pH.

So, the
