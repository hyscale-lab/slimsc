Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The setup is about a light beam propagating through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is about finding the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Hmm, right. I remember that when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed changes. The formula I remember is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's the speed of light in the medium when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. In this case, the glass is moving, so I think I need to consider the motion of the medium as well.

So, the glass is moving at velocity v. Since it's moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is towards the observer, the light's speed relative to the observer might be different because of this motion. Wait, but how do I combine the speed of the medium and the speed of light within it?

I think I should use the concept of relative velocity here. Oh right, when objects are moving relative to each other, velocities add up in a certain way. But wait, light is a bit tricky because its speed doesn't just add like a regular object's. Because according to Einstein's theory, the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. Oh wait, but that's in a vacuum. What about in a moving medium?

Wait, the medium here is moving, so maybe it's a case of adding velocities with special relativity considerations. Or maybe not, since the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties, which are themselves moving.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in the rest frame of the glass. In that frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n towards the observer. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So how do these combine?

Wait, no. Let me clarify the frames. The lab frame is the observer's frame. The glass is moving at speed v in the lab frame. Inside the glass, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer.

Wait, but the direction is important. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass
