Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions with two unknown compounds, treating each with different reducing agents. The products are both (R) and (S) forms of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The task is to determine the starting materials A and B from the given options.

Hmm. So, the reactions are:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

Wait, I remember that LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Or wait, no, maybe the other way around. BH3 is usually used in the BH3-THF complex, which is a milder reducing agent. LiBH4 is stronger, right? So when you reduce ketones, maybe the conditions affect the product in some way.

Wait, but wait a second. Both reactions are producing a ketone, but with different stereochemistry. Wait, but wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Oh, I think I need to think about what kind of starting material would form this product upon reduction.

Wait, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. The 2H suggests that it's partially hydrogenated. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds? No, wait, tetrahydro-2H-pyran would mean that it's a five-membered ring? No, wait, no. Pyran is six-membered. So, tetrahydro-2H-pyran would have four hydrogen atoms? Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's a partially saturated ring. Let me think: pyran is like a six-membered ring, five carbons and one oxygen, with one double bond in the 2H position. So, the structure would be a ring where the oxygen is at position 2, and the ring has two double bonds? Or perhaps the ring is partially hydrogenated, so maybe it's a cyclic hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone. Oh, wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ketone is at position 2. So, the ring has a ketone group at C2, and an ethyl group at C4. So, the ring is tetrahydro, which suggests that most of the double bonds are hydrogenated, but perhaps one remains.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an epoxide or some kind of cyclic ester. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone that's undergoing some kind of ring-opening or reduction.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diketone or an ester. Wait, but the product is a ketone in a ring. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck on that. Let me think about the reagents. LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for reducing esters, ketones, aldehydes. BH3 is used in the formation of alcohols from ketones via the borane method, but wait, I'm not sure. Wait, BH3 (usually as BH3-THF) is used for hydroboration. Oh wait, wait, no. LiBH4 is a borohydride, used for reducing carbonyl groups to alcohols. Oh, wait, but wait: when you reduce a ketone, you get a secondary alcohol. So if the product is a ketone, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone. So, perhaps the starting material is an ester or a cyclic ester that upon reduction forms a ketone.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. If the product is an alcohol, then the reagent would be a reducing agent. But the product here is a ketone. Hmm. No, wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. When you reduce a lactone, what happens? Well, lactones are cyclic esters. Reduction of a lactone would typically break the ester into an alcohol. Wait, but the product here is a ketone, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone with another substituent. For example, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone with an epoxide group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the reactions. The product in both cases is the same structure but different stereoisomers. So, the product must be a chiral center. Looking at the product: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The substituents would be on the ring. Wait, the molecule has a ring, and the ethyl group is at position 4, and the ketone is at position 2. The ring is a five-membered? No, it's actually a six-membered ring because pyran is six-membered. So, perhaps the ring is a tetrahydrofuran analog but with a larger ring.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexanol derivative, but with a ketone group. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic hemiacetal, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a hemiacetal or a ketal. Wait, but if you reduce a ketal, perhaps you get something else. Hmm. Maybe the starting material is an ester or a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the stereochemistry here. The product has (R) and (S) configurations. So, the starting materials must have some stereochemistry that affects the product's configuration.

Wait, if the starting material is a ketone, then when it's reduced, perhaps it forms an alcohol, but that doesn't make sense because the product is a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a secondary alcohol that's oxidized to a ketone. But in this case, the problem says the chemist is performing a reduction, so the starting material is being reduced to form the product. Oh wait, no. Wait, wait: if the product is a ketone and the reagent is a reducing agent, that doesn't fit because ketones are usually reduced, not oxidized. Wait, that's confusing. So, perhaps the starting material is an ester which upon reduction gives a ketone? Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think about the reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with another functional group that, upon reduction, forms a new ring. Maybe the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, and when it's reduced, it forms a diol, but that doesn't explain the ketone.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options given. The options are for A and B, which are different starting materials leading to (R) and (S) products when treated with LiBH4 and BH3 respectively.

Looking at the options, each option gives A and B as either (S) or (R) forms of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, that's interesting. So, both A and B are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, but their configuration is either S or R.

Wait, so the starting materials are (R) or (S) forms of this pentanoic acid derivative. Let me draw the structure of that.

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the structure is a pentanoic acid (5 carbons) with a carboxylic acid group at the end. The substituents: at position 3, an ethyl group; at position 5, an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo) group.

So, the structure would be:

CH2(COOH)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(OCH(CH2CH3)2)-CH2-O-(something?) Wait, no. Wait, 5-isobutoxy would be at position 5, but pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, maybe I should count the positions.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but more accurately, it's CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So, the positions are 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH2), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3). Wait, no, wait. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the chain is 5 carbons, with the COOH at the end. So, the positions are 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH2), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3).

Wait, but in the compound, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5.

So, position 3 has an ethyl group (CH2CH2CH3?), and position 5 has an isobutoxy group and an oxo group.

Wait, but wait, position 5 is the last carbon before the COOH. So, the structure would be:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH(CH2CH3)

Position 4: C(OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Let me try to write the structure.

The molecule is pentanoic acid, so:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH2CH3) - C(=O) - OCH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, maybe not. Wait, position 5 is the fifth carbon, but in a five-carbon chain, the fifth carbon is the methyl group in pentanoic acid (CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH). So, maybe the substituents are at the 3rd and 5th positions.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O)-OCH(CH2CH3)2 ?

But wait, that would make it a six-membered structure? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, that would mean that the pentanoic acid has a ketone group at position 5, which is possible only if it's a cyclic structure. Wait, no, because position 5 is the end of the chain. So, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. So, the pentanoic acid would have an ester linkage, making a five-membered ring. But wait, the formula given is for a pentanoic acid, so maybe it's not a lactone.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH3) - C(O) - OCH(CH2CH3)2

Wait, but that would make the molecule have a ketone at position 4, but that's getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

CH2(COOH) - CH(CH2CH2CH3) - C(O) - OCH(CH2CH3)2

Wait, that would make it a four-carbon chain, but perhaps I'm not visualizing it correctly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the reaction. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the product is a six-membered ring with an ethyl group at position 4 and a ketone at position 2. So, the ring is a pyran derivative with two double bonds? Or maybe one double bond?

Wait, but the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) that upon reduction gives the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or a cyclic acetal. When you reduce an acetal, you might break the ring and form an alcohol, but that doesn't fit with the product being a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with another substituent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material is an ester, and upon reduction, it forms the ketone in the ring. For example, if the starting material is a lactone (cyclic ester), then reducing it would break the ester into an alcohol, but that doesn't give a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different kind of structure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about the reaction conditions. The first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+, which is a strong reducing agent. The second uses BH3 and H+. Wait, perhaps the reagents are different in terms of the mechanism or what they're reducing.

Wait, LiBH4 is typically used to reduce esters to the corresponding alcohols, so if the starting material is an ester, LiBH4 would reduce it to a diol, perhaps. But the product is a ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone ester. For example, a ketone with an ester group. If you reduce that, perhaps you get a secondary alcohol and the ester is also reduced. But I'm not sure if that leads to the product given.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone. For example, perhaps it's a cyclic ether like an epoxide, but that doesn't directly lead to a ketone upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry of the product. The product is formed with R or S configuration, depending on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent used.

Wait, if the starting material is a chiral ketone, then reduction with a chiral reducing agent could lead to a specific stereochemistry in the product. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with a chiral center, and the reducing agent (BH3 or LiBH4) would cause a specific stereochemical outcome. Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically doesn't provide chiral centers unless the starting material is prochiral. So, perhaps the starting material is a prochiral ketone, and the reduction leads to a specific configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reduction leads to a secondary alcohol, but the product is a ketone, which doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the possible products. The product is a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. So, perhaps the starting material is a pentose derivative, but that's just a wild guess.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is a hemiacetal or acetal. When reduced, the hemiacetal would open up and form a diol, but if the starting material is a cyclic ketone, perhaps the reduction would form a secondary alcohol.

Wait, wait a minute. If the product is a cyclic ketone, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), and the reduction leads to a diol, which then rearranges to form the ketone. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone. When reduced, the acetal opens, and the ketone is formed. But then, it would need the right conditions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible starting materials based on the options given. All options for A and B are (R) or (S) forms of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the starting material is a pentanoic acid with substituents at positions 3 and 5. It has a ketone at position 5 and an isobutoxy group at position 5 as well. Wait, wait, that can't be correct because you can't have two groups on the same carbon unless it's a branched structure.

Wait, the structure is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So carbon 5 has both an isobutoxy group and an oxo (ketone) group. But that would mean that carbon 5 has two substituents: an OCH(CH2CH3)2 group and a ketone (C=O), which is possible if the structure is such that the same carbon is connected to both groups.

So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O)-OCH(CH2CH3)2

Wait, that would make the carbon at position 4 having the ketone group and an oxygen substituent. Wait, but the formula is 5-isobutoxy-5-oxo, meaning both substituents are on carbon 5.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O)-OCH(CH2CH3)2

Wait, but then the carbonyl is on carbon 4, not 5. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which upon reduction forms a diol and then cyclizes to form the ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material is an ester, and when reduced, it forms a diol, which then undergoes some kind of cyclization to form the pyranone.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about what LiBH4 and BH3 do. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols. BH3 is a milder reducing agent, often used in the hydroboration-oxidation of alkenes to form alcohols with anti-Markovnikov addition.

Wait, but in this case, the products are ketones, not alcohols. So maybe that's not the case. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reagents are not reducing carbonyl groups but are instead involved in some kind of ring-forming reaction. For example, the formation of an epoxide or another ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone and the reaction leads to a ring formation, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the stereochemistry again. The product is either R or S, depending on the starting material and the reducing agent.

If A is treated with LiBH4 and yields (R), and B is treated with BH3 and yields (S), then perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product.

Wait, but what reaction leads to the product being a ketone from a starting material with a certain configuration?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, which when reduced with LiBH4 or BH3, opens the ring and forms a diol, which then forms the pyranone structure with the correct stereochemistry.

Wait, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl ester, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol, which then undergoes cyclization upon acid workup to form the pyranone.

Wait, let's imagine that the starting material is a diethyl ester of a ketone. Let's say that after reduction, you get a diol, which then forms a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diketone ester that upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a ketone group. When this is reduced, the ester part breaks, and then the molecule rearranges to form the pyranone.

Hmm, but I'm not getting anywhere with this.

Wait, another thought: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring has six members. The substituents are ethyl at position 4 and a ketone at position 2.

So, the ring is:

Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Oxygen is probably at position 6, making it a tetrahydropyran.

So, the structure would be:

O is at position 6. Then, position 2 is the ketone group (so C=O), and position 4 has an ethyl group.

So, the ring is:

1: CH2-

2: C=O

3: CH2-

4: CH(CH2CH2CH3)

5: CH2-

6: O

So, the ring is a six-membered ring with the oxygen at position 6, ketone at 2, and ethyl at 4.

Now, how does this form from a starting material?

If the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative, perhaps it undergoes some kind of cyclization upon reduction.

Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, that's a five-carbon chain with COOH at one end, ethyl at position 3, and at position 5, both an isobutoxy group and a ketone.

So, structure:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O)-OCH(CH2CH3)2

Wait, but that would make the chain five carbons. So, positions 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH(CH2CH3)), 4 (C(O)), and 5 (OCH(CH2CH3)2).

Wait, perhaps this structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a substituent that allows for ring formation upon reduction.

Wait, when LiBH4 or BH3 is used, perhaps the ester group is reduced to an alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the six-membered ring with the ketone.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a ketone, and upon reduction, the ester is opened and the molecule cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. When reduced, the ester is converted to an alcohol, and the β-keto group remains, which then undergoes cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a β-hydroxy ester, which then eliminates water to form an enol, and then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

Hmm, that's a possibility. Let me think.

So, the starting material is a β-keto ester: RCO-COR'.

When LiBH4 reduces the ester group, it would reduce it to a primary alcohol. So, the ester would become RCH2-OH.

Wait, but β-keto esters upon reduction with LiBH4 would reduce the ester group to an alcohol, but the ketone group would remain.

Wait, for example, if the starting material is CH3CO-CO-OEt, LiBH4 would reduce the ester to CH3CO-CH2-OH, but the ketone would remain, leading to CH3CO-CH2-OH.

Wait, but that doesn't directly help.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a γ-keto ester. Then, when reduced, the ester becomes an alcohol, and the ketone remains.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, it forms a β-hydroxy ester, which can undergo cyclization.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the connection to the product structure.

Another approach: perhaps the starting material's structure allows for the formation of the six-membered ring upon reduction.

So, the starting material has groups that are positioned such that when reduced, a six-membered ring is formed with the correct substituents.

Looking back, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, perhaps when reduced, the ester (if any) is converted into an alcohol, and the molecule cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, but how? For example, if the starting material is a lactone, then reducing it would break the ester into a diol, which could then form the pyranone upon rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal that upon reduction forms the pyranone.

Wait, perhaps when LiBH4 reduces the starting material, it opens the acetal or hemiacetal, leading to a diol, which then forms the pyranone.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a β-diketone ester. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry. The product's configuration (R or S) depends on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent's action.

Wait, let's assume that the starting material has a chiral center. When reduced, the configuration of that center would influence the product's configuration.

If the starting material is (R), then after reduction, the product might be (R) or (S), depending on the reaction's stereochemistry.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure how the reduction affects the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration dictates the approach of the reducing agent, thus determining the product's configuration.

Wait, but I'm not very confident about that.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is that A is (R) and B is (S), or vice versa. Looking at the options, option D is A=R and B=S.

Wait, why would that be the case?

Alternatively, perhaps when using LiBH4, which is a stronger reducing agent, the product forms with a certain configuration, and when using BH3, a different configuration.

But I'm not exactly sure how the reducing agent's strength affects the stereochemistry.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material's configuration affects the way the reducing agent approaches, leading to different stereoisomers. For example, if the starting material is (R), then using a certain reagent would lead to (R) product, and another reagent would lead to (S).

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material is retained in the product.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) A and B are both (S)

B) A and B are both (R)

C) A is (S), B is (R)

D) A is (R), B is (S)

So, if the product's configuration depends on the starting material's configuration and the reagent, perhaps using one reagent leads to retention, and the other leads to inversion, or vice versa.

Wait, but I don't recall any such behavior in reductions. Typically, reductions with borohydrides like LiBH4 don't involve any such stereochemical changes; they just reduce the carbonyl group to an alcohol without affecting existing stereocenters.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material itself is a chiral center, so perhaps the configuration of the starting material dictates the configuration of the product.

Wait, if the starting material is (R), then the product after reduction would also be (R), assuming the reduction doesn't change the configuration of existing stereocenters.

But wait, in the problem, the products are different stereoisomers based on the reagent used. So, perhaps the reaction conditions influence the configuration of the new stereocenter formed during the reduction.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with a stereocenter, and the reduction leads to the formation of a new stereocenter.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, which would mean that the reduction isn't of a ketone, but perhaps of something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: the reaction could be a reduction of an epoxide, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reduction leads to a secondary alcohol, which then forms a ring upon elimination.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and when reduced, it forms a β-hydroxy ester, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

Hmm.

But this is getting too vague. Perhaps I should think about the options and what determines the correct answer.

The key is that when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives the (R) product, and when B is treated with BH3, it gives the (S) product.

So, the starting materials A and B must have configurations that lead to these products.

Assuming that the configuration of the starting material is retained in the product, then perhaps A is (R) and B is (S), leading to the products (R) and (S) respectively.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents cause the product's configuration to be opposite to the starting material's.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the starting material's configuration and the reagent's selectivity determine the product's configuration. For example, one reagent leads to retention, the other to inversion.

But without knowing the specific reaction mechanism, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents cause the configuration to invert. So, if the starting material is (R), LiBH4 leads to (R) product, and BH3 leads to (S), or something like that.

Wait, but I don't have enough knowledge about this specific reaction.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option D: A is (R), B is (S).

Because if the starting materials are different enantiomers, then the product would also be different enantiomers depending on the reaction conditions.

So, when using a different reducing agent, the configuration of the product would change.

Thus, the correct answer would be option D: A is (R), B is (S).


The problem involves determining the starting materials A and B that lead to the formation of (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively, when treated with different reducing agents (LiBH4 and BH3). The key is to analyze the stereochemistry of the reaction and how the starting material's configuration influences the product's configuration.

The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent used. The starting materials are given as (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which are enantiomers differing in the configuration of their chiral center at position 3.

When LiBH4 is used, it reduces the starting material to form the (R)-product, while BH3 reduces the starting material to form the (S)-product. This suggests that the stereochemistry of the starting material directly determines the stereochemistry of the product. Therefore, the starting material A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid to yield the (R)-product, and the starting material B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid to yield the (S)-product.

Among the options provided, the correct pairing is:

- A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid  
- B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid  

This corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
