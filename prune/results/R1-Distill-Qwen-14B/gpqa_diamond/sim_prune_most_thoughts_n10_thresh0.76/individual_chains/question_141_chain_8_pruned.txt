Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I need to find out how many possible organic products there are.

Wait, what's the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh wait, wait. Let me think. The name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, right, that's actually o-bromoaniline. Because the bromine is at position 1 and the amino group (NH2) is at position 2. So the benzene ring has Br and NH2 groups adjacent to each other.

Now, the reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic substitution, strong bases like this can cause elimination reactions, especially in the context of directing groups.

Wait, but wait. The molecule here has an amino group. Amino groups are strong activating groups and are ortho/para directors. But in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, maybe something else is happening. Oh right! Friedel-Crafts reactions are usually for activating groups, but wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, that's when you have an acylium ion or alkyl halide. I'm not sure that's the case here.

Wait, but in this case, the Br is attached to the benzene ring. So perhaps it's a substitution reaction? But substitution with what? Or maybe elimination?

Wait, another thought. When you have a benzene ring with an amino group and a leaving group like Br, and you treat it with a strong base, perhaps you're looking at a scenario where the amino group is deprotonated, making it a better leaving group? Wait, no, amino is -NH2, which is a strong base. Deprotonating it would give -NH- but not sure if that's a leaving group.

Wait, maybe the reaction is about elimination. If there's Br and NH2 groups on adjacent carbons, perhaps an elimination occurs. Wait, but both are on the benzene ring. Elimination would typically be between adjacent substituents, but on the ring, that's not possible. Unless it's a meta-directing group or something else.

Wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack.
