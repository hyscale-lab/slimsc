Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's start breaking down the information given step by step.

First, the problem describes a series of reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak).
4. Gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I need to identify the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, or C2v. So I think I should first figure out what the compounds A, B, C, D, E, etc., are.

Let me take each reaction and see what they might represent. Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. The product C is bright red. Bright red makes me think of something like sulfur or maybe a transition metal compound. Alternatively, maybe a product like FeS or something else, but I'm not sure yet.

Reaction 3 says that when C reacts with water, it forms A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. Strong acids are like H2SO4, HCl, HNO3, etc. Weak ones are like acetic acid, H3PO4. Hmm, when a compound reacts with water to form two acids, perhaps it's a sulfite or something with two different acid-forming groups.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, I'm thinking about a situation where a salt reacts with water to form an acid. For example, if C is a salt that contains two different anions, each of which can form an acid when hydrated. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound that upon hydrolysis produces two different acids.

Wait, perhaps C is something like an acid with two different acid components. Or maybe it's a sulfide that forms two different acids upon hydrolysis. Wait, but sulfide is S^2-; when it reacts with water, I think it would form HS- and then H2S, but that's a weak acid. Maybe that's not it.

Another thought: If C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze but I'm not sure it would produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride or some other compound.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible reaction with D. Reaction 2 is C + 2 D → E. And reaction 4: D + B → H, a solvent. What solvents are formed from the reaction of gases? Maybe H is something like water, but I don't think B is H2O because D reacts with B. Alternatively, H could be something like ethanol or another alcohol, but that's a stretch.

Wait, let's think about H being a common solvent. H is formed from D and B. So for example, if D is HCl and B is NaOH, H could be NaCl, but that's a solid. Alternatively, maybe D is something like NH3 and B is something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe D is CO2 and B is NaOH, which would make H Na2CO3, but
