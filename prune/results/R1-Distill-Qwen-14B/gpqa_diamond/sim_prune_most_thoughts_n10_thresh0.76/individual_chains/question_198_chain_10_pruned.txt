Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question involves cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. They're giving me the stability constants (β) for the different complexes. The β values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, I remember that the stability constant (β) is related to the formation of complexes. Each β corresponds to a different complex. So Co(II) can form complexes with thiocyanate ions, starting from the simplest. The complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n is the number of SCN- ions attached. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)₃]^- , and β4 for [Co(SCN)₄]^2-.

Wait, the first thing I need to clarify is what each β represents. The general formula for the nth complex is βn = [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n). So for β1, the complex is [CoSCN]^+, since 2-1=1+. For β2, it's [Co(SCN)₂]^0 because 2-2=0. For β3, the charge would be 2-3 = -1, so [Co(SCN)₃]^- , and β4 would be [Co(SCN)₄]^2-.

But wait, the problem mentions "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- ligands. So which complex is that? Looking at the options, the β2 is 40, which is for the [Co(SCN)₂]^0 complex. So the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)₂]^0 complex. So the question is asking for the percentage of Co species that are in the [Co(SCN)₂]²+ complex.

Wait, but wait, I need to be careful about the charge. So [Co(SCN)₂]^0 would have a charge of 0? Because Co²+ plus 2 SCN^- (each -1) would give Co²+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So yes, that's correct.

But I'm getting a bit confused. So the problem is about finding the fraction of the [Co(SCN)₂]^0 complex relative to all possible Co species.

The approach I think I need to take is to model the distribution of Co(II) species in solution given the various stability constants. Since the solution has a fixed [SCN^-], which is 0.1 M, and the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M, I can use the stability constants to find the distribution of the different complexes.

This sounds like a log fraction problem. The idea is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex based on their stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and the metal ion.

So first, I'll note the possible complexes. The possible complexes are:

- Co²+ (free ion)
- [CoSCN]^+ (n=1)
- [Co(SCN)₂]^0 (n=2)
- [Co(SCN)₃]^- (n=3)
- [Co(SCN)₄]^{2-} (n=4)

So, the fractions of each species can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations. But since the problem is giving me the β values, I need to consider the formation of each complex step by step.

Wait, but wait, the stability constants are given for each step. Alternatively, I can think in terms of the overall formation from the free ion. For example, the β for each complex is cumulative. So the overall β for the third complex, [Co(SCN)₃]^- , would be β1 * β2 * β3, but wait no, that's not correct. Each β is for adding one SCN^- at a time. Alternatively, perhaps the overall β for the nth complex is the product of the individual βs up to that n.

Wait, no, that's not right. The stability constant for each complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation from the previous complex. So, for example, [Co(SCN)₂]^0 is formed from [Co(SCN)]^+ plus another SCN^-.

Wait, no, the step-wise formation is:

Co²+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+ ; β1 = 9

[CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)₂]^0 ; β2 = 40

[Co(SCN)₂]^0 + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)₃]^- ; β3 = 63

[Co(SCN)₃]^- + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)₄]^2- ; β4 = 16

So each β represents the formation of the next complex from the previous one. So the overall β for [Co(SCN)₂]^0 would be β1 * β2 = 9 *40 = 360.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Because when you form the next complex, you're multiplying each step. So the overall β for [Co(SCN)₂]^0 is β1 * β2. Similarly,
