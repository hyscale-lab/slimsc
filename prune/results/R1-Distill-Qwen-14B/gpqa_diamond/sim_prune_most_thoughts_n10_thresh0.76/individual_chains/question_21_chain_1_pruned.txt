Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It mentions that constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but different structures, while stereoisomers are when the molecules are connected the same way but differ in their spatial arrangement. Got it.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Part B asks which of two compounds shows optical isomerismâ€”either methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate.

Let me tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part A: tautomerism. Tautomerism is a type of isomerism where a proton moves from one atom to another, resulting in the breaking and forming of bonds, which leads to a change in the structure. It's similar to keto-enol tautomerism in ketones and aldehydes. For tautomerism to occur, the molecule should have a structure that allows for such a shift. Usually, this involves a conjugated system where a hydrogen can shift, leading to a different arrangement of double bonds or lone pairs.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone can be either para or ortho. Benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, but I'm not entirely sure. Either way, it's a cyclic diketone. Do diketones undergo tautomerism? Wait, the keto-enol form is more about having alpha hydrogens. So, if a molecule has alpha hydrogens, it can tautomerize. Let's think: Benzoquinone has two ketone groups; but the positions might determine if there are hydrogens alpha to the carbonyl. Benzoquinone in the para position would have two carbonyls opposite each other. The benzoquinone structure is O=C6H4=O, but wait, each C=O is connected to an aromatic ring. Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone, so the structure is two ketones on the benzene ring, positions 1 and
