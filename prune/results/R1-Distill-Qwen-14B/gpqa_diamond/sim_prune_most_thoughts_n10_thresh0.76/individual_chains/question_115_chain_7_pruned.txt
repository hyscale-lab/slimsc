Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. Then they collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma for electron is 4, and for positron it's 2. But wait, positron is the antimatter counterpart of electron, so they have the same mass but opposite charges. Since the electron is moving left to right? Wait, no, the electron is moving from the left, so rightward? Because it's moving along the horizontal axis from the leftâ€”so direction is right. The positron is moving along the same axis from the right, so direction is left. So their momenta are opposite.

When particles annihilate, they produce photons. In this case, two photons. And the photons have the same energy. Also, their directions are such that one goes upper-right and the other lower-right, meaning both are moving to the right but in different vertical directions.

Wait, but in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero. Because the electron and positron are moving towards each other, so their momenta are opposite. Let's compute that.

First, calculate the relativistic momentum of each particle. The formula for momentum is p = gamma * m * v. But maybe it's easier to think in terms of energy and momentum in the center of mass frame.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the total energy and momentum of the system before annihilation. Then, in the center of mass frame, the initial momenta of the electron and positron would cancel each other out, right?

Wait, the electron is moving right, the positron is moving left. So their momenta are in opposite directions. Hmm. Let me calculate their momenta. Let's denote the speed of light as c, which is 1 in these units.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given as 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron.

So, the electron's momentum p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly, the posit
