Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change is usually measured in kJ per mole of H+ or OH- ions involved.

The question is about mixing three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Let me see. I think I need to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base, then find out how much they neutralize each other because the excess will determine the overall enthalpy change.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "enthalpy of neutralization when... are mixed." So the reaction is an acid-base neutralization. I should write out the reactions.

Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: HCl → H+ + Cl-. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is also a strong acid and it's diprotic. So each mole would give 2 moles of H+. But wait, since it's 0.3 M, I'll need to calculate the moles. 

Barium hydroxide [Ba(OH)2] is a strong base and it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-. So each mole gives two moles of OH-.

Let me calculate each component's moles first.

First, HCl: volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since each HCl gives one H+, that's 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4: volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, that's 0.18 moles of H+.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2. Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait! Neutralization reactions involve H+ and OH- combining. The total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reactant. Because 0.2 is less than 0.28. So all OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

Wait, no. Wait, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the moles of H+ and OH- will determine how much water is formed. Which one is in excess?

H+ total: 0.28 moles.
OH-: 0.2 moles.

So OH- will be completely neutralized, using 0.2 moles of H+. The remaining H+ is 0.08 moles.

But wait, since the reaction is 1:1, the heat released would depend on the amount of H+ and OH- that actually react. Because the enthalpy of neutralization is typically per mole of H+ or OH-.

Wait, but the enthalpy of neutralization is usually given as the heat released when one mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH- to form water. So the total enthalpy change is based on the moles that actually react.

So in
