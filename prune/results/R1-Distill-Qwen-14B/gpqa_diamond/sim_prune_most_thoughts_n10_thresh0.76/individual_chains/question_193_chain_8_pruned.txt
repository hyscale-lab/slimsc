Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula is N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh yeah, because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx.

But wait, the problem says N varies with 1/plx^5. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5. Which is the same as N ∝ d^5, because if plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So substituting, (1/plx)^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question isn't directly about N vs d; it's about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Oh, right. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be related to the number density times the volume of that shell. Wait, let me think about that.

In three-dimensional space, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance r (d in this case) with thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of the shell multiplied by the number density of stars per unit volume. But wait, no, because the question states it's in a specific region of the sky. Oh, that complicates things. So maybe it's not a spherical shell but a thin cylindrical slice, since it's a region on the sky.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, but how does the number of stars vary with distance? Let me think. The number of stars we observe at a given distance depends on the volume of space we're looking at and the density of stars in that volume.

If the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and since plx is 1/d, then N
