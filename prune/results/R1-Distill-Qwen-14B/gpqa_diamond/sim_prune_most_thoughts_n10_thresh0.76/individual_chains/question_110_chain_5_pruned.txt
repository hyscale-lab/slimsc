Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what each spectrograph can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, so apparent V mag ≤17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so apparent V mag ≤16. So any star that's brighter than 16 mag (apparent V) can be seen by both? Wait no, because each can see up to their own limit. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have an apparent V mag that's within both of their limits. Since HIRES can go down to 16, meaning it can see brighter stars than ESPRESSO, which goes to 17. So any star that's brighter than 16 mag in V (apparent) can be seen by both. Because HIRES can observe up to 16, and ESPRESSO up to 17. Wait, no, the question says 'brighter than 17' for ESPRESSO. Wait, wait, the wording is important. 

The question states: ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17. So if a star's apparent V is less than or equal to 17, it can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe apparent V mag brighter than 16, meaning their apparent V is ≤16. So for a star to be observable by both, it must have apparent V ≤16. Because if a star's apparent V is 16.5, it's too faint for HIRES, but maybe okay for ESPRESSO? Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify:

ESPRESSO: apparent V ≤17 (because brighter than 17 is 17 and lower, since lower magnitudes are brighter). So 17 or brighter (smaller number) can be observed.

HIRES: apparent V ≤16, same logic.

So to be detected by both, the star's apparent V must be ≤16. Because HIRES can't see anything beyond 16, so only
