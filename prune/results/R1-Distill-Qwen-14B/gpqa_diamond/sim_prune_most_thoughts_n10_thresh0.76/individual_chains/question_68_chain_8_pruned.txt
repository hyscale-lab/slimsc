Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies. So the setup is that we have a spin 1/2 particle, and its magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction.

So initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field, which I think means it's in the lowest energy state, maybe spin-up along z. But then the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. Interesting. So the field changes direction suddenly.

Wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Oh, so we're looking at <mu_z>, and how it oscillates over time. I remember something about oscillations in spin systems when the magnetic field changes direction. It must have to do with precession, like in NMR or something.

Let me try to model this. The magnetic moment mu is proportional to the spin, so mu = gamma * S. Since the spin is 1/2, S can be in units of ħ/2. But maybe I don't need to get into the exact values because the problem is about the frequency.

In the presence of a magnetic field, the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B. But wait, earlier I thought mu is proportional to Sz, so H would be proportional to Sz·B. So initially, the field is along Z, so H is proportional to Sz. Then the field is switched to Y direction, so the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy.

Wait, when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B Sy. Because mu is gamma S, and the dot product with B along Y would give mu in the Y direction. So the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy.

But wait, the system is initially in an eigenstate of Sz, like |+z> or |-z>. Because the field was along Z. Then the field changes to Y, so the Hamiltonian changes to one involving Sy. The state of the system doesn't change immediately when the field changes; it's a sudden change. So the initial state is |+z>, but now the system is governed by a different Hamiltonian.

So after the change, the state is |+z>, but the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. So the time evolution will cause the spin state to precess around the Y-axis. Because the Hamiltonian determines the axis of precession.

But the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of mu, which is <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.

I think I should find the expectation value of Sz over time. Since the state will evolve according to the new Hamiltonian, which is proportional to Sy.

The time evolution of the state is given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The state at time t is |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

Wait, but I need to find the expectation value of Sz. Let me denote H = ω Sy, where ω is some frequency related to gamma and B. Let me compute H: H = -mu·B = -gamma S · B. Since B is along Y, H = -gamma B Sy. But wait, the energy is given by H = -mu·B. So the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, but with a negative sign. Alternatively, H = gamma B Sy, because mu is gamma S, so mu·B would be gamma (S·B). So H = -gamma B Sy. Hmm, I might have to think about signs carefully, but perhaps it doesn't matter for the frequency.

But let's proceed. The eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues ± (ħ/2) * gamma B. So the energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B ħ/2) and E_- = -(gamma B ħ/2), but wait, that depends on the sign in H. Wait, H = - mu · B. So perhaps I
