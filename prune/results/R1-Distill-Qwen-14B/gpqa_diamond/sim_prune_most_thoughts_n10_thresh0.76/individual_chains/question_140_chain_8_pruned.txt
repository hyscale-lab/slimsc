Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, releasing gas W, and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Then there's some info about a keto acid reacting with X to produce something with two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's noted that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm. So I need to figure out what X is, and then determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Let me break this down. First, the reaction between X and Y. The gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, if a molecule has equal protons and neutrons, that means the atomic number equals the mass number. Let me think about possible gases. Common gases are O2, CO2, H2O, NH3, etc. Wait, but W's molecules have same protons and neutrons. So, let's think about elements where the atomic number equals the mass number.

Wait, no, wait. W is a molecule, so maybe it's a diatomic gas. So each molecule would have two atoms. So, for each atom in W, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. So for an atom, protons = neutrons. That would mean the isotope has an even atomic number, because if protons = neutrons, mass number is 2*protons. So possible elements are ones where the isotope has protons = neutrons.

For example, let's see: He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (if it's He-4). But He is a noble gas, but I don't think He is diatomic. Wait, O2 is a diatomic gas. Oxygen has 8 protons, but oxygen-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O-16 would have 8 each. So each O atom in O2 would have 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each molecule would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons, but wait, no, W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So O2 has 32 protons (since two O atoms, each 8) and 32 neutrons (each O has 8, so two would be 16). Wait, no. Each O atom in O2 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so the molecule would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons? Because 2*(8) protons, and 2*(8) neutrons. So yes, protons in the molecule (16) equals neutrons (16). So W could be O2.

Wait, but O2's melting point is around 54 K, which is way lower than 277 K. Wait, but B is the product when G is heated, and B's melting point is near 277 K. So B is likely solid at room temp. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So B
