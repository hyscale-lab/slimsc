Okay, so I've got this problem about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question gives me the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole and asks for the order of magnitude of its entropy.

Wait, the event horizon's angular size is given as θ = 1e-17 degrees. The distance is d = 1e10 parsecs. So, I remember that the angular size relates to the actual size of the object (like the event horizon radius) through some trigonometric relationship. Oh right, for small angles, the formula θ ≈ (R / d) in radians should work. So I can probably use that.

First, I need to convert the angle from degrees to radians because the formula uses radians. Let's see, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is (1e-17 degrees) * (π/180) ≈ (1e-17 * 3.1416)/180. Let me compute that. Hmm, 1e-17 * 3.1416 is about 3.14e-17, divided by 180 gives roughly 1.745e-19 radians.

So θ ≈ R / d. Rearranging, R = θ * d. Wait, but wait, d is in parsecs. I need to convert that to meters, right? Because the radius of the event horizon is usually given in meters, and entropy formulas use SI units.

One parsec is approximately 3.0857e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m. Let me calculate that: 3.0857e26 meters.

Now, compute R = θ_rad * d. θ is 1.745e-19 radians, and d is 3.0857e26 m. So R ≈ 1.745e-19 * 3.0857e26 = let's multiply 1.745 * 3.0857 ≈ 5.37. Then exponents: e-19 * e26 is e7. So R ≈ 5.37e7 meters. Wait, that's 5.37e7 meters. But wait, the Schwarzschild radius is R_s = 2GM/c². For a black hole, R is approximately R_s. So M = (R * c²)/(2G). But actually, maybe I can get the mass from R.

Wait, the problem is about entropy. I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: S = (A c³)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Alternatively, I've seen it written as S = (k_B c³ A)/(4 ħ G) or something like that. Alternatively, another formula I remember is S = (π k_B c³ R²)/( ħ G), because A is
