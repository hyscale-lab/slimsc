Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about particle annihilation. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The process given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles each of type A⁺ and A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, which I think means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Also, the mass of particle A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Hmm, okay. So, this looks like a conservation of energy and momentum problem. Because the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps it's non-relativistic, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think about the system.

First, let's consider the initial setup. The proton is at rest, I assume, unless stated otherwise. Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. So the initial state is a proton (probably at rest) and an antiproton moving with some velocity. But wait, in the problem statement, it says the antiproton is "slowly moving". So maybe its speed is low compared to the speed of light, making it non-relativistic.

Wait, but the process is annihilation, so protons and antiprotons are matter and antimatter. When they annihilate, they produce other particles. So, in this case, two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles.

I think I'll need to use conservation of energy and momentum. Let's model the initial and final states.

Initial state:
- Proton (p) with rest mass m_p c². I remember that the proton mass is about 938 MeV/c². But wait, in this problem, the mass of A is 300 MeV; maybe m_p is similar to that, but I can't assume that because 300 MeV is less than 938. Wait, but maybe the problem expects treating the initial particles as having mass m_p, but perhaps I should consider that the proton and antiproton have rest mass energy, while the A particles have 300 MeV each.

Wait, but the problem says m_A c² = 300 MeV. So each A particle has that rest energy.

So initial particles: p and p̄. The proton is at rest, and the ant
