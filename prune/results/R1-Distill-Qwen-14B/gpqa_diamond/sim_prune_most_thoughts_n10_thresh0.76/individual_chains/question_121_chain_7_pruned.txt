Okay, so I've got this problem about reacting a specific epoxide with an organocuprate. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

First, the question says that when saturated epoxides react with organocuprates like Me2CuLi, the alkyl group from the reagent is added to the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. And in disubstituted epoxides, there's an inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile (Nu) adds. Wait, I remember that epoxide ring opening is a nucleophilic attack. So the organocuprate acts as a nucleophile here.

The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let me try to visualize that structure. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane means there's a bridge between carbons 1 and 4, right? So the numbering goes 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. The 7-oxa part is an oxygen in place of a bridge carbon. So the epoxide is between carbons 1 and 2, perhaps? Or maybe another arrangement. Wait, the bicyclo system could be a norbornane-like structure. Norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, but this is [4.1.0], which is a different structure. Let me think: [4.1.0] means there are bridges of 4, 1, and 0 carbons. Wait, the bicyclo notation is bicyclo[x.y.z], where x, y, z are the number of carbons in each bridge. So for [4.1.0], the two bridges are four carbons, one carbon, and zero (so it's a fused ring, perhaps).

Wait, maybe I should draw it. So, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have a 4-membered bridge, a 1-membered bridge, and a 0 (which is just a single bond). Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that it's
