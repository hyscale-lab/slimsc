Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the problem says there are three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. The options are A to D, and I have to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So each state contributes a term to Z based on its energy.

Each spin can be either +1 or -1, so each spin has two possible states. Since there are three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. So I need to consider all eight possible combinations of S1, S2, S3.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8. Let me think about the energy expression. E is proportional to the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Each term S_i S_j is +1 if the spins are the same and -1 if different. So each product can be ±1.

But wait, the energy is E = -J times the sum. So each term in the sum adds to the energy. Let me calculate the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each possible state.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the possible values of the sum and how often each occurs. That way, I can group the states by their energy and compute Z efficiently.

Let me think: What are the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3?

Each term is S_i S_j, which as I said is +1 if same, -1 otherwise.

Let me consider the possible cases. Maybe the sum can take on different values depending on how many pairs are aligned.

Alternatively, perhaps I can see how many pairs are aligned. Let's denote the sum as H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Wait, let's think about the possible values H can take. For three spins, each product term is ±1. So H is the sum of three terms, each ±1. So the maximum possible sum is +3 (all terms +1), the minimum is -3.

But wait, does H actually reach 3? Let's see. For H=3, all S_i S_j must be +1. That means all three pairs are aligned. Let's see if that's possible.

If all three spins are the same, say +1, then S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. So sum H=3.

If all are -1, same thing: S1S2=1, etc., so H=3. So that's possible.

What about H=1? Let's say two pairs are +1 and one is -1. Is that possible?

Wait, let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Then S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum H=1-1-1 = -1.

Hmm, maybe I should look for the possible values of H and count how many states have each H.

Alternative approach: Let's denote the number of aligned pairs as m. Each aligned pair contributes +1, each misaligned contributes -1. So H = (m)(+1) + (3 - m)(-1) ) = m - (3 - m) ) = 2m -
