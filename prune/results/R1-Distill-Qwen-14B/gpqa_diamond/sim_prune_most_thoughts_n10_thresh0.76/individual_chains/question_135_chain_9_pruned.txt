Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem is about the decay of a boson X. The Lagrangian is given, but I think the key points are the mass of the boson and the possible decay products. The mass is 6 GeV, right? So the question is about kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Hmm. I remember that in particle physics, a boson can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the mass of the boson is higher than twice the mass of the fermion. Because for a decay like X → f f̄, the energy required is 2m_f (where m_f is the mass of the fermion). So the boson's mass must be at least twice the mass of the fermion for the decay to be possible.

Wait, but in this case, the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. So I need to check which fermions have a mass less than 3 GeV because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. 

Wait, let me think about the masses of the known fermions. Let me list them out:

- Up quark (u): very light, about 2 MeV.
- Down quark (d): similar, around 4-5 MeV.
- Strange quark (s): around 95-100 MeV.
- Charm quark (c): about 1.2-1.5 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.1-4.7 GeV.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, like 173 GeV.
- Electron (e): about 0.5 MeV.
- Muon (μ): around 105.7 MeV.
- Tau (τ): about 1.78 GeV.
- Neutrinos: even lighter, but since they're not in the options, maybe we can ignore them.

Wait, wait, wait. So the boson X has 6 GeV. Let's see which fermions satisfy 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's check each fermion:

- u: 2 MeV → yes, way under.
- d: 5 MeV → yes.
- s: ~100 MeV → yes, 0.1 GeV, so half is 0.05 GeV. 6 GeV is way more.
- c: ~1.5 GeV → 2m_c is ~3 GeV. 6 GeV is more than 3 GeV, so yes.
- b: ~4.5 GeV → 2m_b would be ~9 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is less than 9 GeV. So 6 GeV < 9 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄ because 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is larger than X's mass. So b is out.
- tau: m_tau is ~1.78 GeV. 2m_tau is ~3.56 GeV. X has 6 GeV, which is more than 3.56 GeV. So tau is allowed.
- e: 0.5 MeV → yes.
- mu: ~0.1 GeV → yes, 0.1*2=0.2, much less than 6.
- c: 1.5 GeV → yes, 2*1.5=3 ≤6.
- s: 0.1 GeV → yes.
- u and d: same as above.

Wait, but wait. What about the charged leptons? X is a boson, so when it decays, it can produce any fermion-antifermion pair as long as the mass condition is met.

So the possible fermions are:

u, d, s, c, tau, e, mu.

Wait, but what about the top quark? Its mass is around 173 GeV, so 2m_t is way above 6 GeV. So no t quark decays.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but earlier I thought b is not allowed because 2m_b is about 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So if X is 6 GeV, it can't decay into b b̄. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but option B includes c. So does c satisfy 2m_c ≤6 GeV? c is around 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 ≤6. So yes. So c is allowed. So B includes c, tau, mu, e, s, u, d. Which all are allowed.

Wait, but what about the bottom quark? Option B doesn't include it. So is that correct? Because X can't decay into b b̄, right? So B is possible.

Option C: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, t is top quark, which is way too heavy. So including t is impossible. So C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, again, including b is wrong because X's mass is 6 GeV which is less than 2m_b. So D is incorrect.

So the correct options are the ones that include all the allowed fermions except b and t.

Looking back, option B includes c, which is allowed. Option B has c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all these 2m_f ≤6 GeV? Let's confirm:

c: 1.5 GeV → 3 GeV, which is ≤6 → yes.

Tau: ~1.78 GeV → 3.56 GeV ≤6 → yes.

Mu: ~0.1 GeV → 0.2 ≤6 → yes.

e: ~0.0005 GeV → yes.

s: ~0.1 GeV → 0.2 ≤6.

u: 0.002 GeV → yes.

d: ~0.005 GeV → yes.

So all their 2m_f are ≤6 GeV. So B is correct.

Wait, but what about the option B? Let me check the options again.

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Yes, that's correct. So the correct answer is option B.

So the allowed decays are
