Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions with (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each chromatogram would show.

First, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is an oxidizing agent often used in epoxidation of alkenes. The reaction adds an epoxide group across the double bond. But wait, I also think that mCPBA can lead to other reactions, like dihydroxylation or other oxidations, but I'm pretty sure in this context, it's about epoxidation. Oh, wait, another thought: I've heard that mCPBA can cause epoxidation, but sometimes when the epoxide is formed, under certain conditions, it can open up, especially in acidic conditions. Oh wait, the reaction here includes aqueous acid after mCPBA. So after epoxidation, the mixture is treated with acid. Hmm.

Wait, what happens when an epoxide is treated with aqueous acid? Oh right, acid-catalyzed ring opening of epoxides. The epoxide oxygen becomes protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then nucleophilic attack occurs. Since it's in acid, the nucleophile would be water (or more accurately, water acting as a nucleophile). So the epoxide would open to form a diol.

But wait, how does the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affect the diol? Because the starting alkenes are E and Z isomers, which would affect the epoxide geometry, which in turn affects the diol product.

So, let's look at each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene. The structure is CH2CH2 groups on opposite sides of the double bond. When treated with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The epoxide would form a trans configuration since the starting alkene is E. Wait, no, wait. Wait, mCPBA typically adds an epoxide in a way that the stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene's geometry. For (E) and (Z) alkenes, the epoxide formation (cis addition) would lead to different diastereomers.

Wait, I think that the addition of mCPBA to an alkene forms an epoxide where the two new oxygen bonds are on the same face. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, which has the two methyl groups (or maybe ethyl, but in this case, oct-4-ene implies two CH2CH3 groups on C4 and C5) on opposite sides, the epoxide would form such that the oxygen adds across the double bond in a cis fashion, leading to a trans epoxide? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's think about the geometry. (E)-oct-4-ene has substituents (CH2CH2CH2CH3) on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, it adds an oxygen across the double bond in a cis
