Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, there are five exoplanets, Planet_1 to Planet_5, in orbital resonance with each other. Their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They used the TTV method to discover them, but I don't think that's relevant for the question. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both have the same albedo, so that shouldn't affect the calculation. I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star. The formula I think is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16 * pi * sigma * a²)) )^0.25, but wait, that's maybe a bit complicated. Alternatively, I think there's an inverse square law involved because the planet's distance affects the received stellar flux.

Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_eff * ( (R_star / (2a) ) )^0.5, assuming it's a perfect blackbody and albedo is zero. But wait, albedo is the fraction of light reflected, and since they have the same albedo here, maybe that cancels out when taking the ratio. So for the ratio of temperatures, perhaps the albedo doesn't matter.

Wait, equilibrium temperature is given by T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) but considering the albedo, the formula would include (1 - albedo) as well. But since the albedo is the same for both planets, (1 - albedo) will be a constant factor and cancel out when taking the ratio of T4 and T2. So I don't need to worry about albedo in the ratio calculation.

So the key is the distance from the star. The planets are in orbital resonance, which means their orbital periods are in a specific ratio. The given ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, P2 is 2*P1, P3 is 2.5*P1, P4 is 3.5*P1, and P5 is 5*P1.

Wait, orbital period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. For a circular orbit, the period squared is proportional to a³. So P² is proportional to a³, so a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So the distance (semi-major axis) of each planet depends on their orbital period. So to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, I need to find the ratio of their distances, then apply the inverse square root.

Because equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance (since T is proportional to (L/(16 pi sigma a²))^(1/4), but more simply, the flux is L/(4 pi a²), and T is proportional to (flux)^(1/4) * (other constants). So T ∝ (1/a²)^(1/4) ) → T ∝ 1/(a^(1/2)).

Wait,
