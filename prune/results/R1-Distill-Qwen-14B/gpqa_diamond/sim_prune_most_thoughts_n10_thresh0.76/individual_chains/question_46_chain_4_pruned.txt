Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the answer is. Let me take it step by step. 

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A) 4, B) 8, C)6, D)2.

First, let me recall what Grubbs catalyst does. Grubbs is a transition metal complex used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. Specifically, Grubbs catalyst facilitates ring-closing metathesis (RCM) and ring-opening metathesis (ROM), but more commonly, it's known for breaking and reforming double bonds through a process called olefin metathesis.

Wait, no, more precisely, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis, which can involve either ring-closing or ring-opening, but in this case, I'm dealing with a monoene, so it would likely undergo ring-closing if possible, or maybe some cross metathesis if there were other alkenes. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is a monoene, so cross metathesis isn't possible here. So the reaction is probably intramolecular, leading to ring formation.

Wait, but wait. The structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me draw it. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2.

So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait no, wait, pent-1-ene has five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Then, 3-methyl would be a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, but that's more than five carbons. Oh wait, wait. No, wait: 3-methylpent-1-ene has five carbons in total. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but 3
