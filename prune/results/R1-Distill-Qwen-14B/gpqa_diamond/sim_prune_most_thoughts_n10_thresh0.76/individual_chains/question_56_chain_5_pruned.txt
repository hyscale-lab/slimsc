Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the hydrogen atom. Hmm, the question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state through two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, selection rules. Right, for the hydrogen atom in the non-relativistic theory, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are that the change in the angular momentum quantum number l must be ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1. But the change in the principal quantum number n can be ±1, ±2, etc., as long as the other rules are satisfied. Oh wait, no, I think I mixed something up. No, actually, the change in n is usually ±1 for dipole transitions, but sometimes higher changes are possible if intermediate steps are involved. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. So the principal quantum number n goes from 3 to 1, which is a change of -2. That's a two-photon transition? Or is it a two-step transition, each being a dipole transition?

Wait, because a single dipole transition (allowed by selection rules) can only change n by ±1, right? Because the dipole transition involves emission or absorption of a photon with a certain energy, which would correspond to going from n to n±1. So to get from 3→1, which is a Δn of -2, that would require two transitions. Each step would be a Δn of -1.

So the decay would have two steps: first from 3→2, then 2→1. Each step is a dipole transition.

Now, the question is about the possible transition routes and their probabilities. The options give different routes and probabilities. Let's look at the options.

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, with probability 1/3.

Option B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 1/4.

Option C: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 1/4.

Option D: It's written as |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3.

Wait, but I think I'm missing something about selection rules. The l value can change by ±1. So the initial state has l=0, so the next state must have l=1 because l can only change by ±1. So in the first transition, l must go from 0 →1.

But when you go from |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩ to |n=2, l=1, m=?⟩, the m can change by 0 or ±1. So m can be -1, 0, or +1 in the intermediate state.

Wait, but what about the possible m values? For the first transition, the initial m is 0. The final m in the intermediate state can be 0, +1, or -1.

So the first transition could go to |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

But wait, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions state that Δl = ±1. So the first step must change l from 0 to 1. Then, in the second transition, from l=1 in n=2, it must go to l=0 in n=1 (since the final state is l=0). So the second transition also must have Δl = -1.

Now, each transition involves a matrix element that determines the probability. The transition probabilities depend on the square of the dipole matrix elements, which are proportional to certain integrals involving spherical harmonics.

Wait, the matrix element for the transition is proportional to the spherical harmonic of the photon's polarization. I remember that the dipole transition matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{l', m'}* Y_{1, q} Y_{l, m} }, where q is the polarization's m number, which can be -1, 0, +1. So the integral is non-zero only if m' = m + q, and l' = l ± 1.

But for the initial state, m=0. The first transition must have m' = m + q, so possible m' values are -1, 0, +1.

So the first transition can go to states with m = -1, 0, +1. But then,
