Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

The question is about a spin-half particle in a specific state. The state is given as a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of sigma_z, which is the Pauli z matrix. The operator we're looking at is 10σz + 5σx. I need to find the expectation value of this operator, and then round it to one decimal place.

Wait, so expectation value for an operator. Right, the formula is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state. So I need to compute that.

Let me break down the operator. The operator is 10σz plus 5σx. So for the expectation value, I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That should simplify things.

First, let me find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

The state is a superposition of these eigenstates. So the expectation value of σz is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

The given state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. The coefficients are 0.5 and √3/2. Let me square these to get the probabilities. 

(0.5)^2 = 0.25, so 25% chance for ↑. (√3/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75, so 75% for ↓.

So the expectation ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, that seems right. So the first part is 10 multiplied by -0.5, which gives -5.

Now, what about ⟨σx⟩? Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are superpositions
