Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what each step does and how the molecule changes.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, I should probably draw that out. So, the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group, which is like a CH2OH attached. Position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as an allyl group, right? So that's CH2CHCH2? No, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which would be CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond starting at C1? Or is it CH2-CH(CH2-)? No, let me think. The structure is CH2=CHCH2- but attached via the central carbon. Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached at C2. So, it's CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2- but attached at the middle carbon. No, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me write this correctly.

Wait, the structure is prop-1-en-2-yl: the parent chain is three carbons, double bond starts at carbon 1. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2- but the substituent is attached at carbon 2. So, the group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the substituent is attached at C2, making it CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait,
