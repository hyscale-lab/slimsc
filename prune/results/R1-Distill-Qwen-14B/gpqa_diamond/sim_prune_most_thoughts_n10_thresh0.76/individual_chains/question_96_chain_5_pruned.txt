Okay, so I've got this question about black hole entropy. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. Oh right, the formula is something like S = (kc^3 A)/(4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon. But wait, I think sometimes they simplify it, especially when they're asking for order of magnitude. Oh, right, there's a simpler version where S is proportional to the area divided by the Planck area. So the entropy S is roughly A/(A_planck), where A_planck is (ħ c/(G))².

Wait, or was it (ħ c/(G)) squared? Yeah, Planck area is (ħ c/(G))^2. So the entropy S is about A/(A_p) where A_p is Planck area. So S ≈ A/(ħ c/(G))^2. But let me get the exact formula.

Alternatively, another approach: I remember the formula for entropy is S = (k c^3) / (4 ħ G) * Area. So S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). But I think k is Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1e-23 J/K. Hmm.

But first, I need to find the area of the event horizon. The event horizon is a sphere with radius r = (2 G M)/c², the Schwarzschild radius. The area A is 4 π r², which becomes 4 π (2 G M / c²)^2.

Wait, but maybe I don't need to go through the mass. The question gives the angular size θ of the event horizon at a distance d. So I can find the size of the event horizon using the small angle approximation. θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size (D) divided by the distance (d). So D ≈ θ * d.

But the angular size given is in degrees, so I should convert that to radians first. Let's see, θ is 1e-17 degrees. To convert to radians, multiply by π/(180). So θ = 1e-17 * π/180 radians.

So the diameter D of the event horizon is approximately θ * d. Wait, no, the actual formula is D = d * θ, but θ needs to be in radians. So D = d * θ_rad
