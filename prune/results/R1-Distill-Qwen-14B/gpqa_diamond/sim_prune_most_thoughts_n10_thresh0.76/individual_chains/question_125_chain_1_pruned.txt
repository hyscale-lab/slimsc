Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about a particle in a potential. Let me read it again.

The problem states that a particle of mass m is moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2)mω² r². Hmm, that looks familiar. Wait, that's the potential for a harmonic oscillator, right? Because Hooke's law force is F = -k r, and the potential is (1/2) k r². So yeah, this is a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.

The question is about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. The options are A to D.

I remember that in three dimensions, the energy levels of an isotropic harmonic oscillator depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh right, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), but wait, wait. Alternatively, because it's isotropic, the energy can also be expressed in terms of the total number of quanta in each direction. Oh, right, the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum n_x + n_y + n_z. Or wait, actually, n is the total number of quanta, so for each direction, the quantum numbers are n_x, n_y, n_z. Each of them can be 0,1,2,... and the total n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Now, the ground state is n=0, first excited state n=1, second n=2, third n=3. So the third excited state would have n=3.

Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy, so the energy levels are ordered by n.
