Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nuclear fission, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest-masses. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So the initial nucleus is at rest, and after fission, the two fragments move with some kinetic energies.

We're told that the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. The question is asking for the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm, okay. The options are A) 2 MeV, B) 5 MeV, C)10 MeV, D)20 MeV.

First, I should probably sketch out what's happening. The nucleus is initially at rest, so the total momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum.

Let me denote the rest masses. Let's say the smaller fragment has rest mass m, so the larger has 2m. The sum of their rest masses is 3m. According to the problem, 3m = 0.99 M. Since the initial nucleus has rest mass M, which is 300 GeV/c². Wait, no, wait: the rest-mass energy is given as 300 GeV. So M c² is 300 GeV, so M = 300 GeV / c².

But wait, when the nucleus splits, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of M. So 3m = 0.99 M. So m = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. Then the larger fragment is 2m = 0.66 M.

Wait, but M is 300 GeV/c². Oh wait, but in units where c=1, M is 300 GeV. Hmm, not sure if that's relevant yet.

So now, after fission, the two fragments (mass 0.33 M and 0.66 M) move with some kinetic energies. Let me denote their velocities as v1 and v2, and their energies as E1 and E2. But since momentum must be conserved, their momenta must be equal and opposite.

But wait, in relativity, momentum isn't just mv. It's gamma m v. So I think I'll need to use relativistic equations here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of energy and momentum conservation.

Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total initial energy is just its rest energy, which is 300 GeV.

After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies, plus any binding energy (if any), but the problem says nothing else is produced, so I think we can ignore binding energy or any other factors. So the total energy after fission is (0.33
