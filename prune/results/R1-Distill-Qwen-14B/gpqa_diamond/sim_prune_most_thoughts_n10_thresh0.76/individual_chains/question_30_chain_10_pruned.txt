Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Let me think through this step by step. Hmm, the question says the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I remember that when a material absorbs light, it excites electrons, and when they relax, they emit light. But wait, the question is about the color of light absorbed, not emitted. Oh right, because the dye emits the complementary color of what it absorbs. Because if a substance emits green light, for example, it must have absorbed the complementary color, which is magenta. But wait, no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again. 

Wait, no, that's about color addition. I think in terms of the electromagnetic spectrum, lower energy corresponds to longer wavelengths. The energy of the photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/位, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and 位 is wavelength. So higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths. 

The energy given is 2.3393 eV. I need to convert that to wavelength to know the color. So first, calculate the wavelength. Let me recall, 1 eV is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So 2.3393 eV times that gives the energy in joules. Then, using E = hc/位, rearrange to find 位 = hc/E.

Wait, let me get the values straight. Planck's constant h is 6.626 x
