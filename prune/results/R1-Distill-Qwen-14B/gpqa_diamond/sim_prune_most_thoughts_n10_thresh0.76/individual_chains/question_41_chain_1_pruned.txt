Okay, so I have this physics problem about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, there's something about how different frames of reference affect measurements.

Alright, the problem says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction. So the glass's velocity is v towards the observer, and the light's speed within the glass depends on n, right? Because the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is given as 1 here. So normally, the speed of light in the glass would be 1/n.

But wait, the glass is moving. So this is a case where we have to consider the relative motion between the medium (glass) and the observer. I think this involves the addition of velocities, like in special relativity.

Oh right, the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add them normally. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(cÂ²)).

Wait, but in this case, the light is in the glass
