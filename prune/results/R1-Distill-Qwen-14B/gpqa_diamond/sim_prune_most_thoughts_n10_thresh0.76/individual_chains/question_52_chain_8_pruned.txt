Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…, and the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm. So, I remember that in LTE, the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2 or n2/n1? Oh, right, the ratio depends on which level is higher in energy. If level 2 is higher than level 1, then the ratio n2/n1 would decrease as temperature increases because the exponential term becomes smaller. Since the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots, that probably means that n1/n2 increases because the denominator (n2) is getting smaller.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem states that when there are spots, the overall Teff is lower. So without spots, Teff is 6000 K, with spots, 5500 K. The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 and level 2 (n1/n2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, initially, when there's no spots, the ratio is higher than when there are spots. So, the ratio is higher at higher Teff.

Wait, let's clarify. The ratio without spots is higher than when there are spots. So, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots. Since n1/n2 is higher without spots, this factor would be greater than 1.

So, according to the Boltzmann equation, the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp((E2-E1)/(k T)) divided by (g2/g1). Wait, no. Let's get the equation right. The ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T)
