Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets orbiting a star. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. There are two planets, Planet1 and Planet2. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 Earth radii, while Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius 1.3 Earth. Both orbits are circular. 

They detected these planets using transit and radial velocity methods. The RV method measures Doppler shifts. The shifts are given as 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2 on the forbidden [OI] line at 6300 Å. The question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, assuming same albedo.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, albedo is the same for both, so that cancels out in the ratio.

First, I need to relate the Doppler shifts to the planets' orbital velocities. The Doppler shift (also called radial velocity) depends on the mass of the planet and the star and the distance of the planet from the star.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K can be given by the formula:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) 

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the more simplified version when the planet's mass is much less than the star, which is probably the case here since planets are much less massive than stars.

So the RV semi-amplitude formula simplifies to:

K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P * (1 - e²)^0.5)) )

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the formula from memory is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c * P) ) )^(1/3) * ( M_planet * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, the Doppler shift is periodic due to the planet's orbit. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given, and it's inversely proportional to the mass of the star (wait, no, K is proportional to planet mass and inversely proportional to cube root of (M_star + M_planet) and so on).

But since the star's mass is much larger than the planet, M
