Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think through what I remember about this. 

Radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines as the planet orbits, causing the star to move towards and away from us. The shift in wavelength depends on the star's velocity. The amplitude of this shift is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period, I think.

The question says both stars have the same mass (like the Sun) and each has a planet similar to Neptune. So the planet masses are similar. Both planets are in circular orbits, which probably simplifies things since eccentricity wouldn't complicate the calculations.

The key data is the periodic shift of the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by a formula. Let me recall... I think K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3). But wait, since M_p is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune is much less than Sun), that term can be approximated as 1. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, another approach: The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) where v is the velocity of the star. I think the formula is K = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (2π)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(c)), but I might be mixing up terms. Alternatively, another version I remember is K = (28.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i / M_jupiter) * (P / (year))^(−1/3) * (M_star / M_sun)^(−2/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the relation between K and the orbital period, given the same star mass and planet mass. Since both stars have the same mass (M) and their planets have similar masses (
