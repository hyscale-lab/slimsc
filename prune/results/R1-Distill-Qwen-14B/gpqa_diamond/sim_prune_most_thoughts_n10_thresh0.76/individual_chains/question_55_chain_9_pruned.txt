Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by breaking down the information given. The compound is an organic one, and the options are different types of propenyl or butenyl acetates. Hmm.

The 1H NMR data has four signals. Let me list them out:

1. 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16 Hz)
2. 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets)
3. 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet)
4. 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet)

I remember that in acetates, like ethyl acetate or propenyl acetate, the structure is usually an ester where the acetyl group is attached to an oxygen, which is connected to another group. So the structure would be something like R-O-CO-R', where R is from the propenyl or butenyl group.

Looking at the NMR peaks:

The singlet at 2.1 ppm is likely the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (COO). In acetates, that's a common feature, so that makes sense. So that's the OAc part.

Now the other signals come from the R group. The 1.6 ppm doublet is probably a methyl group attached to something else. Maybe a CH2 or CH group next to a double bond? Because in allylic positions, you often get splitting like that.

The big clue is the 7.0 ppm peak, which is a doublet with a large coupling constant (J=16 Hz). Large couplings usually indicate trans coupling in double bonds. For example, in a trans-alkene, the two protons on the double bond are on opposite sides, so their coupling is larger. But wait, what about in a vinyl group attached to an oxygen?

Wait, in allylic systems, the coupling between the vinyl protons and the adjacent (allylic) protons can be around 10-18 Hz. So if this is a coupling between two protons on adjacent carbons, maybe that's what's happening here.

Looking at the 5.5 ppm peak, which is a doublet of quadruplets. That suggests that this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. Maybe it's a proton on a double bond that's next to two other protons.

Let me think about the structures of the options:

Options are Cis- and Trans- propenyl and butenyl acetates.

Propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CH2 with a substituent. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but that's for propenyl. Wait, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but if it's an ester, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-R. Wait, no, in this case, the ester is formed between an alcohol (like propanol) and acetic acid. So for propenyl, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3 (since acetate is from acetic acid, which is CH3COO-). So propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

But wait, that's the structure for propenyl. Now, the cis and trans refer to the configuration around the double bond. But wait, propenyl doesn't have a double bond in the R group; wait, propenyl would have a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. So for propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, that's actually allyl acetate, right? Because allyl is CH2=CHCH2-. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the terms.

Wait, let's get this straight. Propenyl groups are CH2=CH2 with a substituent. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-, but wait, propenyl
