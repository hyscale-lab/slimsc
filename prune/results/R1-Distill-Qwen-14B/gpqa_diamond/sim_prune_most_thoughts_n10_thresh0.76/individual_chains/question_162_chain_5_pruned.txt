Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a metric I've seen before. Oh right, sometimes metrics are written in terms of coordinates, and the denominator here seems to be something squared, maybe?

So the first thing I should probably do is recognize what kind of geometry this metric represents. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). That rings a bell because for the sphere, the metric often involves terms like (r² - x² - y²) in the denominator, especially in spherical coordinates. But wait, this is in 2D, right? Because it's only dx² and dy².

Wait, no, maybe it's for a pseudosphere or something else. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. The metric for hyperbolic space usually has terms like (1/(1 + (x² + y²)/a²)) but this doesn't look exactly like that. Alternatively, for a sphere with positive curvature, the metric would have (r² - x² - y²) in the denominator, but the denominator here is 4 - x² - y². Oh, so maybe this is a sphere of radius 2 because 4 is 2 squared.

Wait, but the question says it's a pseudosphere. Oh, right, pseudosphere is a
