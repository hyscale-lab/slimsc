Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where n is a unit vector, and σ are the Pauli spin matrices. Hmm, I've seen Pauli matrices before in spin systems.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, right? Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. So the dot product σ · n would be n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. Oh right, because n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. That makes sense.

Now, Hamiltonian operators are Hermitian, which means their eigenvalues are real. But I don't think that's directly helpful here. I'm more interested in finding the eigenvalues of this particular H. 

I remember that for a spin-½ particle, the eigenvalues of the spin component in a direction are ± ħ/2. But wait, the Hamiltonian here is H = ε σ · n. So, when you have σ · n, that's like projecting the spin operator onto the direction of n. 

Wait, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So σ is 2S/ħ. Oh, right. So if H is ε σ · n, that's the same as ε (σ · n) = ε (2S · n)/ħ. Which is (2ε/ħ) (S · n). 

But wait, S · n for a spin-½ system has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So when you multiply by 2ε/ħ, what do you get? Let's see: 2ε/ħ times (± ħ/2) equals ± ε. 

Wait, hold on. Let me think again. S · n has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So if H is proportional to S · n, then H's eigenvalues would be proportional to that. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, another approach: the Pauli matrices σ satisfy σ · n having eigenvalues ±1. Because for any unit vector n, the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1. Let me see why.

Suppose we have σ · n = n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. The eigenvalues of this matrix would be the same as the eigenvalues of the vector in the direction of n. Since the Pauli matrices are 2x2, their trace is zero and determinant is -1. The eigenvalues would satisfy λ^2 - (trace)λ + determinant = 0 → λ^2 - 0λ -1 = 0 → λ = ±1. So yes, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

Wait, but our Hamiltonian is H = ε (σ · n). So the eigenvalues of H would be ε multiplied by the eigenvalues of σ · n. So that would be ε * 1 and ε * (-1). So the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε.

But wait wait, I thought earlier that in terms of spin, the eigenvalues involve ħ. Maybe I'm mixing two different things here
