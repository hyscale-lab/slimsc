Okay, so I have this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions. Depending on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's ortho/para or meta directing, the product will form accordingly.

The question is asking me to arrange the substances 1 to 6 in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the one with the least para yield comes first, and the one with the highest comes last.

Wait, the weight fraction of the para-isomer. That depends on how much para product is formed relative to other possible products. For example, if a substituent is meta-directing, then the para product won't form as much, maybe even negligible. But if the substituent is para-directing and activating, then a lot of para product will form.

Let me list out each substituent and determine their directing effects.

Substance 1: C6H5-CH3. The substituent is methyl. Methyl is an activating group (since it's an electron-donating alkyl group). It's an ortho/para director. So, the incoming bromine will attack at the para position more than others. So, para product will be major.

Substance 2: C6H5-COOC2H5. The substituent is ester group, OCOEt (ethyl ester). Wait, esters are deactivating because the oxygen in the ester is electron-withdrawing. But wait, esters are meta directors? Or do they have a different effect? Let me think. The ester group is an ortho/para director because the electron-withdrawing effect is through resonance, but the oxygen can donate some electrons through lone pairs. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused. No, wait, ester groups are deactivating but ortho/para directing. Because the ring is activated at ortho and para positions, even though the group is deactivating, because the lone pairs on oxygen can donate through resonance. So for example, nitro groups are meta directing and deactivating, but ester groups are ortho/para and deactivating.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ester group is an ortho/para director. Because the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group but can donate electrons through resonance into the ring. So for example, the nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta directing. But the ester group is less deactivating, so it's ortho/para. So in this case, the substituent is OCOEt, which is an ortho/para director.

So in substance 2, the substituent is ester, so the incoming Br would go to ortho and para positions. So the para product would be a major component.

Substance 3: C6H5-Cl. The substituent is Cl. Chlorine is a deactivating group because it's electronegative, but it's an ortho/para director. Wait, but wait, Cl is a halogen. It's a bit tricky because it's an electron-withdrawing through induction but can donate electrons through resonance (since it has lone pairs). So, it's an
