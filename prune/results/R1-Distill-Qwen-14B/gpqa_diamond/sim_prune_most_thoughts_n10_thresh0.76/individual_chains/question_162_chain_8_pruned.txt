Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because I see only dx and dy. That makes sense because a pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface.

Wait, pseudosphere—oh right, it's a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, what's a pseudosphere in this context? I think in 2D, it's often represented using hyperbolic geometry. But I'm not entirely sure about the metric form here.

The question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. So, wait, in standard terms, the area of a sphere in 2D is 4πr². But a pseudosphere is different. Or does the formula change?

Wait, but pseudosphere in 2D would have a different area. Alternatively, wait, maybe the metric given is that of a hyperbolic space. Or perhaps it's a specific case, like a two-dimensional space with a certain metric, and we need to compute the area.

Wait, the metric is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me see, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), so as x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator goes to zero, which probably means the metric becomes singular there
