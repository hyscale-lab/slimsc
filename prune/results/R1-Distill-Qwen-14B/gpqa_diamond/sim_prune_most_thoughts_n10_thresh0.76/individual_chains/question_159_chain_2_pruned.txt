Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try my best.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. Then, the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. Wait, I remember that in quasars, emission lines can be broad or narrow, but what does the peak wavelength tell me here? Oh, right, it's probably related to redshift. Because if the quasar is moving away from us, its light is redshifted. The peak wavelength being longer than what it should be in the rest frame suggests redshift.

Wait, what's the rest wavelength for that peak? Well, near infrared and optical... I think that peak at 790 nm might be the Lyman-alpha emission line, but wait, no. Lyman-alpha is at about 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But wait, if it's observed at 790 nm, that's much longer. So that would mean a lot of redshift. Let me calculate the redshift, z.

The formula I remember is observed wavelength (λ_obs) equals rest wavelength (λ_rest) multiplied by (1 + z). So λ_rest is 121 nm for Lyman-alpha, I think. Let's see: 790 nm / 121 nm = approximately 6.528. So 1 + z = 6.528, which gives z ≈ 5.528. Wait, that's a high redshift. So the quasar is very far away.

But wait, the question is about the comoving distance. Oh right, comoving distance is a way to measure distance in cosmology, considering the expansion of the universe. The formula for comoving distance is D_c = (c/H0) * integral from 0 to z of 1/sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z')^3 + Ω_lambda*(1+z')^3 + ...). But wait, the universe is flat, so Ω_k is zero.

Given that the cosmological parameters are Ω_m = 0.3, Ω_lambda = 0.7, and H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. I think these values are standard for the Lambda-CDM model.

So I need to compute the comoving distance at redshift z=5.5. But wait, I don't remember the exact integral. Is there a way to approximate it? I know that for high redshifts, the integral doesn't change much after a certain point because dark energy starts to dominate, but at z=5, matter density might be higher.

Alternatively, maybe I can use an approximate formula or refer to known values. Wait, I remember that the comoving distance for z=1 is about 1.4 billion light-years, but that's a rough estimate. For much higher redshifts, like z=2, the distance is around 3-4 billion ly, but that's not precise.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of Hubble lengths. The Hubble constant is 70 km/s/Mpc. So the Hubble distance is c/H0. Let's compute that. c is about 3e5 km/s. H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. So Hubble distance is (3e5 /70) Mpc. 3e5 divided by 70 is approximately 4285.7 Mpc. So about 4.285 Gpc. So roughly 4.3 Gpc.

But that's just the Hubble distance. The comoving distance for a higher z is larger. So for z=5.5, the comoving distance should be more than 4.3 Gpc. How much more?

Wait, I think the comoving distance D_c can be approximated as (c/H0) * f(z), where f(z) is a function that depends on the cosmological parameters and the redshift. For matter-dominated universe, f(z) is (2/(1+z)) * ln(1 + (1+z)/sqrt(Ω_m)) ), but I'm not sure. Maybe for dark energy dominated, it's a bit different.

Alternatively, maybe I can remember some approximate values. I think that for z=1, D_c is about 2 Gpc (but I'm not sure, maybe 1.4?), and for z=2, it's around 3 Gpc? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the expansion is accelerating. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the lookback time and comoving distance. Let me think again.

Wait, I found a resource once that provided comoving distance for various z. Let's see, for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3, Ω_lambda=0.7, here are some approximate comoving distances:

z=0.5: ~1.4 Gpc

z=1: ~1.9 Gpc

z=2: ~5.4 Gpc

z=3: ~8 Gpc

Wait, I'm not exactly sure, but I'm trying to think. Wait, maybe a better approach: For a given z, the comoving distance is the integral from 0 to z of c / H(a) da, where a is the scale factor (a=1/(1+z)).

But integrating H(a) in a flat universe with matter and dark energy is tricky. Maybe I can use a tool or approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question is giving multiple-choice options, so maybe I can reason which option is correct.

The options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. For z=5.5, which is a high redshift, the comoving distance should be on the order of several gigaparsecs. Let me think about the Hubble distance being
