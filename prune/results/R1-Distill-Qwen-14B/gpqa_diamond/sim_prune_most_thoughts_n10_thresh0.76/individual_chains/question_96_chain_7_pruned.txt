Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the black hole's entropy.

Wait, entropy of a black hole... right, I remember that the entropy is related to the area of the event horizon. The formula I think is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area. Oh wait, another way to write that is using the Schwarzschild radius. So the area A is 4π R_s², where R_s is the Schwarzschild radius. Alternatively, I can express A as (2π dθ)^2 * (d^2) or something like that, since angular size relates to the actual size via the distance.

Wait, let's back up. The angular size θ is given in degrees, but I think I'll need to convert it into radians because when calculating linear size from angular size and distance, the small angle approximation is used, which assumes θ in radians is approximately equal to the ratio of the size over the distance.

So, the formula for angular size is θ ≈ (size)/(distance). So the size L of the event horizon would be approximately θ (in radians) multiplied by d.

Wait, but wait, the Schwarzschild radius R_s is proportional to
