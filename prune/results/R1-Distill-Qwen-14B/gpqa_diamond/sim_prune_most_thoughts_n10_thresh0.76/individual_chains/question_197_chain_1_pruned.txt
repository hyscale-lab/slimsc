Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I'll need to look at the IR and NMR data provided to figure out what Compound X is, and then determine what reaction occurs with red phosphorus and HI.

First, let me understand the reagents involved. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, but wait, no, wait. Oh, right! Red phosphorus with HI is used for the substitution of hydroxyl groups in alcohols. Specifically, it's used to convert alcohols to halides. So, if Compound X has an alcohol group, this reaction would replace the -OH with a -I (iodide).

Wait, so the reaction is probably an acid-catalyzed substitution, like maybe converting an alcohol to an iodide. But wait, red phosphorus and HI is a method for converting alcohols to iodides. So, the reaction would be: R-OH + P (red) + HI â†’ R-I + other products.

So, if that's the case, the starting material must be an alcohol. So the product would be a corresponding iodide.

But wait, looking at the options, I don't see any iodide compounds listed. The options are A: propanoic acid, B: isobutyl benzene, C: benzoic acid, D: isobutyl methyl benzene. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but something else. Or maybe the starting compound isn't an alcohol but something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe Compound X is a carboxylic acid. Because if you have a carboxylic acid, and you treat it with a reducing agent like red phosphorus and HI, perhaps you're reducing the carboxylic acid group.

Wait, wait, red phosphorus and HI could be used in the reduction of a carbonyl group. For example, in the case of esters or ketones, but wait, for carboxylic acids, maybe the reaction is different.

Hold on. Let me think: Carboxylic acids can be converted to alcohols under certain conditions, but I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis.

Wait, the IR data might help. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak. 1720 is about right for an ester or a ketone, maybe a carboxylic acid? Wait, carboxylic acids typically have a broad peak around 2500-3300 due to O-H stretching as well. Looking at the IR, there's a broad peak between 3400-2500, which could be O-H. So possibly, a carboxylic acid. So 1720 would fit a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have a peak around 1700, but it can be a bit higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, an ester's carbonyl is around 1740-1720. So 1720 is more in the range of an ester or maybe a ketone. Also, the IR has peaks at 1610 and 1450, which are typical for aromatic C=C
