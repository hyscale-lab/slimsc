Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves a reaction between a specific compound and hydrogen bromide. Hmm, I remember that hydrogen bromide (HBr) is often involved in addition reactions, especially with alkenes. So, the starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. I should probably draw the structure to visualize it better.

Wait, the formula is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a butenyl group. Let me break that down. Butenyl would be a four-carbon chain. The substituents are at position 2,2-dimethyl, and the double bond is at position 3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-

But wait, but-3-en-1-yl implies the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, right? Wait, no, butenyl is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait. Let me think again. The butenyl group is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that would be 1-ene. But it's but-3-en-1-yl. Oh, wait, but that's impossible because butenyl is four carbons, so the double bond can't be at position 3. Oh wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the structure CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, that can't be because but is four carbons. So positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that would be impossible because you
