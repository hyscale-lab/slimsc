Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So the question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. The process is gamma-gamma annihilation producing electron-positron pairs, right? The question is asking at what energy the gamma-rays' lifetime in the universe would be limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember something about photon-photon interactions and pair production. I think the key here is to find the energy where the interaction rate is so high that the gamma-ray doesn't live long enough to travel across the universe. So the lifetime is limited by the interaction time.

Wait, how does the interaction rate depend on the gamma-ray's energy? I think the cross-section for photon-photon to electron-positron must be important here. The cross-section probably increases with the energy of the gamma-ray, but how exactly?

The cross-section for gamma + photon -> e+ e- is a function of their energies. The formula, I think, involves the product of the photon's energy and the gamma's energy. Or maybe the square of their sum or something. Oh wait, I remember that the threshold energy for this process is when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to produce the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so for the pair, it's 1.022 MeV. But wait, the CMB photon is much lower energy, so for a gamma-ray photon of energy E, when E * E_cmb >= 1.022 MeV, then the process can happen.

Wait, no, that's not exactly correct. The threshold condition is when the center-of-mass energy is at least 2*mc², so sqrt(s) >= 2m_e c². The square of the center-of-mass energy s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Wait, but since both photons are moving in opposite directions? Or same direction? Oh, wait, no, in the problem, the gamma-ray is moving through the CMB photons which are in all directions. So for the process to be possible, the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame must be at least 1.022 MeV.

Wait,
