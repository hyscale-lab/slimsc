Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me try to figure out the steps needed.

First, I should draw the structure to visualize better. Benzene ring with substituents: at position 1 is an ethoxy group (OEt), at position 2 is tert-butyl (t-Bu), and at position 3 is nitro (NO2). So the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions. Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering would be such that the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3? Or maybe I should think about their relative positions. Let me imagine the benzene ring with substituents in meta and para positions or something else.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So numbering starts such that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So positions 1,2,3 are all adjacent. Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 would be adjacent, right? Hmm, but that might lead to some steric hindrance, but the question is about the synthesis steps regardless.

So the substituents are ethoxy (OEt), tert-butyl, and nitro groups. The problem is figuring out the order of reactions to introduce these groups on the benzene ring.

I remember that benzene can undergo electrophilic substitution reactions. The order in which substituents are introduced can affect the product because each substituent directs the incoming electrophile. So the directing effect of each group is important here.

Let me recall: activating groups (like -OEt, which is an electron-donating group) are ortho/para directors. Deactivating groups (like nitro, which is meta director) are different. So, the order in which we introduce these substituents will determine where the next group goes.

So, the target has three substituents. Let's think about the steps.

First, perhaps the most challenging substituent to introduce is the nitro group, which is a strong meta director. Wait, but maybe not. Let me think: when adding substituents, each step affects where the next group goes. So the first substituent set will direct the next substitution.

Wait, but the problem is to add ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Let's think about their activating or deactivating nature. The ethoxy group is activating (ortho/para), and the nitro is deactivating (meta). The tert-butyl is an alkyl group, which is activating (ortho/para).

So, the order of introducing these substituents is crucial. For example, if we introduce nitro first, since it's meta-directing and deactivating, the next substituents might go to meta positions relative to the nitro. But wait, the target has nitro at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added last, because adding nitro can be a bit tricky, especially since nitration is a strong reaction.

Wait, but nitration is typically done under strong conditions. Let me think about the steps.

So, the target structure is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me try to imagine the benzene ring. Let's number the ring: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So substituents are in 1, 2, 3 positions. Wait, that would mean they are adjacent, but in a benzene ring, each position is adjacent
