Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter. So Planet_1 orbits much faster than Planet_2.

Wait, orbital period being shorter means it's closer to the star. Because the orbital period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law. So Planet_1 is closer in. Also, both have circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit.

The host stars have the same radii because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but they match in size. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. Oh, but same radius, so higher mass with same radius implies higher density. But how does that affect transit probability?

Transit probability is mainly about the size of the planet relative to the star and the inclination of the orbit. I think the formula for the probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)² times something else? Or wait, I'm a bit fuzzy.

Wait, the transit probability P depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, right? Because the planet has to be in the right part of the sky for its orbit to cross our line of sight. So the probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet), where a_planet is the semi-major axis. Because a_planet is the distance from the star, so for a given star size, a closer planet would have a lower probability since the orbital plane needs to be edge-on for a transit. Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, the transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, multiplied by the probability that the inclination is correct. Let me think again.

The formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p * (1-e^2)^0.5)), but wait, that's more about the depth and duration. Oh no, wait another thing. The probability that a planet transits is given by the ratio of the size of the star to the distance of the planet's orbit (a) times some constant. So P ≈ (R_star / a_planet) * (something). Or more accurately, I think the transit probability is (R_*/ a_p) * (something). Wait, no, I might have to get the formula right.

Wait, I think the probability of a planet transiting is approximately (R_*/ a_p)² * (something about the orbital plane). Or maybe it's (R_*/ a_p) multiplied by the probability that the orbital inclination is correct. Oh right, the transit probability is given by the formula:

P = (R_p + R_*)² / (a_p² c) ), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is (R_* / a_p)²
