Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to work through this step by step.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2D metric because there are dx and dy. So this is a 2-dimensional spacetime? Or maybe just a 2-dimensional surface? I'm a bit confused because in relativity, the metric usually has four dimensions, but here it's two. Maybe it's a conformally flat metric or something.

I remember that the area element in a 2D metric is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, since it's 2D, the metric is in terms of dx and dy, so the area should be based on the determinant. Wait, the metric tensor g has components g_xx, g_xy, g_yx, g_yy. But in this case, the metric is diagonal because the cross terms are zero. So the matrix is diagonal with g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²) and g_yy the same as g_xx. So the determinant is (g_xx * g_yy) - (g_xy)^2. Since g_xy is zero, the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2.

So the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, no, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy only if the metric is expressed in terms of orthonormal coordinates. Alternatively, for a diagonal metric, the area element is sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) dx dy. Wait, since g_xy is zero, the determinant is (g_xx)(g_yy) - 0, so sqrt(det g) is sqrt(g_xx g_yy). Since g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), then sqrt( (32/(4 - ... ))^2 ) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the area of a pseudosphere. A pseudosphere is a surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? Or wait, in the context of general relativity, a pseudosphere might refer to a surface with constant negative curvature. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Wait, alternatively, sometimes in higher dimensions, a pseudosphere can be the boundary of a 5-dimensional ball in Minkowski space, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps in 2D, the metric given is a model of hyperbolic space. Because the metric resembles a hyperbolic metric. The standard hyperbolic metric in Poincaré coordinates is ds² = (dx² + dy²)/(x² + y² - 1), but that's for a hyperbolic plane. Wait, no, wait: the Poincaré model for hyperbolic plane has ds² = ( (dx² + dy²) )/(1 - (x² + y²)) )², or something like that. Hmm, not exactly matching this.

Wait, let me think. The given metric is ds²
