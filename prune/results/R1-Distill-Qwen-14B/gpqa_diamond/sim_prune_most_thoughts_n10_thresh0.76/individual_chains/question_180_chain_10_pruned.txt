Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, which probably means we don't have to worry about kinetic energy contributions. 

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals in Joules.

Hmm. I think this is a problem about electric potential energy. Since all the charges are the same, they're all 2e each. So each charge would repel the others because they're all positive.

The system's total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But wait, since the system is isolated, and all the charges except one are at a fixed distance from P, perhaps we can calculate the potential energy contributions.

Wait, but I remember that the potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.988×10^9 N·m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

Since the system is isolated and all the charges except the 13th are at 2 meters from P, the 13th charge is fixed there. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge at P.

So, first, I need to calculate the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the other 12 charges. Then, I also need to account for the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges that are at 2 meters apart. Because each of those 12 is the same distance from P, but what about their mutual distances? Hmm, wait, are the 12 charges arranged in some specific formation, or are they all just at 2 meters from P but their mutual distances are irrelevant? Because the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but it doesn't specify their arrangement relative to each other.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So maybe the charges are arranged in
