Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH and the various dissociation steps. Let me think through this step by step.

The solution has 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.

Wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it dissociates. So, the forms present are H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (phosphate). Orthophosphate is the fully protonated form, H3PO4, but in solution, especially with other salts, it might not be the main species.

The problem gives me the masses of the two salts. So, I should calculate the moles of each first.

First, let's compute the moles of KH2PO4. The molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that: approximately 1 / 136 is about 0.00735 moles.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O, the molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So moles are 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.00561 moles.

Wait, but the solution volume is 0.2 liters. So the concentrations would be moles divided by 0.2 L.

But I'm not sure if I can just add them directly because these salts might influence each other's dissociation. Plus, the phosphoric acid has three dissociation steps, each with different Ka values.

Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) dissociates as:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So the solution's pH will affect which species is predominant. But wait, the solution here is a mixture of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, which are conjugate acid-base pairs. They should buffer the solution around a certain pH.

I think this is a buffer solution problem, where the pH depends on the ratio of the two components. So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would come into play here. Let me recall: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. So, the relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = about 7.207.

Wait, no, wait, pKa is negative log of Ka. So pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) with a negative sign. Let me calculate that: log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 0.79 -8 = -7.21, but since pKa is -log, it's 7.21.

So the Henderson equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, the salts provided are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ + H2PO4^-.
