Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that there's a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii and mass is 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how spots affect the effective temperature. I remember that starspots are cooler regions, so when they cover part of the star's surface, the overall brightness as seen from afar would change. But effective temperature depends on the total luminosity and the surface area. Oh right, the effective temperature is calculated based on the star's luminosity and radius. So when spots cover part of the surface, the emitted flux from that part is less, so the overall luminosity decreases, leading to a lower Teff.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels—level 1 and level 2. The ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Hmm. So I think this is about the Boltzmann equation for populations of energy levels. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy), E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So the ratio depends on the temperature. If the temperature changes, this ratio changes. Now, the star's effective temperature when it has spots is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K). So, if the ratio is n1/n2 (wait, the problem says level 1 and level 2—so what's the ratio being considered?), the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, the ratio is lower.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2. Because if the temperature goes down, according to the equation, the exponential term gets smaller. So if E2 is higher than E1 (since level 2 is a higher energy), then (E2-E1) is positive. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term gets smaller. So n2/n1 would decrease. But the question says that the ratio observed decreases when the star has spots. So which ratio are they talking about?

Wait, the problem says "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)"—when there are spots, the ratio decreases. So let me clarify: when the star has spots, the temperature is lower. So the ratio (n1/n2) would be higher or lower?

Wait, wait. Let's make sure. The ratio n1/n2 is
