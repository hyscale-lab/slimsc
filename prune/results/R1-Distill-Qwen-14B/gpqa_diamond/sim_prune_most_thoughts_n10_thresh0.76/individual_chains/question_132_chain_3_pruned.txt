Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these. But I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that there's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, each with the molecular formula C10H14. So both are tetramethylbenzenes, right? Because benzene is C6H6, and adding four methyl groups would make it C10H14. Alternatively, maybe one is diethyl, but wait, the molecular formula given is C10H14. Let me think: a diethyl group would be C2H5CH2CH2? No, wait, diethyl is two ethyl groups. Each ethyl is C2H5, so two would be C4H10. Adding that to benzene (C6H5) would give C10H15, but the molecular formula is C10H14. Hmm, so that doesn't fit. So probably both are tetramethylbenzenes.

The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each with a 1:1 ratio. Wait, but the options include 1,4-diethylbenzene as one of the possibilities. But if the molecular formula is C10H14, maybe the diethyl is part of the structure. Let me calculate: benzene is C6H6, two ethyl groups (each is C2H5) would be adding C4H10. So 6 +4 is 10 carbons, and H:6 +10 =16. But the formula is C10H14. Hmm, that's 16 H's, but the compound is C10H14. So maybe the diethyl doesn't fit. Unless it's a different substitution pattern. Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the diethyl's structure has some double bonds? No, diethyl is typically single bonds. Maybe the substitution is such that it's not adding up. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong and the diethyl is correct. Let me think again. Benzene ring with two ethyl groups: each ethyl is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl contributes 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since the ring is attached via a CH2). Wait, no. Each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So each adds 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens? Wait, no. Each ethyl group is CH2CH3. When attached to the benzene, it's -CH2CH3, so each contributes 5 hydrogens. Two ethyl groups would be 10 hydrogens. The benzene has 5 hydrogens (if it's mono-substituted, but wait, if it's diethyl, it's para or ortho substitution.

Wait, but let's not get stuck here. Let me proceed with the NMR data first.

The aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm) shows two singlets, each integrating to 1:1. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each singlet must be from one of the compounds. So each compound contributes one
