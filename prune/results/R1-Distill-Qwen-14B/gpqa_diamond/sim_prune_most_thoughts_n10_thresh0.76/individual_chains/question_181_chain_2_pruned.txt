Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain reaction branch stops. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves a few different processes, like the proton-proton chain, right? And the pp-III branch is one of those steps. Oh wait, the pp chain has a couple of branches: pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each branch contributes to the overall neutrino flux in different ways.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes? Oh, that's roughly how long it takes for sunlight to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the reaction stopped 8.5 minutes ago, that means the neutrinos from that reaction would stop reaching us now. But wait, neutrinos move at almost the speed of light, so they would have been traveling for that 8.5 minutes. So the flux of neutrinos from the pp-III branch would drop to zero almost immediately here on Earth. But what about the other reactions?

The question is about the ratio of fluxes in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the pp-III branch contributes to these bands and how stopping it affects the flux ratio.

I think the pp-III branch produces a specific type of neutrino. Let me recall. The main neutrinos from the Sun are from the proton-proton chain. The pp-I branch produces neutrinos at a certain energy, and the pp-III (maybe it's the so-called "hep" or high-energy proton branch) produces higher energy neutrinos.

Wait, in the pp chain, the main reaction is pp -> deuterium, and then it can branch. The pp-I branch goes to 3He via a triplet state, and the pp-II and pp-III branches go to singlet states. Oh, wait, or is it that the pp-III branch is when two protons combine with a carbon-12 nucleus? So, the pp-III branch is the so-called "carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle" part? No, wait, the CNO cycle is a different process altogether, more involved with heavier elements. Hmm.
