Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by recalling what I remember about ESPRESSO. I think ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Paranal. It's known for its precision in measuring stellar velocities, which is useful for things like detecting exoplanets through the radial velocity method.

The question is asking how many of the listed stars have a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So each star's detectability depends on whether it meets this S/N threshold.

Let me look at each option and determine if it's detectable. 

First, I should probably figure out the factors that affect S/N. The signal here would be the star's brightness, and the noise is due to various sources like background noise, readout noise, etc. So a brighter star (lower magnitude) would have a higher S/N. Also, the exposure time is fixed at 1 hour, and the instrument's efficiency matters too.

The stars are given with either their names or RA, DEC, absolute magnitude, and distance. So for each star, I need to calculate or determine its apparent magnitude because that's what determines how bright it appears to us, which in turn affects the S/N.

Wait, absolute magnitude is given for options c, d, e, f. Absolute magnitude (M) is how bright a star would appear at 10 parsecs. So to find apparent magnitude (m), I can use the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d) where d is distance in parsecs.

So for each of these, I'll compute m.

Let's go through each option:

a) Canopus. I remember Canopus is a bright star. I think it's one of the brightest stars in the sky. Let me check. Oh wait, Canopus is a first-magnitude star. So m is about 0.7 or something. That's very bright, so S/N should be good.

b) Polaris. Polaris is the North Star. I think it's a second or third magnitude. Let me think, it's around 2.0. So m is about 2.0. Still bright, but not as bright as Canopus.

c) Star with Mv=15, at 10 pc. So m = 15 + 5 + 5 log10(10). Log10(10)=1, so 5*1=5. So m=15+5+5=25? Wait, no, wait. Distance is 10 pc, so the distance modulus is 5*(log10(10)) -5 = 0. So m = M + distance modulus = 15 + 0 =15. Wait, I think the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. Or wait, correction: The distance modulus is m - M = 5 log10(d) -5. So m = M + 5
