Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB. Hmm, let me see. The question is about determining the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the process where a gamma-ray annihilates with a CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair. The options are all in the GeV range, so this must be a high-energy physics problem.

I remember that in particle physics, when a high-energy photon interacts with another photon, they can produce electron-positron pairs if their combined energy is sufficient. The key here is probably the threshold energy required for this process. Oh right, the threshold condition for pair production requires that the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame is at least twice the rest mass of the electron (since each electron has a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV, so two would be 1.022 MeV).

Wait, but wait. The CMB photons are low energy, around 1e-3 eV. So the gamma-ray must have enough energy to, when combined with a CMB photon, produce the necessary energy. But in the lab frame, how does that work? I think the reaction is gamma + photon → e+ + e-, so the two photons (gamma and CMB) must have sufficient combined energy and the right energies to produce the pair.

I remember that for two photons colliding, the condition for pair production is that the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame has to be at least twice the electron mass. Alternatively, using the invariant quantity s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2 (since photons have E = pc). When s >= (2m_e c²)^2, then pair production is possible.

Wait, but each photon's momentum is E/c, right? So for two photons moving in opposite directions, their momenta would add vectorially. Let me think: suppose one photon is the gamma-ray with energy E_gamma, and the other is the CMB photon with energy E_photon ≈ 1e-3 eV. Let's say they're moving head-on. So in the lab frame, their momenta are in opposite directions, which would add when considering the invariant s.

So the invariant s would be (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (p_gamma c - p_photon c)^2. Since photons have E = pc, so p = E/(c). Wait, but wait, for a photon moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is negative, so p_photon would be -E_photon/(c). So p_photon c = -E_photon.

So s = (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - ( (E_gamma / c) * c + (E_photon / c) * c )^2? Wait, no. Let me correct that. Wait, the momenta are in opposite directions, so when calculating p1 + p2, it's (E_gamma/(c)) - (E_photon/(c))) since they're opposite. So the vector sum for the momenta is (E_gamma - E_photon)/(c) * c, because each p is E/c in their respective directions.

Wait, maybe I should approach this more carefully. Let's write the four-momentum of each photon. The gamma photon has four-momentum (E_gamma/c, E_gamma/c * direction vector). The CMB photon has (E_photon/c, -E_photon/c * direction vector), assuming they're moving towards each other.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the invariant squared s. The invariant s is (p1 + p2)^2, where p1 and p2 are the four-momenta of the two photons.

Each photon's four-momentum is (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z). For simplicity, let's assume they're moving along the x-axis. So for the gamma photon, which is moving in the positive x direction, the four-momentum would be (E_gamma/c, E_gamma/(c^2)*c, 0, 0) → (E_gamma/c, E_gamma/c, 0, 0). Wait, wait, no: the three-vector part of four-m
