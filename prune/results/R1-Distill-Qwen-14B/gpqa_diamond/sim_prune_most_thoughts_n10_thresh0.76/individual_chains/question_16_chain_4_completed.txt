Okay, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about optical activity. Let me think through each compound one by one. I remember that a compound can show optical activity if it has chiral centers, meaning it has a carbon atom with four different substituents. Also, the compound shouldn't have a plane of symmetry or an internal plane that makes it achiral despite having chiral centers.

So the question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many of them are optically active. Let's go through them one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Let me draw the structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has a Cl, a CH2CH(CH3), and two hydrogens? Wait, no, the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait, wait, wait. Wait, butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but in this case, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group (CH(CH3)), and the other substituents. So structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, wait. Let me think: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, and a methyl on C2. So it's Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is CH2Cl-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3)?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write it more clearly. The compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would be CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3. Then 1-chloro would replace a hydrogen on the first carbon with Cl. So it's ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, because but-1-ene is four carbons. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it becomes ClCH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again: the structure is CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3. Then 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon: Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Hmm, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond. Wait, no. Maybe it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or Cl attached to the double bond? Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1 has Cl, a CH2 group (maybe), and two other substituents.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl, a methyl group, and two other groups. Wait, no, but 2-methyl would be on C2. So on C1: Cl, double bond to C2, and two more substituents. Let me draw:

C1: Cl, double bond to C2, and two CH2 groups? Or maybe it's Cl, two CH3 groups, and a double bond.

Wait, maybe I should think of the structure as CHCl2-CH2... No, perhaps it's better to think in terms of substituents. For (Z) configuration, the highest priority groups on each carbon of the double bond should be on the same side.

But regardless, the key point is whether this molecule has a chiral center. So looking at the molecule: C1 is Cl, double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group (CH(CH3)) and another substituent. Wait, but if the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2, then C1 is CHCl, and C2 is CH(CH3). So the substituents on C1 are Cl, two CH2 groups, and the double bond. Wait, no, but in a double bond, the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, because the double bond is between C1 and C2, so it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2? No, wait but but-1-ene is four carbons. So structure: C1: Cl attached, double bond to C2. So C1 has Cl, a CH2 group (since but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3), but with a methyl substituent on C2.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether this compound has a chiral center. For a chiral center, the carbon must be connected to four different groups.

In 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and then two more CH2 groups attached.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. For optical activity, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. The molecule has a double bond, so the substituents are on either side. C1 has Cl, CH2CH2CH3 (maybe), and the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the molecular structure. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to note that this is a tetrahedral molecule. But wait, a double bond is spÂ² hybridized. So the molecule is planar around the double bond. So, if the molecule is symmetric, it might not have a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is such that the substituents on either side of the double bond are the same, making it not chiral. Wait, for (Z) isomer, high priority groups are on the same side.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think of another approach. Does 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene have any chiral centers? Let's see, the molecule's structure: The first carbon has Cl, a double bond, and two CH2 groups? Or is it CH2Cl attached to a CH(CH3) which is double bonded to another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but as a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2CH3. No, that can't be because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, so ClCH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is ClCH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond, wait that's impossible because that would be CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with double bond between C1 and C2, so CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3 can't have a double bond between C1 and C2 because the double bond would be between C1 and C2 as CH2=CH-CH2-CH3, but with Cl on C1.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, but that's five carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers because the substituents might be arranged symmetrically. For example, if the substituents on either side of the double bond are mirror images, leading to no chiral centers. Or perhaps the molecule itself is symmetric. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe this molecule has no chiral centers, so it's not optically active. Let me move on and come back if I have time.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
   This name is a bit complicated. Let's break it down. It's a hexahydro compound, meaning it has six hydrogen atoms (so perhaps a six-membered ring, but not sure). Methanoisobenzofuran suggests a benzofuran ring fused with a methylene group. The substituent is chloromethylene (CH2Cl) attached at position 8. The stereochemistry is specified as 3aR and 7aS, with E configuration.

I think this molecule is a bicyclic structure, possibly a lactone or something similar. The presence of 'E' indicates a double bond geometry. Now, does this compound have any chiral centers?

Well, the substituents at 3a and 7a are R and S, respectively. So those are chiral centers. But wait, the E configuration refers to the double bond. So the molecule has at least two chiral centers. Therefore, it's chiral and should be optically active. Also, the presence of E configuration doesn't affect the chirality of the centers.

So this compound is optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2 and 3 positions are the two middle CH2 groups. In this case, both positions have methyl groups. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Now, each of the 2 and 3 carbons has substituents. Let's check if they are chiral centers.

For C2: attached groups are HOOC, CH(CH3), two CH3 groups (from the methyl), and another CH(CH3). Wait, no. Let me think: The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So the groups on C2 are:
- one from the carboxylic acid (OOC-)
- one methyl
- one CH(CH3) (the adjacent carbon)
- another substituent?

Wait, let me think. Each CH(CH3) would have:

C2 has:
- a carboxylic acid group (OOC-)
- a methyl (CH3)
- a CH2 group? No, wait, no. Let's write the structure as:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the middle CHs has a methyl group. Now, for each of these carbons (C2 and C3):

At C2: the groups are:
- the left carboxylic acid (OOC-CH2-)
- a methyl (CH3)
- a CH(CH3) (the next carbon)
- and another group, which is a hydrogen? Or is it another substituent?

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to two CH(CH3) groups, a carboxylic acid, and a methyl. Wait, no, wait: Each of these carbons is connected to a CH3, a CH(CH3), and two other groups. Let me think: C2 is connected to:

- OOC- group (from the first acid)
- CH(CH3) (the next carbon)
- CH3 (the methyl)
- and another group? What else? Since it's a tetrahedral carbon, there must be four substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine it as:

C1: O=C(OH)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-C(OH)=O.

So for C2 (the first CH(CH3)): the substituents are:

- O=C(OH)-
- CH(CH3) (C3)
- CH3 (methyl)
- and a hydrogen? Because CH(CH3) would have three substituents: the two CH3 and the adjacent C.

Wait, no, wait. Let me count the bonds. Carbon has four bonds. C2: one bond to C1 (O=C(OH)-), one bond to C3 (CH(CH3)), one bond to CH3, and one bond to H. So substituents are: O=C(OH)-, CH(CH3), CH3, and H. So that's four different groups, making C2 a chiral center.

Similarly, C3 has substituents:

- O=C(OH)- (from C4)
- CH(CH3) (from C2)
- CH3 (methyl)
- and H.

So C3 is also a chiral center. Therefore, this molecule has two chiral centers. Since the configuration is (2R,3S), these are two enantiomeric centers, so the molecule is chiral and should show optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Structure is the same as the previous compound, but with both C2 and C3 as R configuration. So each is a chiral center with four different substituents. Hence, this molecule is also chiral. So it should exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait a second. Are there any planes of symmetry that could make the molecule achiral despite having two chiral centers?

The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH with both C2 and C3 as R configuration. Let's see: the molecule could have a plane of symmetry if the substituents mirror each other. For example, if C2 and C3 are mirror images, but because both are R, perhaps the overall molecule is not symmetrical.

Wait, but in this case, the two chiral centers are on adjacent carbons. So the configuration would depend on whether they are cis or trans. But since both are R, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two chiral centers if their configurations are the same. Wait, but that depends on their arrangement.

Wait, let's imagine the structure. If you have two methyl groups on adjacent carbons, both R configuration, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical. So the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, but wait, let's think: if the configuration is (2R,3R), then if you look at the molecule, would it have a plane of symmetry? Let me imagine the molecule. For example, in tartaric acid, the meso form has two R and two S configurations, making the molecule achiral. But in this case, the substituents are different. Wait, in our case, the substituents on each chiral center are the same: each has a methyl, a hydrogen, and two (different) carboxylic acid groups.

Wait no, the substituents might not be the same. Let me think: C2 has a methyl, a hydrogen, a carboxylic acid group (from the left), and a CH(CH3) from C3. Similarly, C3 has a methyl, a hydrogen, a carboxylic acid group (from the right), and a CH(CH3) from C2.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the substituents. Let me think again: for C2, the substituents are:

- O=C(OH)-CH2- (from C1)
Wait, no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So for C2:

- The left side is O=C(OH)-
- The right side is CH(CH3) (C3)
- One methyl (CH3)
- And a hydrogen.

Similarly, C3 has:

- O=C(OH)- (from C4)
- CH(CH3) (from C2)
- One methyl
- And a hydrogen.

So substituents for C2 and C3 are the same types but connected to different parts. So if both are R configuration, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are arranged so that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule would be chiral.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetrical if the configurations lead to a plane of symmetry. Wait, if the two centers are both R, then perhaps the molecule is chiral. For example, in meso compounds, the molecule is achiral because of a plane of symmetry. But in that case, the configurations are R and S, making a meso form.

Wait, in this case, if both are R, is there a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine the molecule: the two chiral centers are adjacent, each with methyl, hydrogen, and two different groups from the carboxylic acids. If both are R, then looking through the center, perhaps there's no symmetry. So the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, but wait. In the case where both are R, the molecule is not a meso compound because the configurations are not mirror images. So it would be chiral. Therefore, this compound would exhibit optical activity.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
   This is a cyclohexanol with a double bond at position 3, making it cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. The configuration is R. So the hydroxyl group is on C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4.

The question is whether this molecule has a chiral center. For C1, the substituents are:

- Hydroxyl group (-OH)
- Two CH2 groups (since it's cyclohexene)
- And a double bond adjacent.

Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two others in the ring. So C1 is attached to C2 and C6. But with a double bond between C3 and C4, perhaps the structure is such that C1 has four different substituents.

Wait, let's imagine the structure: the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. The hydroxyl is on C1. So the groups around C1 are:

- OH
- two CH2 groups (since C1 is connected to C2 and C6, which are each CH2 groups)
- and a CH group that's part of the ring (but wait, no, since it's a cyclohexene, each carbon in the ring is CH2 except the ones with substituents).

Wait, no, in cyclohexene, each carbon in the ring is CH2 except for the ones where substituents are attached. So C1 has a hydroxyl group, so the substituents on C1 are:

- OH
- two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6)
- and a CH2 group that's part of the ring (since C1 is connected to C2 and C6, which are CH2 groups, and to the rest of the ring).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: C1 has four substituents. One is OH, others are the adjacent carbons in the ring. Since it's a ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6, which are both CH2 groups, and the other two substituents are the ring bonds.

Wait, but in reality, each carbon in the cyclohexene ring is connected to two other carbons. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. The other two bonds are from the ring. So the substituents on C1 would be: OH, C2 (CH2), C6 (CH2), and the ring (but that's not a substituent, it's a bond). Wait, perhaps I'm not considering this correctly.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to use an example. The structure is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, which is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and a hydroxyl group on C1.

Each carbon in the ring has two ring bonds. So, for C1, the substituents are:

- OH
- two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6)
- and a CH group (from the ring, but wait, perhaps not.)

Wait, perhaps the groups are as follows:

C1 is bonded to:
- OH
- C2 (which is CH2)
- C6 (which is CH2)
- and the ring's double bond is between C3 and C4, so the arrangement around C1 is such that the substituents are OH, two CH2 groups, and the ring itself.

Wait, but a carbon can't have the ring as a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps C1 has four substituents: OH, two CH2 groups, and a CH group connected to the rest of the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps C1 is attached to two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), one OH, and one CH group that's part of the ring (like C5 or C3? No, because the double bond is between C3 and C4).

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C1 are: OH, two CH2 groups, and a double bond? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it out mentally. The ring is six-membered. C1 has OH. C1 is connected to C2 and C6. C2 is connected to C1, C3, and another CH2 group. C3 is double bonded to C4.

Wait, perhaps C1's substituents are:

- OH
- CH2 (C2)
- CH2 (C6)
- and another CH2 from the ring?

Wait, no, because C1 is connected to two CH2 groups (C2 and C6) and two ring bonds. So, the groups on C1 are OH, two CH2, and one ring bond. But that's only three substituents, which can't be because carbon has four bonds.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the actual structure. For cyclohexene, each carbon is CH2 except for the ones with substituents. So in this case, C1 has OH, so it's CH(OH). The other carbons are:

C2: CH2 (connected to C1 and C3)
C3: CH2 (connected to C2 and C4; but wait, C3 is double bonded to C4, so C3 is CH2 and C4 is CH2 as well, but with a double bond between them?

Wait, perhaps no, because in a double bond, each of those carbons would be CH. So C3 would be CH2 in the ring but connected via double bond to C4, which would be CH.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps C1 has four substituents: OH, two CH2 groups, and a CH2 group from the ring.

Wait, perhaps this isn't the right way. Let me think about whether C1 is a chiral center. For that, it needs four different substituents.

If C1 has OH, two CH2 groups, and another CH group (say, from the double bond), then it would have four different substituents. Alternatively, if the substituents are not all different, then it's not chiral.

Wait, if C1 has substituents: OH, two CH2 groups, and a CH2 group from the ring that's part of the double bond, then maybe some substituents are the same.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH
- CH2 (from C2)
- CH2 (from C6)
- and another CH2 (from the ring, perhaps connected to C5 or C2 again?)

No, that can't be because each substituent would have to be unique.

Alternatively, perhaps C1 has substituents: OH, two CH2 groups, and a CH group (from the double bond at C3 and C4). If that's the case, then the substituents are OH, CH2, CH2, and CH. Wait, but then two substituents are CH2, so they're the same. So C1 wouldn't be a chiral center.

Wait, but wait. If C1 is connected to two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), an OH, and part of the ring (which is a double bond), perhaps the fourth substituent is another CH2 group. But that would make two CH2 groups, so C1 would have two identical substituents, making it not a chiral center.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think of this differently. If the molecule is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, then it must have a chiral center. Otherwise, the R configuration wouldn't make sense. So the molecule must have a chiral center, so this compound is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
   This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. The configuration is s (which I think is the same as R, but it depends on the specific structure).

The question is whether this molecule has a plane of symmetry. Because if it does, then even with multiple chiral centers, the molecule could be achiral.

Looking at the positions: 1,3,5 are alternate positions on the ring. So if the hydroxyl groups are all on the same face (cis) or opposite faces, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, since all three hydroxyls are on the same side, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring.

Wait, but let's think about the substituents. Each hydroxyl is on a different carbon, but arranged symmetrically. For example, if each OH is axial or equatorial, and their positions create a plane of symmetry.

If the three OH groups are all in the same configuration (say, all axial and pointing down), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Because the arrangement would be symmetrical, perhaps leading to an achiral molecule.

So, for example, if each OH is in the axial position and all point in the same direction, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

In that case, this molecule would not exhibit optical activity because it's meso or has a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, if the configuration leads to no plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

Wait, but wait. Let's think: the molecule has three OH groups at positions 1,3,5. If the configuration is (1s,3s,5s), that implies each OH is on the same face (all R or all S, but I'm not sure about the specifics).

Wait, but if all three OHs are on the same face, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, a plane through the center of the ring, perpendicular to the plane of the ring, would reflect each OH to another position. But since all are on the same face, this might not create a symmetry.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think of the molecule. If all three OH groups are on the same face (cis), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. For example, if you imagine the cyclohexane ring lying in a plane, and all OHs are above the plane, then a plane cutting through the center of the ring would mirror each OH to another position. But since there are three OHs, perhaps the symmetry isn't perfect.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical because the three substituents are equally spaced around the ring. So if each OH is in the same configuration, the molecule could be achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because there's no plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions don't mirror each other.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me look for a similar example. For instance, 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane: if the substituents are all on the same face, the molecule is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry. So similarly, if the OHs are all on the same face, the molecule might be achiral.

Wait, but in the case of three substituents, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. For example, in 1,2,3-trimethylcyclohexane, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, but in 1,3,5, it's more symmetrical.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: if all three OHs are in the same configuration, the molecule would be achiral because it has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry. For example, if each OH is axial and pointing up, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center, making it achiral.

So, perhaps this compound is not optically active because it's achiral despite having three chiral centers.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
   The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of butan-1-one (which is (CH3)2CO, but with substituents). So structure is cyclopentyl-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but the correct structure would be CH2-CO-CH2-CH3, but with a cyclopentyl group on C1. So it's cyclopentyl-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO, but that's not correct. Wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2-CO, but butanone is more commonly found as methyl isopropyl ketone, but I might be mixing things up.

Alternatively, butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO, so the carbonyl is on C1. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But in this case, the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The carbonyl is on C1, so the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-cyclopentyl? No, wait, but butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So 3-methyl would be O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. And 1-cyclopentyl would mean the cyclopentyl is attached to C1. So the structure is cyclopentyl-CH2-CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

Wait, but butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So 3-methyl would have a methyl on the third carbon from the carbonyl. So in butan-1-one, the carbonyl is on C1, then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH2, C4 is CH3. So 3-methyl would be O=C-CH2-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's 3-methylbutan-1-one.

But with 1-cyclopentyl, the substituent is on C1, which is the carbonyl carbon. Wait, no, because the carbonyl is a double bond. So, perhaps, the cyclopentyl is attached to C1, which is the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but carbonyl carbons are double-bonded to oxygen and can't have substituents because they're already double-bonded. So, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, butan-1-one has the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the carbonyl is at the end. So the possible structure with 1-cyclopentyl would have the cyclopentyl group attached to the C1, which is the carbonyl carbon. But that's not possible because the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and can't have another substituent.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is cyclopentyl attached to C1 of butanone. But butanone is (CH3)2CO, which is 2-butanone. But the question says butan-1-one, so O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So position 1 is the carbonyl, position 2 is CH2, position 3 is CH2, position 4 is CH3.

So 1-cyclopentyl would be attaching a cyclopentyl group to position 1, which is the carbonyl. But that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps it's a typo, and the correct structure is the cyclopentyl attached to position 3, but that's not what the name says.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (cyclopentylmethyl)butan-1-one. So the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH(CH2Cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH3. Hmm, but that's a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl. So the substituents are:

C1: O=C-

C2: CH2-

C3: CH(CH3)-

C4: CH2-Cyclopentyl.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about whether this compound has a chiral center.

In any case, the presence of a cyclopentyl group and a methyl on the same chain may lead to a chiral center. Let me check each carbon.

The carbonyl is at C1, which is O=C. So C1 is double-bonded to O and can't be a chiral center.

C2: CH2, attached to O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl. So C2 is CH2, which has two CH2 groups, a carbonyl, and a CH(CH3). So substituents are O=C-CH2, CH(CH3), two CH2 groups. So no, C2 is not a chiral center.

C3: CH(CH3). The substituents here are:

- CH2 from C2
- CH(CH3)
- CH2 from C4
- and Cyclopentyl from C4?

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl. Then, C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), and a cyclopentyl group. Wait, no, the cyclopentyl is on C4.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl. So C3 is CH(CH3), connected to:

- C2 (CH2)
- C4 (CH2)
- a CH3 group
- and another substituent?

Wait, perhaps C3 has four substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, and the rest? Or perhaps it's attached to a cyclopentyl group.

No, perhaps the structure isn't leading to a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe C3 isn't a chiral center because two substituents are the same.

Alternatively, perhaps C4 is the one with substituents. For example, C4 is CH2 connected to cyclopentyl. So substituents on C4: CH2 (from C3), CH2 (from C5?), and two cyclopentyl groups.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

Wait, but let's think again. If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl, then each carbon:

C1: O=C- (not chiral)
C2: CH2- (two CH2 groups, so not chiral)
C3: CH(CH3) attached to two CH2 groups, a CH3, and another CH2. So substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, and the rest. So four different groups? Let's see:

- From C2: CH2
- To C4: CH2
- CH3
- and the fourth substituent: perhaps a hydrogen? No, because CH(CH3) would have three substituents plus the fourth.

Wait, no, perhaps I should count:

At C3, substituents are:

- O=C-CH2- (from C2)
- CH2-CH2- (from C4)
- CH3
- and a hydrogen?

Wait, no, that can't be. Because C3 is CH(CH3), which implies it's connected to three other groups plus the methyl. Wait, CH(CH3) would have:

- C2: CH2
- C4: CH2
- CH3
- and another substituent. Wait, but if C3 is CH(CH3), it's only connected to three other carbons and a methyl. That makes four substituents: two CH2, a CH3, and another CH2? No, that would mean two CH2 groups, making two substituents the same, so not a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C3 are:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH2 (from C4)
- CH3
- and a cyclopentyl group.

No, that doesn't make sense because the cyclopentyl is on C4.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. For a compound to have optical activity, it needs a chiral center. If the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, it's not optically active.

In this case, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers because all the substituents are arranged symmetrically, leading to no tetrahedral carbon with four different groups.

So, this compound is not optically active.

Now, let's tally up the number of optically active compounds.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene â Not a chiral center. So no optical activity.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... â Yes, two chiral centers. So yes.
3. (2R,3S)-... â Yes, two chiral centers. So yes.
4. (2R,3R)-... â Yes, two chiral centers. So yes.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol â Yes, chiral center. So yes.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-... â No, because it's achiral (symmetry). So no.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one â No chiral centers. So no.

So the count is 4 compounds that are optically active: numbers 2,3,4,5.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, for number 2: the compound has 3aR and 7aS. That's two chiral centers, so yes.

Number 3: (2R,3S) â two chiral centers, yes.

Number4: (2R,3R) â two chiral centers, yes.

Number5: (R) configuration, so yes.

So 2,3,4,5 are active. That's four.

But wait, earlier I thought about number 6 being no and 7 being no. So total of four.

So the answer should be 4, which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check number 1.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Does this molecule have a chiral center?

Structure is CHCl2-CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2CH3? Or is it CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3?

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a double bond, and the substituents on either side are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center.

Wait, but in a double bond, the carbons are spÂ² hybridized and planar, so they can't be chiral centers. So any chiral centers would have to be elsewhere.

So, in this molecule, let's look for any spÂ³ carbons with four different substituents.

The molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

Structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2? No, that can't be because that would require four substituents on a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's structured as Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2, but that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH-CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2, but that would make four carbons. No, but but-1-ene is four carbons.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3 but as CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3. But that's not correct because the double bond would require one less carbon.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, that would be four carbons: C1 (Cl), C2 (CH2), C3 (C(CH3)), and C4 (CH2).

Wait, but that's five carbons. I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CHCl2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond. No, this isn't making sense. Perhaps this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

So, total of four compounds (numbers 2,3,4,5) that are optically active.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and no plane of symmetry or internal compensation that makes it achiral.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound has a double bond between C1 and C2. The carbons in the double bond are spÂ² hybridized and planar, so they cannot be chiral centers. Additionally, there are no other spÂ³ carbons in the molecule with four different substituents. Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This compound has a bicyclic structure with two chiral centers at positions 3a and 7a, as indicated by the stereochemistry (3aR, 7aS). The presence of these chiral centers and the lack of symmetry in the molecule make it **optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has two chiral centers at positions 2 and 3. Each of these carbons is bonded to four different groups: a carboxylic acid group, a methyl group, a hydrogen atom, and the adjacent carbon in the chain. Since both chiral centers are present and the molecule has no plane of symmetry, it is **optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound is similar to the previous one, with two chiral centers at positions 2 and 3. Both carbons are bonded to four different groups, and the molecule has no plane of symmetry. Thus, it is **optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   This compound has a hydroxyl group on C1 of a cyclohexene ring. The carbon at C1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group, two CH2 groups, and the rest of the ring. This makes it a chiral center, and the molecule is **optically active**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5 of a cyclohexane ring. While there are three chiral centers, the molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the alternating positions of the hydroxyl groups. This symmetry makes the molecule **achiral** and **not optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbonyl carbon at C1 is double-bonded to oxygen and cannot be a chiral center. The other carbons in the molecule do not have four different substituents, so there are no chiral centers. Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5. Thus, there are **4 optically active compounds**.
