Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's an aromatic ring with two substituents attached. The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group, which makes sense because esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen in the ester linkage. So, the compound probably has an ester functional group somewhere.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let me break down what each signal represents. 

First, two signals correspond to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted aromatic ring, the aromatic protons would split into different environments. If the substituents are meta to each other, there would be two types of aromatic protons. Alternatively, if they are para, but wait, it's di-substituted, so para would be two substituents opposite each other. But wait, the ring is 6-membered, so di-substituted could be ortho, meta, or para. But since there are two signals, maybe it's para? No, wait, para substitution on a benzene ring would result in two equivalent sets of protons, right? Or maybe not. Let me think. If two substituents are para, the ring would have two equivalent protons in each ortho position, but wait, no, if substituents are attached at positions 1 and 4, then the H at 2 and 3 would be equivalent, and H at 5 and 6 would be equivalent. So that would lead to two sets of aromatic protons, each as a doublet. So that fits with two signals for aromatic-H. But wait, the problem says two signals. So maybe that's para substitution.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets because each H is next to one other H. Wait, but a doublet of quartets suggests that each proton is coupling with two different sets of protons. Wait, maybe it's an ester group with some substituents. Let's think: an ester group is R-O-CO-R'. So maybe the compound has an ester and another group attached. Or perhaps it's a substituted vinyl group.

Wait, the aromatic ring is di-substituted. So maybe one substituent is an ester group and the other is something else. Or perhaps the substituent is an ester itself, like a benzene ring with an ester group attached as one substituent and another group as the second substituent. 

The two –CH3 groups: their signals don't split into multiple peaks because they're likely in equivalent environments or maybe as singlets. But wait, in the NMR, each CH3 group would appear as a singlet unless they're attached to something that causes splitting. But the question says there are two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups, but no signals for –CH2 groups. So, maybe there are two methyl groups, each as singlets, perhaps attached to an oxygen, like in an ester. Because in an ester, the R-O-CO-R' structure, if R is a methyl and R' is another group, then the methyl would be attached to oxygen and give a singlet. 

So, putting this together: the aromatic ring has two substituents. One substituent is an ester group, which would be something like O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, for example, if the substituent is an ester group, like OAc (acetate) group, then the structure would be benzene-O-CO-CH2CH3 or something. Alternatively, it could be a vinyl ester or some other substitution.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, there are two vinyl-H signals. So maybe one of the substituents is a vinyl group. Or perhaps the ester is connected to a vinyl group. Or maybe the substituent is a group with vinyl protons. 

Let me think
