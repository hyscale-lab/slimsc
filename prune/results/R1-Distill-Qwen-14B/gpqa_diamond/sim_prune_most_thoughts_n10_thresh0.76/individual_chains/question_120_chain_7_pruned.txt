Okay, so I'm faced with this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance, right? So plx = 1/distance. Or wait, actually, I think the formula is d = 1/plx, where d is in parsecs. So as parallax increases, the distance decreases. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So if I consider a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

But wait, the stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Are they uniformly spread in terms of their actual density in space, or is their distribution uniform on the celestial sphere? Oh, the question says they're uniformly distributed in the sky, but I think that might mean uniform in the 3D space. Or maybe it's uniform in the sense that the number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere.

Hmm, okay. So perhaps it's about the density in space. Let's model this. Suppose the number density of stars is constant, n. So n is the number per unit volume.

Parallax is related to distance. So the volume of space up to a certain distance comes into play. Let me think about how the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr relates to parallax.

Wait, parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So for a small change in plx, dplx, what's the corresponding change in d? Since d = 1/plx, the change in d would be approximately (d(plx))^-1 * (-1/plx²) dplx. Wait, maybe it's easier to express dr in terms of dplx.

Let me get this straight. The distance d = 1/plx, so plx = 1/d. Taking differential, dplx = -1/d² dd. So dd = -d² dplx. But since we're dealing with positive distances and parallaxes, perhaps the sign doesn't matter much here. So the thickness in distance is proportional to d² times the change in parallax.

Wait, but I'm trying
