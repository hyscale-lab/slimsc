Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think through it.

The question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid. The goal is to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble hydroxide. To dissolve it, adding a strong acid will react with it. The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid, like HCl, should produce Fe^3+ ions and water.

The reaction equation should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Right, because each OH- in Fe(OH)3 would react with H+ from the acid.

So, I need to calculate how much H+ is needed to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3. Let's get the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron is about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. Moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me compute that more accurately: 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 mol.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ because the reaction is 1:3. So total H+ needed is 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The acid solution is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration. So volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. But wait, the question says "minimum volume" so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but when you add the acid, you're not only reacting with Fe(OH)3 but also adding more solution. So the initial volume is 100 cm³. Wait, wait, the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. Oh, wait, no: "dissolve in 100 cm³ total volume." Or wait, let me check the question again. It says, "We would like to dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." Oh, so the total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³? Or is the initial solution 100 cm³, and the acid is added to it? I might have misread that.

Wait, the problem says: "prepare the solution" which is 100 cm³. So when you add the acid and the Fe(OH)3, the total volume is 100 cm³. So I think I don't have to worry about the dilution beyond that.

Wait, but I'm calculating the volume of acid needed, so let's think again. The moles of H+ needed is 0.002808, and the acid is 0.1 M, so the volume is 28.08 cm³. That's around 28 cm³, which matches option C's 28.0
