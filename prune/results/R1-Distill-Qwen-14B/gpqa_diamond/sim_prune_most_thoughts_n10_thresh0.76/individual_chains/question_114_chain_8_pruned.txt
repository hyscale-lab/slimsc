Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options provided. 

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (along with H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, let's break this down. I'll start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. Reacting ketones with NaCN usually leads to a substitution reaction. Wait, but in ketones, the carbonyl is a good electrophile. So when you add something like HCN, you get a cyanohydrin formation. But wait, in this case, the reagent is NaCN and another substance A. Oh wait, I think the reaction of ketones with CN- (from NaCN) typically requires an acid catalyst. Because the mechanism involves the formation of a protonated carbonyl, which makes the carbonyl more electrophilic, allowing the CN- to attack.

So for the first step, butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The product is a cyanohydrin. The reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ (which is H+ from HCl or H2SO4) or maybe something else. So A is an acid catalyst.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is treated with reagent B and water to form the corresponding acid. Wait, the starting material has a nitrile group here (butanenitrile) and a hydroxyl group. Oh wait, no, the product is a butanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

Nitrile to carboxylic acid typically involves hydrolysis. How does that happen? There are different ways to hydrolyze nitriles. One common method is acidic hydrolysis, which usually requires H3O+ (like HCl or H2SO4) and heat. Alternatively, sometimes you use H2O with a catalyst, but I think in this case, it's more likely the acidic conditions.

Wait, but wait. Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid can also be done under basic conditions, but that would form the sodium salt, which would need to be acidified. But in the product here, it's the acid itself, so probably acidic conditions.

But let me think again. The starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So when the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, the hydroxyl group might be involved in some way. Wait, but in the product, it's a butanoic acid. Let me count the
