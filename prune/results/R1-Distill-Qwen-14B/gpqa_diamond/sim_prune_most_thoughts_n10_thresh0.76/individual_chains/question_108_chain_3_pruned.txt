Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down.

Alright, the question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 T. And m is small, which I think refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. But wait, m is usually the magnetic quantum number, which can be -1, 0, +1 for p orbitals, or something like that. But if m is small, maybe it's near zero? Or does it matter here?

The main thing is to compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE. So I need to find expressions for both and see which is bigger.

First, let me recall what the paramagnetic coupling term is. Paramagnetism arises from the interactions between the magnetic moments of electrons and an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is usually given by the Zeeman term, which is H = -μ·B. Oh wait, but sometimes it's written as H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

Wait, no, the Zeeman term is for the interaction between the magnetic moment and the external field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. But wait, orbital and spin contributions can be considered separately. Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term—oh wait, in the context of atoms, the paramagnetic term is typically the spin-orbit coupling, but wait, no—spin-orbit is a different thing. Or is the paramagnetic coupling the Zeeman effect due to spin?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. Paramagnetism arises due to the response of the electron's magnetic moment to an external field. So the energy due to this is the Zeeman energy. So the Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic term is H_param = -μ·B. For an electron, μ is proportional to its spin, but wait, electrons have spin-1/2, so their magnetic moment is μ = -g_s μ_B S, where g_s is the gyromagnetic ratio for spin, which is about 2.

But wait, wait—when you have an external magnetic field, the energy is H = -μ·B. So for an electron, the magnetic moment is μ = -gμ_B m_s, where m_s can be ±1/2. But if the field is applied, say, along the z-axis, then the energy becomes H = -gμ_B m_s B.

Wait, but in this problem, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh, because in the question, it's written as m, which is the orbital one, not spin. So the orbital magnetic moment is μ_orbital = μ_B m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m can be -l, ..., +l. But for an electron, the orbital magnetic moment is given by μ_orbital = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m, which is μ_B m.

Wait, but paramagnetism is usually due to the spin magnetic moment, not orbital. Because electrons have spin-1/2 and hence their spin magnetic moment contributes to paramagnetism. Oh, because orbital contributions are usually smaller because for s orbitals, l=0, and for p, l=1, but in any case, the spin is always there. Hmm, but the question says the paramagnetic coupling term, so perhaps it's the spin contribution.

Wait, but the question specifically says the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the Zeeman term due to spin. So the energy would be H = g_s μ_B B m_s, where m_s is ±1/2. But since the orbital m is given as small, perhaps it's not relevant to the paramagnetic term. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused
