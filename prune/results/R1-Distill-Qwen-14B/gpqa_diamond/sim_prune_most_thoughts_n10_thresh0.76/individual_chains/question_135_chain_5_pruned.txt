Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me see what it's about. The question is about the decay of a boson X. The Lagrangian interaction is given, and we're told that the mass of X is 6 GeV. We need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed, considering the lowest order processes.

Hmm, so first, I remember that in particle physics, the allowed decays depend on conservation laws and the masses of the particles involved. Since X is a boson, I think about which fermions it can decay into. The Lagrangian provided is L = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully.

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, maybe that's a typo or notation confusion. Alternatively, perhaps it's L = -λ f ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). I'm a bit confused, but perhaps it's better to move forward.

Wait, perhaps the interaction term is something like λ times something involving ψ_f and X. Maybe it's a Yukawa coupling. The general form for Yukawa interaction is something like g ψ ψ X, where X is a scalar (boson), and ψ is a fermion field. So, in this case, the interaction would be -λ f \bar{ψ} X ψ_f. So, the fermion ψ_f would couple to the boson X through this term.

So, the boson X can decay into a pair of fermions ψ_f. Then, the possible decay products are pairs of these fermions.

But wait, the fermions involved in the interaction are ψ_f. So, looking at the Lagrangian, the fermions are ψ_f(y), which I think are fermion fields. So, the possible decay products would be any fermion-antifermion pairs that ψ_f can form. Hmm, but the options list specific particles, so perhaps ψ_f is a specific type of fermion, like a quark or lepton.

Wait, no, the question doesn't specify what ψ_f is.
