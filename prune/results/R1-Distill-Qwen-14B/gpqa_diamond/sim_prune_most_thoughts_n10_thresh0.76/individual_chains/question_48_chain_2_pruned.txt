Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm still a bit new to this.

The question goes like this: cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to give product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to make product 3. Finally, product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride to give product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. The options are A) 6, B) 8, C) 10, D) 7.

Hmm, alright. Let me break this down reaction by reaction.

First reaction: cyclohexanone + bromine gives product 1. I remember that when ketones react with bromine, it's usually a bromination. But wait, does bromine add to the carbonyl group? Or maybe it's a dihydroxylation or something else. Wait, wait, no, ketones don't typically add bromine directly. Oh wait, wait a second—maybe it's a bromohydrin formation? But that usually involves water and bromine. Or maybe it's a different reaction. Oh wait, no—the typical reaction of ketones with bromine in a specific condition... Oh wait, maybe it's the formation of a dibromide. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. Wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you add bromine (Br2) in a dihydroxy condition, like maybe under acidic conditions, that would lead to the addition of HBr across the carbonyl. Wait, no, wait. Br2 in an alkali solution would perhaps undergo a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromonium ion formation but that's more for alkenes. Wait, no, the starting material is a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps I should think again. Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group (C=O). Adding Br2 to a carbonyl group—I think that would lead to the formation of a bromoketone, but I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility is that the bromine is adding across the carbonyl. Wait, but ketones don't usually add Br2 in the same way as alkenes. Oh wait, unless it's a conjugate addition, but that's more for alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyls.

Wait, maybe it's an enol formation. Oh wait, when ketones are treated with HBr, they form enol bromides. But wait, the first step here is with Br2, not HBr. Hmm, perhaps it's a different reaction. Maybe it's a dihydroxybromination, but I'm not certain. I'm a bit stuck here, perhaps I should think of the possible products.

Alternatively, maybe it's a bromohydrin. Wait, bromohydrin formation occurs when a ketone reacts with Br2 and water. But the question says bromine, not specifying the conditions. So maybe product 1 is a bromohydrin, which would have an -OH and a -Br added. But wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone—so adding across the carbonyl would form a vicinal diol? No, wait, no, adding Br2 would add across the double bond, but since the starting material is a ketone (which doesn't have a double bond in the ring), perhaps the bromine adds to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a haloform reaction? No, that's for methyl ketones. Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, not a methyl one, so the haloform reaction wouldn't apply here.

Wait, maybe it's a bromine addition to the carbonyl group. So cyclohexanone has C=O. Adding Br2 would perhaps add across the carbonyl, making a bromide. Wait, but adding Br2 to a ketone—maybe it's a diaddition. So the carbonyl oxygen would get replaced by OBr, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, adding Br2 to a carbonyl group would result in a brom
