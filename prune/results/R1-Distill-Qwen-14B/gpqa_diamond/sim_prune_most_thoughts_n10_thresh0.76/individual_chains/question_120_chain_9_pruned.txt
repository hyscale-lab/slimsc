Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think through this.

Parallax is a measure of how close a star is to us, right? The closer the star, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position when observed from different points in our orbit. So the formula I remember is distance d (in parsecs) is 1 over parallax plx (in arcseconds). So d = 1 / plx.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. So their actual density in space is uniform. But when we observe them, the number we see in a certain range of parallax depends on how their distances relate.

Wait, if stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number of stars per unit volume is constant. Let's say the number density n is constant. So n = N/(volume), where N is the number of stars in that volume.

But when we look at stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx, what's that in terms of distance? Since plx is 1/d, so plx increases when d decreases. So plx and distance d are inversely related.

Let's think about the volume of a sphere with radius d. The volume is (4/3)πd³. But when we look at a thin shell between d and d + dd, the volume is approximately 4πd² dd.

So to find the number of stars in that shell, it's N = n * 4πd² dd.

But we need to express this in terms of parallax plx. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So substituting, d² becomes (1/plx)^2, and dd is the change in d, which would be related to the change in plx. Let me think about that.

The relationship between d and plx is d = 1/plx, so if plx increases by a small amount dplx, then d decreases by dd = (d²) dplx. Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Taking derivative: dd/dplx = -1/(plx²). So dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since plx is increasing when d is decreasing, the negative sign just indicates direction. The magnitude is (1/plx²) dplx. So dd = (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, but I'm trying to express everything in terms of plx. So let's write d in terms of plx: d = 1/plx. Then d² is 1/(plx)^2. The volume element 4πd² dd becomes 4π(1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because dd is (1/plx²) dplx. So 4πd² dd = 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but the number of stars in that shell is n * 4πd² dd.
