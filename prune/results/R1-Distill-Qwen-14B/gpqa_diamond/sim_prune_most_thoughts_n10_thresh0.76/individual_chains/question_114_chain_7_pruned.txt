Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question involves two reactions, and I need to pick the right reagents from the options given.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN, using reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is treating 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile with reagent B and H2O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. So, when a ketone reacts with NaCN, I remember that nitriles can be formed through substitution. Wait, but ketones reacting with CN- usually undergo nucleophilic addition.

Wait, but when you have a ketone and a source of cyanide, like NaCN, under certain conditions, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, I think the product here has a hydroxy group as well. Oh, wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So it's a nitrile and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. Hmm, that's interesting.

Wait, maybe it's a cyanohydrin formation. Right! The cyanohydrin reaction. In this reaction, a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (from NaCN) in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and water attacks the oxygen. But wait, wait, let me think. The mechanism is that the cyanide ion adds to the carbonyl, making a tetrahedral intermediate. Then, the leaving group (like OH-) leaves, but wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, the cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acid catalyst. Oh right! So the reaction of a ketone with NaCN in the presence of an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A for reagent A), would form the cyanohydrin. So the product would have both the cyanide and hydroxyl groups on the same carbon.
