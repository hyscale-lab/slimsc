Okay, so I have this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember learning about special relativity and how time works when you're moving at speeds close to the speed of light. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about an astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The astronaut is 22 years old and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options are whether they die before reaching, or how many years they'll be when they get there.

Wait, so this is a time dilation problem. Time dilation occurs because the astronaut is moving at a high velocity relative to Earth. From Earth's frame of reference, the time taken would be longer due to the distance involved, but from the astronaut's perspective, the trip should take less time because of length contraction.

But wait, the question specifically asks about the astronaut's own experienced time, which is their proper time. So I need to calculate the proper time for the journey.

First, I should figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Oh wait, no, wait—no, wait, that's the distance for the Andromeda galaxy maybe. Let me think. Oh wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is actually about 160,000 light-years away. Or is it 170,000? Hmm, I'm not sure about the exact figure, but perhaps the problem expects me to use that distance.

Wait, perhaps I should look it up, but since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed with what I remember. Let's say the distance D is approximately 163,000 light-years.

So, from Earth's frame, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. So time t = D / v.

But since the astronaut is moving at a high speed, their experienced time is less because of time dilation. Alternatively, using length contraction, the distance they experience is shorter, so the time would be less.

Wait, the formula for time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or wait, is that correct? Let me recall. Proper time is the time measured in the
