Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons. So, it's probably an organic compound, maybe a cyclic ester or something with an oxygen-containing functional group.

Let's start with the given data:

1. **FTIR Spectrum:**
   - Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹. That usually means O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak is more typical for an alcohol, right? Or maybe a carboxylic acid? Hmm, but wait, I remember that carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹, but if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's from an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like in a phenol? I'm not sure yet. 

   - Strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region usually corresponds to carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1650 could be another carbonyl? Or maybe an aromatic ring (C=C) stretching. Wait, but aromatic C=C is usually around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹. Oh, wait, 1650 is a bit higher. Maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl or an ester group. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated double bond like in an enone.

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum:**
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has at least one double bond. That's useful.

3. **Mass Spectrometry:**
   - Fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let's think. The molecular ion for some compounds breaks down into smaller fragments. For example, 45 could be (CH3)2CO (which is acetone), but wait, acetone's molecular weight is 58. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like C3H7O? Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight for C3H9O, but that's not a common structure. Wait another approach: 45 is the same as 45 amu. Let's think of common fragments. Oh, maybe the tropylium ion? No, that's m/z=91. Alternatively, in the case of an ester, perhaps the ester group breaks off. For instance, if the compound is an ester like methyl something, then maybe the fragment is from the ester part. Wait, but methyl groups are 15. Alternatively, if the compound is something like a cyclic ester, like a lactone. The fragment at 45 could be from the ring opening. For example, if the ring is six-membered, maybe the cleavage produces a 45 fragment.

Now, let's look at the options and their possible structures.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, each has six carbons, varying in the number of hydrogens and oxygen atoms.

Let me think about each formula.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: Each degree is a double bond or ring. The formula is C6H12O2. The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CnH2n+2. But with O, it doesn't change the count. So for C6H12O2, the hydrogen count is 12. Let's compute degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X=0, N=0.

So, (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 2/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are part of a double bond. So maybe a ring plus a double bond? Or another double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has one double bond (from the NMR) and maybe an oxygen-containing group like an ester or ketone.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl.

But the FTIR shows a carbonyl at 17
