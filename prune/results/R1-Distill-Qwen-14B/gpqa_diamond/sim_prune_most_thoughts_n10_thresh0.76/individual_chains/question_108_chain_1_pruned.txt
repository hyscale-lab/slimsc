Okay, so I have this question about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's break this down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question mentions a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis. I remember that in atoms, when a magnetic field is applied, it can cause effects like the Zeeman effect, which splits energy levels. But wait, this is about paramagnetic coupling, so maybe it's related to the interaction between the magnetic moment of electrons and the external field.

The orbital magnetic quantum number is small, m. Oh right, m can be -l, -(l-1), ..., 0, ..., l-1, l. If m is small, like near zero, that means the orbital angular momentum is contributing less to the magnetic moment. So the paramagnetic effect here might be dominated by other factors, perhaps the spin part?

The magnetic field B is 1 Tesla. I remember that 1 T is a pretty strong magnetic field. Wait, but for paramagnetism, the effect is usually small because it's due to the electrons' magnetic moments—like the Zeeman effect. But I'm not sure about the magnitude here.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term... I think the Hamiltonian for the interaction between the magnetic moment and the magnetic field is something like H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * μ_B * m, where g is the Landé g-factor, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Oh wait, but this is an orbital magnetic moment, so maybe it's μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m, or something similar.

Wait, the paramagnetic term is the energy due to this interaction. So the expectation value <H> would be proportional to m * B, right? Because H is proportional to m (since B is along a particular axis, say z, so the dot product simplifies to the product of components).

On the other hand, the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two atomic energy levels. For hydrogen, the energy levels are given by the Rydberg formula. The wavelength given is
