Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about the para-isomer yield when certain substituents undergo bromination. The substituents are attached to a benzene ring, and each will direct the incoming bromine either ortho, para, or meta. The key here is to determine the directing effects of each group and then see how that affects the ratio of para-substituted products.

So, the substituents given are:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene, methyl group)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (benzoyloxyethyl group)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The structures are:

1) C6H5-CH3 → methyl benzene (toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 → benzoyloxy ethyl benzene? Wait, no. The structure is benzene ring with a COOEt group. So it's a benzoyloxyethyl group, but wait, perhaps more accurately, it's a benzoyloxy ethyl group attached to the benzene. Or wait, no, I think it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl attached to an ethoxy group. So it's like O-CO-OEt? Wait, no, perhaps it's an ester group. Let me think. The formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Oh, wait, that's benzoyloxy ethyl group. So the substituent is O-CO-C2H5 attached to the benzene. So it's a carbonyl group connected to an ethoxy. Wait, no, wait: wait, the substituent is -COOEt. Because COO is carbonyl oxygen, then O connected to ethyl. So it's a carbonyloxy ethyl group. So the substituent is -O-CO-OEt? No, wait, the formula is C6H5-COOC2H5. Oh, okay, so the structure is benzene ring with a carbonyl group and an ethoxy group attached. Wait, no: the substituent is a group where the benzene is attached to a COOEt group. So the structure is O=C(OEt)- attached to the benzene. So it's a carbonyl with an ethoxy ester group. So, the substituent is a -COOEt group.

3) C6H5-Cl → chlorobenzene, Cl attached to benzene.

4) C6H5-NO2 → nitrobenzene.

5) C6H5-C2H5 → ethylbenzene, ethyl group attached.

6) C6H5-COOH → benzoic acid, COOH attached.

Now, each substituent affects the electrophilic substitution by either activating or deactivating the ring and by directing the incoming electrophile to certain positions.

So, the bromine is in excess, and it's an electrophilic substitution. So each substituent will direct bromine to certain positions. But for each, I need to see whether they are activating or deactivating and whether they are meta or para directors.

The question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. The more the substituent directs to para, the higher the percentage of para isomer. But the substituent's ability to do so depends on their activating/deactivating and directing effects.

Wait, but wait. The substituents can be either activating (which make the ring more reactive, so the reaction occurs more easily) or deactivating (making the ring less reactive). Also, activating groups are typically ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups are meta directors, except for some exceptions.

So let me list each substituent with their effects:

1) -CH3 (methyl group): it's an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. So it's an ortho/para director. So when bromine is added, the para position is a major product.

2) -COOEt (ester group): ester is a deactivating group because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So it's a meta director. So the substituent directs the incoming bromine to the meta position. Wait, but wait. Let me think about this. Ester groups are meta directors because they are deactivating. So bromine would add more in the meta positions relative to the substituent.

3) -Cl (chlorine): chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group (due to its electronegativity) but can have a slight +R effect (if it's attached). Wait, actually, chlorine is a deactivating group due to its electronegativity (electron-withdrawing inductive effect), but it's an ortho/para director because of the lone pairs on Cl which can donate electrons through resonance, but this is a weaker effect compared to the inductive effect. So chlorine is an ortho/para director but deactivating.

Hmm, sometimes, for substituents like -Cl, the ring is slightly deactivating but the directing is ortho/para. So in the case of chlorobenzene, when bromine is added, the major products are the ortho and para brominated chlorobenzenes, but because the ring is deactivating, the reaction is slower compared to benzene.

4) -NO2 (nitro group): Nitro is a strong deactivating group (due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect) and is a meta director. So the nitro group directs the incoming electrophile to the meta position relative to itself.

5) -C2H5 (ethyl group): Similar to the methyl group, ethyl is an activating group (alkyl, electron-donating via induction), so it's an ortho/para director. So the para product would be a major isomer.

6) -COOH (carboxylic acid group): This is a strong deactivating group because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the COOH. It's a meta director. So the substituent directs the electrophile to the meta position.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure about each substituent.

1. Methyl (CH3): activating, ortho/para → para is a major product.

2. COOEt (ester): deactivating, meta director → meta is major.

3. Cl: deactivating (but nit, wait, I thought Cl is deactivating but ortho/para director. Oh yes, because Cl is a halogen. Halogens are unique because they are deactivating (due to inductive effect) but ortho/para directors due to resonance effects. So Cl would direct to ortho and para, but the ring is less reactive.

4. NO2: deactivating, meta director.

5. Ethyl: activating, ortho/para director. Para is a major product.

6. COOH: deactivating, meta director.

So, for each substituent, the site of bromination and the major isomer.

Now, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, how much does para contribute to the yield.

But wait, what is the yield in terms of para-isomer? For substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para is a major product, but for meta directors, the para is less likely.

Wait, but in the case of meta directors, the substituent directs to the meta position, so the para position (relative to substituent) would not be a main product. So for example, in the case of COOEt (ester group), the bromine adds meta to it, so para to the substituent is not a major product.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify: for substituents that are meta directors, the major products are the meta isomers, not the para. So in that case, the para isomer would be a minor product, so their weight fraction would be lower.

So, the substituents that are ortho/para directors will lead to higher para yields, while those that are meta directors will have lower para yields.

So let me list each substituent and whether the para isomer is major or minor.

1. CH3: ortho/para director → para is major.

2. COOEt: meta director → para is minor? Wait, no. Wait, if the substituent is a meta director, then the incoming group goes to the meta position relative to it. So the meta position is across two carbons from the substituent, meaning that the substituent is at position 1, bromine at position 3. So for the substituent at position 1, the para position would be position 4. So if the substituent is a meta director, bromine goes to position 3, not to position 4. So the para product would be a minor product.

Wait, actually, in the case of meta directors, the major product is meta, which is different from the para.

So for substituents that are meta directors, the para isomer is not a major product, so the weight fraction of para is lower.

So now, for each substituent, I need to determine how much of the para isomer is formed.

But wait, some substituents might have more than one directing effect. For example, in the case of Cl, it's an ortho/para director, but because it's deactivating, the ring is less reactive. So the substitution is slower but the para is a major product. So para is a major isomer but in lower amounts than benzene.

Comparing the substituents:

Substituent | Effect (activating/deactivating) | Director (ortho/para/meta)
--- | --- | ---
1) CH3 | Activating | ortho/para → para major
2) COOEt | Deactivating | meta → para minor
3) Cl | Deactivating | ortho/para → para major
4) NO2 | Deactivating | meta → para minor
5) C2H5 | Activating | ortho/para → para major
6) COOH | Deactivating | meta → para minor

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about substituent 3: Cl. It is ortho/para director but deactivating. So when you brominate chlorobenzene, the para isomer is major but it's in lower yield than in benzene, but compared to other substituents, perhaps.

So the key is to arrange the substituents in order of increasing weight fraction of para-isomer. So from least para to most.

So, substituents that are meta directors will have less para product. Those that are ortho/para will have more.

So, which substituents have the least para yield (most meta), and which have the most.

Let me list each substituent's expected para fraction.

Substituent | Para Fraction (high → low)
--- | ---
2) COOEt | Low (meta)
4) NO2 | Low (meta)
6) COOH | Low (meta)
3) Cl | High (ortho/para)
1) CH3 | High (ortho/para)
5) C2H5 | High (ortho/para)

Wait, but wait. For substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para is a major product, but the ratio between ortho and para depends on the substituent. Sometimes, bulky groups may direct more to para because the ortho positions are hindered.

So, for substituents that are ortho/para directors, how much para is formed? For example, in toluene (methyl group), the para isomer is the major product, but the ratio can vary. For substituents with strong activating groups, the para is more favored than ortho. For example, in an activating group, the para tends to be the major product. So the substituents 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), and 5 (C2H5) would have relatively high para fractions.

Now, comparing substituents 1, 3, and 5.

Substituent 3 is Cl, which is a deactivating group. So the ring is less reactive. But it's an ortho/para director. So the para is a major product, but the total yield might be lower than benzene.

Substituent 1 is CH3, activating, so more reactive. Substituent 5 is C2H5, also activating, but perhaps more bulky than CH3. Wait, but how does the bulk affect the product? Generally, bulky groups direct more to para because the ortho positions are harder to approach.

So for substituent 5 (ethyl), the para product might be more dominant than in CH3.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. In toluene (CH3), the para isomer is about 40-50% of the product, with the ortho being about 20-30%, and the rest is unreacted or other isomers. But I'm not exactly certain. Alternatively, perhaps for ethylbenzene, the para isomer is even more dominant because the ethyl group is bulkier, making the ortho attack less favorable. So perhaps substituent 5 has a higher para fraction than substituent 1.

But it's possible that substituent 5 (ethyl) has a higher para fraction than substituent 1 (methyl) because of steric hindrance.

Similarly, substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive, but it's an ortho/para director. So the para fraction might be significant but perhaps less than in activating groups.

Wait, but the question isn't about the total reactivity but the weight fraction of the para isomer in the product. So for substituents that are deactivating and ortho/para directors (like Cl), the para fraction is high, but the overall reaction is slower.

But for the purpose of this question, the order is based on the fraction of para isomer in the product.

So, substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating, so the para is a major product, but perhaps the para fraction is lower than in activating substituents because there are fewer products overall (since the ring is less reactive). Wait, that's not correct because the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer, not the total yield.

Wait, the weight fraction of the para isomer in the brominated product. So regardless of how much product is formed (since bromine is in excess), the fraction comes from the regiochemistry.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. If the substituent is a deactivating group, the ring is less reactive, so the product might be lower in total, but the fraction of para could be the same as in activating groups.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Because for deactivating substituents, the ortho and para positions are still the major sites, so their para fraction is high.

So, substituent 3 (Cl) and substituents 1,5 (activating) all have high para fractions, but their absolute amounts might vary. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer.

So, the para fraction is the percentage of the product that is para with respect to the substituent, regardless of the total yield.

Therefore, substituents that are meta directors (like COOEt, NO2, COOH) will have lower para fractions. So 2,4,6 have low para fractions.

Substituents 1,3,5 have high para fractions.

But among substituents 1,3,5, which have the highest para fraction?

Wait, the activating groups (1,5) would have higher para fractions than Cl (3), which is deactivating but still an ortho/para director.

So, perhaps substituent 5 (ethyl) has the highest para fraction, followed by 1 (methyl), followed by 3 (Cl).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. For nitration, for example, in toluene, the major product is para, but for chlorobenzene, the para product is also a major isomer. However, due to the deactivating effect, the reaction doesn't proceed as readily, but the para fraction is still significant. So perhaps the order is substituent 5 (ethyl) > substituent 1 (methyl) > substituent 3 (Cl).

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a lower para fraction than substituents 1 and 5.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the activating substituents. Activating groups increase the rate of reaction and increase the para and ortho products. Deactivating groups decrease the rate but can still have significant ortho/para (Cl) or meta (others) products.

But the weight fraction of para is more influenced by the directing effect than the activation. So regardless of the activation, the fraction of para comes from the directing.

So substituents that are ortho/para directors (1,3,5) would have higher para fractions, while meta directors (2,4,6) have lower.

Now, among the ortho/para directors, which substituent leads to the highest para fraction? That would be the substituent that best directs to para.

For example, in toluene (methyl), the para product is about 50% (I think), while in ethylbenzene, due to steric hindrance, the para product is higher, maybe around 60-70%? I'm not certain about exact percentages, but ethyl groups are bulkier, so substituent 5 would have a higher para fraction than 1.

Substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating group, so the para product would be the major isomer but perhaps not as high as in activating groups. So substituent 3's para fraction would be lower than 1 and 5.

So the order of para fraction from lowest to highest (among substituents 2,4,6 being the lowest, then 3, then 1, then 5) would be:

Lowest para fractions: 2,4,6; then 3; then 1; then 5.

Wait, but let me check.

Wait, perhaps the substituents with activating groups have higher para fractions than deactivating. So substituents 1,5 (activating) have higher para fractions than substituent 3 (Cl, deactivating but ortho/para director).

So the order from least to most para fraction:

2,4,6 (low) → 3 (relatively low) → 1 (high) → 5 (highest).

Wait, but substituent 3 is a deactivating group, so perhaps its para fraction is lower than substituents 1 and 5, but higher than substituents 2,4,6.

So the order would be:

Substituents 2,4,6 have the lowest para fractions. Then substituent 3 (Cl) next. Then substituent 1 (CH3). Then substituent 5 (C2H5) highest.

So the order is 2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about each substituent.

Substituent 2: COOEt → meta director → low para.

Substituent 4: NO2 → meta → low.

Substituent 6: COOH → meta → low.

So 2,4,6 have the lowest para fractions.

Among substituents 3,1,5, which have ortho/para directing.

Substituent 3: Cl → deactivating, ortho/para → para is major but lower yield than in activating groups. So substituent 3's para fraction is lower than 1 and 5.

Substituent 1: CH3 → activating → high para.

Substituent 5: C2H5 → activating, bulkier, so higher para fraction.

So the order of para fractions from least to most would be:

2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but substituent 3 is Cl, which is ortho/para but deactivating. So its para fraction is less than in activating substituents, but more than in meta directors.

So the order would be 2,4,6 (lowest), then 3, then 1, then 5 (highest).

So the increasing order is 2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 4<2<6<3<1<5 → No. Because according to my order, 2 is less than 4 and 6.

Wait, no. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 4<2<6<3<1<5 → 4 is less than 2, which contradicts my earlier thought.

Option B) 6<2<4<5<1<3 → No, since 5 and 3 are in the higher end.

Option C)4<6<2<1<5<3 → No.

Option D)3<5<1<6<2<4 → No.

Wait, none of the options seem to match what I thought.

Wait, maybe my initial assessment is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, substituent 2 is COOEt. It's a meta director, so the para fraction is low.

Substituent 4 is NO2, meta, so para fraction low.

Substituent 6 is COOH, meta, para fraction low.

Substituent 3 is Cl, ortho/para, but deactivating. So para is major isomer, but less than activating groups.

Substituent 1 is methyl, activating, so higher para.

Substituent 5 is ethyl, activating, which I think has higher para than methyl (because of steric hindrance making ortho less favored), so substituent 5 has highest.

So the order from least to most para fractions is: 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but the initial para fractions for 2,4,6 are all lower than 3. So the order would be 2,4,6 (all low), followed by 3, then 1, then 5.

But how are 2,4,6 ordered among themselves?

Wait, substituents 2,4,6 are all meta directors, so their para fractions are low, but which is the lowest? Let's think about their deactivating strength.

The more deactivating the substituent, the less reactive the ring, but the para fraction is about regioselectivity, not reactivity.

Wait, but perhaps the substituent's ability to direct bromine affects the para fraction — but for meta directors, the substituent leads to meta, so para is minor. So their para fractions are all low, but the question is among them, which has the highest para fraction.

Wait, but all meta directors have lower para fractions. Among them, perhaps substituents that are less deactivating would have a higher rate of reaction, but the para fraction is still low. However, the question is about the fraction of para in the product, not the rate.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 (COOEt) is a stronger deactivating group than 6 (COOH) and 4 (NO2)?

Wait, nitro is a strong deactivating group, more so than ester or carboxylic acid.

So substituent 4 (NO2) is the strongest deactivating, then 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt). So their para fractions would be from high to low: substituent 2 has higher para fraction than 6, which has higher than 4.

Wait, no. Wait, the stronger the deactivating, the more the ring is deactivated, but the para fraction is about the regiochemistry, not the rate.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent's deactivating strength doesn't directly influence the para fraction. Because all meta directors have low para fractions, regardless of their deactivating strength. So perhaps 2,4,6 have the same low para fractions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's deactivating strength affects the para fraction. For example, a stronger deactivating group (like NO2) may lead to less para product because the ring is less reactive, but the directing is still meta. Wait, but the para fraction is the ratio of para to total product, so if the ring is less reactive, the product is less, but the ratio between isomers is determined by the substituent's directing.

Wait, perhaps for meta directors, regardless of their strength, the para fraction is about the same. So substituents 2,4,6 all have low para fractions but how low?

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 6 (COOH) is a stronger deactivator than 2 (COOEt) and 4 (NO2), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options given are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Hmm, we're to arrange substituents 1-6 in order of increasing weight fraction of para-isomer.

So the list would go from the one with the least para to the most.

If the substituents 2,4,6 have the lowest para fractions, and then 3, 1, 5 have higher.

But looking at option A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, that's substituent 4 first, then 2, then 6, then 3, then 1, then 5.

But if substituent 2 is COOEt, 4 is NO2, 6 is COOH, which are all meta directors, so all have low para fractions. So option A suggests that 4 has lower para fraction than 2, which has lower than 6.

But I'm not sure if the order among 2,4,6 is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is: COOEt (2) → more activating than COOH (6) and NO2 (4). Because ester groups are less deactivating than carboxylic acids and nitro groups.

Wait, no. Actually, nitro groups are stronger deactivators than esters, which are stronger than methyl groups.

So substituent 2 is COOEt → ester, which is deactivating, but less so than NO2 and COOH.

Substituent 6 is COOH → stronger deactivating than COOEt.

Substituent 4 is NO2 → strongest deactivating.

So substituent 2 is the least deactivating, then 6, then 4.

But how does this affect the para fraction?

Wait, but all three (2,4,6) are meta directors, so their para fractions are low. The order of their para fractions would be 4 <6 <2? Because substituent 4 is strongest deactivating, so perhaps the para fraction is lower than in substituent 2.

Wait, but again, the para fraction is about regiochemistry. All three are meta directors, so their para fractions are low, but perhaps substituent 2 has a higher para fraction than 4 and 6 because it's less deactivating. So substituent 2 would have a higher para fraction than 4 and 6, making substituent 4 the lowest among them.

Wait, perhaps not. Because all three have para fractions that are low, but substituent 2's para fraction is higher than 4 and 6.

Wait, it's getting confusing. Maybe I should think of each substituent's para fraction.

- Substituent 1 (CH3): high para fraction (say 50%)
- Substituent 2 (COOEt): low para (say 10%)
- Substituent 3 (Cl): high para (say 40%)
- Substituent 4 (NO2): low para (say 5%)
- Substituent 5 (C2H5): high para (say 60%)
- Substituent 6 (COOH): low para (say 8%)

Wait, this is arbitrary, but for the sake of example.

So, the order from least to most para fraction would be: 4 (5%) <6 (8%) <2 (10%) <3 (40%) <1 (50%) <5 (60%).

So the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Which would correspond to option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 → No.

Wait, because I have 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. Wait, let me look again:

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 → No, because according to my example, 6 comes after 4, but before 2.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 → No.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 → No.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 → No.

Wait, my example order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. Let's see which option matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 → No, because 2 comes after 4 but before 6, which in my example 6 comes after 4 but before 2.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 → No, ends with 3.

Wait, none of the options match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong in the para fractions. Maybe substituent 2's para fraction is higher than substituent 6's.

Wait, perhaps substituent 6 (COOH) is a stronger deactivator than substituent 2 (COOEt), so substituent 6's para fraction is lower than 2's.

So in my example, substituent 4 has 5%, substituent 6 has 8%, substituent 2 has 10%.

So the order would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking for this order in the options.

Option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3 → No, because 3 comes after 5.

Option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5 → No.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the order is 2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5. So 2 is the least, then 4, then 6, then 3, then 1, then 5.

Wait, but substituent 6 is more deactivating than 2, so perhaps its para fraction is lower than 2.

So substituent 6 has lower para than 2. So the order would be 6 <4 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but substituent 4 is stronger deactivator than 6, so perhaps 4 has lower para fraction than 6.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused.

Another way: perhaps the order of para fraction from least to most is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Which would correspond to substituent 4 (NO2) has the least para fraction, then 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt), then 3 (Cl), then 1 (CH3), then 5 (C2H5).

Looking for this order in the options. Let's check the options.

Option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 → No, because 2 is before 6.

Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 → No, because 3 is after 5.

Hmm, none match. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a higher para fraction than substituent 1 (CH3). Is that possible?

No, because CH3 is an activating group, leading to higher para product than Cl, which is deactivating but still ortho/para.

So substituent 1 has higher para fraction than 3.

So in the order, substituent 3 comes after 1? No, because substituent 3 is deactivating but ortho/para, so its para fraction is lower than activating groups.

Now, perhaps the correct order is substituents 4,6,2,3,1,5.

So substituent 4 (NO2) has the least para, then 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt), then 3 (Cl), then 1 (CH3), then 5 (C2H5).

Looking at the options, this is option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 → No, because option A puts 2 after 4 but before 6.

So perhaps option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5. That would be substituent 4 has the least, then 2, then 6, then 3, then 1, then 5.

Wait, but according to my earlier thinking, substituent 6 has lower para fraction than 2.

So I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on the substituent activating/deactivating and directing.

The key is that:

- Activating groups (1,5) are ortho/para directors, leading to higher para fractions.

- Deactivating groups that are ortho/para directors (3) have lower para fractions than activating groups but higher than meta directors.

- Deactivating meta directors (2,4,6) have the lowest para fractions.

So the order from least to most para is: 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, no. Because among the meta directors, substituent 4 (NO2) is the strongest deactivator, but all meta directors have low para fractions.

So the correct order should be substituent 4 (NO2) < substituent 6 (COOH) < substituent 2 (COOEt) < substituent 3 (Cl) < substituent 1 (CH3) < substituent 5 (C2H5).

So the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options:

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 → No.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 → No.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 → No.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 → No.

Hmm, none of the options match this order.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

The question is about 'weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer'. So, if a substituent is a meta director, the para isomer is a minor product, but how does the substituent's nature affect how minor it is?

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating but ortho/para director, so the para is a major product, but the overall reaction is slower. So its para fraction would be higher than in meta directors but lower than activating groups.

Wait, but how does the substituent's activating or deactivating nature influence the para fraction? For example, substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating but directs to ortho/para. So the para product is formed, but the reaction is slower, but the para fraction is significant.

So in terms of para fraction:

Substituent 1 (CH3) → high (activating, ortho/para)

Substituent 5 (C2H5) → higher than 1 (activating, bulky)

Substituent 3 (Cl) → lower than 1 and 5 (deactivating, ortho/para)

Substituent 2,4,6 → all meta directors, so low para fractions.

So the order from least to most para:

2,4,6 (all low) <3 <1 <5.

But how to order substituents 2,4,6?

Perhaps, substituent 4 (NO2) is a stronger deactivator than 6 (COOH), which is stronger than 2 (COOEt). So their para fractions would be in the order 4 <6 <2.

So the overall order would be: 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

So the order is 4,6,2,3,1,5.

Looking at the options:

Option A:4,2,6,3,1,5 → No.

Option B:6,2,4,5,1,3 → No.

Option C:4,6,2,1,5,3 → No.

Option D:3,5,1,6,2,4 → No.

Hmm, none match.

Wait, perhaps substituent 6 (COOH) has a lower para fraction than 2 (COOEt) and 4 (NO2), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the option where the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking again at the options:

Option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 → No.

Option B:6 <2 <4 <5 <1 <3 → No.

Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 → No.

Option D:3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4 → No.

Hmm, none of the options match, so perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that substituents which are deactivating and meta directors have lower para fractions, but their exact order depends on their deactivating strength.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the substituent's activating/deactivating effects in the following order:

Strongest activating: ethyl group (5), methyl (1), then Cl (3) as deactivating but weaker.

Strongest deactivating: NO2 (4), then COOH (6), then COOEt (2).

So, the order from least to most para is:

4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

Which is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking for this in the options, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5, which is option A.

But according to my analysis, substituent 6 should be after 4 but before 2, but option A has 2 before 6.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently.

The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each substituent:

- For a meta director, the para is a minor product. So the weight fraction is low.

- For an ortho/para director, the para is a major product. So high weight fraction.

So, among substituents 2,4,6, all meta directors, their para fractions are low. So the order among them is something.

Among substituents 1,3,5: all ortho/para directors. So their para fractions are high.

Now, let's think about which substituent among 1,3,5 has the highest para fraction.

The bulkier substituent (5) would have the highest para fraction because steric hindrance makes ortho less favored. So substituent 5 has the highest para fraction.

Then substituent 1 (CH3), which is less bulky than 5, so its para fraction is lower than 5 but higher than 3.

Substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating, so its para fraction is lower than 1 and 5 but higher than the meta directors.

So the order is: 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

Now, the question is about the order of increasing weight fraction, which is from least to most.

So, substituents 2,4,6 have the least, then 3, then 1, then 5.

But how are 2,4,6 ordered?

I think substituent 4 (NO2) is a stronger deactivator than 6 (COOH) and 2 (COOEt). So substituent 4 has a lower para fraction than 6 and 2.

So substituent 4 <6 <2.

So overall, the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking for this in the options, I don't see it. So perhaps the correct option is A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but according to me, 4 is first, then 6, then 2.

So none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent with the strongest deactivating effect actually leads to the lowest para fraction because the ring is so deactivated that even though it's a meta director, the para product is extremely low.

Wait, but all meta directors have low para fractions. The substituent with the strongest deactivating effect would have the least para fraction, because the ring is least reactive. So, substituent 4 (NO2) has the least para fraction.

Then substituent 6 (COOH), which is less deactivating than 4, but more than 2.

Then substituent 2 (COOEt), less deactivating than 6.

So the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Which is not an option. So perhaps the answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: consider the activating and deactivating groups. Activating groups (1,5) have higher para fractions, deactivating ortho/para (3) has lower than activating, and meta directors (2,4,6) have the lowest.

So, between substituents 2,4,6, which has the highest para fraction?

Substituent 2 is COOEt, which is an ester group. Esters are less deactivating than nitro and carboxylic acid groups.

So substituent 2 would have a higher para fraction than 4 and 6.

So substituent 4 <6 <2.

So the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But this is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct order is option A.

Wait, another thought: when the substituent is a strong deactivating group (like NO2), the ring is so deactivated that the para product is very small. So substituent 4 would have the least para fraction, followed by 6, then 2, then 3, then 1, then 5.

So, the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. But since this is not an option, perhaps the correct option is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A.

But I'm not getting any closer. Let me think again.

Wait, let's look for the correct answer from the options.

Looking at option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

That would mean substituent 4 (NO2) has the least para, then 2 (COOEt), then 6 (COOH), then 3 (Cl), then 1 (CH3), then 5 (C2H5).

But substituent 6 (COOH) is more deactivating than 2 (COOEt), so substituent 6 should have a lower para fraction than 2. So option A would have 2 before 6, which contradicts.

So option A isn't correct.

Looking at option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3.

But substituent 3 (Cl) is an ortho/para director and should have higher para fraction than substituent 1 (CH3), which is an activating group. Or is that the case?

No, because substituent 1 is activating, so it's ortho/para with higher para fraction than substituent 3, which is deactivating.

So substituent 1 has higher para fraction than 3.

So option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3 → which is incorrect because 3 (Cl) comes after 5 (C2H5), which is correct, but substituent 1 is after 2, which is correct.

Wait, in option C:

4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

So substituent 3 (Cl) is at the end, meaning it has the highest para fraction, which is wrong because substituent 5 (C2H5) has higher para.

So option C is incorrect.

Looking at option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 → No, it's out of order.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 → No, because substituent 5 and 1 are activating and should have higher para than 3.

This is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps the correct order is substituent 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5, which isn't present. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a higher para fraction than 1 and 5 because Cl is electron-withdrawing but can donate electrons via resonance, making the para product more favorable. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is substituent 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5, which isn't an option, so I must have an error.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 (COOEt) is a meta director, so its para fraction is lower than substituent 3 (Cl), which is ortho/para. So substituent 3 has higher para fraction than 2.

So the correct order would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But looking back, I think the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. But since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct order is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5, which is option A.

But I'm not sure. I think I'll have to conclude based on my initial analysis that the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A.


The problem involves determining the order of substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine. The substituents on the benzene ring influence the reaction through their activating or deactivating nature and their directing effects (ortho/para or meta). The goal is to rank the substances in increasing order of the para-isomer yield.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Substituent Effects**:
   - **Activating Groups**: Enhance the reactivity of the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.
     - Substituents 1 (CH₃), 3 (Cl), and 5 (C₂H₅) are ortho/para directors but differ in their activating/deactivating nature.
     - CH₃ (1) and C₂H₅ (5) are strongly activating, leading to high para fractions. Cl (3) is deactivating but still an ortho/para director, resulting in a lower para fraction compared to activating groups.
   - **Deactivating Groups**: Reduce the reactivity of the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to meta positions.
     - Substituents 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO₂), and 6 (COOH) are meta directors, leading to low para fractions. Among these, NO₂ (4) is the strongest deactivator, followed by COOH (6), and then COOEt (2).

2. **Order of Para Fraction**:
   - **Meta Directors**: Substituents 4 (NO₂), 6 (COOH), and 2 (COOEt) have the lowest para fractions due to their meta-directing nature. Among them, NO₂ (4) has the lowest para fraction, followed by COOH (6), and then COOEt (2).
   - **Ortho/Para Directors**: Substituents 3 (Cl), 1 (CH₃), and 5 (C₂H₅) have higher para fractions. Cl (3) is deactivating but still directs to ortho/para, resulting in a lower para fraction than the strongly activating groups CH₃ (1) and C₂H₅ (5). Among the activating groups, C₂H₅ (5) likely has the highest para fraction due to steric hindrance favoring para substitution.

3. **Final Order**:
   - The order of increasing para fraction is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5)**: Incorrect, as it places 2 before 6, which contradicts the analysis that NO₂ (4) < COOH (6) < COOEt (2).
- **Option B (6 < 2 < 4 < 5 < 1 < 3)**: Incorrect, as it misplaces several substituents, including 5 and 3.
- **Option C (4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3)**: Incorrect, as it places 3 after 5, which contradicts the analysis that 3 has a higher para fraction than 1 but lower than 5.
- **Option D (3 < 5 < 1 < 6 < 2 < 4)**: Incorrect, as it misplaces several substituents, including 3, 5, and 6.

### Conclusion:
The correct order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**, but none of the provided options match this order. Based on the given options, the closest match is **Option A (4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5)**, despite its inconsistencies.
