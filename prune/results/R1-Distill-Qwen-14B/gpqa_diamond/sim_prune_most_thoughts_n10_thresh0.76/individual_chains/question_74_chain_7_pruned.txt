Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's start by understanding what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability that it has decayed. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, 150 minutes from now? Or is it the next 150 minutes after the initial 100? No, I think it's the next 150 minutes starting from the current time, which is 50 minutes after the start.

Wait, no, the initial setup is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So I think that 100 minutes is the half-life or something. Wait no, 32% is the probability of decay in 100 minutes. So, if I have a probability P of decay in time t, that relates to the decay constant.

Radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The probability that a nucleus has not decayed after time t is given by P_not = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. So the probability of decay is 1 - e^(-λt). 

Given that, the probability of decay in 100 minutes (t=100) is 32% or 0.32. So:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)
=> e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

Taking natural logs on both sides:

-100λ = ln(0.68)
=> λ = - ln(0.68) / 100

Let me calculate that. ln(0.68) is approximately... well, ln(1)=0, ln(e)=1, so ln(0.68) is negative. Let's approximate it. ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566.

So λ = 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the situation is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So, the time elapsed is t1=50 minutes. The current time is t=50, and we need to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, no. The next 150 minutes after what? After the initial start, or after the current time?

Wait, the initial condition is that after 100 minutes, the probability is 32%. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. So the question is, what is the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes? So that's from the current time (50 minutes) to 50+150=200 minutes. So the next 150 minutes is the time from now (50 min) to 200 min.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the probability that it will decay within the next 150 minutes, starting from the current time. So the time interval is 150 minutes.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?" So the next 150 minutes from now, which is 50 minutes after the start.

So, in that case, the time elapsed from now is t=150 minutes. But wait, no, because the atom's decay is memoryless, right? So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same regardless of how much time has passed before. Because radioactive decay is a Poisson process, and the probability only depends on the remaining time.

So, the fact that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet doesn't change the probability that it will decay in the next t minutes. Because the decay is independent of the past.

Wait, that's interesting. So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as if we had just started. Because the probability is based on the exponential distribution.

Wait no. Because in the exponential distribution, the probability of decaying in the interval [t, t + Δt] depends on the remaining time. So for the first 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So the remaining time after that is 150 minutes.

Wait, but the way to compute this is to consider the probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200 minutes.

In the exponential model, the survival probability up to time t is P(t) = e^(-λ t). The probability of decaying between t=a and
