Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state.

Hmm, right. The spin state is given as (3i, 4). Wait, wait—wait, in what form is that vector? Oh yeah, I think in quantum mechanics, spin states are often represented as two-component vectors. So (3i,4) must be a column vector. Let me write that down: the state vector is [3i; 4]. That is, the first component is 3i and the second is 4.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket notation: ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So in this case, O is S_y. But wait, what's the operator for spin in the y-direction?

Oh right, the Pauli matrices. The spin operator S for a given direction is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. So S_y would be (ħ/2) times sigma_y. The sigma_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. Let me break this down.

First, I should write the state vector ψ as a column vector. So ψ is [3i, 4]^T. The bra vector, which is the conjugate transpose, would be [3i*, 4*]. Since 3i is complex, its conjugate is -3i, and 4 is real, so its conjugate is 4. So the bra vector is [-3i, 4].

Now, I'll compute the matrix multiplication. Let's do it step by step.

Compute ψ† S_y ψ. So:

ψ† is [ -3i , 4 ]
S_y is (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]
ψ is [ 3i; 4 ]

So first, multiply S_y by ψ. Let me compute S_y ψ first.

But wait, actually, the multiplication is ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ. Alternatively, S_y is (ħ/2) times sigma_y, so perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value using the sigma_y matrix and then multiply by ħ/2.

So let's compute ψ† sigma_y ψ and then multiply by ħ/2.

So, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute the product:

ψ† sigma_y ψ = [ -3i , 4 ] * sigma_y * [3i; 4]

Let me compute sigma_y * ψ first.

Multiplying sigma_y by ψ:

First element: 0*(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-i)(4) = -4i.

Second element: i*(3i) + 0*(4) = i*3i = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So sigma_y * ψ is [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, multiply ψ† with this result.

ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So, [ -3i ,4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ] gives:

(-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3)

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2. Since i^2 is -1, this becomes 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

So the sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, but wait a second. That's without the factor of ħ/2. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by this result.

Wait no, the sigma_y matrix is multiplied by ħ/2 to get S_y. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24). 

Wait, but wait—that can't be right because I think I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me double-check.

Another approach: perhaps I should compute it as (ψ† (sigma_y) ψ) * (ħ/2).

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Compute sigma_y * ψ:

sigma_y is 

[0   -i]
[i    0]

ψ is [3i;4].

So first element:

0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = 0 -4i.

Second element:

i*(3i) +0*4 = 3i^2 = -3.

So sigma_y ψ is [ -4i; -3 ]

Then, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ]

Compute ψ† (sigma_y ψ):

= (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term:4*(-3) = -12.

Sum: -12 + (-12 )= -24.

So ψ† sigma_y ψ is -24.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2)*(-24) = (-24 ħ)/2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are fractions with 25 in the denominator. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, maybe I messed up the normalization. Oh, right! The spin state should be normalized. Because the state [3i,4] may not be a unit vector.

Wait, the state is given as (3i,4). But to compute the expectation value correctly, the state should be normalized. So perhaps I need to normalize it first.

Hmm, right. The norm squared is (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) = (9 i^2)*(-1) + 16.

Wait, wait, no: the norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2. The modulus squared of 3i is (3)^2 =9, because |i|=1. Similarly, 4 is 4, so |4|^2=16. So the norm squared is 9 + 16 =25. So the norm is 5. Therefore, the normalized state is (1/5) [3i;4].

Wait, so the actual state is [3i,4]^T divided by 5. Because |ψ|^2 = (3i)(-3i) +4*4.

Wait, wait, no: |3i|^2 is (3)^2*(i)(-i) =9*(1)=9. |4|^2 is 16. So sum 25. So the normalized state is (1/5) [3i;4].

Ah! So when I compute the expectation value, I have to use the normalized state. That's where I went wrong earlier.

So, the state ψ is [3i;4], but its norm is sqrt(25)=5. So the normalized state is ψ_norm = (1/5) [3i;4].

So, to compute the expectation value correctly, I should use ψ_norm.

So, let's redo the calculation with ψ_norm.

So ψ is (1/5) [3i;4], so ψ† is (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ].

Compute ψ† sigma_y ψ.

Which is (1/5)(-3i,4) * sigma_y * (1/5)(3i;4).

So first, the 1/5 * 1/5 =1/25.

So the expectation value is (1/25) * [ (-3i)(-4i) +4*(-3) ] multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, let me recompute sigma_y * ψ.

Wait, with ψ being (1/5)[3i;4], then sigma_y * ψ is sigma_y * (1/5)[3i;4].

Which is (1/5) [ sigma_y * [3i;4] ].

Earlier, we found that sigma_y [3i;4] is [ -4i; -3 ].

Multiply by 1/5, it becomes (1/5)[ -4i; -3 ].

Then, ψ† is (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ].

So now, ψ† (sigma_y ψ) is (1/5)(-3i,4) multiplied by (1/5)(-4i; -3).

So (1/5)(1/5) is 1/25.

The dot product is:

(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) =12 i^2 =12*(-1) =-12.

Second term:4*(-3)= -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

Multiply by 1/25: (-24) * (1/25) = -24/25.

So the expectation value of sigma_y is (-24/25) * ħ/2.

Wait, no:

Wait, the expectation value is (1/25)(-24) * (ħ/2).

Because the operator S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (1/25) * [ (-3i)(-4i) +4*(-3) ] * (ħ/2).

Wait, no. I think I should compute sigma_y expectation first and then multiply by ħ/2.

So sigma_y expectation is [(-3i)(-4i) +4*(-3)]/25 = (-24)/25.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (-24/25) * (ħ/2) = (-24 ħ)/(50) = (-12 ħ)/25.

Which matches option A: -12 hbar/25.

So the correct answer should be A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = (3i, 4) \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Normalization of the state**:  
   The norm of \( \psi \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   \|\psi\|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]  
   Thus, the normalized state is:  
   \[
   \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Spin operator \( S_y \)**:  
   The spin operator along the y-direction is given by:  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
   \]  
   where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:  
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Expectation value formula**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \langle \psi_{\text{norm}} | S_y | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle.
   \]  
   Substituting \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), this becomes:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi_{\text{norm}} | \sigma_y | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}} \)**:  
   First, calculate \( \sigma_y \psi \):  
   \[
   \sigma_y \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Then, multiply by the normalization factor \( \frac{1}{5} \):  
   \[
   \sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Compute \( \langle \psi_{\text{norm}} | \sigma_y | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle \)**:  
   The bra vector \( \langle \psi_{\text{norm}} | \) is the conjugate transpose of \( \psi_{\text{norm}} \):  
   \[
   \langle \psi_{\text{norm}} | = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Now, compute the dot product:  
   \[
   \langle \psi_{\text{norm}} | \sigma_y | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Breaking this into terms:  
   \[
   (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i^2 - 12 = 12(-1) - 12 = -24.
   \]  
   Multiply by \( \frac{1}{25} \):  
   \[
   \langle \psi_{\text{norm}} | \sigma_y | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{-24}{25}.
   \]

6. **Final expectation value**:  
   Substitute into \( \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi_{\text{norm}} | \sigma_y | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle \):  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

Thus, the expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to option **A**.
