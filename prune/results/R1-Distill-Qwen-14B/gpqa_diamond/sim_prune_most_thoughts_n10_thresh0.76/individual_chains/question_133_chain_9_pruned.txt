Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because buffer solutions can be a bit tricky. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution. The given Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, right. Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The salts here are KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O (which is Na2HPO4·2H2O, but when dissolved, it should dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water). So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions.

Wait, what's the orthophosphate ion? Oh right, that's HPO4^2-. Because in the phosphate ion family, H3PO4 is the fully protonated, H2PO4^- is the first deprotonated, HPO4^2- is the second, and PO4^3- is the third. But the question is asking for orthophosphate, which I think is HPO4^2-.

So, looking at the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. That should form a buffer solution because they are two consecutive species in the dissociation of H3PO4.

Wait, but in this case, the two salts are KH2PO4 (which provides H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O (which provides HPO4^2-). So this is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, no, wait. Orthophosphate is actually H3PO4. Wait, no, that's not right. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, which is PO4^3-. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing terms.

Wait, the term "orthophosphate" refers to the simplest phosphate, which is PO4^3-. But in solution, it's usually in various protonated forms. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the term orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- ion. Because in some contexts, HPO4^2- is called the dihydrogen phosphate ion, and H2PO4^- is hydrogen phosphate, while PO4^3- is orthophosphate. Wait, maybe I should double-check that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring
