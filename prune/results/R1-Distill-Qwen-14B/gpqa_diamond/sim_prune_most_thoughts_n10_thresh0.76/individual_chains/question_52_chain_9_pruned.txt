Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the problem says that the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. But I'm not sure if those details are directly relevant here. The important part is about the temperature and the spots.

Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does the overall temperature decrease? Oh, because spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when spots cover part of the surface, the star's average temperature goes down.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, normally, the ratio is higher without spots, and lower with spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. That is, ratio without spots divided by ratio with spots.

Since the photosphere is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), I can use the Boltzmann equation for the population of energy levels. The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Here, g2 and g1 are the statistical weights of the two levels, E2 and E1 are their energies, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The ratio is n2/n1. But when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler, but does the photosphere's temperature change? The problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So I think T here is the effective temperature of the photosphere, which is lower when spots are present.

But wait, wait. Let me clarify. The problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the average temperature we observe is lower, but the spots themselves are even cooler than that. Does that matter for the photosphere's temperature? Hmm, but the photosphere is in LTE, so each region's temperature is its own. But when we have spots, the average emission is lower. But for the purpose of the energy level population in the photosphere, each part (spot or not) has its own temperature. But wait, the question is about the ratio in the stellar photosphere as a whole when spots are present. So maybe the average temperature is 5500 K, but the regions without spots are at 6000 K, and the spots are cooler. But how does that affect the overall population?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is treating the entire photosphere as being at a uniform temperature. Because when spots are present, the effective temperature (which is the average) is 550
