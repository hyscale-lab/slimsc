Okay, so I've got this question here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, the star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have different masses and radii. Both have the same albedo, which I remember affects how much light they reflect. The question gives some data about the Doppler shifts from the RV method, but I'm not sure how that plays into the equilibrium temperature yet.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... Right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering the energy it absorbs and emits. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Oh wait, albedo is the same for both planets, so that factor will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So the main factors affecting equilibrium temperature are the star's temperature and the planet's orbital distance. Because the formula depends on the square root of the star's radius and the inverse square root of the distance (since a is the orbital distance in the formula). Wait, let me write that formula correctly.

The equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). Oh yeah, because the planet absorbs
