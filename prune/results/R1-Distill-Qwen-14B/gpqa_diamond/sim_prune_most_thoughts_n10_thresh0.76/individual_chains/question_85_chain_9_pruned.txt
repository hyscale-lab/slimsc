Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see what I remember. The question gives me two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Alright, I'll take it step by step.

First, I think the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. Oh wait, the question says both have the same albedo, so that part cancels out. That's good; I don't have to worry about that factor.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Wait, no, I might be mixing things up. Let me recheck. Oh right, the formula is T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ). But since both planets have the same albedo, the (1-A) part is the same, so when I take the ratio, those terms will cancel out. So the ratio of their temperatures will depend on the square root of (R_star/(a1)) divided by (R_star/(a2)), but wait, perhaps I should re-examine the formula more carefully.

Wait no, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt( (R_star) / (2a) ) ) * ( (1-A) )^(1/4 ). But since both have same A, the ratio T1
