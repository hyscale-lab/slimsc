Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question involves two reactions, and I need to choose the major products from the given options. Let's take it one reaction at a time.

First reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as the base. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, which usually leads to elimination reactions rather than substitution. But wait, in the presence of a ketone, what happens? Oh right, when a ketone reacts with a base and an enolate is formed, it can undergo some kind of alkylation or similar addition.

Wait, another thought: maybe this is a conjugate addition or a Michael addition? Or perhaps it's an example of the Aldol reaction? Wait, no, because ethyl acrylate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So, when a base like t-BuOK is present, the alpha position of the ester can become deprotonated. The enolate would then attack the carbonyl carbon of the ketone.

But wait, the starting material is a cyclic ketone: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Its structure... so the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Positions 2 and 6 are methyl and ethyl groups. Hmm, wait, no: 2-ethyl would be position 2, and 2,6-dimethyl, so position 2 has ethyl and methyl? Or wait, 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethylâ€”wait, that might be a typo. Let me parse that. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the numbering is such that the ketone is at position 1. The ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6.

So position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? Or wait, no. 2-ethyl would be one substituent at position 2, and 2,6-dimethyl would mean another methyl at position 2 and one at position 6. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl
