Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

So, the problem says that an organic chemist does two reactions. Reaction I is treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH, followed by an acidic workup. Reaction II is treating pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4 and then acidic workup. After both reactions are complete, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. We need to find out how many peaks each chromatogram shows.

Hmm. Alright, let's break down each reaction first.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH. LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Hexan-3-one is a six-carbon chain with a ketone group on carbon 3. The structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, the structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one is:

The hexan-3-one means the ketone is on C3. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexan is six carbons. So numbering from 1 to 6:

Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

At position 3 is the ketone, and position 5 has a methoxy group.

So structure is: CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it properly.

Wait, hexan-3-one: the carbonyl is at C3. So, structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one is pentyl group attached to carbonyl. Let's count: C
