Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, intrinsic angular momentum, so that's spin, right? Muons are elementary particles, similar to electrons but heavier, and they have spin-1/2.

The problem says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator. It's given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), the second row is (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh wait, wait. I think S here is the Pauli matrix, but let me check—Pauli matrices are usually sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. The sigma_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], right? So S must be sigma_y here. Oh, because the question says S is a 2x2 matrix with those entries.

So Ay = c * S. Therefore, Ay is (h/(4π)) times sigma_y. Because c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But wait, the question isn't asking for the specific eigenvalues; it's asking which statement is correct among the options A to D.

So the options are:

A) The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π).
B) Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1.
C) Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.
D) Eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay.

Wait, let me think about each option.

First, let's calculate the eigenvalues of Ay. Since Ay is proportional to sigma_y, which has eigenvalues ±1. So sigma_y has eigenvalues 1 and -1. So Ay's eigenvalues would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by those, so (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1). So the eigenvalues are +h/(4π) and -h/(4π). 

Wait, but wait. No, wait.
