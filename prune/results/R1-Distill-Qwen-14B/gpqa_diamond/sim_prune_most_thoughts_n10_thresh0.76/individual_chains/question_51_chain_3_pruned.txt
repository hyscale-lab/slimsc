Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a different formula.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with conducting spheres, especially grounded ones, image charges come into play. Oh right, the method of images. So, for a grounded sphere, the image charge concept might be useful here.

When a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the induced charges on the sphere create an image charge. For a grounded sphere, I think the image charge is inside the sphere. But wait, no, wait. No, wait. No, for a conducting sphere, the method of images applies. So, if the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential on its surface must be zero because grounding sets the potential to Earth's potential, which is zero. So the conducting sphere's potential is zero.

Wait, but the charge q is outside the sphere. So, the sphere is a conductor, so charges will be induced on its surface. But since it's grounded, any induced charges on the outer surface would be neutralized by the ground. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the sphere is conducting, so the induced charges would be on the surface. But since it's grounded, the charges can flow to the ground, so the sphere remains neutral except for the induced charges? Or maybe
