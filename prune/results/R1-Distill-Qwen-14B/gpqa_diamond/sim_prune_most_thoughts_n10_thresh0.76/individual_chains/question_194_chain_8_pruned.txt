Okay, so I've got this problem about three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). I need to find the partition function Z. Hmm, partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right?

Wait, the system has three spins each with two possible states, so the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. So I need to list all 8 possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate E for each, then sum up exp(-βE) for all.

But maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8. Let me think about the possible values of E. Oh wait, maybe I can find the number of states that have a particular energy and then compute each term once multiplied by their count.

Let me see, the energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be 3, 1, -1, or -3. Let me see how.

Wait, when all three pairs are +1, sum is 3. So E = -J*3. But when two are +1 and one is -1, sum is 1. Or if one is +1 and two are -1, sum is -1. And all three negative, sum is -3.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me call this sum H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each S_i is ±1. So each product S_iS_j is also ±1.

How many possible values can H take? Let's see.

H can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, let me check: For three variables, how many possible values of H. Let's think in terms of combinations.

Wait, another approach: each pair S
