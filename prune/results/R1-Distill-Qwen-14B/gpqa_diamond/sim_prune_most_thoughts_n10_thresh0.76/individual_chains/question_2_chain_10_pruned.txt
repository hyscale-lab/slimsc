Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde, right? Trans-cinnamaldehyde has the structure where the aldehyde group is attached to a benzene ring via a propenyl group, and the double bond is in the trans configuration. So, the structure is something like Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO, but wait, no, wait. Cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? Or is it Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No wait, wait. Wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde derived from cinnamic acid. So, the structure is benzaldehyde with a double bond. Oh right, it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no. Wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, wait. No, wait, cinnamic acid is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-COOH. Wait, no. No, wait, cinnamic acid is Ph-CH=CH-COOH. Oh, right, so the aldehyde would be Ph-CH=CH-CHO. So the structure is benzene ring connected to a CH₂ group, but wait, no. Wait, cinnamic aldehyde is actually the aldehyde
