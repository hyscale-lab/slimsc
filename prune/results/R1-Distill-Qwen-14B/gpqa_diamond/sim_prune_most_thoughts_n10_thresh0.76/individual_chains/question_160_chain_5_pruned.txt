Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. When monochromatic light of wavelength λ falls on it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, let's start by thinking about what happens when light passes through an aperture. I remember from my studies that when light goes through a slit or an aperture, it diffracts and forms a pattern of bright and dark spots called interference maxima and minima. The position of these depends on the size and shape of the aperture.

Wait, the problem says that the aperture is a regular N-sided polygon, right? And all apothems are of length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is related to the side length and the number of sides. But since N is very large, the polygon becomes almost like a circle. Oh, wait, wait! Because as N approaches infinity, the polygon should approximate a circle. So in that case, the problem might reduce to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Wait, but wait. I've heard of the single-slit diffraction pattern. For a single slit of width 'd', the minima occur at angles θ where d sinθ = m λ, with m being ±1, ±2, etc. The first minimum is at θ = λ/(d), where m=1.

But wait, in this case, the aperture is a polygon with N sides, but when N is very large, it's circular. So perhaps the apothem 'a' relates to the radius of the circle. Let me think about that.

Wait, the apothem 'a' is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon with N sides, the radius R (distance from center to a vertex) is related to the apothem. The formula is R = a / cos(π/N). But when N is very large, π/N approaches zero, so cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π/N)^2/2. So R is approximately a(1 + (π^2)/(2N²)) ... but as N approaches infinity, R
