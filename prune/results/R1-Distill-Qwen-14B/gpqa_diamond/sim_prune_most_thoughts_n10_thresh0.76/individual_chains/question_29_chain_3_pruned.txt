Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question. Let me read through it again and break it down.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate this compound.

They used EMS mutagenesis, which I remember causes mostly point mutations, like substitutions. So the mutations here are probably point mutations.

Looking at the sequences:

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

The mutants are 1-4. I need to compare each to the wild type.

Mutant 1: The sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.
Comparing to the wild type:
- The first 5 bases: wild is ATGTT (positions 1-5), mutant 1 is ATGTT as well. Wait, no, looking again. Wait the wild has ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.
Wait, perhaps it's easier to line them up.

Wild type first part: 5'- ATGTT TCTCG C TGGT A CTTCT G TGGATGAA...
Mutant 1: starts with ATGTT C TACG C TGGT A CTTCT G TGGATGAA. Hmm, wait, maybe I should look for where the changes are.

Let me see each mutant:

Mutant 1: The initial sequence is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.
Wait, the wild type is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1 is 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Wait, perhaps the difference is in the first part. Let's compare:
Wild: ATGTT TCTCG C TGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...
Mutant1: ATGTT C TACG C TGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

Wait, no. Let me count the bases.

Wild type first 10 nucleotides: ATGTTTCTCG (positions 1-8? Let me count: A(1),T(2),G(3),T(4),T(5),C(6),T(7),C(8),G(9), etc.)

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGC...

Hmm, maybe it's better to just see where the differences are.

In the wild type, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTG...

Mutant1: The first part is ATGTTCTACGC...

So comparing:
