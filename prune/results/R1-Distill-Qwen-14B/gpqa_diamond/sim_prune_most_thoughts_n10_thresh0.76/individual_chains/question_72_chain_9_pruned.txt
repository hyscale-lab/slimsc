Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. So the substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. Norbornene derivatives often undergo various reactions because of their strained structure.

The first reaction is combining this compound with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction because I see dienes and dienophiles. Wait, the starting material is a diene (bicyclo with two double bonds) and 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two double bonds as well. Oh wait, no, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a diene. But the other part, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), has two Br groups on each methyl attached to the cyclohexene. So maybe each of those is a leaving group.

Wait, sodium iodide and elevated temperatureâ€”maybe an elimination or substitution? Alternatively, considering the reaction conditions, perhaps a coupling. Oh, wait, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction where the norbornene is the dienophile. But wait, the norbornene has two double bonds? Wait, no, norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, so it has one double bond. So the starting compound is bicyclo with two double bonds? Wait, the name is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, so that's a norbornadiene structure. Oh, right, norbornadiene has two double bonds and is a good diene for Diels-Alder reactions.

So the first step: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Wait, that's a cyclohexene with two substituents. Each of those substituents is a dibromomethyl, meaning each has two Br atoms attached to a methyl group attached to the cyclohexene. So each position (5 and 6) has a CH2Br2 group?

Wait, wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So it's a cyclohexene with 1,3-diene, which is conjugated, and at carbons 5 and 6, each has a methyl group where each methyl is substituted with two Br atoms. So each of those is a CH2Br2 group.

So the reaction between norbornadiene (dienophile?) and the dienophile? Or perhaps the cyc
