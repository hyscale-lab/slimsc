Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is asking which exoplanet among the options has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices given are A to D, each corresponding to one of these.

Wait, let me make sure I understand each option correctly. Each option describes a planet with certain characteristics. I need to calculate their densities and compare them.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I think. So a's density is 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and density approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's the same density as Earth? But if the mass is higher, does that affect the density? Wait, no, because density is mass per volume. So if the mass is double but the radius is... wait, the question says "a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³." Oh, wait, in the question, each option is a separate description. So option b says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5. So that's given directly, so its density is 5.5. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. No, because the way it's written, option b says the density is 5.5. So that's straightforward.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Composition affects density because Earth's composition is specific. So if it's same composition, then the density remains the same as Earth's, which is 5.5. Because density is mass/volume, but if both mass and volume scale similarly (like if radius increases, volume increases with radius cubed), then the density would stay the same if the composition is same. So option c's density is also 5.5.

Wait, wait. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. If a planet has the same composition as Earth, then the density should be similar because density is a function of composition. So if Earth's density is 5.5, this planet should also have 5.5. So for option c, density is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition implies same density, so 5.5. So all options a, b, c, d have densities of 5.5? But that can't be, because the question is asking which has the highest. Hmm, maybe I've misread some parts.

Wait, let me re-examine each option.

Option a: Earth mass and radius. So same as Earth. Density 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, density 5.5. So yeah, same as above.

Option c: same composition, mass 5x Earth. So same density, 5.5.

Option d: same composition, half Earth's mass. Same density, 5.5.

Wait, but that would mean all have 5.5, but that can't be the case. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing mass with radius. Let me think. Because density is mass divided by volume. Volume depends
