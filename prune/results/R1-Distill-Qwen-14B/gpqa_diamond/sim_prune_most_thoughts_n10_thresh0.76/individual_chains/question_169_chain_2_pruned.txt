Okay, so I'm trying to solve this nuclear decay problem. Hmm, let's read the question again carefully.

The original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The energy spectrum of E particles is continuous with an endpoint Q. So, I remember that in particle decays, when you have a continuous spectrum, it usually involves some kind of energy sharing between particles, maybe because of conservation laws or something like that.

In the variant, the decay is different: 2A → 2B + 2E + M, where M is an exotic, massless particle. The question is about how the E spectrum changes in this case. So, what's different now?

Wait, in the original decay, there are two E and two V particles. And in the variant, it's two E and one M. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the variant says "instead of the 2V" it emits one M. So the original decay had two V particles, and the variant replaces them with one M. So the products are 2B, 2E, and M. Oh wait, the original was 2B + 2E + 2V. The variant has 2B + 2E + M.

Wait, M is massless. So M would behave like a photon or something, right? Since it's massless, it's always moving at the speed of light, and has no rest mass.

So, knowing that, how does the energy spectrum of E change?

In the original decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum. That suggests that the energy of E can vary, which usually happens when there's a distribution of energies possible, given the conservation of energy and momentum.

In the original case, 2E and 2V are emitted. Since V is a particle (maybe a neutrino?), their energies would be determined by the available energy and the conservation laws. But in the variant, we have 2E and M. Since M is massless, perhaps it's like a photon or a neutrino. Hmm.

Wait, in a decay where you have multiple particles, the energy distribution depends on how the energy is shared among them. If you have two particles emitted, say E and V, their energies can vary as long as energy and momentum are conserved. The continuous spectrum arises when there are multiple possible energy states for the daughter particles.

In the original decay, since there's 2E and 2V, the system's energy and momentum must be shared among all four. So when you have a multi-particle emission, the energy of each particle can vary, leading to a continuous spectrum for E. But in the variant, instead of two V particles, there's one M.

Wait, but how does the number of particles affect the E spectrum? Let's think about the original case: 2E and 2V. Since each pair could have varying energies, perhaps the E particles have a range of possible energies.

In the variant, the decay products are 2E and 1M. So now, the energy is shared among three particles. But M is massless, so its energy is tied to its momentum. Because E and M are emitted, perhaps the presence of a massless particle changes the way energy is distributed.

Wait, in the original decay, if
