Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. So, my first thought is to remember how velocities and energies are handled in relativity.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. So the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, which direction are they moving? Oh, both are moving in the positive x-direction. So the astronaut with speed 0.6c is moving faster than the one at 0.5c. So from the 0.6c astronaut's frame, how fast is the other moving?

Wait, no. Wait, the question is probably asking for the relative speed of the second astronaut as seen from the first, or vice versa. Let me clarify: the relative speed would be the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. So for example, what is the speed of astronaut 2 (0.5c) as seen from astronaut 1's frame (0.6c)?

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for their relative speed in the frame where the first astronaut is stationary. Wait, I'm a bit confused about that. But the formula should still hold as I thought.

So plugging in the numbers: v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute the numerator first: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately 0.142857c, which is roughly 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Next, I need to calculate the total energy of the system. Wait, the system is both astronauts together. So I think I need to find the total energy from each astronaut's perspective in the same reference frame, probably the rest frame where one astronaut is stationary, but wait, no, I think the total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies in the same frame.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." Hmm, in relativity, the total energy would be the sum of their energies in the same frame. So which frame? Since they are moving relative to each other, the total energy would depend on the frame.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the frame. Hmm, maybe it's the sum in the lab frame, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that we calculate the energy in the center-of-momentum frame, but that's
