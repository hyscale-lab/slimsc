Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charge distributions and radiation. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember that when charges oscillate, they can emit electromagnetic radiation, and the power radiated depends on various factors.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroidal with the symmetry along the z-axis. So, I think that implies some kind of dipole radiation maybe? Because dipoles have that kind of symmetry. Wait, or maybe it's a quadrupole? I'm a bit confused there.

The problem states that the maximum power radiated is A. So, the function f, which is the radiated power per unit solid angle, depends on lambda and theta. So, f = f(lambda, theta). They're asking for the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and also what the form of f is.

Oh wait, I remember something about the radiation pattern of a dipole. The power radiated by a dipole varies with the angle theta. For a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator (theta = 90 degrees) and falls off as sin^2(theta) when theta is measured from the axis. Or wait, I think it's proportional to sin^2(theta) in the far field. Or is it cos^2(theta)? Hmm, I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, no. For a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field is given by the formula for the electric field, which depends on the angle. The power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to (sin^2(theta)) / (some power of lambda). But wait, lambda is the wavelength, which relates to the frequency and the speed of light. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact dependence here.

Wait, let me think again. The power radiated by a dipole varies with the fourth power of the frequency, but since frequency is related to lambda, that would translate into a dependence on lambda. Let me see: power is proportional to (d^2 p/dt^2)^2, where p is the dipole moment. So, for oscillating charges, the dipole moment varies sinusoidally, so the second time derivative is proportional to angular frequency squared times the dipole moment. So power would be proportional to omega^4 and other terms.

Wait, the Poynting vector, which gives the power per unit area,
