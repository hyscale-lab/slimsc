Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. We need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E, where E is given as pi squared h-bar squared over 2mL squared. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels of a single particle is E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2mL²), right? But wait, in the question, E is defined as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so E is actually E_1, the ground state energy for a single particle. So E_n for a single particle would be n² * E.

But wait, there are four identical spin-1/2 particles here. Oh, right, identical particles with half-integer spin are fermions, so they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers.

In a 1D infinite well, the quantum numbers are determined by the principal quantum number n, which is a positive integer (n=1,2,3,...). So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. But wait, in a 1D well, the only quantum number is n, since there's no angular momentum (l=0) or magnetic quantum number (m=0). So each particle must have a different n.

Wait, but spin-1/2 particles have two possible spin states: up and down. So for each energy level (each n), there can be two particles with the same n but different spins. Because the Pauli exclusion principle allows them to have the same n as long as their spin states are different.

So, for four particles, we need to fill the energy levels in order, making sure that each n can hold at most two particles (due to spin). Let me think about how to distribute the four particles into the energy levels.

Let's list the possible energy levels:

n=1: E1 = 1²
