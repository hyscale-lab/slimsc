Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to understand the question. The key point is that each spectrograph has a limiting magnitude. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So that means ESPRESSO can detect stars with V mag less than or equal to 17? Or does it mean brighter than 17, meaning higher numbers are fainter? Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's easier to detect because it's brighter. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag ≤ 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V mag ≤ 16.

Wait, I'm not sure. The question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So brighter means lower magnitude. So a star with V mag of 16 is brighter than 17, so it's observable. The limit is V ≤ 17 for ESPRESSO, and V ≤ 16 for HIRES.

So each star in the options needs to have apparent V magnitude ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES to be detectable by both. But wait, no, wait. The question says which stars can be detected with both. So the star must satisfy the requirements for both spectrographs. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. Wait, but wait, no. Because if a star is brighter than 17 (i.e., V ≤17), it's detectable by ESPRESSO. But for HIRES, it must be brighter than 16 (V ≤16). So for a star to be detectable by both, its V mag must be ≤16. Because if a star's V mag is 16.5, ESPRESSO can still see it (since 16.5 ≤17), but HIRES can't (since
