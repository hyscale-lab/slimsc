Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, right? Since it's at around 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nanometers, that's well into the UV. But ground-based telescopes can't observe UV light because our atmosphere absorbs it. So, for these telescopes to detect the absorption, the wavelength must have shifted into the visible range due to redshift.

Wait, so the clouds are absorbing light at Lyman alpha. So the quasar's light is being absorbed, and that absorption shows up as a line in the quasar's spectrum. But if the cloud is at a high redshift, that absorption line would be shifted into the optical range, which ground telescopes can see.

So the key here is figuring out the redshift where the Lyman alpha wavelength (1216 Angstroms) is redshifted into the optical range. What's the lower limit? That is, the smallest redshift (so closest to us) where the wavelength is just at the edge of what optical telescopes can detect.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second. The Lyman alpha is emitted by the hydrogen cloud. No, wait, the quasar emits light, and the clouds absorb specific wavelengths. So the cloud's hydrogen absorbs the quasar's light at the Lyman alpha wavelength (1216 A), but if the cloud is moving away, the wavelength we observe is longer (redshifted). So the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

So our goal is to have lambda_obs be in the range that optical telescopes can observe. Optical wavelengths are roughly 400-700 nm, I think. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. Wait, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 40
