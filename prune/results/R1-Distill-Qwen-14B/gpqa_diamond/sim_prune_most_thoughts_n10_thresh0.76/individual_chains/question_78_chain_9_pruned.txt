Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through.

The question is asking for the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a certain point r and time t, where t is greater than tr, the time when the charge's position generated the field. The charge is moving along some trajectory s(t), and the velocity at the generation time tr is v.

I remember that the potentials are related to the fields. For the scalar potential, I think it's similar to the static case, but maybe adjusted because the charge is moving. The vector potential, on the other hand, arises due to the motion of the charge.

Wait, the scalar potential V is usually given by (1/(4πε₀)) * q / r, where r is the distance between the charge and the point of observation. But wait, in this scenario, since the charge is moving, do we have to consider the retarded time? Oh right, because the fields from a moving charge depend on where the charge was at an earlier time. So the potential might involve a term that accounts for the movement, like the charge's velocity.

But looking at the options, some have V as q/(4πε₀ r), others have more complicated expressions. Oh, wait, the problem says to consider the vector d, which is from the point where the field was generated (at tr) to the observation point r. So the distance is d, not r? Or is d the vector from the charge's position at tr to r? So maybe the actual distance in the denominator is |d| or something like that.

Hmm. Let me recall the Liénard's potentials. The scalar potential V for a moving charge is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [ (1 - (v²/c²)) / (d c - v·d) ) ] or something similar. Or is it the other way around? Wait, I think the denominator involves c times the distance minus the dot product of d and v. Because when you have a moving charge, you have to account for the time delay and the Lorentz contraction factors.

So for the scalar potential, V should be (q/(4πε₀)) multiplied by (c) divided by (d c - v·d) or similar. Let me think in terms of dimensions. The denominator should have units of length, because d is a vector with units of length, and v·d would have units of (velocity * length) = length squared per time. Hmm, but that's not right—wait, no, d is a vector, so d has units of length. v·d is (velocity)*(length) = (L T^{-1}) * L = L² T^{-1}. Hmm, but the denominator is (d c - v·d), which would have units of (L * L T^{-1}) - (L² T^{-1})) = L² T^{-1}, which is strange. Oh wait, no: in the denominator, it's (d c) minus (v·d), but d is a vector, and c is a speed. Wait, no, perhaps it's |d| times c minus (v · d). Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is d c - (v · d), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the denominator could be c times |d| minus the projection of v onto d times |d| or something.

Wait, another approach: think about the expression for the scalar potential when the charge is moving. The scalar potential is generally given by V = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/( |d| (1 - (v²/c²) + (v·d)/(c²|d|) ) )) ), but that's a bit vague.

Alternatively, I remember that for the scalar potential, it's:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * ( c ) / ( |d| c - v · d )

Wait, because the denominator should account for the time it takes for
