Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

Alright, the setup is that there's a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a conducting sphere with radius R. The sphere is grounded, which probably means it's connected to the Earth, so any charges on it can move freely and can have induced charges as needed.

Wait, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, charges get induced on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, it can lose or gain electrons as needed to maintain a zero potential? Or wait, no, the potential of the sphere would be the same as the Earth's potential, which is considered zero. So the sphere's potential is zero.

But what about the induced charges? When you place a charge q near the sphere, the induced charges on the sphere will arrange themselves such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. Because the sphere is a conductor, the potential is the same everywhere on its surface.

So, the induced charges would be opposite to the charge q, right? Because like charges repel and opposite charges attract. But wait, if the sphere is grounded, any excess charge can leave. Hmm, maybe I should think about the method of images here. Oh right, the method of images is used in such situations where you replace the grounded conducting sphere with an image charge.

Wait, the method of images says that the potential due to a charge near a conducting sphere can be found by considering an image charge inside
