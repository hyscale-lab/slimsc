Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like this are often related to angular momentum, maybe spin angular momentum since muons are spin-1/2 particles.

Wait, the operator P is given with its X, Y, and Z components. So P_x is ħ/2 times a matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], which I think is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is ħ/2 times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And P_z is ħ/2 times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix. Oh right, so P must be the spin operator for spin-1/2 particles in the direction n, which is arbitrary but in the x-z plane.

So the operator P can be written as P = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction is (n_x, 0, n_z). So n_y is zero. That simplifies things a bit.

Wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. Let me think about that. So the operator P would be:

P = (ħ/2) [ n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ]

Where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

The eigenvectors of this operator will correspond to the spin-up and spin-down states along the direction n. Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, we're looking for the spin-up state along n.

The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So putting it all together, the operator P is:

P = (ħ/2) [ n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Which simplifies to:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] ]

Wait, let me compute that matrix. So the (1,1) element is n_z*(1) + n_x*(0) = n_z. (1,2) is n_x*(1) + 0 = n_x. (2,1) is n_x, and (2,2) is -n_z.

So P's matrix is:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.
