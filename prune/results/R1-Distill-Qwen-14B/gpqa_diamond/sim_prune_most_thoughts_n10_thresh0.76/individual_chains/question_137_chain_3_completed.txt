Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are types of particle accelerators that use magnetic fields and electric fields to accelerate charged particles. Synchrocyclotrons are a special kind, maybe for higher energies? I'm not entirely sure, but I'll try to work through the problem.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

Wait, the question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes. So I think I need to find the number of times the proton goes around the synchrocyclotron before it reaches that kinetic energy.

I remember that in cyclotrons, the particles move in a circular path due to the magnetic field. The frequency of the electric field must match the particle's cyclotron frequency for it to be accelerated each time it passes through the electric field regions. Synchrocyclotrons probably work on a similar principle but maybe adjust the magnetic field as the particle's energy increases.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. In a normal cyclotron, the magnetic field is constant, and the frequency of the applied voltage matches the cyclotron frequency. But synchrocyclotrons might vary the magnetic field to keep the resonance condition as the particle's mass increases with velocity? Or maybe not, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Let's try to think about the energy gain. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy and reaches 950 MeV. Wait, the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So 950 MeV is just a bit more than its rest mass. So the proton is getting a significant boost here.

But how does the synchrocyclotron accelerate the proton? Oh right, the electric field does work on the proton when it's moving through the gap between the dees. The potential difference across the gap determines the energy gain each time the proton passes through.

In a cyclotron, the time for one revolution is the cyclotron period, T = (2π m)/(q B). The applied voltage's frequency must match this period so that the proton is accelerated each time it goes through the gap.

Wait, but in synchrocyclotrons, do they adjust the magnetic field to keep the resonance as the proton's speed increases? Or is the magnetic field fixed? I think that in conventional cyclotrons, the magnetic field is constant, but in synchrocyclotrons, the magnetic field may increase with time to maintain the resonance. Or maybe the opposite. Or perhaps it's the opposite: maybe the magnetic field varies in a way that the frequency of the applied voltage stays in tune with the proton's cyclotron frequency as it gains energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclotron frequency changes as the proton's velocity increases, but the applied voltage's frequency is adjusted accordingly. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics.

Let me think about what's given. The voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α) t + Φ0]. The term ν(α) probably denotes a frequency that depends on some parameter α, maybe the angle or the position in the accelerator?

Wait, but for a cyclotron, the condition for acceleration is that the electric field's frequency matches the cyclotron frequency of the particle. So, the cyclotron frequency ω_cyclotron = (q B)/(m c), or something like that, but I might be mixing some terms. Or perhaps it's ω = q B/(m), since ω = (v_perp)/(r), and v_perp = (q B r)/(m), so yeah, ω = (q B)/(m).

Wait, the cyclotron frequency is ω = (q B)/(m), for a particle of mass m and charge q in a magnetic field B.

In the cyclotron, the applied voltage must have a frequency ν that matches the cyclotron frequency divided by 2π, so ν = ω/(2π) = (q B)/(2π m).

In a synchrocyclotron, perhaps the magnetic field isn't fixed. But I think that in a synchrocyclotron, the proton is accelerated in a way that the magnetic field is increased as the proton's energy increases, allowing the cyclotron frequency to stay matched with the applied voltage's frequency.

Wait, but let me think. The problem states that the proton undergoes two accelerations. Hmm, perhaps each acceleration corresponds to one revolution. So maybe each time the proton passes through the electric field gap, it gains some energy.

Alternatively, each revolution, the proton is accelerated once. So the number of revolutions would be equal to the number of times the electric field accelerates the proton.

Wait, but the given voltage is an alternating voltage. So the electric field alternates in direction, which means that the proton is accelerated each time it passes through when the field is in the right direction. So perhaps each half-cycle of the voltage corresponds to an acceleration.

Wait, but the cyclotron works such that the electric field is applied in the gap, and the particles are accelerated each time they pass through. The electric field is applied in a way that alternates direction, so each time the particles go through, the direction of the field is correct to accelerate them.

In a cyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage must match the cyclotron frequency. So the number of revolutions the proton makes is equal to the number of times it's accelerated.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the energy gain. The kinetic energy of the proton is 950 MeV. The rest mass is about 938 MeV, so the total energy is 950 MeV. The kinetic energy is T = γ m c² - m c² = (γ-1) m c². So γ = (T + m c²)/m c². So for T = 950 MeV, m c² is 938 MeV, so γ ≈ (950 + 938)/938 ≈ 1988 / 938 ≈ around 2.12. So the proton's gamma factor is about 2.12, so its velocity is a significant fraction of c, but not extremely close to c.

But the key point is that the energy comes from the electric field accelerating the proton each time it passes through the gap. Each acceleration gives a certain amount of energy, and the number of revolutions would be the number of times this happens.

Each time the proton completes a revolution, it gains some energy. Alternatively, each time it passes through the gap, it might gain some energy. But in a cyclotron, the acceleration occurs each time the particle passes through the gap, and this happens once per revolution because the gap is between the dees, which are part of the structure.

Wait, perhaps each revolution corresponds to one acceleration. So if the proton makes N revolutions, it gains energy N times. Each time it gains energy equal to the potential difference U0 (assuming the proton is moving in phase with the voltage, so it gets the full U0 each time).

Wait, but wait: the voltage given is U(t) = U0 cos[2π ν(α) t + Φ0]. So the potential difference across the gap depends on this time-varying function. So the actual energy gain per passage might vary, but perhaps in this case, the average is considered.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the setup. The voltage is applied to the gaps between the dees. The electric field in those gaps is E = U(t)/d, where d is the distance between the dees. The proton, moving through this gap, will have a force F = q E, which does work on it. The energy gained per passage would be q * U(t), assuming that the charge moves through a potential difference U(t).

Wait, but the voltage U(t) is the potential difference across the gap, so the energy gain per passage would be q * U(t). But U(t) is varying with time, so the energy gain per revolution may vary. Hmm, but this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that each passage through the gap gives an energy gain of U0, the peak voltage. But wait, U(t) is a cosine function, so its maximum value is U0. So perhaps the maximum energy gain per passage is U0. But the actual energy gain would depend on the phase when the proton passes through.

But the problem states that the proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so maybe the initial phase is such that it's in phase with the voltage, so it gets the maximum energy gain each time. Or maybe not, but let's proceed.

So if each revolution gives an energy gain of U0, then the number of revolutions N would be T1 / U0, but in eV or appropriate units.

Wait, but let's check the units. U0 is 190 kV, so 190,000 eV per revolution. The kinetic energy T1 is 950 MeV, which is 950,000,000 eV.

So N = 950,000,000 eV / 190,000 eV per revolution ≈ 950e6 / 1.9e5 ≈ let's compute that.

950e6 / 1.9e5 = (950 / 1.9) * (1e6 / 1e5) )= 500 * 10 = 5000.

Wait, but wait, that's just 5000 revolutions. But the options are around 1864, 5300, 3536, 2500.

Hmm, 5000 isn't an option. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps each revolution doesn't correspond to one acceleration. Maybe each time the proton goes through the gap, it's accelerated once, and that corresponds to half a revolution? Because in a cyclotron, the dees are shaped like D's, and the proton moves in a circular path, switching between the two dees. So it passes through the gap once per half-revolution, perhaps? Or is it once per full revolution?

Wait, maybe each time the proton goes around once, it passes through the gap once. So each revolution corresponds to one acceleration. So if each acceleration gives U0 eV, then the number of revolutions is T1 / U0.

But according to the calculation, that would be 5000, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I'm wrong about the energy per revolution.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy per revolution is not U0, but something else. Maybe the maximum possible energy gain per revolution is U0, but the actual energy gain is U0 times the cosine term's value at the time of acceleration.

But since the proton is starting at t=0 with T≈0, and the voltage is U(t)=U0 cos(2π ν(α) t + Φ0), which is U0 cos( Φ0 + 2π ν t ), with Φ0=π/4.

At t=0, U(0) = U0 cos(π/4) = U0*(√2/2) ≈ 134,400 V. But the proton's first acceleration would be when it passes through the gap at some t, when the voltage is at its maximum. Wait, but the initial phase is π/4, so perhaps the first acceleration isn't at maximum.

Hmm, but perhaps the problem is designed to have the voltage applied at the correct phase each time the proton passes through, so the maximum energy is gained each time.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase is such that U(t) is at maximum when the proton is at the gap. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the energy gained as a function of time. But that might get complicated.

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that the total number of revolutions is the number of times the voltage completes a half-cycle, which corresponds to the number of times the proton is accelerated.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is determined by the time it takes for the proton to reach the desired energy, and the number of revolutions is that time divided by the period of the cyclotron.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the time it takes to reach the energy T1, and then find the number of revolutions during that time.

So, let's consider the process. The proton is accelerated each time it passes through the gap. Let's model the energy gain as a function of the number of times it's accelerated.

Each acceleration gives an energy gain of q * U(t), but if the voltage is sinusoidal, perhaps on average, each acceleration gives an average energy gain of q * (U0/2). Because the average of cos over a cycle is zero, but the average of the absolute value of cos is 2/π ≈ 0.6366. Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have each half-revolution corresponding to an acceleration. Or maybe each full revolution gives two accelerations (once on each side?), so perhaps each revolution gives two energy gains.

Wait, that's a possibility. Because in a cyclotron, the dees are two, so the proton alternates between them. Each time it goes through the gap, it's accelerated once. So in each full revolution, it goes through two gaps, so two accelerations.

So if that's the case, each revolution corresponds to two accelerations. So the number of accelerations would be twice the number of revolutions.

In that case, the total energy gained would be number_of_accelerations * average_energy_per_acceleration.

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think: in a cyclotron, the dees are two, so each time the proton goes through a gap (i.e., switches from one dee to the other), it's accelerated once. So for each full revolution, the proton passes through two gaps, thus two accelerations.

So if the proton makes N revolutions, it has 2N accelerations, each giving U0/2 energy on average. Wait, but the U(t) varies, so maybe the average energy per acceleration is U0/2.

Wait, but if the applied voltage is U0 cos( ... ), then the average value over a cycle is zero, but the maximum energy gain per acceleration would be U0, but the average might be different.

Alternatively, perhaps each acceleration gives an energy gain of U0, but in reality, the energy gained depends on the phase.

But perhaps the problem is simplifying things, assuming that each acceleration gives U0, and that the number of times the proton is accelerated is T1/(U0 * e), where e is the proton charge in coulombs, but more likely in eV.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently.

The kinetic energy T1 is 950 MeV. The proton's charge is e = 1.6e-19 C.

Each time the proton is accelerated, it gains energy equal to e * U, where U is the potential difference across the gap. The question is, how many times is the proton accelerated to reach T1?

But the applied voltage is time-dependent, so U(t) varies. So the energy gained each time depends on U(t) when the proton passes through.

But perhaps the problem is assuming that the voltage is such that the proton is always accelerated with a voltage U0, so each acceleration gives e * U0 energy. Then the number of accelerations N is T1 (in eV) divided by (e * U0) in eV.

Wait, but U0 is given in volts. To get the energy in eV, e * U0 would be (1.6e-19 C) * U0 (V) = 1.6e-19 * U0 eV. Wait, no: e * U0 is U0 (in volts) times e (charge), which is (e * U0) in eV, because 1 eV = 1 volt * 1 e charge.

So, e * U0 = 190,000 eV, which is 190 keV.

Wait, so each time the proton is accelerated, it gains 190 keV. So to reach 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV, the number of accelerations N is 950,000 / 190 ≈ 5000.

But earlier, I thought each revolution corresponds to two accelerations. So the number of revolutions would be N = 5000 / 2 = 2500.

Looking at the options, option D is 2500. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but why would each revolution correspond to two accelerations? Because the cyclotron has two dees, and each time the proton goes through one gap, it's accelerated once. So for each full revolution, the proton passes through two gaps, hence two accelerations.

So, if each acceleration gives 190 keV, and the total energy is 950,000 keV, the total number of accelerations is 950,000 / 190 ≈ 5000. Since each revolution gives two accelerations, the number of revolutions is 5000 / 2 = 2500. So the answer is D) 2500.

Wait, but earlier I thought the initial calculation without dividing by two gave 5000, which isn't an option, but 2500 is option D.

But why is each revolution two accelerations? Let me think again. The cyclotron has two dees, which are the two hemispherical electrodes. The proton moves in a circular path, switching between the two dees. Each time it moves from one dee to the other, it passes through the gap and is accelerated once. So each revolution involves two such passages, hence two accelerations per revolution.

Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the number of accelerations is double the number of revolutions. So if each acceleration gives 190 keV, and the total is 950,000 keV, then number of accelerations is 5000, and number of revolutions is 2500.

So the correct answer is D) 2500.


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gain and the relationship between accelerations and revolutions.

The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (\(T \approx 0\)) and reaches a kinetic energy of \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). The alternating voltage applied is \(U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi \nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0]\), where \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) and \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\). The goal is to find the number of revolutions the proton makes.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Gain per Acceleration**:  
   Each time the proton passes through the gap between the dees, it gains energy. The energy gained per acceleration is proportional to the applied voltage \(U_0\). Assuming the proton is always in phase with the voltage, it gains \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) per acceleration.

2. **Total Number of Accelerations**:  
   The total energy gained is \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{kV}\). The number of accelerations required to reach this energy is:  
   \[
   N_{\text{accelerations}} = \frac{T_1}{U_0} = \frac{950,000}{190} \approx 5000
   \]

3. **Revolutions and Accelerations**:  
   In a synchrocyclotron, the proton passes through two gaps (one between each pair of dees) per revolution. Thus, each revolution corresponds to two accelerations. Therefore, the number of revolutions is:  
   \[
   N_{\text{revolutions}} = \frac{N_{\text{accelerations}}}{2} = \frac{5000}{2} = 2500
   \]

### Conclusion:
The proton makes **2500 revolutions** in the synchrocyclotron to reach the kinetic energy of \(950 \, \text{MeV}\). This corresponds to option **D**.
