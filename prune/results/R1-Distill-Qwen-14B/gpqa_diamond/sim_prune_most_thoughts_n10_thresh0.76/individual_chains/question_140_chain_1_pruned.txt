Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and see if I can break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y violently, releasing a gas W. Gas W's molecules have the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius, so just a bit above freezing. 

Also, the product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is similar. The task is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering isotopes. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by figuring out what gas W could be. The key clue is that W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, let's think about molecules where protons = neutrons. Common gases that come to mind... Maybe hydrogen? But H2 has 1 proton each, but for each molecule, protons are 2 (since each H has 1). Wait, but the number of neutrons would be zero, because hydrogen typically doesn't have neutrons. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another idea: maybe CO2? No, wait, CO2 has a molecule with 22 protons (C has 6, each O has 8; 6+8+8=22). But the number of neutrons would be (mass number) minus protons. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, what about water vapor? No, H2O has 2 H and 1 O. Protons: 2*1 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: (mass numbers for each isotope). Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, another angle: the gas W has same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule. Let's think about molecules where each atom's protons equal their neutrons. For example, if it's something like CH4, but that's not a gas with same protons and neutrons. Alternatively, maybe the molecule itself has equal protons and neutrons in total. So for example, if the molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, that would be a total of 4. But what gas has that?

Wait, let me think about isotopes. For example, if the gas is something like D2O or something else. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like NH3, but that's not a good fit. Alternatively, maybe it's something like O2? No, O2 has 16 each. Wait, maybe the gas is CH4? No, that's a flammable gas but not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the reaction. X reacts with Y violently. Common violent reactions: maybe metals reacting with acids. So perhaps Y is an acid. If X is a metal, and Y is an acid, the reaction could produce a gas like H2 or CO2, but wait, that doesn't fit the W condition.

Wait, but if W is a molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, maybe each atom is something like
