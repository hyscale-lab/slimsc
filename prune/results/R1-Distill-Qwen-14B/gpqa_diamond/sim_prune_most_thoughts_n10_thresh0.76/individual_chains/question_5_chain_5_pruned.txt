Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of the operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these components is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, right. In quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement is made. The eigenvalue in this case is ħ/2, so we're looking for a state where measuring the component along direction n gives this value.

The direction n is in the x-z plane. So, the vector n can be represented in spherical coordinates with an angle θ from the z-axis and φ=0 because it's in the x-z plane. So, maybe the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but I'm not sure if that's needed right now.

The operator P is along an arbitrary direction n, so the total operator would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction's components. So, the operator P should be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But wait, n is in the x-z plane, which means the y-component of n is zero. So n_y = 0. That simplifies things. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Now, P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

But since n_y is zero, P becomes (n_x * P_x) + (n_z * P_z). Let me write that out.

So, substituting the matrices:

P = (n_x * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]).

Let me factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Let me compute the matrix inside the brackets. Let's denote this matrix as M.

M = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So P = (ħ/2) M.

We're looking for the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no. Because the eigenvalue is ħ/2, so P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

But P is (ħ/2) M, so substituting:

(ħ/2) M |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ:

M |ψ> = |ψ>.

So the matrix M has to have |ψ> as an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.

Therefore, I need to find the eigenvectors of M corresponding to eigenvalue 1.

Matrix M is:

[ n_z      n_x ]
[ n_x     -n_z ]

To find the eigenvectors, I'll set up the equation (M - I) v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.

So,

(n_z - 1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0,

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0.

This gives a system of equations. Let me write them out:

(1) (n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0

(2) n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0

Let me solve equation (1) for v2:

n_x v2 = (1 - n_z) v1

v2 = [(1 - n_z)/n_x ] v1

Similarly, from equation (2):

n_x v1 = (n_z +1) v2

Substituting v2 from equation (1) into equation (2):

n_x v1 = (n_z +1) * [(1 - n_z)/n_x ] v1

Assuming v1 is not zero, we can divide both sides by v1:

n_x = [ (n_z +1)(1 - n_z) ] / n_x

Multiply both sides by n_x:

n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(1 - n_z)

n_x^2 = (1 - n_z^2)

But wait, since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So yes, n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2. So this condition holds.

So, the two equations are consistent. So from equation (1), v2 = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] v1.

So, let me write the eigenvector as v1 and v2. Let me choose v1 as a parameter, say v1 = a, then v2 = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] a.

So, the eigenvector can be written as:

|ψ> = a [1; (1 - n_z)/n_x ]

But we need to normalize this vector. The normalization condition is |a|^2 [1^2 + ( (1 - n_z)/n_x )^2 ] = 1.

So, |a|^2 [ 1 + ( (1 - n_z)^2 ) / (n_x^2) ] = 1

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1, n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2.

So, substituting:

|a|^2 [ 1 + (1 - 2n_z + n_z^2) / (1 - n_z^2) ) ] = 1

Simplify the denominator: 1 - n_z^2 = (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z)

So,

1 + [ (1 - n_z)^2 ) ] / [ (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) ) ] = 1 + (1 - n_z)/(1 + n_z )

= [ (1 + n_z) + (1 - n_z) ) ] / (1 + n_z )

= [ 2 ] / (1 + n_z )

So,

|a|^2 * [ 2 / (1 + n_z) ) ] = 1

Therefore,

|a|^2 = (1 + n_z) / 2

So, a = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) or the negative, but since we're looking for a normalized vector, we can take the positive value.

So, the normalized eigenvector components are:

v1 = a = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

v2 = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] * a = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] * sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

But wait, n_x is sqrt(1 - n_z^2), because n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2. So n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z^2) = sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1+n_z) ) )

So,

(1 - n_z)/n_x = (1 -n_z) / sqrt( (1-n_z)(1+n_z) ) ) = sqrt( (1-n_z)/(1+n_z) )

So,

v2 = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/(1 +n_z) ) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

Simplify:

v2 = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/(1 +n_z) * (1 +n_z)/2 ) )

The (1 +n_z) terms cancel, leaving sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

So,

v = [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Hmm, but wait, there's a possibility of a phase factor, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can ignore it for now.

Alternatively, perhaps this relates to the eigenstates of spin in a particular direction.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenstate for spin-1/2 along a direction (n_x, n_y, n_z) has the components based on the spherical harmonics or the Euler angles.

Wait, but since the direction is in the x-z plane (n_y=0), the angle φ is zero. So the state can be expressed in terms of θ, the polar angle from the z-axis.

In that case, n_z = cosθ, n_x = sinθ, n_y=0.

So substituting:

v1 = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = cos(θ/2 )

v2 = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = sin(θ/2 )

But wait, wait, wait. The square roots would have factors. Let's see:

(1 + cosθ)/2 = cos²(θ/2)

So sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = cos(θ/2 )

Similarly, (1 - cosθ)/2 = sin²(θ/2), so sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = sin(θ/2 )

So the components are [ cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2 ) ]

But wait, that's the case when the vector is [n_x, 0, n_z] = [sinθ, 0, cosθ]. So the spin-up state along direction n is |+> = [ cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2 ) ]^T.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, the eigenvector was [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Substituting n_z = cosθ, this becomes [ sqrt( (1+cosθ)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) ] which is [ cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2 ) ]

So that's the normalized eigenvector.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which would correspond to the vector ( cosθ/2, sinθ/2 )

But wait, options are presented as the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So option C is that. But let's look at all the options.

Option A: sqrt(2/3) ħ and sqrt(1/3) ħ. That doesn't involve θ, so probably not.

Option B: (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ ). Hmm, but since the direction is in x-z, φ is zero, so e^{iφ} is 1. So the vector would be (cosθ, sinθ ), but that would be for a different scenario, perhaps if it were in the z-x direction but for a different operator.

Option C: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) )

Option D: sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(θ/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(θ/2 )

Wait, but in our conclusion, the eigenvector components are cos(θ/2) and sin(theta/2), without any factors of ħ, since the eigenvectors are dimensionless.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the question asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the eigenvector should be a unit vector, with each component a scalar; no ħ involved, because eigenvectors are state vectors (dimensionless in terms of units). So options that have ħ in them (A, D) might be incorrect.

Wait, but looking at option C, the components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result.

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait, another thought: the operator is P, which is a spin operator. For spin 1/2 particles, the eigenstates have components like cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), as I thought.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem gave the components of P_x, P_y, P_z as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) * something? Wait, no, earlier I derived that P is (ħ/2)*M, and the eigenvalue is ħ/2.

So when I set up the equation, I had (ħ/2) M |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, so M |ψ> = |ψ>. So the eigenvector is with eigenvalue 1 for matrix M
