Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But I don't think mass directly affects the abundance ratios here, so maybe I can ignore that part for now.

The problem gives me some elemental abundance ratios using the EW method. Let me jot down the given data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, and the Sun's photospheric composition is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5
- Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5

I'm supposed to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, [nSi_1 / nSi_2].

Hmm. Let me think about the abundance notation. The brackets mean log of the ratio of the element's abundance relative to another, usually hydrogen, but sometimes another element.

Wait, the [X/Y] notation is usually [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun.

Wait, no. Alternatively, sometimes it's defined as the logarithm of the ratio of the element abundance to the Sun's abundance for that element. So, [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X_sun / n_Y_sun).

But I might need to clarify. Alternatively, for [X/Y], it's log10 ( (n_X / n_Y) / (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) ) )

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10( (n_Si1 / n_Fe1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) ) = 0.3

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → log10( (n_Fe1 / n_H1 ) / (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ) ) = 0 → (n_Fe1 / n_H1 ) = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun )

Same for Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log10( (n_Mg2 / n_Si2) / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) ) =0.3

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → (n_Mg2 / n_H2) = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun )

Wait, but wait. Let's get the Sun's data:

From Sun: 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → so nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Wait, but nFe/nH is given. Similarly, nMg/nH is 10^(-5), which is 1e-5.

Wait, so for the Sun, the ratio nFe/nH = 3.16e-5, and nMg/nH =1e-5.

But what about nSi? The Sun's photospheric silicon abundance isn't directly given. Hmm, but
