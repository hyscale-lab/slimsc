Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think it through step by step. So the question is about reacting (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr) and looking at the TLC results. The reactant spot diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to figure out which products are formed.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me break that down. The benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether part is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the butenyl group has substituents.

Butenyl means four carbons with a double bond. The numbering is from the oxygen. So the structure of the butenyl group is: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, but it's but-3-en-1-yl. So the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if numbered starting from the oxygen, which is position 1). Wait, no, wait. Let me get the structure right. Let's think.

The group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the main chain is four carbons: positions 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between 3 and 4 (but-3-en). The substituents are methyl groups on carbon 2. So the structure is: OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, I think I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH- attached to the oxygen. Wait, no, but with substituents. The structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but the butenyl group is at position 1. So the structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? That doesn't seem right. Maybe I should draw it step by step.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the parent chain is four carbons with the double bond between C3 and C4. The substituents are on C2. So structure is:

O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-3-enyl is CH2CH2CH=CH2. Wait, but with substituents on C2. So the group is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but the double bond is between C3 and C4, so it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is the same as 1-penten-3-yl? No, perhaps not. Let me think of butenyl as four carbons. So for but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is CH2CH2CH=CH-. Wait, but that
