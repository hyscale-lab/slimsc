Okay, so I've got this question about ring-closing metathesis, and I need to figure out the starting material that would give the desired cyclohexene compound. Hmm, metathesis is a reaction where the distribution of substituents changes, right? I remember that ring-closing metathesis is when two alkenes undergo a reaction to form a ring, with the redistribution of substituents.

The target molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me visualize that structure. Cyclohexene has a six-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents are isopropyl at position 5, and methyl groups at 3 and 4. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, I think, because the numbering starts at the double bond position.

Wait, wait, no. The numbering in organic compounds typically gives the double bond the lowest possible numbers. So for cyclohexene, the double bond is between 1 and 2. So the substituents are at 3,4,5. So the structure should have the double bond at 1-2, methyl groups on 3 and 4, and an isopropyl group on 5.

So, how does ring-closing metathesis work here? I think it involves two alkenes reacting. The metathesis would break and reform the double bonds, effectively moving substituents to form a ring. So the starting material must have two double bonds that can undergo metathesis to form the cyclohexene ring.

Let me think about the starting material. The product is a six-membered ring, so the starting material must have a diene that can form a ring when the metathesis occurs. Wait, no. Ring-closing metathesis typically uses a diene and another diene, or perhaps a diene and a monoene. Oh wait, no, I think it's usually a diene and another diene, or maybe a diene with a terminal alkene.

Wait, another approach: the product has a six-membered ring. So the starting material should have a chain that, when the rings form, would have six atoms in the ring. So if the product is a cyclohexene, the starting material probably has a chain with two double bonds, such that closing the ring would bring the ends together.

Ring-closing metathesis typically involves two alkenes within the same molecule. So the starting material must have two alkenes separated by a certain number of carbons. When the metathesis happens, the two ends of the alkenes would form a new double bond in the ring.

Let me think about the structure. The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So substituents are at positions 3,4,5. Let's imagine the starting material as an octene, maybe. Because the product is a six-membered ring, the starting material would have two double bonds that are spaced in a way that closing the ring would bring the substituents into the correct positions.

Looking at the options, all are octadienes. So for each option, I can imagine the structure and see which would form the target upon metathesis.

Let me list the options:

A) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene
B) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene
C) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene
D) 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene

I need to figure out which of these, upon ring-closing metathesis, would form the target cyclohexene.

Ring-closing metathesis typically uses a Grubbs catalyst, which facilitates the breaking and reforming of the double bonds. The mechanism involves the catalyst opening the alkenes, swapping the ends, and then closing to form a new ring.

So in the starting material, each double bond will have substituents that end up in specific positions in the ring. The positions of the substituents in the starting material will determine where they end up in the product.

For the target molecule, the substituents are at 3,4,5. Let's think about what that implies about the starting material.

Suppose the starting material has two double bonds. The first double bond is at one end, and the second is somewhere else. When metathesis occurs, the ends of the double bonds will swap, forming a new double bond and a ring.

Let me model this. Let's imagine the starting material is octadiene. Let's number the carbons from 1 to 8.

For option A: octa-1,7-diene. So double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8. The substituents are 5-isopropyl, 3 and 4 methyl.

Wait, let me try to sketch this. The molecule would look like CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-? Wait, no, octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. But wait, the substituents are at 5,3,4.

Wait, the substituents are at 5,3,4 in the starting material for option A. So the structure would be:

Positions 1-2: double bond.

Then positions 3 and 4 have methyl groups, position 5 has isopropyl.

Wait, but that would be:

1: CH2-

2: CH-

3: CH(CH3)-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)- ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to write it:

Structure for option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So positions 1 and 2 are double bond (octa-1,7-diene), and the substituents are at 3,4,5.

So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CH2

Wait, but the double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8. Wait, octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 7-8. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- (but wait, that's only eight carbons. Oh, wait, octa is eight carbons. So the starting material is 8 carbons. So the structure is:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, that can't be right. Let me correct. The substituents are at positions 3,4,5.

So:

Positions:

1: CH2=CH-

2: CH-

3: CH(CH3)-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-

6: CH2-

7: CH2-

8: CH2-

Wait, but octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8.

Wait, so position 7 would be CH2-CH2- with double bond at 7-8.

So the structure would be:

Positions: 1-2: double bond.

Positions 3-4: each have methyl substituents.

Position 5: isopropyl substituent.

Then, positions 6,7,8.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the two double bonds as possible sites for ring formation.

In ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes within the molecule will undergo exchange. The catalyst breaks the two double bonds, and swaps the ends, forming a new double bond.

So for the starting material, let's imagine that the two double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 7-8 in an eight-carbon chain.

When metathesis occurs, the ends (positions 1 and 7) would swap partners, right? So the new double bond would form between the former 2 and 7 positions, and the chain would form a ring.

Wait, maybe a better way to think about it: the metathesis reaction will form a new double bond connecting the two alkenes and close the ring. So the number of carbons between the two double bonds will determine the ring size.

If the two double bonds are separated by four single bonds, that would give a six-membered ring. Because each double bond is two carbons, so the distance between the two would be four, plus the two from each double bond, totaling six.

Wait, no, let me think again. The number of atoms between the two double bonds. For example, if the two double bonds are at ends like 1-2 and 7-8, the number of single bonds between them is four (3-4, 5-6, etc.), which would form a six-membered ring when the ends are connected.

Alternatively, the metathesis will connect the two ends, forming a new double bond. So the ring size is the number of atoms between the two original double bonds plus two (for the two ends that are connected).

So in the case of octa-1,7-diene, the distance between the two double bonds is five (since 1-7 is six carbons apart, but the distance between the double bonds is positions 2 and 7, which is five carbons apart).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of carbons between the two double bonds.

If the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, the positions are:

1-2: double bond.

3-4: single.

5-6: single.

7-8: double bond.

So between the two double bonds, there are three single bonds (positions 3,4; 5,6; 7,8). Wait, no, between the two double bonds, the number of connecting single bonds is 7-2 =5? Or perhaps, the number of carbons between the two double bonds is 5 (positions 3,4,5,6,7). So when metathesis occurs, the two double bonds would form a ring by connecting 2 to 7.

Wait, perhaps the starting material would have double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7, so the distance is four carbons apart (positions 3,4,5,6). Then the ring formed would have 6 members (the two double bonds contribute four carbons, and the two connecting carbons from the ends make six).

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of carbons between the double bonds. If the starting material has double bonds at 1-2 and 5-6, the number of carbons between them is 3 (carbons 3,4,5). So when metathesis occurs, the ends (carbon 2 and 6) would form a new double bond, and the ring would be 1-2-3-4-5-6, which is a six-membered ring. Wait, but that would require the starting material to have double bonds at 1-2 and 5-6.

Wait, but the starting material is an octadiene. So the total chain is eight carbons. So if the double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 5-6, that's octa-1,5-diene. But none of the options have that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about each option and see which one can form the target upon RCM.

The target is cyclohexene with substituents at 3,4,5. So when the ring is formed, the substituents should be in those positions.

Looking at option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

The structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CH2

Wait, but where are the double bonds? 1,7-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 7-8.

So the structure would be:

1: CH2-

2: CH-

3: CH(CH3)-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-

6: CH2-

7: CH-

8: CH2-

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me try again. For octa-1,7-diene, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with substituents at positions 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is:

1: CH2=CH-

2: CH-

3: CH(CH3)-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-

6: CH2-

7: CH-

8: CH2=CH2?

Wait, no, octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8.

So the structure is:

Positions 1-2: double bond.

Position 7-8: double bond.

So the structure is:

1: CH2=CH-

2: CH-

3: CH(CH3)-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-

6: CH2-

7: CH-

8: CH2=CH-

Wait, no, position 7-8 can't have a double bond because position 8 would then be CH2.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CH2

But that doesn't have a double bond at 7-8. Oh wait, perhaps I have the substituents in the wrong positions. Or perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8. The substituents are at 3,4,5.

So the structure is:

1: CH2=CH-

2: CH-

3: CH(CH3)-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-

6: CH2-

7: CH2-

8: CH2=CH2

Wait, that can't be right because octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8, but 7-8 would be CH2-CH2 if it's octa-1,7-diene. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should imagine that when the metathesis occurs, the two double bonds will swap ends, and form a new double bond, creating a ring.

So, for example, if the starting material has double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8, the metathesis would break those and form new bonds between 2 and 7, creating a ring. The substituents would then be positioned accordingly.

Wait, let me try to imagine that. The two alkenes are at the ends of the molecule. Upon metathesis, the catalyst would break the double bonds and form new bonds between the ends, creating a ring.

The ring size would be determined by the number of carbons between the two double bonds. So between double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8, the number of carbons between them is 5 (positions 3,4,5,6,7). So the ring would consist of 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-1, but that's an eight-membered ring, which doesn't fit the target.

Wait, but the target is a six-membered ring. So the starting material must have the two double bonds in such a way that the ring formed is six carbons.

Let me think again. The target is cyclohexene, which is six-membered. So the starting material must have two double bonds with four carbons between them. Because when the ends are connected, the ring will have six members.

Wait, because each double bond contributes two carbons, and the four carbons in between would make 2+4+2=8? No, perhaps it's the number of carbons between the two double bonds.

Wait, the number of carbons between the two double bonds is four (since the starting material is an eight-carbon chain). So positions 1-2 and 5-6 would have four carbons (3,4,5,6) in between. So when the metathesis occurs, the new double bond would be between 2 and 5, forming a six-membered ring (1,2,3,4,5,6).

Wait, but the starting material in that case would be octa-1,5-diene, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps the correct option is option C, which is octa-1,6-diene.

Wait, option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. Let's consider that.

In that case, the double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7. So the distance between the two double bonds is three carbons apart (positions 3,4,5,6). Hmm, wait, if double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7, the number of carbons between them is 4 (positions 3,4,5,6), because from 2 to 6 is four carbons.

So when metathesis occurs, the ends would connect 2 and 6, forming a six-membered ring.

Wait, let me count: positions 1,2,3,4,5,6 would form the ring.

So the product would have a six-membered ring, which matches the target.

Then, the substituents in the starting material would end up in the correct positions in the product.

So in the starting material, positions 3 and 4 have methyl groups, and position 5 has isopropyl.

When the ring forms, these substituents would be at positions 3,4,5 in the cyclohexene.

So, for option C, the starting material is octa-1,6-diene with 3,4-dimethyl and 5-isopropyl.

So when the ring forms, the substituents at 3,4,5 would end up at the same positions in the cyclohexene.

Alternatively, perhaps the positions shift due to the metathesis.

Wait, when the ring closes, the substituents would be positioned based on how the chain is connected.

Let me think in terms of the positions. The starting material is an eight-carbon chain with double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7.

So the chain is:

1-2: double bond.

3: CH(CH3)-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-

6: CH-

7: CH-

8: ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to imagine the starting material as:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CH2

But wait, that's octa-1,6-diene. So 1-2 and 6-7 are double bonds. So positions 1-2: double, 6-7: double.

Wait, but in octa-1,6-diene, the structure would be:

Positions 1-2: double bond.

Positions 3-4: single.

Positions 5-6: single.

Positions 7-8: double bond.

Wait, no. 1,6-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7.

So the structure is:

1: CH2=CH-

2: CH-

3: CH(CH3)-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-

6: CH-

7: CH-

8: CH2=CH?

Wait, no, because it's octa-1,6-diene, so the second double bond is at 6-7.

So positions 6-7: CH2-CH2, no, wait, it's a double bond.

So the structure would be:

1: CH2=CH-

2: CH-

3: CH(CH3)-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-

6: CH-

7: CH-

8: ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure.

But perhaps the key is to realize that when the two double bonds (at 1-2 and 6-7) undergo metathesis, the new ring will have six members. The substituents in the starting material, at positions 3,4,5, will be in the same positions in the ring.

So the cyclohexene would have substituents at 3,4,5, matching the target.

Wait, but in the target, the substituents are at 3,4,5, but the double bond is at 1-2 of the cyclohexene.

So in the starting material, the substituents should be positioned such that after ring formation, they end up at the correct positions.

So for option C, which is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene, after metathesis, the substituents at 3,4,5 in the starting material will be at positions 3,4,5 in the cyclohexene.

Thus, the product would be 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, which is the target.

Alternatively, let me consider option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

In this case, the double bonds are at 2-3 and 6-7. So the starting material would be:

Positions:

1: CH2-

2: CH-

3: CH-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH3)-

6: CH-

7: CH-

8: CH2-

Wait, but this would have double bonds at 2-3 and 6-7. So the metathesis would form a ring by connecting 3 and 6.

Wait, the ring size would be 3-4-5-6-7-8-1-2-3, which is eight-membered. But the target is six, so this can't be right.

Hmm. So perhaps option C is the correct one.

Alternatively, let me look at the positions of the substituents. The target has substituents at 3,4,5. In the starting material, those substituents must be positioned such that when the ring forms, they end up at the correct positions.

In option A, the substituents are at 3,4,5. The double bonds are at 1,7. So when the ring forms, those substituents would end up at positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene. But I'm not sure about the ring size. Let me count.

If starting material is 8 carbons with double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8, then the ring formed would consist of 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-1, which is an eight-membered ring. But the target is a six-membered ring, so that can't be. So option A is probably not the right starting material.

Option B: double bonds at 2,6. So when metathesis occurs, the ring would be formed by connecting 2 and 6, which would make a six-membered ring.

So let's see: starting material is octa-2,6-diene.

Structure: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, but with double bonds at 2-3 and 6-7.

Wait, no, it's octa-2,6-diene, which would be:

1: CH2-

2: CH2-

3: CH-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH3)-

6: CH2-

7: CH-

8: CH2-

Wait, perhaps not. I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the ring size.

If the starting material has double bonds at 2-3 and 6-7, the number of carbons between the double bonds is 3 (positions 4,5,6). So when they undergo metathesis, the ring would form between 3 and 6, which would make a six-membered ring (positions 2,3,4,5,6,7).

Wait, no. If the double bonds are at 2-3 and 6-7, the number of carbons between them would be 3 (positions 4,5,6). So the ring would form with 2,3,4,5,6,7 connected, making a six-membered ring, which is correct.

But in this case, the substituents are at 4 and 5 (since in the starting material, positions 4 and 5 have methyl groups). So when the ring forms, those would become positions 4 and 5 in the cyclohexene. But where is the isopropyl group?

In option B, the isopropyl is at position 5 of the starting material, which would become position 5 in the ring. So the product would have substituents at positions 4,5,5? No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think again.

In the starting material, substituents are at positions 3,4,5.

Wait, no, in option B, the substituents are 5-isopropyl and 3,4-dimethyl.

Wait, actually, option B is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So substituents are at 3,4,5.

In the starting material, the substituents are:

3: CH(CH3)-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-

So when the ring forms, the substituents at 3,4,5 would be in the ring.

But the ring would have six members, positions 2,3,4,5,6,7.

So substituents at 3,4,5 would be at positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene. Which is exactly what the target is. So the substituents would end up correctly.

Wait, but the double bonds are at 2-3 and 6-7. So the ring would form by connecting 3 to 6. But that would form a six-membered ring, with substituents at 3,4,5 in the ring, which would correspond to positions 3,4,5 in the product.

So that seems to fit. So the target would be 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexene.

Wait, but in the starting material, the isopropyl is at position 5, which is part of the ring. So in the product, it would be at position 5, which is correct.

Hmm, but earlier I thought option C might be the correct one. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about which substituents would end up where.

In option C, the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So the substituents are at 3,4,5, and double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7.

When metathesis occurs, the double bonds break, and the ends (2 and 6) would connect, forming a new double bond between 2 and 6.

Wait, but that would form a ring of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, which is eight carbons. No, that can't be.

Wait, no. Let me think: The starting material is an eight-carbon chain with double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7.

When the metathesis occurs, the catalyst breaks both double bonds, and the two ends (carbons 2 and 6) form new bonds. So the ring would be formed by connecting carbon 2 to carbon 6, which are four carbons apart (3,4,5,6). So the ring would be 1-2-3-4-5-6, which is six carbons.

Wait, no. Let me count: 1 is connected to 2, which is connected to 3, then 4,5,6, and 6 is connected back to 1. Wait, no, that's a five-membered ring. No, wait, that's not right. Let me list the carbons in the ring.

If the ring is formed by connecting carbon 2 to carbon 6, then the ring consists of 2,3,4,5,6, and back to 2. Wait, that's five members. No, that can't be right. Wait, I think I'm getting confused again.

Perhaps it's better to count the number of atoms between the two ends.

If the starting material is octa-1,6-diene, the two double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7. So the distance between the two double bonds is 4 carbons (positions 3,4,5,6). So when the metathesis occurs, the new ring would consist of 1,2,3,4,5,6, which is six carbons.

Wait, but that would be a six-membered ring with double bond between 1-2 and 6-7. No, when the metathesis happens, the new double bond would be between which carbons?

Alternatively, perhaps the new double bond is between 2 and 7, but that would require the other end to be at 7, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Another approach: in ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes exchange their ends. So the starting material would have two alkenes, A and B. After metathesis, the new alkenes are A’ and B’, where the ends have been swapped.

So, for example, suppose the starting material has alkenes at positions 1-2 (A) and 6-7 (B).

After metathesis, the new alkenes would be between 2 and 6, or another combination, forming a ring.

Wait, perhaps the new double bond would form between the two ends that were not part of the original alkenes.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the catalyst breaks both double bonds and swaps the ends. So original double bonds are A (1-2) and B (6-7).

After metathesis, the new double bonds would be between 2 and 6, and 1 and 7.

Wait, but that might not form a ring. Alternatively, perhaps one of the double bonds would be within the ring, and the other outside.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach would help.

Let me think about the Grubbs catalyst. It facilitates the breaking and reforming of double bonds. When two alkenes are present in the same molecule, the catalyst can bring the ends together to form a ring.

The key is to determine which starting material, upon RCM, gives the correct cyclohexene with the substituents in the right positions.

The target has substituents at 3,4,5. So the starting material must have substituents at positions that, after the ring forms, end up at 3,4,5.

Looking at option C: substituents are at 3,4,5. The double bonds are at 1,6. So when the metathesis occurs, the ring would have substituents at 3,4,5.

So the product would have substituents at 3,4,5, which matches the target.

Wait, but the ring size? If the starting material has double bonds at 1,6, the ring formed would have six members. So I think option C is correct.

But earlier I thought option B could be a possibility, but perhaps not.

Another way to think about it: the number of carbons between the two double bonds determines the ring size. For a six-membered ring, the two double bonds must be separated by four carbons.

So in the starting material, the distance between the two double bonds should be four carbons apart. So in an eight-carbon chain, the double bonds would be at positions 1-2 and 6-7 (option C). Because 1-2 and 6-7 are separated by four carbons (3,4,5,6).

So metathesis would form a ring by connecting 2 and 6, giving a six-membered ring.

Thus, the product would have substituents at 3,4,5, which is correct.

Therefore, the correct starting material is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis (RCM), we analyze the options based on the reaction mechanism and the structure of the target molecule.

### Key Points:
1. **Target Structure**: The target molecule, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with:
   - A double bond between carbons 1 and 2.
   - Methyl groups at positions 3 and 4.
   - An isopropyl group at position 5.

2. **Ring-Closing Metathesis (RCM)**: This reaction involves two alkenes in the starting material. The catalyst breaks the double bonds and reforms them to create a new ring. The substituents in the starting material must align such that, after the reaction, they occupy the correct positions in the cyclohexene ring.

3. **Ring Size Determination**: For a six-membered ring to form, the two double bonds in the starting material must be separated by four carbons. This ensures that the reaction connects the ends of the chain to form a six-membered ring.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**
  - Double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 7-8.
  - The distance between the double bonds is five carbons, which would form an **eight-membered ring** upon metathesis. This does not match the target molecule, which requires a six-membered ring.
  - **Eliminated**.

- **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**
  - Double bonds are at positions 2-3 and 6-7.
  - The distance between the double bonds is three carbons, which would form a **five-membered ring** upon metathesis. This does not match the target molecule, which requires a six-membered ring.
  - **Eliminated**.

- **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**
  - Double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7.
  - The distance between the double bonds is four carbons, which would form a **six-membered ring** upon metathesis. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the starting material align correctly to produce the target molecule.
  - **Correct**.

- **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**
  - Double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 7-8.
  - The distance between the double bonds is five carbons, which would form an **eight-membered ring** upon metathesis. This does not match the target molecule, which requires a six-membered ring.
  - **Eliminated**.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene** (Option C), as it has the appropriate double bond positions and substituents to form the target molecule via ring-closing metathesis.
