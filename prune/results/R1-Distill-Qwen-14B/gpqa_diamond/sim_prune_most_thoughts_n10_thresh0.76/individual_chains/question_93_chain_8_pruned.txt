Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the scientist is making a calibration curve. He used a positive control with known copy numbers, diluted it in serial fashion, and ran three technical replicates for each dilution. The efficiency is 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect—so each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² is 1, which means the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope is -3.3. Wait, I remember that the slope is related to the efficiency. The formula for the slope is usually negative because higher DNA amounts give lower Ct values. The ideal slope for 100% efficiency is -3.32, right? Oh, wait, yeah, because each cycle doubles the DNA. So a 10-fold increase in DNA would take about 3.32 cycles. So a slope of -3.3 is close to that, maybe a little off due to rounding or experimental conditions.

Looking at the data: The Ct values for each concentration are in triplicates. Let's see:

At 100,000 copies/ul, Ct's are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average would be around 34.2. For 10,000, it's 30.6, 30.9, 31.2 → average ~30.9. Then 1000 copies: 27.3-27.9 → ~27.6. 100 copies: 24-24.6 → ~24.3. 10 copies: 20.7-21.3 → ~21.0.

Wait, but wait, each 10-fold dilution should change the Ct by about 3.3 cycles. Let me check the differences.

From 100,000 to 10,000 is a 10-fold dilution. The Ct difference is 34.2 - 30.9 ≈ 3.3. Oh, that's exactly the slope's -3.3. So that makes sense.

Next, 10,000 to 1000: 30.9 to 27.6. That's a 3.3 difference again.

Similarly, 1000 to 100: 27.6 to 24.3 → 3.3. 100 to 10: 24.3 to 21.0 → 3.3. So each 10-fold dilution gives a 3.3 decrease in Ct, which aligns with 100% efficiency.

But the question is about the discrepancies in his results. So why are the Ct values varying within each concentration? Like, the triplicates for 100,000 are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The range is about 0.6. Similarly, others are within 0.3 or 0.6. Are these differences considered too high?

Wait, but the question is which option explains the discrepancies in the results. The options are A to D.

Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. But the data shows clear correlation, so A is incorrect.

Option B says Ct values don't correlate with target amount. But R² is 1, so B is wrong because they do correlate.

Option C says ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, ten-fold should cause a change of about 3.3 cycles. So if the dilution is more than that, maybe the data doesn't fit. But in the data, each dilution step is exactly 3.3. So C doesn't fit.

Option D: the deviation is more than 0.3 between technical
