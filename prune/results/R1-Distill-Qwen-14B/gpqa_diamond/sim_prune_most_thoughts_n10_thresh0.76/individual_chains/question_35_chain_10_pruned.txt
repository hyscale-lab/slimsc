Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, intrinsic angular momentum... Oh right, that's the spin. So the question is about the Y-component of the spin operator, represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y. The setup says that A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a given matrix.

Wait, let's think about the matrices involved. The S matrix has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

And c is h/(4π), so A_y is (h/(4π)) multiplied by this S matrix.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Also, there are four options to consider regarding the properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

First, I need to find the eigenvalues of A_y. To find eigenvalues, I'll need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0.

Wait, but A_y is a 2x2 matrix, so this should be manageable. Let me compute it step by step. Let me compute A_y first.

A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.
So each element of S is multiplied by h/(4π).

Let me compute the matrix A_y:

A_y = [ [0 * c, (-i) * c ],
         [i * c, 0 * c ] ]

Which becomes:

[ [0, -i c ],
  [i c, 0 ] ]

So the matrix is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]].

Now, the characteristic equation is det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

So subtracting λ along the diagonal:

[ [ -λ, -i c ],
  [i c, -λ ] ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i c)(i c) = λ² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Wait, let's compute (-i c)(i c). Let's see:

(-i)*(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So ( -i c )*(i c ) = (1) * c².

So determinant is λ² - c².

Setting this equal to zero: λ² - c² = 0 → λ² = c² → λ = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are λ = c and λ = -c.

Wait, c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So their real parts are those values, and their imaginary parts are zero. Because c is a real number, so the eigenvalues are real.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). But wait, our eigenvalues are purely real. So the imaginary part is zero, which none of the options directly mention. So A is wrong because it states imaginary parts, which is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real ±1. Hmm, but our eigenvalues are c and -c, which are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So let's compute h/(4π): Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, but I don't think the actual value matters here. The point is, c is h/(4π), which is a real number. So the eigenvalues are real, as I found.

So the eigenvalues are ±c, which are ±h/(4π). So the real parts are h/(4π) and -h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. So looking at the options, none of A or B are correct in terms of having zero imaginary parts, except maybe none. So let's look at the other options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Wait, A
