Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about reacting an epoxide with an organocuprate. Hmm, I remember that organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and typically attack epoxides in a specific way. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about a disubstituted epoxide reacting with Me2CuLi, which is a methyl cuprate. The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. I need to figure out the product structure and its configuration.

First, I should probably sketch the structure of the starting epoxide to visualize it better. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane means it has a seven-membered ring with two bridgeheads. The 7-oxa indicates an oxygen in the ring, so it's an epoxide.

Looking at the substituents: 1,3,4-trimethyl. So, positions 1,3, and 4 each have a methyl group. The configuration is (1R,3R,4R,6S). Wait, the 6S part must be the bridgehead with the oxygen.

When organocuprates react with epoxides, the nucleophilic attack happens at the less hindered carbon. Since it's a disubstituted epoxide, each carbon in the epoxide is connected to two substituents. The less hindered one would be where the methyl groups are not so bulky.

Wait, the starting molecule is a bicyclo structure. So the epoxide is part of a bridge. Maybe the two carbons in the epoxide are each connected to two bridgehead carbons. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is in a position where one carbon has more substituents than the other. For example, in a disubstituted epoxide, each carbon is attached to two other carbons. The less hindered would be the one with fewer substituents or where the approach of the nucleophile is easier.

Wait, organocuprates add to the less hindered carbon because they're bulky. The methyl from Me2CuLi would add there, opening the epoxide.

Once the cuprate attacks, it opens the ep
