Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the structure of an unknown compound based on the spectral data provided. Let me take it step by step.

First, let's read through the problem carefully. The compound is a white solid, and the chemist has provided mass spectrometry, IR, and 1H NMR data. The options are four different compounds, each with a chlorine substituent and a functional group, like hydroxy, aldehyde, or acid.

The mass spec shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%) and another peak at 158 (32%). The IR has a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1 and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. The 1H NMR has three signals: a singlet at 11.0 ppm integrating for 1H, a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H), and another doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).

Let me break down each piece of data.

Starting with the mass spec. The molecular ion is at 156. The other peak at 158 suggests some kind of isotopic peak. Wait, chlorine has a significant natural abundance isotope, Cl-35 and Cl-37. So if the molecular formula includes Cl, the molecular ion could have peaks at m/z corresponding to the different isotopes.

Let me calculate the molecular weight. Let's see, the options are four, so maybe I can get the molecular weight from their formulas.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Its formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate the molecular weight: C=12*7=84, H=5=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. Total is 84+5=89, +35.5 is 124.5, +32 is 156.5. Hmm, but the molecular ion is at 156. That's a bit off. Wait, but maybe the molecular formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C8H5ClO2? Or wait, maybe I should double-check.

Wait, benzaldehyde is C7H6O. If it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's compute that: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5 for Cl, 2*16=32. So 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. So the molecular weight is approximately 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156. That makes sense because the molecular ion is usually the M+· ion, so M is 156.5, but the mass is rounded to 156. Wait, but in mass spectrometry, the exact mass depends on the isotopes. So, if the molecule has a Cl atom, which has a 35 and 37 isotope, the molecular ion would show peaks at both m/z 156 and 158. Because for each Cl, 75% is Cl-35 (35) and 25% is Cl-37 (37). So the molecular ion (M) would be at 156 (for Cl-35), and the next peak would be at 158 (Cl-37). The relative intensity would be 75% and 25%, but the question says 100% and 32%. Hmm, that doesn't match 75% and 25%. Alternatively, maybe there's another isotope effect, or perhaps the molecular formula has more than one Cl? Let me check the options.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as option A, same molecular weight. So the same as above, so the molecular ion would be at 156 (Cl-35) and 158 (Cl-37), but their intensities would be 3:1 (75% for 156 and 25% for 158). But the question states 32%, which is about a quarter, so that matches. So the 32% peak at 158 is likely the Cl-37 isotope. So that could fit.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. The formula would be C6H4ClO2. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. Let's compute the molecular weight: C6H5O2Cl. C=6*12=72, H=5, O=32, Cl=35.5. 72+5=77+35.5=112.5 +32=144.5. So the molecular ion would be 144. But in the problem, it's 156. So that doesn't match. Unless I got the formula wrong. Wait, perhaps phenyl chloroformate is OCl-CO-Ph? Its formula is C6H5ClO2? Wait, molecular weight would be 144.5 as before, so not matching the 156. So option C is out.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is same as option B and A: C7H5ClO2. So same molecular weight, so same mass spec as B.

So all of A, B, D have the same molecular weight, so the mass spec can't help me choose between them so far.

Next, the IR data: a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1 and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1.

A broad peak in that region suggests an -OH group because O-H stretch is usually broad. Alternatively, it could be an amide or something else, but in the options, we have an aldehyde, an acid, and a chloroformate.

The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is probably a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Let's see:

- Aldehyde (RCHO): The carbonyl peak is around 1720-1710 cm^-1, but sometimes higher. Also, aldehydes usually have a peak around 2800-2700 cm^-1 due to the aldehyde H stretch, which is a strong, sharp peak. But in the IR data, the broad peak is from 3500-2700, which may include that, but the other peak is at 1720.

- Carboxylic acid (RCOOH): The carbonyl is around 1700 cm^-1. However, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch due to the -OH group, which is consistent with the broad peak in the IR (3500-2700 cm^-1). Additionally, the O-H stretch in carboxylic acids is usually around 2500-3300 cm^-1 and is broad because of hydrogen bonding.

- Benzaldehyde (if it's an aldehyde): The carbonyl would be around 1720, but the aldehyde's O-H is not present because benzaldehyde is an aldehyde without an -OH (unless it's 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde). Wait, option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So that would have both a carbonyl (from aldehyde) and an -OH group. The IR shows a broad peak, which would be the -OH group. The strong peak at 1720 would be the aldehyde's carbonyl. Also, aldehydes have a strong absorption around 2800 cm^-1 (the C-H stretch of the aldehyde), which is within the 3500-2700 region. So that could fit the IR data.

Wait, but if the compound is a carboxylic acid, like options B or D, the carbonyl would be around 1700-1720. The broad peak would be due to the -OH of the acid. So both the aldehyde and the acid have an -OH group, but their carbonyl groups are similar in wavenumbers.

But looking at the NMR data. Let's move there.

The 1H NMR shows:

- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H)
- 8.02 ppm (d, 2H)
- 7.72 ppm (d, 2H)

11.0 ppm is a singlet integrating for one proton. That's a strong indication of a -COOH group because the -OH proton in a carboxylic acid typically appears around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm as a sharp peak. Wait, but in the NMR, it's a singlet at 11.0. That's a bit higher than an aldehyde. Also, the aldehyde's proton is usually a triplet due to coupling with adjacent protons, but in aromatic aldehydes, maybe it's a singlet if it's para to substituents. Hmm.

Wait, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have an aldehyde proton. Let me think about its structure. The structure is Cl in position 3, OH in position 2, and aldehyde in position 1 (assuming the numbering is such). So the aldehyde would be at position 1 (like benzaldehyde), so the aldehyde proton would be on the aromatic ring. Wait, but in that case, the aldehyde is attached to the ring, so the proton is part of the aromatic ring. No, wait, a benzaldehyde has the structure where the CHO is attached to the benzene ring. So the aldehyde proton is not on the ring; it's on the CHO group. So the aldehyde proton would be a singlet because it's not adjacent to any other protons. In the NMR, the aldehyde proton typically appears as a singlet around 9.5-10.5 ppm. So the 11.0 ppm is a bit high, but it's close.

Alternatively, the proton at 11.0 ppm could be from a carboxylic acid. The -COOH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and is a broad peak. But in this case, it's a singlet, which may not match the broadness. However, sometimes in DMSO or when there's exchange, the signal could be sharp, but I'm not sure.

So looking at the other NMR signals. The 8.02 ppm doublet (2H) and 7.72 ppm doublet (2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because a doublet of doublets or a pair of doublets, each integrating for two protons, could indicate two sets of protons adjacent to substituents.

If the aromatic ring has substituents in the para positions, then the two doublets would each be two equivalent protons. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the protons across from each other would be equivalent.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The benzaldehyde would have substituents at positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and 1 (CHO). So the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3 positions. Wait, that would leave the ring with substituents in adjacent positions. So the aromatic protons would not be in a para arrangement. Let me think, the structure would be:

Positions 1: CHO, position 2: OH, position 3: Cl.

So the ring would have substituents at 1, 2, 3, making it a meta arrangement between some substituents. The remaining protons would be at positions 4,5,6. But wait, no, benzaldehyde has substituents in positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). So the protons at positions 4,5,6 would be in a more complex splitting pattern. If the protons on the ring are all adjacent to substituents, their signals might not be simple doublets.

Alternatively, options B and D are 4-chlorobenzoic acid and 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Let's consider benzoic acid. The structure would have a COOH group attached to the benzene ring.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The substituents are Cl at position 4 and COOH at position 1. So the ring has substituents at 1 and 4. The remaining positions (2,3,5,6) would have protons. But wait, benzoic acid's structure is a benzene ring with COOH at position 1. If there's a Cl at position 4, then the ring is para-substituted with Cl and COOH. Wait, no, benzoic acid has the COOH at position 1, and Cl at position 4 would be para to COOH.

In that structure, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 would be equivalent if the substituents are para. So the NMR would show two doublets: one for the protons ortho to COOH and Cl, and another for the meta positions.

Wait, let me think about the splitting. In para-substituted benzoic acid, the ring has substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). Then the protons at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, and protons at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH.

In such a case, the protons at 2 and 6 would each be next to the COOH group and the Cl. So each of these protons (2 and 6) would be adjacent to two substituents: COOH and Cl. Wait, but in benzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. The protons at 2 and 6 are next to position 1 (COOH). The protons at 3 and 5 are next to position 4 (Cl).

Wait, actually, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to draw this out.

Benzoic acid has COOH at position 1. If the Cl is at position 4 (para), then the ring looks like:

Positions:

1: COOH

2: H

3: H

4: Cl

5: H

6: H

Wait, no, that's not right. In para-substituted, the substituents are across from each other. So if COOH is at 1, Cl would be at 4.

So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4.

The protons on the ring would be at 2, 3, 5, 6.

Protons at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH (position 1), and meta to Cl (position 4).

Protons at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

But in para-substituted benzene rings, the protons at 2 and 6 are equivalent (due to symmetry), and the same for 3 and 5.

In that scenario, the NMR would show two sets of protons: one set as a doublet (for the ortho protons) and another as another doublet (for the meta protons).

Wait, but let me think about the splitting. Each proton ortho to COOH would be next to one substituent (COOH) and another proton. So for the protons at 2 and 6, each is next to a COOH group and a proton (say, at 3 and 5). But I'm not entirely certain about the splitting pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the coupling would result in a doublet of doublets, but if the substituents are symmetric, perhaps the coupling constants are the same, leading to a doublet.

Alternatively, considering that the two protons are equivalent, perhaps each would couple with only one neighboring proton, resulting in a doublet. So the 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) could be the protons ortho to COOH, and the 7.72 (d, 2H) could be the protons meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

But wait, in benzoic acid derivatives, the protons ortho to the COOH group are typically more downfield than the others. Let me think. The COOH is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so the ortho protons would be deshielded and appear upfield or downfield? Wait, deshielded would mean downfield. So the ortho protons would appear at higher ppm.

In the NMR data, the 8.02 ppm is a doublet integrating for 2H, and 7.72 ppm is another doublet for 2H. So if the ortho protons are at 8.02 and the meta are at 7.72, that fits.

So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B), the structure would have Cl at position 4 and COOH at position 1. The protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be at higher ppm (8.02), and the meta protons (positions 3 and 5), which are next to Cl, would be at 7.72 ppm.

But wait, Cl is an electron-withdrawing group as well, so the protons adjacent to Cl would be deshielded, but perhaps not as much as those adjacent to COOH. So the ortho protons might be more deshielded than the meta, hence higher ppm.

Alternatively, the protons ortho to COOH would have higher chemical shift. So 8.02 could be ortho to COOH, and 7.72 could be meta to COOH.

Another option is that the 8.02 ppm is from the aldehyde's adjacent protons, but in that case, the aldehyde's protons would be somewhere else.

Wait, let's consider option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The structure would be:

Positions: 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). So the ring has substituents at 1, 2, and 3.

The remaining protons are at 4,5,6.

In such a structure, the ring would have substituents in adjacent positions, which could lead to coupling between the protons. The protons at 4,5,6 would be in a meta arrangement, but I'm not sure about their splitting.

Alternatively, the aromatic protons might not appear as simple doublets. For example, the protons at 4 could be next to 3 (Cl) and 5 (which is next to 6). This might cause a more complex splitting pattern, like a triplet or a doublet of doublets, but the NMR only shows two doublets each integrating for 2H.

Hmm, that seems more complicated, so perhaps option A is less likely.

Looking back at the NMR, the singlet at 11 ppm (1H). If it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH proton would be around there. But in the case of benzoic acid, the -OH is usually a broad peak. However, in the NMR, it's a singlet, which suggests maybe an aldehyde, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm.

Wait, but the singlet at 11.0 could also be an exchangeable proton, like an -OH in a carboxylic acid, but why is it a singlet? Maybe in DMSO-d6 as the solvent, the -OH could appear sharp. Alternatively, perhaps it's an amide or something else, but the options don't include amides.

Wait, another possibility: the singlet at 11 ppm could be the aldehyde proton. But I thought aldehyde protons are around 9-10. Maybe in this case, it's higher because of the substituents. Let me think. If the aldehyde is attached to a benzene ring with electron-withdrawing groups, the aldehyde proton could be deshielded and appear at a higher ppm.

In option A, the aldehyde is at position 1, adjacent to an OH (position 2) and Cl (position 3). The presence of strong electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl and OH) could deshield the aldehyde proton, pushing its chemical shift upfield or downfield. Wait, the aldehyde proton is usually in the 9-10 region. If it's near electron-withdrawing groups, it would be more deshielded (downfield), hence higher ppm. So 11 ppm is possible.

But then, the aromatic protons would be more complex. For option A, the substituents are at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). The remaining protons are at 4,5,6.

In such a case, the ring is substituted at 1, 2, 3, so the protons at 4,5,6 would be in a meta arrangement. Maybe each pair (like 4 and 6) would be equivalent, and 5 would be another. But I'm not certain about the splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the protons at 4 and 6 are equivalent, and 5 is a different proton. So, for example, the proton at 4 is next to Cl (position 3) and the proton at 5. The proton at 5 is next to 4 and 6, which is next to position 1 (CHO). This might result in some coupling, but without more detailed analysis, it's hard to say.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted ring, perhaps. Because in a para-substituted benzene, the two sets of protons (ortho and meta) would each be equivalent and split into doublets.

So if the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B), the aromatic protons would be at 8.02 and 7.72, each as doublets.

But wait, another thing to consider is the IR data. Benzoic acid would have a strong O-H stretch (broad) from the -COOH group. The IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which would include the O-H stretch. The sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is the C=O of the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, a chloroformate would have a carbonyl, but the NMR would be different.

Another thing to note: in the 1H NMR of benzoic acid, the -COOH proton is usually broad and appears around 10-12 ppm. But in the given NMR, the singlet at 11.0 is sharp. That might indicate that it's not a carboxylic acid, because the -OH in acid is usually broad. But perhaps in DMSO, the peak could be sharp. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, the singlet would be sharp.

Wait, so if the singlet is an aldehyde proton, then the compound is likely option A or perhaps another aldehyde. But option A is the only aldehyde among the options.

Wait, but let's re-examine the options. Option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So, it has both an -OH and an aldehyde group. The IR would show an O-H stretch and an aldehyde C=O. But in that case, the aldehyde C=O would be around 1720, which matches the IR data. The broad peak in IR would be the O-H (from both the aldehyde and the acid? Wait, no, 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have an -OH (phenol group, perhaps) and an aldehyde.

But wait, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have a phenolic -OH (position 2) and an aldehyde group (position 1). So the IR would have both the phenolic O-H (broad) and the aldehyde C=O (sharp). So the IR data would fit.

In the NMR, the singlet at 11.0 would be the aldehyde proton. But why is it at 11? Usually, aldehydes are around 9-10. But perhaps due to the substituents, it's shifted higher. Also, the presence of an -OH group (phenolic) nearby could cause some deshielding. Alternatively, the aldehyde might be in a different environment.

Wait, but in option A, the structure is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So the substituents are at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). So the aldehyde is at position 1, making the aldehyde proton's environment more deshielded due to the adjacent substituents. Hence, the higher chemical shift.

The NMR would have the aldehyde proton as a singlet at high ppm, the aromatic protons as two doublets. Let me think about the aromatic protons in this structure.

Positions 4 and 6 would be adjacent to Cl (position 3) and position 2 (OH), respectively. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, with substituents at 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl), the ring would have the remaining protons at 4,5,6. Each of these protons would have different substituents nearby, leading to different chemical shifts.

But the NMR data shows two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests that the aromatic protons are in two sets of two equivalent protons each. So, perhaps in the structure, there are two pairs of equivalent protons.

In option A, the substituents at 1,2,3 would not produce equivalent protons at 4,5,6. For instance, position 4 is next to substituent at 3 (Cl) and position 5. Position 5 is next to position 4 and 6. Position 6 is next to position 5 and substituent at 1 (CHO). So the protons at 4 and 6 would not be equivalent because their neighboring groups are different.

Therefore, the NMR wouldn't have two doublets each integrating for 2H if the substituents are at 1,2,3. Instead, there might be more complex splitting. So maybe option A is not correct.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Its structure has substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the ring is para-substituted with COOH and Cl.

In this case, the aromatic protons would be in two sets of two equivalent protons each. The protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be equivalent and appear as a doublet. The protons meta to COOH and ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would also be equivalent and appear as another doublet. This would give two doublets, each integrating for 2H, which matches the NMR data.

The singlet at 11.0 ppm would then be from the -COOH group's proton. But wait, the -COOH proton is usually broad. The NMR shows a sharp singlet, which is a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the sample was measured under conditions where the -OH is deprotonated, leading to a different signal, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, the singlet at 11.0 could be from an exchange process, but the sharpness suggests it's not an -OH proton. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde, but that would require the aldehyde's position in the structure.

Wait, if option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the NMR would have a singlet for the COOH proton, but in reality, the COOH proton is usually broad. However, maybe in this case, the sample is not in a solution where the COOH is deprotonated, so the -OH is present and appears as a sharp singlet? That seems unlikely because the -OH in a carboxylic acid is usually broad.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is from another proton. Wait, the COOH group has only one proton. So that's the only possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a chloroformate, like option C. But earlier analysis suggested that its molecular weight is lower, so that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound isn't a carboxylic acid but a phenyl ester. Let me think—no, the options are limited.

Alternatively, let's consider option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. The substituents would be at position 2 (Cl) and position 1 (COOH). So the ring has COOH at 1 and Cl at 2. The remaining positions are 3,4,5,6.

In this case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. The protons at positions 3 and 6 would be ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. The protons at positions 4 and 5 would be meta to COOH and para to Cl.

Wait, but that might not produce two doublets. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the protons are split into two groups, each a doublet.

Wait, in 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). The protons at 3 and 6 would be adjacent to COOH (position 1) and Cl (position 2). The protons at 4 and 5 would be across the ring.

But I'm not sure about the splitting here. It might not produce two doublets, but perhaps more complex splitting. So the NMR data would not fit as neatly as in option B.

Therefore, considering the NMR data and the IR data, option B seems more plausible.

Wait, but the IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700, which would include the O-H stretch (from the carboxylic acid). The strong sharp peak at 1720 is the C=O of the acid.

The 1H NMR would have the COOH proton as a singlet, but in reality, it's broad. So perhaps the sample was measured in a way that the -OH is sharp, or perhaps it's another proton. Alternatively, maybe it's not a COOH proton.

Wait, another thought: the singlet at 11.0 could be an aldehyde proton. If that's the case, the compound would be an aldehyde, which would fit option A.

In that case, the IR would have the aldehyde C=O at 1720 and the O-H (phenol) as a broad peak. The NMR would have the aldehyde as a singlet, and the aromatic protons as two doublets, which would require a para-substituted ring.

But in option A, the substituents are at 1,2,3, which would make the ring not para-substituted, leading to more complex splitting. So that would not explain the NMR data.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to summarize:

- Mass: All options except C have molecular weight around 156.5, so C is out.

- IR: 1720 suggests a carbonyl group, either aldehyde or acid. Broad peak suggests O-H.

- NMR:

   - Singlet at 11 ppm: possibly aldehyde (if sharp) or COOH proton (broad).

   - Two doublets: 8.02 and 7.72, each 2H. So for a para-substituted ring, perhaps.

Looking again, if the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B), the -COOH would give a broad peak in IR, the C=O at 1720. The NMR would have the -COOH proton as a broad singlet, but in the data, the singlet is sharp. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, if the singlet is not from -COOH, perhaps it's from another group. Wait, another possibility: the singlet could be from an O-H in a phenol group.

Wait, let's think about option A again. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde has both a phenolic -OH and an aldehyde group. The IR would show O-H (broad) and aldehyde C=O. The NMR would have the aldehyde proton as a singlet, and the phenolic -OH as a broad peak. But in the given NMR data, the singlet is sharp, so perhaps the -OH is not present as a separate peak, which is confusing.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the singlet is at 11.0. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, that would be the -COOH proton. But why is it a singlet? Alternatively, maybe the -OH is not exchanging rapidly, so it appears as a sharp peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet isn't from an -OH or aldehyde. Could it be another group, like an acidic proton elsewhere?

Alternatively, maybe it's a different functional group, but the options are limited.

Wait, another possibility: the singlet could be an -NH proton, but none of the options have amine groups.

Alternatively, the singlet is from an -OCH3 group, but none of the options have that.

Hmm.

Let me think about the NMR for option B again. If it's 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the -COOH proton would normally be a broad peak, perhaps around 12 ppm. But the data shows a sharp singlet at 11.0. So either the data is misinterpreted, or perhaps the structure has a different proton.

Alternatively, maybe the singlet is from the aldehyde, but that would require the structure to have an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the singlet is from an aldehyde, and the structure is a para-substituted benzaldehyde with other substituents.

Wait, in para-substituted benzaldehyde, the aldehyde is at position 1, and another substituent at position 4. But the other substituent would be something else. For example, if it's 4-chloro benzaldehyde, then the structure would have Cl at 4 and CHO at 1. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to CHO and para to Cl. The protons at 3 and 5 would be meta to CHO and ortho to Cl.

In that case, the NMR would have the aldehyde proton as a singlet around 9-10 ppm. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets: one set ortho to CHO (which is more deshielded, higher ppm) and another set meta to CHO and ortho to Cl (less deshielded, lower ppm).

Wait, but option A has substituents at 1,2,3. So it's not para-substituted aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-chloro benzaldehyde, but that's not one of the options. The options are A, B, C, D as given.

Wait, another thought: the singlet at 11.0 could be due to an acidic NH proton, but none of the options have amines. So that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is from a different functional group, but nothing comes to mind.

Given the options, perhaps option B is the correct answer despite the possible inconsistency in the NMR. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think about the IR again. 1720 cm^-1 is more consistent with an aldehyde than a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids usually have lower wavenumbers, around 1700 cm^-1. Aldehydes are higher, around 1720-1740. So if the IR peak is at 1720, it suggests an aldehyde.

So if the IR peak is at 1720, the compound is more likely an aldehyde. So that would point to option A or perhaps another aldehyde that's not among the options.

Looking at the options, only option A is an aldehyde. So let's reevaluate.

If the compound is option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

IR shows O-H (broad) from the phenol group and aldehyde C=O (sharp).

The NMR would have the aldehyde proton at ~11 ppm as a singlet, the phenolic -OH as a broad peak around 5 ppm, but in the given data, the phenolic -OH is not present. Wait, but the given NMR data includes only three signals. So perhaps the phenolic -OH is exchanging and not appearing as a separate peak, or it's integrated into the broad peak at 3500-2700 cm^-1 in the IR.

Wait, the NMR data shows three signals: 11.0 (s, 1H), 8.02 (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H). So the phenolic -OH is not appearing here, perhaps because it's broad and integrated elsewhere or not observed under the conditions.

In that case, the aldehyde proton is at 11.0 ppm, the aromatic protons as two doublets. So how would the aromatic protons look in option A?

In option A, the substituents are at 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). The ring has H at 4,5,6. Let's imagine the structure:

Positions:

1: CHO

2: OH

3: Cl

4: H

5: H

6: H

Wait, but in reality, the substituents are at 1,2,3, which is a meta arrangement. The remaining hydrogens are at 4,5,6. So the ring's substituents are at 1, 2, 3, which are adjacent.

In such a scenario, the ring would have H at 4,5,6. The H at 4 is adjacent to Cl (position 3) and H5. H5 is adjacent to H4 and H6. H6 is adjacent to H5 and CHO (position 1).

This would cause the ring protons to have different chemical shifts and splitting patterns. For example, H4 would be next to Cl and H5. H5 is between H4 and H6. H6 is next to H5 and CHO, which is an electron-withdrawing group.

This would likely result in complex splitting, such as doublet of doublets or triplets, but in the NMR, there are only two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests that the aromatic protons are in two sets of two equivalent protons each, which would occur in a para-substituted ring.

Therefore, option A's structure doesn't fit the NMR data, as it would produce more complex splitting.

Hmm, this is getting really tricky. Let me try to approach this differently.

Let's look at the NMR data again. The aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H. That implies a symmetrical substitution pattern on the benzene ring. So for example, a para-substituted benzene would have two sets of equivalent protons.

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. In this case, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the ring has substituents in para positions. The remaining protons are at 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 are equivalent (both ortho to COOH), and the protons at 3 and 5 are equivalent (both meta to COOH and ortho to Cl).

Therefore, the NMR would show two doublets: one for the ortho protons (2 and 6) at higher ppm, and another for the meta protons (3 and 5) at lower ppm. That matches the given data.

The singlet at 11.0 ppm would be from the COOH proton. But wait, the COOH proton is typically broad because it's involved in strong hydrogen bonds. However, in some cases, especially in deuterated solvents or under certain conditions, the peak could appear as a sharp singlet. Alternatively, perhaps the sample was measured under conditions where the -OH is not exchanging rapidly, leading to a sharp peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet isn't from the COOH but from another proton. But given the options, COOH is the only possibility for a singlet at 11 ppm.

So, putting it all together:

- Mass spec: molecular ion at 156, with a 32% peak at 158 (Cl isotope).

- IR: broad peak from O-H (carboxylic acid), sharp peak at 1720 (C=O).

- NMR: singlet at 11 (COOH proton), two doublets for para-substituted aromatic protons.

Thus, option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid seems to fit.


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156 (100%)** and **m/z = 158 (32%)** suggests a molecular weight of approximately 156.5, with the 32% peak corresponding to the chlorine isotope (Cl-37). This eliminates option **C (Phenyl chloroformate)**, as its molecular weight is significantly lower (144.5). The remaining options (**A, B, D**) have the same molecular formula (C₇H₅ClO₂) and molecular weight.

The **IR spectrum** shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H group, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests the compound is either a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde. The **1H NMR spectrum** provides further insight:

- A **singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H)** is consistent with the proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) or an aldehyde (-CHO). However, aldehyde protons typically appear around 9-10 ppm, making the singlet at 11.0 ppm more consistent with a carboxylic acid.
- Two **doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H)** and **7.72 ppm (2H)** indicate a para-substituted aromatic ring, as the protons are split into two equivalent sets.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   This compound has a phenolic -OH group, an aldehyde (-CHO), and a chlorine substituent. The IR spectrum would show both an O-H stretch (from the phenol) and a C=O stretch (from the aldehyde). However, the NMR data does not fit this structure, as the substituents at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl) would lead to a more complex splitting pattern for the aromatic protons, inconsistent with the two doublets observed.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and a chlorine substituent in the para position. The IR spectrum matches, as the broad peak corresponds to the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid, and the sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O stretch. The NMR data also matches: the singlet at 11.0 ppm is the -COOH proton, and the two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons ortho and meta to the -COOH group, respectively. This structure is consistent with all the spectral data.

3. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and a chlorine substituent in the ortho position. The NMR data does not fit this structure, as the aromatic protons would not produce two doublets with the observed splitting pattern. Instead, the splitting would be more complex due to the proximity of the -COOH and Cl groups.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data (mass, IR, and NMR) are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The molecular weight matches, the IR spectrum shows the expected O-H and C=O stretches, and the NMR spectrum matches the para-substituted aromatic ring pattern.
