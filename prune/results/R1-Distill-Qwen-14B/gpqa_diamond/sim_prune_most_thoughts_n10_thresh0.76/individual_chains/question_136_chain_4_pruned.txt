Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r² from the origin. The magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a non-zero component along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I'm supposed to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that divergence is a measure of a vector field's source or sink at a given point. The divergence theorem might come into play here because it relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface.

Wait, the divergence theorem states that the volume integral of ∇·f over a region is equal to the flux of f through the surface enclosing that region. So, applying that, I can compute either the volume integral directly or compute the flux through the sphere of radius R.

But wait, the vector field f is given, so maybe I should compute the divergence first.

In spherical coordinates, since the field is radial, and only the radial component is non-zero. Let me denote the radial unit vector as r̂. So, f(r) = f_r(r) r̂, where f_r(r) = 1/r².

The divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the radial component is given by:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r)

Let me plug f_r = 1/r² into that. So,

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ]

Simplify the expression inside the derivative:

r² * (1/r²) = 1. So,

d/dr (1) = 0. Therefore, ∇·f = 0.

Wait, that's confusing. If the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin, then the volume integral should be zero. But wait, what about the origin? Because 1/r² suggests a point charge-like behavior, which might have a divergence at r=0.

Wait, but in this case, f(r) = 1/r². Let me think about the electric field analogy. The electric field of a point charge varies as 1/r²,
