Okay, I need to figure out which sequence of reactions will give me 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Wait, no, wait. Let me look again. The structure is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So numbering the benzene ring, position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. That's a meta arrangement between ethoxy and tert-butyl, but the nitro is in position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (since position 1 and 2 are ortho, 3 is meta to 1). Wait, no. Wait, benzene numbering is a ring, so positions 1, 2, 3 are consecutive. So substituents are at 1, 2, and 3 positions.

Wait, substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3? That would make it a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. But wait, is that possible? Because benzene is symmetric, but let's think about the substituents' directing effects.

Benzene rings can undergo electrophilic substitution. Each substituent directs incoming groups to certain positions based on their activating or deactivating, and whether they are meta or para directors.

In the target molecule, the substituents are:

- Ethoxy group (OEt) at position 1: ethoxy is an activating group, ortho/para director.

- tert-Butyl group at position 2: tert-butyl is a bulky, activating group (since it's an alkyl group), so it's an activating, ortho/para director.

- Nitro group at position 3: nitro is a strong deactivating, meta director.

Wait, but the nitro group is at position 3 relative to ethoxy and tert-butyl. Hmm, this part is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this by determining the order in which the substituents are added. Since nitro groups are meta directors, if
