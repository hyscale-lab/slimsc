Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the interaction of high-energy gamma rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Hmm, I remember that gamma rays can annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The question is asking at what energy a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe would be limited by this process. 

The setup seems to be about photon-photon annihilation. I think the process is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. The problem gives the average photon energy of the CMB as 10^-3 eV. So, the gamma-ray is high-energy, and the CMB photon is low-energy.

Wait, I recall something about the mean free path and photon-photon interactions. The lifetime of a particle depends on the probability of it interacting and the density of the medium. For gamma rays, interactions with the CMB photons would limit how far they can travel, which affects their lifetime.

I think the cross-section for this annihilation process is probably important here. The cross-section (σ) depends on the energy of the gamma ray and the CMB photon. Since the CMB photon energy is much lower (1e-3 eV), maybe the gamma's energy is much higher, so we can make some approximations.

The cross-section for γγ → e+e- is given by some formula. I remember that the cross-section has a certain dependence on the energy. Wait, when the gamma-ray energy is much larger than the CMB photon, the cross-section σ might scale with a certain power of the gamma's energy. I think it's proportional to 1/E^2 or something similar. Or maybe it's proportional to the square of the logarithm of E? Wait, no, that's for something else. Let me think.

Alternatively, I think the cross-section for this process peaks when the gamma photon energy E is around twice the electron mass (which is about 0.511 MeV). But wait, that's for pair production by a single photon interacting with another photon. But in this case, the CMB photon is so low energy, so maybe the cross-section is significant only when E is high enough.

Wait, the reaction γγ → e+ e- can only proceed if the combined energy of the two photons is at least the rest mass of the electron (twice, since we're producing two particles). The CMB photon is about 1e-3 eV, and the gamma is high energy, E. So the threshold condition is E
