Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the reaction scheme. It starts with compound A reacting with HCN to form B. Then B is reduced with H2 and Pd to make C. C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and D loses an inert gas to form E.

Looking at the hints, hint a) says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylide reactions are typically for Wittig reactions, right? The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting a phosphorus ylide with an aldehyde or ketone. So A must be a carbonyl compound because that's what the Wittig reacts with.

The product of the Wittig reaction is an alkene. The product given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me visualize that structure. So cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. Wait, position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a propenyl group. So the structure is cyclopentane with a double bond connected to a propan-2-yl group.

Wait, the ylid adds to the carbonyl. So if A is a carbonyl, then after the Wittig, it becomes an alkene. So maybe the starting compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Let me think: after the Wittig, the ring would have a substituent that's an alkene. So the product has a cyclopentane ring with a double bond (propan-2-ylidene) attached. So perhaps the original A was a cyclopentanone with a methyl group or something.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the ring has methyl groups at 1 and 2, and at 4, there's a propenyl group (since propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe it's (CH3)2C=CH- attached to the ring.

Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be the ylide part. The ylide is (CH3)2P=CH-CH2- something? No, wait. The ylide structure is P=CH-R, where R is an alkyl group. In this case, the propenyl group is attached as a substituent on the cyclopentane.

Wait, maybe the starting carbonyl is a cyclopentanone with methyl groups. For example, if A is 4-methylcyclopentanone. Then, the Wittig reaction would convert the ketone into an alkene. Let's see: cyclopentanone (if
