Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question says that there's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each integrating for 1:1 ratio. Then, there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, integrating in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options given are four different tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

Wait, C10H14. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2=4. So four degrees: probably one benzene ring (which is three double bonds or one ring plus three double bonds, but benzene is a ring plus three double bonds, so that's four degrees right there. So the rest of the molecule must be all single bonds. So substituents on the benzene ring.

So each compound is a tetramethylbenzene? Because if benzene is six carbons, and each substituent is methyl, then four methyl groups would be four carbons. So 6 +4 =10, which matches C10H14. Wait, but 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups. So that's 6 + 2*2=6+4=10. Oh wait, no. Diethyl is two ethyl groups. Each ethyl is two carbons. So benzene (6) + 2*(2) = 10. So the formula is C10H14. Because benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl is C2H5. Two ethyls would add 4 carbons and 10 hydrogens. So total is C6+4= C10, H6 + 10= H16? Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl group is C2H5. So two ethyl groups: 2*(C2H5) => C4H10. So the molecule is C6H6 + C4H10 => C10H16. Hmm, but the molecular formula is C10H14. So that's a problem. So the diethylbenzene would have C10H16, but the question says C10H14. So maybe it's not a diethyl. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the formula is C10H14. Let me recalculate the diethylbenzene. Benzene is C6H6, each ethyl is C2H5. So two ethyls add 4 carbons and 10 hydrogens. So 6+4=10 C, 6+10=16 H. But the formula is C10H14. So that doesn't match. So diethylbenzene is C8H10? Wait, no, benzene has six carbons, two ethyls (each two carbons) make eight. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, benzene is six, each ethyl is two, so two ethyls is four carbons. So six plus four is ten. So that's correct. But hydrogens: benzene is 6 H. Each ethyl is 5 H. Two ethyls: 10 H. So total H: 6 +10=16. But the formula is C10H14. So diethylbenzene would not fit, unless I'm missing something. Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe the diethyl is part of a substituent that's causing some deprotonation, but that's unlikely. So maybe 1,4-diethylbenzene isn't an option here because its formula doesn't match.

Wait, looking back at the options, one of them includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the diethylbenzene is actually 1,4-dimethylbenzene with ethyl groups? No, wait, the options list 1,4-diethylbenzene as an option. So the molecular formula of that would be C6H5-C2H5-C2H5? No, wait, the benzene has two ethyl substituents. So that's C6 (benzene) + 2*(C2) = C10. The hydrogens: benzene (6) + each ethyl has 5 H, so 6 + 5*2= 16. So C10H16. But the problem says C10H14, which is the molecular formula of the compounds in the mixture. So 1,4-diethylbenzene would have C10H16, which doesn't match. Hmm, so maybe the 1,4-diethylbenzene isn't a correct option. Unless the problem statement is correct, and I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me think: benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl group is C2H5, so each adds 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens. Two ethyls would add 4 carbons and 10 hydrogens. So total is C
