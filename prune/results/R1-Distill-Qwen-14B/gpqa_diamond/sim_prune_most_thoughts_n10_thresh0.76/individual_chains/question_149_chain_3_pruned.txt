Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question to tackle. Let me read through it carefully. 

The question says that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly like the expected molecule, but there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so it's not like they're splitting each other.

Then, the LC-MS at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, matching the expected molecule. So the mass is the same, but there are two separate peaks. Hmm.

Wait, let's break it down. The NMR shows two peaks for same alpha-proton. But the integral adds up to 1H, so each peak is about 0.5H? Or maybe similar, but together they sum to 1. They're similar in shift, so it's not like different environments. But the coupling isn't spin-spin, which usually happens when two protons are close, like geminal or vicinal. So why two peaks?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If there's a precursor, the mass would be different. But the LC-MS shows the same mass, so that's probably not. Unless the precursor ion has the same mass as the product? But that's less likely. Maybe not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers would have same molecular weight, so same mass in LC-MS. But in NMR, each enantiomer would have same number of protons, same shifts because they're mirror images. So the NMR would show a single peak, not two. So this might not fit. Unless... maybe the coupling is not between protons but some other kind of interaction? Wait, but the problem says coupling pattern rules out spin-spin. Enantiomers wouldn't cause double peaks in NMR because their protons are in equivalent environments. So maybe B isn't the right answer.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Hmm, what's that? I think when forming an amide bond, sometimes you can get some side reactions, like if two different amine groups attack the same carbonyl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe during the coupling, two different amide bonds form, but that seems unlikely. Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for the same proton. Or, perhaps, it's about diastereomers. If the molecule has some stereocenters, maybe during the coupling reaction, different stereochemistry arises.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so in NMR, they would show different shifts. But wait, in this case, the shifts are similar, so maybe if the diastereomers are similar enough, their peaks would be close. But why would the same alpha-proton split into two? Oh, wait, if the diastereomers have the same proton but in slightly different environments, they could cause two separate peaks. Like, for example, if the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere, causing the alpha proton to split its shift. But why would the integral add up to 1H? Because each diastereomer contributes half a proton? No. Wait, no. If there's a 50-50 mix of two diastereomers, each with the same number of protons, then the NMR would show each peak as double the area, but the integral would sum to 2H, not 1H. Oh, but the integral together is 1H. Maybe each diastereomer has a different environment for that proton, but in each case, the proton is present. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe each diastereomer has one proton, but the environment makes the shifts slightly different. So each diastereomer contributes one peak, but because they're similar, the two peaks are close. So the integral would be 2H. But wait, the question says the integral together is 1H. So maybe this isn't it. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows two peaks that integrate to 1H together. So each peak is about 0.5H. But an alpha-proton is only present once in each molecule. So how can that be? Maybe the compound is a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers, each with the same number of protons but in different environments. So for each molecule, the alpha proton exists, but in each diastereomer, the shift is slightly different. So each diastereomer has one proton, so the total integral would be 2H. But the question says the integral together is 1H. That doesn't add up. So maybe it's not diastereomers.

Wait, what about if the alpha-proton is in a different environment in each diastereomer, but they're both present. But that would cause each diastere
