Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem says that an organic chemist did two reactions. Reaction I uses (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. Reaction II uses pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 and then acidic workup. After both reactions are done, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: one normal-phase and one chiral. The question is how many peaks each will show.

Hmm, I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce esters, ketones, etc. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a milder reducing agent and typically reduces ketones but not esters. Wait, but sometimes it can depend on the reaction conditions. Oh, wait, pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups, so NaBH4 should reduce both, right?

Let me break down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH. LAH usually reduces carbonyl groups. The starting material is a ketone. So, LAH would reduce the ketone. Wait, but the molecule is (S) configuration. So the starting material is a chiral ketone.

When a ketone is reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product from Reaction I should be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait, does the reduction affect the configuration? LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically leads to
