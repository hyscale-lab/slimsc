Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound matches the given data. Let's take it step by step. The compound is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me jot down the molecular formula first. That's C9H11NO2. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so substituting: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So 5 degrees—probably a benzene ring (3 DoU) plus a double bond or an amide or something. 

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those broad peaks are likely N-H stretches. Amide or amine groups have strong N-H bands. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or amide. Esters usually have around 1740-1720, so 1720 fits. Amides are a bit lower, maybe around 1650, but perhaps this is a substituted amide or something else.

Now, the 1H NMR. Let me go through each part. 

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's a typical ethyl group, like -CH2CH3. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so probably a -CH2-CH3 where the CH2 is next to another group.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet often suggests exchange, like an NH2 group, but wait, the integration is 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to an electronegative atom. Wait, maybe it's a methylene (CH2) adjacent to something else. Oh, wait, in an ester, the OCH2CH3 would be around δ4.0 maybe. Let me think: in ethyl esters, the OCH2 is usually around δ4.1. But the triplet is at 1.20, so that would make sense for the CH3. Hmm, perhaps the 4.0 is something else.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet with 2H—so maybe a CH2 next to another CH2. Like in an ester group, the CH2O would be a quartet. Wait, the quartet at 4.5—maybe that's the OCH2 in an ester. Because the ethyl group's CH2 is adjacent to another group, leading to a quartet. Wait, yeah, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 gives a quartet for the OCH2 (split by the adjacent CH3), and a triplet for the CH3. But in the NMR data, the triplet is at 1.20, which aligns with the CH3. So the 4.5 quartet could be the OCH2. Then, the 4.0 could be another group.

7.0 ppm, doublet (2H); 8.0 ppm, doublet (2H). Those aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene. Because in para substitution, each proton is next to two others, but in the case of para substitution, each H would have one adjacent H on either side, leading to a doublet. Wait, no. For para substitution, the protons are opposite each other. So in a para-substituted aromatic ring, each proton has one neighbor on each adjacent carbon, but in reality, for a simple para substitution, the protons are equivalent and split into a doublet of doublets or something? Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the two doublets might indicate a coupling between two sets of protons, such as in a meta or para substitution with substituents causing coupling. Wait, perhaps it's a benzamide where the amide is attached at the para position, and the adjacent carbonyl is causing splitting. Alternatively, if the substituents are in the para positions, the aromatic protons could be two doublets, each with 2H, as in a 1,4-disubstitution.

Wait, the aromatic region: 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). The higher ppm (8.0) suggests more deshielded protons, which could be adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl. So maybe the benzene ring has substituents at the para positions. Let me think about the possible structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So the substituents are at 3 (ethoxy) and 1 (amide). Wait, but that's meta, not para. So the aromatic protons would be more complex. The NMR shows two doublets, 2H each, which might not fit a meta substitution but more a para.

Option B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formamide group is attached to the 4-ethoxy phenyl ring. The formamide has a CO-NH- structure. The substituents are at the 4 and 1 positions (assuming phenyl is numbered as 1 being the point of attachment). Wait, no: the phenyl is attached to the formamide's nitrogen. So the substituent is at the para position (4-ethoxy). So the ring would
