Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically dealing with Grubbs catalyst and racemic compounds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

The question is: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene?

Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. So the starting material is a racemic mixture of 3-methylpent-1-ene. I need to figure out what happens when Grubbs catalyst is used on this.

Grubbs catalyst is used for alkene metathesis reactions. Metathesis typically involves the redistribution of alkyl groups between alkenes, often breaking and reforming double bonds. Oh right, Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually involving ruthenium, and it's used for olefin metathesis.

The starting compound is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH₃)CH₂CH₃? Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So pent has five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, the substituents on C3 is a methyl group.

So the structure would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let's count. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂? No, wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But if it's 3-methylpent-1-ene, that means on carbon 3 (the third carbon), there's a methyl branch. So the structure would be CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, but that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene, which is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me count: Carbon 1: CH₂=, Carbon 2: CH-, Carbon 3: CH(CH3), Carbon 4: CH2CH3? Wait, that's five carbons. Yes.

Wait, no. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the formula is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH₂CH3? No, wait, that would have
