Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let's see what it says.

The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, right, pi mesons decay into a muon and a neutrino. Pi plus is positive, so the products are a positive muon and a neutrino. The pi is initially at rest, so that should simplify things a bit because the total momentum before decay is zero.

The rest masses are given: Pi+ is 139.6 MeV, and mu+ is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but wait, the neutrino is another particle. I remember that neutrinos are super light, but I'm not sure of their exact mass. Oh wait, in particle physics problems, sometimes the neutrino's mass is neglected, especially if the particles involved are much heavier. So maybe in this case, the neutrino's mass is considered zero? Because otherwise, the problem might get complicated. Let me think about that more.

So, in decay problems where the initial particle is at rest, the total energy must be conserved. Also, because the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That implies that the two product particles must have equal and opposite momenta. So their magnitudes of momentum are the same, but directions opposite.

Now, the initial rest energy is just the mass of Pi+, which is 139.6 MeV. So the total energy of the products must add up to that, right? Wait, no, wait. Because when a particle at rest decays, the total energy of the decay products includes their rest energies plus their kinetic energies.

Wait, let's get the energy conservation equation. The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the Pi, which is m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

So E_total = E_mu + E_nu.

And each of these energies is the sum of their rest energy and kinetic energy. So E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu, and E_nu = p_nu c + K_nu (since for a massless particle, E
