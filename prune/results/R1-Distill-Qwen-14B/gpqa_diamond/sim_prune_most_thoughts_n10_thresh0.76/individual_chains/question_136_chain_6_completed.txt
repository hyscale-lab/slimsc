Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and think through what I remember from my classes.

The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r², and it only has a radial component. So, the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r². Hmm, I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field is spreading out or converging at a point.

Wait, right, divergence in spherical coordinates. Since the field is radial and depends only on r, the divergence might be simpler to compute. I think for a vector field that's purely radial and depends on r alone, the divergence formula in spherical coordinates simplifies. Let me recall: for a radial vector field A(r)ȓ, the divergence is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A(r)). Oh right, because in spherical coordinates, divergence involves derivatives with respect to r, theta, and phi, but since the field has no angular components, those terms vanish.

So the divergence of f is (1/(r²)) d/dr [r² * (1/r²)]. Let's compute that. Let me write that out: inside the brackets, r² times 1/r² is just 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence ∇·f is zero? Wait, that can't be right because I remember something about Gauss's law and point charges. Wait, Gauss's law says that the integral of the divergence over a volume is equal to the flux through the surface. Oh wait, but if the divergence is zero, then the integral would be zero. But wait, if the field is like the electric field of a point charge, which has a divergence proportional to the charge density.

Wait, but in this case, the field is f(r) = 1/r² in the radial direction. Hmm, the electric field of a point charge is E = (kQ)/r² ȓ, right? And the divergence of E is ρ/ε₀, which is a delta function at the origin because for a point charge, the charge density is a delta function. So the divergence is non-zero only at r=0. So if I integrate the divergence over a volume that includes the origin, the integral might not be zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the field is f(r) = 1/r² ȓ, then the divergence is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) = (1/(r²)) d/dr (1) ) = 0. That suggests that ∇·f is zero everywhere except at r=0. But that's conflicting with the Gauss's law scenario where divergence is a delta function.

Ah, okay, because the function f(r) as given here is 1/r², which is the same as the electric field of a point charge, which actually has a divergence that's a delta function at the origin. So perhaps the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, but integrating over the volume including the origin would give a non-zero result.

Wait, but the problem says to evaluate the integral of the divergence inside the sphere of radius R. So if the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the integral would be zero. But that doesn't account for the point at the origin. Oh wait, no, because the divergence is zero except at the origin. So the volume integral would only get contributions from the origin, but in reality, the divergence is a delta function there.

Wait, maybe I got the divergence calculation wrong. Let me recalculate. So f(r) is radial, so F(r) = F(r)ȓ, and F(r) = 1/r². So the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr [r² F(r)].

So substituting F(r) = 1/r²:

(1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ] = (1/r²) d/dr [1] = 0.

So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. But wait, that's not correct because the field f(r) = 1/r² is the same as the electric field of a point charge, which has a divergence equal to ρ/ε₀, which is a delta function at the origin.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake here is assuming that the divergence is zero. So maybe the divergence is not zero, but that I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the volume integral of the divergence of f. According to the divergence theorem, this integral is equal to the flux of f through the surface of the sphere. So the integral of ∇·f dV over the volume is equal to the integral of f · n dS over the surface, where n is the outward normal vector (which is radial here).

So if I calculate the flux through the surface of the sphere, that might be easier.

f(r) is 1/r² in the radial direction, so on the surface r=R, the field is f = 1/R² ȓ. The surface area element in spherical coordinates is R² sinθ dθ dφ. The flux is f · n * dS, but since n is ȓ, the dot product is just f. So the flux is (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ.

Wait, that's (1/R²) * R² = 1. So the flux integral becomes the integral over θ and φ of 1 * sinθ dθ dφ. The integral of sinθ dθ from 0 to pi is 2, and the integral of dφ from 0 to 2pi is 2pi. So 2 * 2pi = 4pi.

So the volume integral of the divergence is equal to 4pi. But wait, that's the flux, which equals the volume integral of divergence. But earlier, the divergence was calculated as zero everywhere except origin. So that suggests that the volume integral is 4pi.

Wait, but wait, that can't be. Because if the divergence is zero everywhere except at origin, then integrating over any volume that includes the origin should give a non-zero result. So perhaps the divergence isn't zero, but that's conflicting with the initial calculation.

I think I'm getting confused here. Let me go back. Gauss's law says that the flux is Q_enc / ε₀, where Q_enc is the enclosed charge. In the case of a point charge, the flux through a sphere of radius R is proportional to Q, and the divergence at the origin is ρ/ε₀, which is a delta function. So the integral of the divergence over all space is the flux through any surface enclosing the origin, which would be Q/ε₀.

Wait, but in this problem, the vector field is given as f(r) = 1/r² ȓ. Let's think about this. If f is the electric field of a charge, then the flux through a sphere of radius R would be E * 4pi R² = (kQ)/R² * 4 pi R² = 4 pi k Q. Which is equal to (Q)/(ε₀) because k=1/(4 pi ε₀). So 4 pi k Q = Q/(ε₀). So the flux is Q/ε₀. But this is the same as the integral of the divergence over the volume inside the sphere. So the integral of ∇·f over the volume is equal to the flux, which is 4 pi.

But wait, according to the divergence theorem, the flux is the integral of divergence over the volume. So if the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the integral over any volume not including the origin is zero, and the integral over a volume including the origin would be the flux. So in this case, the flux is 4 pi, so the volume integral would be 4 pi.

But wait, earlier calculation said divergence is zero, which would imply the integral is zero. That's conflicting. So perhaps I made a mistake in computing the divergence.

Wait, let me recompute divergence. The field is F(r) = (1/r²) ȓ. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a radial field is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F(r)).

So F(r) = 1/r². So r² F(r) = r² (1/r²) = 1.

d/dr (1) = 0. So divergence is (1/(r²)) * 0 = 0. So divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0.

But according to the divergence theorem, the integral over the sphere should be 4 pi. How does that reconcile?

Ah, I think the issue is that the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, but the function f(r) is not differentiable at r=0, so the divergence is actually a delta function there.

Wait, but in this problem, we're evaluating the volume integral inside the sphere. So the volume includes the origin, so the integral would include the delta function contribution.

But earlier calculations using the divergence formula gave zero everywhere except origin, but the divergence theorem gives the integral as 4 pi. So I must be missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f(r) is not smooth at r=0, so the divergence is zero except at r=0, but the integral over any volume that includes r=0 is 4 pi. So the integral is 4 pi.

Wait, but wait, the divergence is zero except at origin, but the volume integral is the integral of the divergence. So if the divergence is zero everywhere except at origin, which is a single point, the integral should be zero because the point has zero volume. But that contradicts the divergence theorem.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused between the mathematical function and the physical scenario. Let's think again.

The vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) ȓ. Its divergence is zero except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So when integrating the divergence over the entire space, it's the same as the flux through a surface enclosing the origin, which is 4 pi.

But in the problem, we're integrating over a sphere of radius R, which certainly includes the origin. So the integral would be 4 pi. But wait, that can't be right because if I compute the divergence as zero everywhere else, except origin, the integral would be zero. So perhaps I'm missing something in the calculation of the divergence.

Wait, perhaps the field f(r) isn't the same as the electric field, but let's see. Wait, in the case of f(r) = 1/r² ȓ, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, but the flux through the sphere is 4 pi. So the integral of the divergence is 4 pi. So the correct answer would be 4 pi.

But wait, wait, looking back at the problem, the field is given as f(r) = 1/r², and it's radial. So perhaps the divergence is indeed zero, and the integral would be zero. But the flux through the sphere would be 4 pi, which would imply that the divergence must have a delta function at origin to account for that. But the given vector field doesn't have a delta function divergence, so perhaps the integral is zero.

Wait, but that can't be right because the flux is 4 pi, which is the integral of the divergence. So if the divergence is zero everywhere except origin, but the integral is 4 pi, that suggests that the divergence has a delta function at origin.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the field f(r) = 1/r² ȓ is the same as the electric field of a point charge, which has a divergence equal to rho/epsilon_0, where rho is a delta function. So the divergence is not zero everywhere except origin; instead, it's a delta function at origin. So the divergence is 4 pi delta^3(r), perhaps.

Wait, but let's compute it properly. The divergence of f(r) is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F(r)) ), which for F(r) = 1/r² is (1/(r²)) d/dr (1) ) = 0. But that's only when r is not zero. So for r≠0, the divergence is zero. But in reality, the field f(r) = 1/r² ȓ comes from a point charge, which would have a delta function in the divergence.

So perhaps the function f(r) is not smooth at r=0, and the divergence is zero except at the origin, but the integral over any volume that includes the origin would be 4 pi. So the integral of the divergence is 4 pi, which is option A.

Wait, but let's think again about the divergence. The calculation says divergence is zero for r≠0, but the integral over any volume including the origin gives 4 pi. So the integral is 4 pi.

So the correct answer would be A) 4 pi.


The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field **f(r)** inside a sphere of radius **R** centered at the origin. The vector field is given as **f(r) = 1/r² ȓ**, where **ȓ** is the radial unit vector in spherical coordinates, and it has only a radial component. The divergence of a radial vector field in spherical coordinates is given by:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 f(r) \right).
\]

Substituting **f(r) = 1/r²**, we compute:

\[
r^2 f(r) = r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} = 1,
\]

and

\[
\frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0.
\]

Thus, the divergence of **f(r)** is:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \cdot 0 = 0 \quad \text{for } r \neq 0.
\]

However, the field **f(r) = 1/r² ȓ** is singular at the origin, and the divergence is not defined in the usual sense at **r = 0**. Physically, this field resembles the electric field of a point charge, where the divergence corresponds to a delta function at the origin. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux of the field through the surface of the sphere. The flux of **f(r)** through the surface of a sphere of radius **R** is:

\[
\text{Flux} = \oint_{\text{surface}} \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS,
\]

where **n** is the outward normal vector (radial direction). On the surface of the sphere (**r = R**), the field is **f(r) = 1/R² ȓ**, and the surface element is **dS = R² \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi**. The flux becomes:

\[
\text{Flux} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi.
\]

The angular integrals evaluate to:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi = 2\pi, \quad \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta = 2.
\]

Thus, the flux is:

\[
\text{Flux} = 2\pi \cdot 2 = 4\pi.
\]

By the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of **f(r)** over the sphere of radius **R** is equal to the flux through the surface. Therefore, the integral is:

\[
\int_{\text{volume}} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \, dV = 4\pi.
\]

This result arises because the divergence of **f(r)** is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it effectively contributes a delta function to account for the flux through the surface.

**Critical analysis of options:**

- **A) 4π**: Correct. The volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux through the surface, which is **4π**.
- **B) 1**: Incorrect. This does not match the computed flux or the divergence theorem result.
- **C) 4/3 π R**: Incorrect. This is unrelated to the divergence or flux calculation.
- **D) 0**: Incorrect. While the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, the integral over the volume includes the contribution from the origin, leading to a non-zero result.
