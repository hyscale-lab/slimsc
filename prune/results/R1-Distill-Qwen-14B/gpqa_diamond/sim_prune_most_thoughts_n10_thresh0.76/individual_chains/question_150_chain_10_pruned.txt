Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and then determining the final product after a series of reactions. Hmm, okay, let's start with understanding the given information.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m -x - y)/2. So here, n=8, m=9, x=1 (O), y=1 (N). Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 -1)/2 = (18 -11)/2 = 7/2 = 3.5? Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate that. 2n+2 = 18. 18 -9 (H) -1 (O) -1 (N) = 7. 7 divided by 2 is 3.5. That can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I did that wrong. Let's see: another way, each double bond or ring counts as one. So for C8H9NO: the general formula for a saturated compound is CnH2n+2OxNy. Let's see, 2n+2 = 18. But here we have 9 H, so 18 -9=9. So 9/2 = 4.5. Wait, that's not making sense. Oh wait, perhaps I should use the formula for calculating degrees of unsaturation: Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens which aren't present here. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. Oh, right, that makes more sense. So five degrees of unsaturation. That's a lot. Could be rings, double bonds, triple bonds, etc. Maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 3), plus a double bond or two.

Looking at the NMR data: 

1H-NMR (ppm):
9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

Let me interpret these signals. 

The 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t) for 1H. That suggests an aldehyde proton, maybe, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Hmm, maybe it's an enal, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde. Because in that case, the aldehyde proton would be deshielded and show a triplet due to coupling with the two adjacent protons.

Then, 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each integrating to 2H. Those might be aromatic protons, perhaps from a para-substituted benzene ring. The downfield shift (around 6.98) could be due to substituents like hydroxyl groups or electron-withdrawing groups. Wait, but nitro groups are more downfield. Alternatively, perhaps they're part of a conjugated system.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests exchange, maybe like an -OH group, but integrating to 2H. Wait, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, it could be protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a hemiacetal or something, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated diene system.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's probably
