Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down. The question is about dienes reacting with mCPBA and then treated with aqueous acid. Then, the products are analyzed using HPLC. Hmm, I remember mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is an oxidizing agent, especially used in epoxidation of alkenes. Right, epoxidation adds an oxygen bridge across the double bond.

So the question has two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columns—both standard and chiral.

Wait, what's the process here? Epoxidation typically forms an epoxide. But after that, when treated with acid, the epoxide might undergo ring-opening. Oh right, acid-catalyzed ring opening of epoxides leads to diols. But wait, the conditions are aqueous acid. So the epoxide would protonate, and then the nucleophilic attack happens. Since mCPBA is a peracid, which is used to form epoxides, and then acid workup leads to the diol.

Wait, but for each starting alkene, what happens? Let's think about each reaction.

Starting with (E)-oct-4-ene. Epoxidation by mCPBA would give an epoxide. The geometry—since mCPBA adds the oxygen across the double bond in a specific way. Wait, mCPBA is an electrophilic oxidizing agent. It adds across the double bond, making the epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, in (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. So when mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds across the double bond, and the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, but actually, the epoxidation of an E-alkene would result in a trans epoxide, and a Z-alkene would give a cis epoxide. Or is it the other way around? Hmm. Wait, no, the mCPBA adds the
