Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question involves two reactions, A and B, and I have to choose the correct major products from the options given. The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction is between 1-nitropropane, KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products for both reactions.

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK.

Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so this probably is an enolate formation reaction. The starting material is a cyclohexanone derivative. The structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one would be a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 1. At position 2, there's an ethyl group, and at position 6, a methyl group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, numbering: the ketone is at position 1, so positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to it. So position 2 has an ethyl group, and position 6 has a methyl group? Or wait, 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? Wait, the compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? No, wait. Let me draw this.

Cyclohexanone has the ketone at C1. Then, C2 has an ethyl group, and C6 has a methyl group. Wait, no. The formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So, the substituents at C2 are ethyl and methyl, and C6 has a methyl? Or perhaps C2 has an ethyl and a methyl, and C6 has a methyl? No, maybe it's 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl. Wait, perhaps the structure has an ethyl
