Okay, so I have this question about stellar abundances and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass: Star_1 is 1.5 times the Sun's mass, and Star_2 is 1.2 times. The question gives me some elemental abundance ratios using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width method. 

The given data:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So the abundance of silicon relative to iron in Star 1 is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun's.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So magnesium to silicon in Star 2 is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun's.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So iron abundance relative to hydrogen in Star 1 is the same as the Sun's.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Magnesium relative to hydrogen in Star 2 is same as Sun.

I'm given the Sun's photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. Therefore, nFe/nH =10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So log(nMg/nH) =7-12 = -5. So nMg/nH =10^-5 =1e-5.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, [n_Si(Star1)] / [n_Si(Star2)].

Hmm, how do I approach this? I think I need to find the [Si/H] for both stars, then find their silicon abundances relative to hydrogen, and then take the ratio.

Wait, but I don't have [Si/H] directly for either star. But I have [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H] for Star_1. Same for Star_2, I have [Mg/Si] and [Mg/H], so perhaps I can find [Si/H] for each star.

Let me think about Star_1 first. [Fe/H]_1 is 0, meaning [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe/nH)_1 - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0. So (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun = 3.16e-5.

But [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0.3. Wait, no. Wait, the definition of [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.3.

So:

log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun)

What's nSi_sun /nFe_sun? Since nFe_sun/nH_sun is 3.16e-5, and nSi_sun/nH_sun is something I can compute if I know the solar abundance of silicon. Wait, but I don't have that given. Hmm. The problem gives only [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for the Sun.

Wait, the Sun's photosphere is given for Fe and Mg. So for the Sun, nFe/nH =3.16e-5, nMg/nH=1e-5. But what about nSi/nH? I don't have it. Hmm, but maybe I can find it using the [Mg/Si] ratio for Star_2, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model each star's [X/H] abundances.

Let me try for Star_1 first.

Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 =0. So Fe abundance is same as Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. So [Si/Fe] is log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.3.

Because nFe1 = nFe_sun (since [Fe/H]_1=0). So, nFe1 = nFe_sun.

So: log(nSi1 / nFe_sun) - log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) =0.3

Which simplifies to log( (nSi1 / nFe_sun) / (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) ) =0.3. Because that's log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b).

So that's log( (nSi1 / nFe_sun) * (nFe_sun / nSi_sun) ) ) = log( nSi1 / nSi_sun )=0.3.

So, log(nSi1 / nSi_sun) =0.3 → nSi1 = nSi_sun * 10^0.3.

So, the silicon abundance in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.

But wait, because [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, but [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so silicon is enhanced relative to Fe, which is same as
