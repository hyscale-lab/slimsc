Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which is given as a 2x2 matrix. The operator is Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S looks like this: first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). Hmm, I've seen something like this before. Wait, isn't this similar to the Pauli matrices? Oh right, the S matrix here is probably the Pauli X or Y matrix multiplied by something. Wait, let me think. 

The Pauli Y matrix is usually defined as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh, exactly the same as the S matrix given here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. Then, the operator Ay is c multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix. Since c is h/(4π), let me write down Ay.

So, Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But before jumping into that, let's recall some properties of Pauli matrices and their eigenvalues.

The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, which means their eigenvalues are real. But wait, Ay is c times a Hermitian matrix. So, because c is a real constant, Ay will also be Hermitian. Therefore, Ay should have real eigenvalues. That's an important point because any option suggesting imaginary eigenvalues might be wrong.

Now, for the Pauli Y matrix, the eigenvalues are ±1. Because each Pauli matrix (X, Y, Z) has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when we multiply by c, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c*(±1), which is (h/(4π)) * (±1). So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). 

Wait, that's a key point. So any option that talks about the eigenvalues having imaginary parts is incorrect. So looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and the real parts are ±h/(4π). But that
