Alright, so I have this IUPAC nomenclature problem about a benzene ring with several substituents. Hmm, let me try to visualize the structure based on the description.

Okay, the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group. Let's say that's position 1 as the reference point because in benzoic acid derivatives, the carboxylic acid is usually the principal functional group, so its position is numbered first.

Next, the substituents are all meta to each other. Wait, the carboxylic acid, the carbaldehyde, and the cyano group are meta to one another. So, if the carboxylic is at position 1, then the carbaldehyde (formyl group) would be at position 3, and the cyano group at position 5. Because meta is three positions away in a six-membered ring.

Wait, but wait. The description says all three are meta to one another. So maybe I need to arrange them such that each is meta to the others. Let me think. For example, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the carbaldehyde would be at 3 (which is meta to 1), and the cyano group would be at 5 (which is meta to 3). But then, the cyano at 5 is also two positions away from the carboxylic at 1, which is meta as well. So that's correct.

Now, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Ortho is positions 2 and 6. So, positions 2 and 6 have a hydroxyl (OH) and a dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) group. Also, the para position to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Para to position 1 is position 4. So position 4 has OMe.

Wait, but the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. The nitrile is the cyano group, which is at position 5. So, the ortho positions to 5 are positions 4 and 6.

Wait, let me check. The cyano is at 5. The ortho positions are 4 and 6. So, substituents at 4 and 6 are both ortho to the nitrile. The methoxy
