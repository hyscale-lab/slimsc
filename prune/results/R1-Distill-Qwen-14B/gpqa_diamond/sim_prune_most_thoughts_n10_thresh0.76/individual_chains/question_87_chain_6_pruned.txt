Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR data tells me there's a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, so what does that mean?

First, I need to figure out the structure of the compound. It's a di-substituted benzene ring, right? Because it's a 6-membered aromatic ring, so that's the benzene part. So the substituents on the benzene are two groups. The total carbon count is 8, but the benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 more carbons. Wait, no, wait. Because di-substituted means two substituents. Each substituent could be a group with more than one carbon. Let me see.

Wait, the molecule has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6, so substituents add 2. But wait, substituents could be like two -CH3 groups. So each substituent has one carbon. But wait, the substituents could also be a group with more than one carbon each.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Cl, Br, etc. attached to the ring). So the substituents must be a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen atom. But wait, a halogen as a substituent would be something like -X, where X is Cl or Br. But then, the other substituent would need to have some carbonyl functionality.

Wait, the carbonyl group is present. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an aldehyde, but wait, that might not fit the rest. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. But wait, if the substituent is a carbonyl, like an acyl group attached to the benzene ring, that would add more carbons.

Wait, let me count the carbons again. The benzene has 6 carbons. The substituents are two groups, each contributing their own carbons. The total is 8 carbons. So substituents contribute 2 carbons together. So each substituent must be a -CO- something? Wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group with two carbons attached. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: one substituent is a carbonyl group, like an acyl group, and the other substituent is a halogen. Let me think. Suppose the substituents are a -COCH3 (like a methyl ketone group) and a -X (like Cl). So the benzene ring would have a ketone and a halogen.

Wait, but that would add more
