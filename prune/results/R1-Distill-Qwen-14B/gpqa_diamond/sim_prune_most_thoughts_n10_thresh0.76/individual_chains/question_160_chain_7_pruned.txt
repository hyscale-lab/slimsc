Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light, wavelength λ, is hitting it along the z-axis, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N approaches infinity. Oh, and they mentioned that the angles are small, so we can approximate tanθ as θ. Hmm.

Wait, let me think. When N is infinitely large, the aperture becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. So, this problem is essentially about a circular aperture. But wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is related to its radius. For a circle, the apothem would be the same as the radius, I think. So the radius of the circular aperture is 'a'.

Now, when light passes through a circular aperture, it forms a diffraction pattern. The first minima in this pattern is known. The formula for the angular position of the first minimum in a single-slit diffraction is given by a sinθ = λ/2. But wait, in the case of a circular aperture, it's slightly different. Oh right, for a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at an angle θ where a sinθ ≈ λ/ (π a) )? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is called the Airy disk. The central bright spot is surrounded by concentric rings of varying intensities. The first dark ring (minimum) occurs at an angle θ where sinθ is approximately λ/(π a). Because for the circular case, the condition for the first minimum is given by a sinθ = λ/(π). So θ = λ/(π a) approximately, since angles are small.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The formula for the minima in a single slit is a sinθ = m λ, where m is the order. But for a circular aperture, the minima are given by a sinθ = (m + 0.5) λ, where m is 1, 2, etc. Or wait, maybe it's a different condition. Oh, right! For the circular aperture, the condition for the min
