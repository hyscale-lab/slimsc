Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of questions. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a strong monobasic acid. I need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A, B, C, D with different pH and volume values.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide and when it reacts with an acid, it should form a salt and water. Since it's monobasic, the acid probably donates one H+ ion. So the reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O. Wait, no, wait. Fe(OH)3 is a strong base? Or is it a weak base? Oh, right, metal hydroxides can vary. Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so when it reacts with a strong acid, it should completely dissolve.

So the first step is to find out how much Fe(OH)3 is present. The mass is 0.1 grams. Let me calculate the moles. The molecular weight of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17=55.85+51=106.85 g/mol. Wait, is that right? Wait, the formula is Fe(OH)3. So 1 Fe, 3 O, and 3 H? No, wait, each OH- is O and H. So 3 OH groups: so 3 O and 3 H. So yeah, 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1
