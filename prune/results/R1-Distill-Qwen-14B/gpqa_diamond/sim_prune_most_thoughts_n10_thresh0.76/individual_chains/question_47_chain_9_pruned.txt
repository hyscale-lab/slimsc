Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2, and the options are A, B, C, D. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, looking at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNy. Degree of unsaturation is (2n + 2 - m - x - y)/2. So here, n=9, m=11, x=2, y=1. So it's (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 20 -14 =6, divided by 2 is 3. So three degrees of unsaturation, which could be one ring and two double bonds, like a benzene ring (which accounts for 3 degrees right there), or other combinations. So probably an aromatic compound, which makes sense since the NMR shows signals around 7 and 8 ppm, which are typical for aromatic protons.

Now, looking at the IR data. The peaks at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 are probably N-H stretch or O-H. Wait, but O-H would be around 3200-3600, but if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an amide N-H or an alcohol. But wait, the options have things like amides and esters. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's usually a carbonyl group. So carbonyl could be an ester, amide, ketone, etc. Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: that's an amide, so the carbonyl would be around 1680-1700, but sometimes a bit higher. Wait, but sometimes amides can be higher depending on substitution.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: also an amide. So maybe the carbonyl is around 1700.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: that's a carboxylic acid ester, so the carbonyl would be around 1720, which matches the IR given. Because esters usually have carbonyl around 1720-1740.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: same here, another ester. So the carbonyl at 1720 suggests ester or maybe another carbonyl-containing group.

Wait, but the IR also has two peaks around 3400 and 3325. Those are broad, maybe. The question says medium to strong intensity. So for N-H, a primary amide would have a broad peak around 3300-3500. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, but I don't think any of the options are alcohols. Let me look at the options.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would have an amine group (NH2?), which would show broad peaks around 3300. Also, the propionate would be an ester. So the IR would show the carbonyl at ~1720, and N-H from amine. But amines can absorb in that region, but if it's a secondary amine, maybe the absorption is less intense and maybe split into two bands.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That's also an ester, so the carbonyl would be around 1720. The 4-aminobenzoate would have an amine group. But wait, in benzoate, the ester is the carbonyl. The amine is a substituent. So the IR would have N-H from the amine. But in the IR given, two bands at 3420 and
