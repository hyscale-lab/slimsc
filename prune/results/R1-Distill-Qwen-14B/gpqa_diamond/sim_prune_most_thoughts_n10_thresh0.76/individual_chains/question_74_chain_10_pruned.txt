Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that we have an atom, and we're supposed to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without it decaying. They mentioned that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. Hmm, wait, so the initial experiment says 32% chance in 100 minutes. But now, after 50 minutes, what's the chance it'll decay in the next 150?

Wait, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay law. The probability of decay doesn't depend on the age of the atom, right? So it's memoryless. That means the probability of it decaying in the next t minutes is independent of how much time has already passed. 

So if the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32, that would correspond to the probability P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). Wait, actually, for radioactive decay, the survival probability is e^(-λt), so the decay probability is 1 minus that. So P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).

So for t=100 minutes, P(100)=0.32. Let me write that down:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

So solving for λ. Let's rearrange this:

e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

Take the natural log of both sides:

-100λ = ln(0.68)

So λ = - ln(0.68)/100

Let me calculate ln(0.68). I remember ln(1) is 0, ln(e)=1, but exact values... ln(0.68) is approximately... Let's think. I know that ln(0.5) is about -0.693, and ln(0.7) is about -0.356, so 0.68 is close to 0.7. Let me approximate it as about -0.400? Wait, more accurately, let me think: e^(-0.4) is about 0
