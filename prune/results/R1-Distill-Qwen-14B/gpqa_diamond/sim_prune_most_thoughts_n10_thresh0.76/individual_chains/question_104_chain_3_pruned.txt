Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Astronomers found exoplanets around each using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The planets have circular orbits.

The key part is about the spectral line shifts. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The shift relates to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The formula I think is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance.

Wait, the formula I recall is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) )^(1/3) ), but since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So, K ≈ [ (G M_p) / ( M_* ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P (1 - e²)^(1/2))) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude K and the orbital period. Because the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbit.

The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

But again, M_p is much smaller than M_*, so we can ignore M_p in the denominator. So,

K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) P^(1/3) c ) )

Wait, but I think there's a simpler way. The shift in wavelength is proportional to the velocity. So, the Doppler shift formula is:

Δλ / λ ≈ v / c

But in the problem, the shift is given in milliangstroms, which is a change in wavelength. So, the shift is directly proportional to the velocity of the star.

So, for each planet, K is proportional to the shift. Because the same spectral line is used, the rest wavelength λ is the same for both. So, the velocity of the star is proportional to the shift. So, K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2.

Wait, no. Because K is the velocity semi-amplitude. So, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7. But wait, the shift is given as 5 and 7 milliangstrom. So, the velocity K is proportional to the shift, correct? Because Δλ = (v/c) * λ, so v is proportional to Δλ, assuming λ is the same for the same spectral line.

So, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So, K1/K2 =5/7.

But how does K relate to the orbital period? Let's think about the formula again.

The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P) )^(1/3) * [ 1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ]

But since e is zero (circular orbits), that term is 1. And M_p is much less than M_*, so we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So,

K ≈ [ (G M_p) / M_* ]^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3 )

Hmm, so K is proportional to (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3 )

Wait, but in this problem, both M_p are similar to Neptune, and both M_* are the same as the Sun. So M_p and M_* are the same for both planets. So, (M_p / M_*) is the same for both. Therefore, the ratio of K1 to K2 is inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their periods.

So, K1 / K2 = ( (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) )

Because the other terms are the same, so K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3 ), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, let me make sure. Let's write the formula for each planet:

K1 = [ (G M_p) / M_* ]^(1/3) * (2π / P1 )^(1/3 )

K2 = [ (G M_p) / M_* ]^(1/3) * (2π / P2 )^(1/3 )

So taking the ratio:

K1/K2 = [ (2π / P1 )^(1/3 ) ] / [ (2π / P2 )^(1/3 ) ]

The (2π) terms cancel, so:

K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So, rearranging:

(P2 / P1 ) = (K1/K2 )^3

Wait, no: (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

Thus, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

But wait, K1 is 5 and K2 is 7. So K1/K2 is 5/7. So,

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but wait. Wait, because if K is higher, then the period is shorter. Because higher velocity implies shorter period.

Because for the same mass, if the star moves faster, the planet must be closer, hence shorter orbital period.

So, if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait, according to the formula, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So if K1 is 5, K2 is 7, K1/K2 is 5/7 <1. So, (5/7)^3 is about 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is 0.364 times P1.

So, the orbital period of Planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Therefore, the question is, how many times longer is Planet #2's period than Planet #1's? That would be the inverse of 0.364, which is about 2.75. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, the question is: How many times
