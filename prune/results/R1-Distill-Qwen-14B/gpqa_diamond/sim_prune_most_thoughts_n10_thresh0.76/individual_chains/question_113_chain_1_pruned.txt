Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on some spectroscopic data. Let's see what I can do.

First, let's break down the given information. The question says that the compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in the IR typically indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a broad peak around 3000 could also be from N-H stretches, but the options don't have any nitrogen, so maybe it's O-H.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch, maybe from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl, which might suggest something like an ester or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a carbonyl group adjacent to a ring, but I'm not sure.

Moving on to the NMR. The 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond. Maybe it's an ester with a double bond, or something else.

The Mass Spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what fragments have a mass of 45. Common fragments include things like CH3CO+ (which is 43, but close), but wait, 45 is maybe a different fragment. Let me think: 45 could be a ketene ion (like O=C=O+), but that's maybe more for a different situation. Alternatively, maybe a methyl group attached to something else. Or perhaps a fragment like (CH3)2O which is 45 (since (CH3)2O is 45: 2*(15 for CH3) + 16 for O is 46? Wait, 2*(15) is 30, plus
