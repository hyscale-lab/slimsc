Okay, so I've got this problem here about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that divergence has something to do with how a vector field spreads out or converges. The question is about a specific vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². Oh wait, and it's only got a radial component in spherical coordinates. 

Alright, so the setup is that the field's magnitude is 1/r², and it's only radial. So in spherical coordinates, the vector field f would just be [f(r), 0, 0], right? Because the other components (theta and phi directions) are zero.

I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of f over a sphere of radius R. The integral is ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV, and I need to evaluate this inside the sphere.

Wait, I remember from vector calculus that the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is a bit different from Cartesian. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ) is (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² f_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dθ (f_θ sinθ) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dφ (f_φ)/(sinθ). But in this case, f has only a radial component, so the other terms (f_θ and f_φ) are zero. So the divergence simplifies to (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² f_r).

Right, so f_r is 1/r². Plugging that into the divergence formula: ∇ · f = (1/r²) * d/dr [r² * (1/r²)]. Let me compute that. The term inside the brackets is r² * 1/r² = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So that would make the divergence zero. So ∇ · f = 0?

Wait, but wait a second. That can't be right because I remember about Gauss's law. Like, if the divergence is zero, the integral over the volume should be zero as well. But wait, Gauss's law says that the integral of the divergence of E is the enclosed charge. But wait, in this case, if the divergence is zero, then the integral should be zero. But another thought: maybe the vector field is f(r)
