Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which requires at least one stereogenic center or some kind of asymmetry that leads to non-superimposable mirror images.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. Let me go through each one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure here is a double bond with substituents on each end. For E and Z isomers, the configuration refers to the arrangement around the double bond. But does that create a chiral center? No, because the double bond itself isn't a chiral center. Unless one of the substituents is a chiral center. Let me think. The structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So C1 has Cl, another substituent from the double bond, and two other groups. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So structure is Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait butene is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So structure is Cl-C(=CH2)CH(CH3) maybe? Wait, perhaps it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. Let me draw it: Cl-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3)-? Wait no, the full structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So structure: Cl2C=C(CH2CH3)? No, wait wait. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, but since it's but-1-ene, it's CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is
