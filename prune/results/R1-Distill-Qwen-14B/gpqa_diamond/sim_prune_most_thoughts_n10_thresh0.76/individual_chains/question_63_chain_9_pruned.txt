Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the molecule is made of atoms X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and it absorbs a photon to move to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, so the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when it absorbs a photon, it goes to the next state. But what does "next state" mean here? Are they talking about the next vibrational state or the next rotational state?

Hmm, the question mentions the rotation-vibration model, which considers both rotational and vibrational energies. So the molecule's energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the model).

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But since the problem says non-rigid rotor model, maybe it's a bit more complex. Or perhaps they're using the vibration-rotation coupling model. Alternatively, the problem might be considering the transition from the ground vibrational state to the first excited vibrational state, ignoring rotation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question is about the "next state with the lowest possible energy". So perhaps it's the next vibrational state (v=1) but the same or lowest rotational state. Or maybe the transition is a combination of both. I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplifying and considering only the vibrational transition. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon in vibration, it transitions from v=0 to v=1, which would require a photon with energy equal to the vibrational energy quantum.

Wait, but the question mentions the rotation-vibration model, so maybe the energy levels are a combination of both. So the molecule's energy is E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. The fundamental state is v=0 and the lowest J=0 or J=1. Then, when it absorbs a photon, it can increase either v, J, or both.

But the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the least energy increase. So perhaps the next state is the first vibrational state (v=1) and the same J. Or maybe a higher J but same v.

Wait, but if the molecule is initially in the ground vibrational state, the fundamental state, then the lowest energy transition would be to v=1 and J=0 or J=1, whichever is lower. Alternatively, perhaps the transition is purely vibrational.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the energies involved. The vibrational energy is quantized as E_v = (v + 1/2) h w. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1
