Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, I think. But wait, the question is about the orbital periods of the planets, not their masses.

The problem says that two stars have the same mass, each similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. The RV method detected these planets. The shift in spectral lines for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for #2 it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does the shift relate to the orbital period?

Wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us. This velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P) )^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/ (something?)) Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, the main thing is that the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the orbital period P, when other factors are held constant.

Wait, more accurately, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( ( (G * P) / (2π) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) ) ) / c

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune is about 1/3000th of the Sun's mass, and the stars are solar mass), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(c)) ?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relationship between K and P. Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have the same mass, but the velocity shifts are different. Wait, no, the planets have similar masses to Neptune, but I
