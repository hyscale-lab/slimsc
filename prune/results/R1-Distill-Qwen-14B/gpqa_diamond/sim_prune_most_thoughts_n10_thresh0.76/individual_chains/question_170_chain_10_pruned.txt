Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The state given is (3i, 4). Wait, I think in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors. So the state vector here is χ = [3i, 4]^T. Right, because in 2-level systems, like spin-1/2 particles, the state is a column vector with two elements.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ | S_y | χ⟩. Oh wait, wait. No, wait. Actually, the spin operator S is related to the Pauli matrices. Right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and S is (ħ/2) times those matrices. So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

Wait, the problem gives σ_y as a matrix:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So that's correct. So S_y is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

Now, the expectation value is calculated as χ† S_y χ. Or wait, more accurately, it's the conjugate transpose of χ multiplied by S_y multiplied by χ.

So first, let me write down the state vector χ. It's [3i, 4]^T. So χ is a column vector where the first element is 3i and the second is 4.

The conjugate transpose (which gives a row vector) would be [ -3 (since (3i)* is -3i?), wait wait, no. Wait, the conjugate of 3i is -3i? No, wait. Wait, the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i. So the conjugate transpose, χ†, would be [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think. If χ is [3i; 4], then χ† is the transpose, so [3i*, 4*], which is [ -3i, 4 ]? Because 3i's complex conjugate is -3i. And 4 is real, so its conjugate is 4.

Wait, no.
