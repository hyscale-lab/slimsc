Okay, so I came across this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about the equation.

The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current in a semiconductor device when it's in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation given is J equals (9/8) epsilon mu V squared over L cubed. So, J = (9/8)εμV²/L³. 

From what I remember, this equation applies under specific conditions. The SCLC regime is when the current is limited by the space charge, meaning the electric field is so strong that it's dominated by the charges that have accumulated in the device. This usually happens when there's a lot of injection, so the space charge creates a region where the electric field is significant.

Now, the question is about the validity of the equation. The options A to D give different scenarios. I need to figure out which conditions are correct for the equation to hold.

Let me think about each component of the equation. The equation involves ε, the dielectric constant, which is related to the material's ability to store electric energy. μ is the carrier mobility, which is how fast carriers move under an electric field. L is the length of the device, probably the thickness in a diode context.

The Mott-Gurney equation is derived under certain assumptions. I think one of the key assumptions is that the dominant current transport mechanism is injection-limited, meaning that the current is limited by how much carriers can be injected into the conduction or valence band. Also, it's usually for a single-carrier device, not a two-carrier one like a bipolar junction transistor.

Ohmic contacts versus Schottky contacts: Ohmic contacts have a low barrier, allowing carriers to pass without much voltage loss. Schottky contacts have a higher barrier for one carrier type (like electrons) but not the other (like holes). For the Mott-Gurney equation, I think the contacts are assumed to be Ohmic. Because if there's a Schottky barrier, that would complicate the current injection, maybe leading to a different current-voltage relationship. So, the equation assumes Ohmic contacts to avoid complications with barriers.

Trap-free: Traps are impurities or defects that can capture and hold carriers. If there are traps, they can cause the current to behave differently, perhaps leading to more complex dependencies. So the Mott-Gurney equation probably assumes a trap-free material because traps would complicate the space-charge effect.

Negligible drift vs. diffusion currents: The equation is in the SCLC regime, which is more about drift current. But during SCLC, the dominant factor is the space charge, so maybe diffusion is not the main factor. Wait, the derivation considers that the current is limited by the accumulation of space charge, so perhaps drift is the main component. But I need to clarify if diffusion is negligible.

In the Mott-Gurney derivation, I think it's assumed that the current is dominated by drift, and that the space charge (from the accumulated carriers) creates the electric field. So the equation doesn't account for diffusion currents because diffusion is a different mechanism, more about carrier concentration gradients. So, for the Mott-Gurney equation to be valid, diffusion current should be negligible compared to drift current.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Trap-free single-carrier with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, if drift is negligible, then the current wouldn't be drift-limited. The SCLC is drift-limited, so drift should be significant. So if drift is negligible, this might not fit. Or perhaps the statement is about other currents being negligible. Hmm, need to think again.

Wait, the question is about the validity of the equation. So which conditions are necessary for the equation to hold? 

Option B: Trap-free, single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier, negligible diffusion current. No carrier injection barrier would imply Ohmic contacts, right? Because a Schottky contact has a barrier. So no injection barrier implies Ohmic. And single-carrier. Also, negligible diffusion current would mean drift is dominant, so that matches SCLC. So this could be correct.

Option C: Single-carrier, Schottky contact, negligible diffusion. Wait, Schottky contacts have barriers, which would mean there's an injection barrier. So if the device has a Schottky contact, would that affect the validity? Because the Mott-Gurney equation assumes Ohmic contact (no barrier), so if you have a Schottky, maybe it's not valid. Or does it not matter as long as the overall injection is possible? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that point.

Option D: Two-carrier device. Mott-Gurney is for single-carrier, so D is incorrect.

So, narrowing down to options A, B, and C.

Option A says negligible drift current. But in SCLC, drift current is the main component. If drift is negligible, the current wouldn't be dominated by space charge. So A is probably incorrect. Unless the phrasing is that other current components (like thermal emission) are negligible.

Wait, the equation is for when the current is space-charge limited, which is a drift current phenomenon. So, the equation must apply when drift is significant. Therefore, any option that says drift current is negligible would be incorrect because that would imply another mechanism is dominant.

Looking at option B: negligible diffusion current. Because if diffusion were significant, then the current might be diffusion-limited, which is a different regime. So, if diffusion is negligible, drift is dominant, which is correct.

Option B says "no carrier injection barrier", which I think refers to Ohmic contacts. So, no injection barrier would mean carriers can inject easily, making the current injection limited by the space charge. So trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (Ohmic), negligible diffusion. That sounds correct.

Option C has a Schottky contact, which implies a barrier, perhaps making injection not free. But in the Mott-Gurney derivation, do they assume that the contact is Ohmic? Because a Schottky would require overcoming a barrier, which may not be part of the equation. So C would be incorrect.

So, the correct statement is option B.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation, \( J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3} \), is valid under specific conditions. These conditions include a trap-free single-carrier device, as traps would complicate the space-charge effect. The equation assumes negligible diffusion current, as the dominant mechanism in the SCLC regime is drift current. Additionally, it assumes no carrier injection barrier, which implies Ohmic contacts, as Schottky contacts introduce barriers that could alter the current-voltage relationship.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: States "negligible drift current," which contradicts the SCLC regime, where drift current is the dominant mechanism. Therefore, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Correctly describes a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contacts) and negligible diffusion current, aligning with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation.
- **Option C**: Mentions a Schottky contact, which introduces a barrier and does not align with the assumption of Ohmic contacts in the Mott-Gurney equation. Thus, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Refers to a two-carrier device, but the Mott-Gurney equation is derived for single-carrier devices. Hence, this option is incorrect.

The correct statement is **Option B**, as it accurately reflects the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.

Answer: B
