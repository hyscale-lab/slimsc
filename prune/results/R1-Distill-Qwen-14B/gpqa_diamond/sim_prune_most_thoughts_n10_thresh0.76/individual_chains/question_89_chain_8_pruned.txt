Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the problem again and think about each part.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, sort of a cage-like molecule. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two opposite positions of the adamantane structure.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C. Hmm, KOH is a strong base. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with strong bases, they usually undergo an elimination reaction to form alkenes—like the E2 mechanism. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, which are separated by a couple of carbons. So maybe it's an example of dehydrohalogenation but in a different way.

Wait, but in the case of adamantane derivatives, maybe the structure allows for a different kind of elimination. Oh, wait! When you have two bromines in the 1 and 3 positions of adamantane, heating with a strong base like KOH can lead to the formation of an alkene. Because the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, and the leaving groups (Br-) depart, leading to the formation of a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, or maybe 2 and 3. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a less substituted alkene, but that doesn't make sense because the more substituted (more stable) alkenes are favored.

Wait, no. For 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in a way that's not directly next to each other but across a bridge. So when they eliminate, perhaps they form a bridgehead double bond. Because adamantane's structure has bridgehead carbons, making a bridgehead alkene like bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene or something similar. Wait, but bridgehead alkenes are generally not possible
