Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. I need to figure out which one has the highest density among the options given. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume, right? So density = mass/volume. That makes sense because if you have more mass in the same volume, the density is higher. Or if the volume is smaller for the same mass, density increases.

The question has four options, a to d, each describing different exoplanets. I need to compare their densities to see which is highest.

Option a says it's an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So both mass and radius are the same as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So a) has density 5.5.

Option b is a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but wait. The question says it's a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5. But wait, no, wait. Let me read that again. Oh wait, option b just states that the density is approximately 5.5 g/cm³. So the density is 5.5. So that's the same as Earth's density. So for option b, density is 5.5.

Option c is a planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Hmm. So Earth's composition implies that the density is similar, right? Because composition affects density. If it's the same composition, then the density should be the same as Earth's. But wait, what if the mass increases, does the density change?

Wait, no. Because if the mass increases, but the composition is same, the radius would increase as well. Because more mass would mean a larger planet. So for a planet with same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive, what happens?

Let me think about this. The density is mass/volume. Volume depends on radius cubed. So if the mass increases by 5 times, but the radius also increases, the density would depend on how the radius scales.

Earth's mass and radius are given. Let's say the planet in c has 5 times the mass. But since it's same composition, the radius would be larger. How much larger?

I think for a planet with same density as Earth, mass and radius are related. The mass scales with radius cubed, because mass is proportional to volume, which is radius^3. So if the mass is 5 times Earth's, then radius scales as cube root of 5.

Cube root of 5 is approximately 1.71. So the radius would be about 1.71 times Earth's radius.

So the volume would be (1.71)^3 times Earth's volume. Which is about 5 times Earth's volume. So the density (mass/volume) would be (5 Earth masses)/(5 Earth volumes) = 1. So same as Earth's density, 5.5 g/cm³.

Wait, but wait. Because the mass is 5 times, and the volume is 5 times, so density remains same as Earth. So option c has density 5.5 g/cm³.

Option d is a planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. Same reasoning as c. Since mass scales with radius^3, the radius
