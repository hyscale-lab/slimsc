Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. Hmm, I remember that when alkenes are heated, especially with certain conditions, they can undergo some kind of rearrangement. Oh wait, is it a Cope rearrangement or an electrocyclic reaction? Or maybe a hydride shift?

Wait, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let me draw that structure. So nona means nine carbons. The double bonds are at positions 2 and 6. The substituent is a butyl group at position 5. So position 5 has a butyl group attached. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-C(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait no, wait. Let me think again. Nona is nine carbons, so the chain is 9 carbons long. The double bonds are between C2-C3 and C6-C7. So positions 2 and 3 are double bonded, and 6 and 7 are also double bonded.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, nona-2,6-diene would be positions 2,3 as double bond, then a single bond, then another double bond at 6,7. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait no, wait, that can't be right because the numbering would be from the end. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it more carefully. The molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. So the main chain is nine carbons. The double bonds are between carbons 2-3 and 6-7. So:

1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait no, the double bonds are at 2 and 6. So positions 2 and 3 are double bonded, and positions 6 and7 are double bonded. So the structure would be:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
CH2-C=C-CH2
