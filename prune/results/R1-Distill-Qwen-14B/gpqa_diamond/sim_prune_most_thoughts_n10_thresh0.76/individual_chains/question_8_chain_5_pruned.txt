Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions and disease resistance in lupines. Hmm, let me try to break this down. So, the setup is that they're looking for genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants for each, and also double mutants. 

The question is about figuring out the relationships between these genes based on the resistance levels. The control has 100% resistance, meaning they are very resistant. The mutants have varying percentages. 

The results are:

- g1: 75% → less resistant than control.
- g2: 0% → no resistance, which is bad. So the mutant is super susceptible.
- g3: 50% → half as resistant as control.
- g1g3: 10% → very susceptible.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

They also mention that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, I think transcription factors usually regulate other genes, maybe activating or repressing them.

I need to figure out the genetic interactions here. The options are about whether they're epistatic, pleiotropic, or redundant.

Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. Like, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the presence of A masks or modifies the effect of B. So, in the double mutant, if knocking out both A and B leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone, that could be epistasis.

Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. But here, the traits are the same (resistance), so maybe it's not directly about that. Alternatively, if the same gene is involved in multiple pathways, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Gene redundancy is when two genes have overlapping functions, so knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both (g1g3) would have a worse effect than either single knock-out.

Looking at the data:

g2 has 0% resistance. So in the single mutant, they're completely susceptible. The double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) are also 0%, same as g2 alone. That suggests that g2 is epistatic to both g1 and g3. Because even when you have a mutation in g2 along with another gene, the phenotype is the same as when g2 is mutated alone. So, the presence of g2's mutation masks the effect of the other gene.

Wait, but wait. In genetics, when a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, it suggests that the two genes are in the same pathway. Also, if gene B is epistatic to gene A, the double mutant a b has the same phenotype as b. So if in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0% like g2, that suggests that g2 is epistatic to g1. So, G2 is epistatic to G1. Similarly, in g2g3, it's same as g2. So, G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

So, G2 is acting upstream because it's epistatic. Because when you have a mutation in G2, any mutations in downstream genes (like G1 or G3) don't change the outcome. So G2 is a transcription factor upstream.

Now, let's look at the other double mutants: g1g3 is 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. G1 single is 75%, G3 single is 50%, but together it's 10%. That suggests that G1 and G3 are redundant or in parallel pathways. Because their combined knockout leads to a much worse phenotype than either alone.

Redundancy would mean that each gene can compensate for the other. So if G1 is knocked out, G3 can take over, and vice versa. But when both are knocked out, there's no compensation, so the phenotype is worse. So G1 and G3 show redundancy.

Wait, but what's the difference between redundancy and epistasis? Redundancy is when two genes have overlapping functions. So knocking out one doesn't cause a problem, but knocking out both does.

In this case, G1 knockout has 75% (so some function remains), G3 knockout has 50% (so also some function). But when both are knocked out, it's 10%. So each gene contributes to the function, but they might not be in the same pathway. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, and both contribute to resistance. So their double mutant is worse than either single.

So, in that case, G1 and G3 show redundancy. But wait, redundancy usually refers to genes that can compensate for each other, so their functions are redundant. That would fit what I'm seeing here.

So, to recap:

G2 is a transcription factor because it's epistatic to both G1 and G3. When G2 is mutated, the resistance is 0%, and any other mutation doesn't change that. So G2 acts upstream.

G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other but their combined knockout leads to worse resistance. So they might be in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. So knocking both out removes both contributions, leading to much lower resistance. This suggests redundancy.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is transcription factor, G2 and G3 pleiotropic, G2 epistatic to G1 → But our analysis says G2 is the TF, so A is wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1 → Same promoter would mean they are in the same pathway, but the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either. Same promoter might not lead to that. Also, G3 epistatic to G1 would mean that in g1g3, the resistance would be same as G3 single, which is 50%. But g1g3 is 10%, which is worse. So B might not fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic, G1 epistatic to G3 → Pleiotropy is about multiple traits, but I'm not sure about that here. Also, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then g1g3 would have the same as G1, which is 75%. But it's 10% here, so that doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3 → Wait, but redundancy is when they compensate each other, so knocking both leads to worse. So in the double mutant, they don't mask each other's effect but add to it. Hmm, but the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. That would mean that when both are knocked out, the phenotype is same as G1. But the double mutant is 10% which is worse than both, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the epistasis part wrong. Let's think again.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. Now, the single mutants have 75% (g1) and 50% (g3). So, the double is worse than either. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the double mutant's phenotype would resemble the more severe of the two. But in this case, 10% is worse than either. So perhaps G1 and G3 are additive. Or, G1 is not epistatic to G3.

Wait, another approach: in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. Which suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Similarly, g2g3 is same as g2, so G2 is epistatic to G3 as well. So G2 is acting upstream of both G1 and G3.

So G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. Because if G2 is knocked out, then G1 and G3 can't function either. Because in the single knockouts, G1 and G3 still have some function, but when G2 is knocked out, all downstream functions are gone.

Wait, that makes sense. So G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed, leading to no resistance.

But wait, in the single mutants, g1 has 75% resistance, which is lower than control but not zero. Similarly, g3 has 50%. So perhaps G1 and G3 are part of separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. So when G2 is present, both are active. But when G2 is knocked out, both are inactive, leading to no resistance.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor for both G1 and G3, then the single mutants (g1 and g3) would still have some function because the other gene is active. So, in g1, G3 is still active because G2 is present. So resistance would be as per G3's activity. So, in g1, resistance is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. Hmm, that suggests that G1 contributes more than G3. So without G2, both are off, so 0% resistance.

So, the fact that in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is lower than either single. That suggests that G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways. So, when both are knocked out, you lose the contributions from both, hence lower resistance.

So, the model is that G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, which function in parallel pathways to contribute to resistance. So, in a single mutant, you lose one pathway but the other is still active. So in g1, G3 is active (50%?), but wait, in the data, g1 is 75%. Wait, maybe G1 contributes more. Hmm, but the data is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates a gene that activates both G1 and G3. But that complicates things.

Wait, looking back, in the single mutants:

G1 knockout: 75% → some resistance remains.

G2 knockout: 0% → no resistance.

G3 knockout: 50% → some resistance.

So, G2 is essential for resistance. Because when G2 is knocked out, there's no resistance. So G2 must be a key gene, perhaps a transcription factor that's required for the function of other genes (G1 and G3).

So, when G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 can't function. But when G2 is present, G1 and G3 can function, but their functions aren't completely overlapping. So, in g1, G3 is functioning, but it's only providing 50% resistance. Whereas in g3, G1 is functioning, providing 75% resistance. So G1 contributes more than G3.

But when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance
