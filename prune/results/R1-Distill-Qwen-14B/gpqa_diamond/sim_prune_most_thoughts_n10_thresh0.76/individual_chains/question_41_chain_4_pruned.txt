Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me think through this. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to break it down.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab.

Wait, I remember something about the speed of light in a medium when the medium is moving. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties, but how does the motion of the medium itself affect it?

Wait, no. Wait a second. The speed of light in a medium is given by c divided by n, right? But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. If the medium is moving, does that change the speed of light as measured in the lab frame?

Wait, I think in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh, but this problem might not be considering relativity because the velocities are probably non-relativistic, but I'm not sure. The problem says v is a constant velocity, but it's unclear if it's relativistic.

Wait, the problem states the speed of light in a vacuum as c=1, so maybe it's using Galilean transformations here since when velocities are much less than c, Galilean is fine. But when velocities are significant fractions of
