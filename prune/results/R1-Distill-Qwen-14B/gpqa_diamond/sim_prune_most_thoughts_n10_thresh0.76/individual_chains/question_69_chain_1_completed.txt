Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the Bubble Chamber at CERN. Hmm, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can affect how far they travel before decaying. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The energy of the particle in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are for the minimum resolution, which I think refers to the minimum distance the particle must travel for us to detect the decay.

Wait, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime from our perspective (lab frame) is longer because of time dilation. Oh right, time dilation is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. So gamma equals the total energy divided by the rest mass energy.

So let's calculate gamma first. The energy E is 27 GeV, and the rest mass m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is E/(m c²), but since the units are in GeV, the c² factors cancel out. So gamma = 27 / 3.41. Let me do that math: 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, so 27 is a bit more than 7.93, maybe around 7.9?

Wait, let's compute it accurately: 27 / 3.41. So 3.41 times 7 is 23.87. Subtract that from 27, we get 3.13. 3.13 / 3.41 is approximately 0.918. So gamma is around 7.918. Let me write that as 7.918 for more precision.

Next, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime, τ. So τ_lab = gamma * τ₀. So τ_lab = 7.918 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that: 8e-16 * 7.918 = approximately 63.344e-16 seconds, which is 6.3344e-15 seconds.

Now, the distance the particle travels before decaying is the product of its velocity and the lifetime in the lab frame. But wait, the velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light, so maybe we can approximate it as c for simplicity. Because particles moving at high energies like 27 GeV are pretty close to the speed of light.

So the distance L = v * τ_lab. Since v ≈ c, this becomes L = c * τ_lab. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

Putting it all together: L = 3e8 m/s * 6.3344e-15 s. Let me compute that: 3e8 * 6.3344e-15 = (3 * 6.3344) * 1e-7. 3 * 6.3344 is about 19.0032. So 19.0032e-7 meters, which is 1.90032e-6 meters. So approximately 1.9003e-6 meters.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, so I need to find the distance that corresponds to 30% of the maximum possible. Because not all decays can be observed if the resolution isn't good enough.

Wait, no. Maybe I should think in terms of the decay length. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. But if the resolution is the ability to detect if a decay has occurred, perhaps the minimum distance that the decay products can be separated by, such that we can observe the decay. Alternatively, the minimum resolution required to distinguish the decay point from the production point.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the minimum resolution such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So, perhaps the fraction of decays that have traveled a certain distance that the detector can resolve.

Another approach: the probability that a particle decays within a certain distance. The decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability P that a particle decays within a distance L is P = 1 - e^(-L/(cτ_lab)). But wait, wait, let me get that right. The proper lifetime is τ₀, so the lab frame lifetime is gamma τ₀. The decay probability is P = 1 - e^(-t/(gamma τ₀)), where t is the time. But since L = v t ≈ c t, then t = L/c. So P = 1 - e^(-L/(c gamma τ₀)).

Wait, but if I'm looking for the minimum L such that P >= 0.3 (30%), then 1 - e^(-L/(c gamma τ₀)) >= 0.3. So e^(-L/(c gamma τ₀)) <= 0.7. Taking the natural logarithm on both sides: -L/(c gamma τ₀) <= ln(0.7). Multiply both sides by -1 (and reverse the inequality): L/(c gamma τ₀) >= ln(1/0.7) ≈ ln(1.4286) ≈ 0.3567.

So L >= 0.3567 * c gamma τ₀.

Let me compute 0.3567 * c gamma τ₀.

We already have gamma ≈ 7.918, τ₀ = 8e-16 s.

So c gamma τ₀ = 3e8 m/s * 7.918 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that:

3e8 *7.918 = approx 2.3754e9. Multiply by 8e-16: 2.3754e9 * 8e-16 = 1.9003e-6 meters. Wait, that's the same as before.

Wait, but now we have L >= 0.3567 * (1.9003e-6 m). Let me compute 0.3567 * 1.9003e-6.

Hmm, 0.3567 * 1.9 is about 0.68. Let me compute it accurately:

1.9003e-6 * 0.3567 = approximately (1.9 * 0.3567) e-6.

1.9 * 0.3567: 1 * 0.3567 is 0.3567, 0.9 *0.3567 is 0.32103. Sum is 0.67773. So 0.67773e-6 meters, which is 6.7773e-7 meters, or approximately 6.78e-7 m.

Wait a minute, but none of the options match this. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m
B) 2.08e-9 m
C) 2.08e-1 m
D) 2.08e-3 m

Hmm, 6.78e-7 m is about 6.8e-7 m, which is 0.68e-6 m. So that's less than option A, which is 2.08e-6 m. But the options don't include anything around 6.7e-7. So maybe I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I approached this incorrectly. The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps it's referring to the minimum distance that the decay products are displaced from the interaction point, such that the detector can resolve the decay vertex. That is, the minimum distance that the decay occurs from the point of production, beyond which the detector can't distinguish (due to limited resolution). So, if the particle travels a longer distance, it's easier to detect, but for shorter distances, it's harder. So we need the minimum L such that 30% (or more) of the decays occur beyond that L. Wait, no, because if the detector's resolution is bad, it can't see small distances. So if the particle decays within a certain length, the detector can't resolve it, so we miss those decays.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. The resolution is the ability to determine the decay point. So if the decay occurs within a distance L, and the detector's resolution is δ, then if L > δ, you can observe the decay. So the probability that L is greater than δ is the fraction of decays that are observed.

Wait, that makes sense. So the question is, what δ (the minimum resolution) is needed so that at least 30% of the decays have L > δ. So, we need to find δ such that the probability P(L > δ) >= 0.3.

But wait, the decay length distribution is exponential. The probability that L > δ is e^(-δ/(c gamma tau_0)).

Wait, no. The probability that the decay occurs beyond distance L is P(L) = e^(-L/(c gamma tau_0)).

Wait, no. Because the decay probability is P(L) = 1 - e^(-L/(c gamma tau_0)), which is the cumulative distribution function. So the probability that the decay occurs at a distance less than L is P(L) = 1 - e^(-L/(c gamma tau_0)).

Wait, no, wait. The lifetime in lab frame is gamma tau_0. The decay rate is such that the probability of decay after time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau_0)). Since L = v t ≈ c t, P(L) = 1 - e^(-L/(c gamma tau_0)).

Wait, but our problem is that we need the fraction of decays that have L > delta. So that would be e^(-delta/(c gamma tau_0)) >= 0.3 (since 1 - P(L < delta) = P(L >= delta)).

So e^(-delta/(c gamma tau_0)) >= 0.3.

Take the natural log of both sides: -delta/(c gamma tau_0) >= ln(0.3) ≈ -1.20397.

Multiply both sides by -1 (and reverse inequality): delta/(c gamma tau_0) <= 1.20397.

So delta <= 1.20397 * c gamma tau_0.

Wait, but earlier we found that c gamma tau_0 was approximately 1.9003e-6 meters.

So delta <= 1.20397 * 1.9003e-6 m.

Compute 1.20397 * 1.9003e-6:

Approximately 2.287e-6 meters.

Wait, but none of the options exactly match that. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the gamma.

Gamma = E / (m c²) = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV) = 27 / 3.41.

Let me compute 27 / 3.41 more accurately. 3.41 *7 = 23.87. 3.41 *7.9=?

3.41 *7 = 23.87, 3.41 *0.9=3.069. So 23.87 + 3.069=26.939. So 3.41 *7.9=26.939, which is just under 27. So 27 -26.939=0.061. So 0.061 left.

So 0.061 /3.41 is approximately 0.0179. So gamma is approximately 7.9179.

So gamma=7.9179 approx.

c gamma tau_0 = 3e8 m/s *7.9179 *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *7.9179 = 2.37537e9 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s:

2.37537e9 *8e-16 = 1.9003e-6 m.

So c gamma tau_0 is 1.9003e-6 m.

Now, delta = 1.20397 * 1.9003e-6 m.

1.20397 * 1.9003 is approximately let's calculate.

1.9003 *1.2 = 2.28036.

1.9003 *0.00397= approx 0.00753.

So total is 2.28036 +0.00753= ~2.2879e-6 m.

Hmm, about 2.2879e-6 m.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m. Close but not exact. Maybe I should recheck the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to find the minimum delta such that the number of observed decays is at least 30% of the total. That is, the fraction of decays beyond delta is 30%. So, P(L>delta) = 0.3.

Which as above, delta = ( - ln(0.7) ) * c gamma tau_0.

Wait, wait, let's correct that. Because P(L>delta) = e^(-delta/(c gamma tau_0)) = 0.3.

So ln(0.3) = -delta/(c gamma tau_0).

So delta = - c gamma tau_0 * ln(0.3).

Wait, ln(0.3) is approximately -1.20397.

So delta = (1.20397) * c gamma tau_0.

Which brings us back to the same calculation: 1.20397 * 1.9003e-6 = 2.287e-6 m.

But none of the options match that. The options are 2.08e-6 m (option A), which is close but lower. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely. Let me compute 27 / 3.41 exactly.

3.41 into 27.

3.41 *7 =23.87.

27 -23.87 =3.13.

3.13 /3.41 = 0.91788.

So 7.91788.

So gamma=7.91788.

c gamma tau_0 = 3e8 *7.91788 *8e-16.

Let me compute 3e8 *7.91788 = 2.375364e9 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.375364e9 *8e-16 = (2.375364 *8) *1e-7.

2.375364 *8 =19.002912.

So 19.002912e-7 m = 1.9002912e-6 m.

So c gamma tau_0 =1.9002912e-6 m.

Now, delta=1.20397 *1.9002912e-6.

Compute 1.20397 *1.9002912.

1.9 *1.2 = 2.28.

0.0002912 *1.20397 is about 0.00035.

So approximately 2.28 +0.00035=2.28035.

Wait, but more accurately:

1.9002912 *1.20397 = ?

Let me compute 1.9002912 *1.20397.

Breaking it down:

1.9002912 *1 = 1.9002912.

1.9002912 *0.2 = 0.38005824.

1.9002912 *0.00397 = approximately 0.00753.

Add them up: 1.9002912 + 0.38005824 = 2.28034944.

Plus 0.00753: 2.28034944 +0.00753=2.28787944.

So delta =2.28787944e-6 m, which is approximately 2.288e-6 m.

Again, the options don't have this. The nearest option is A)2.08e-6.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the mean decay length, which is c gamma tau_0.

Mean decay length L_mean = c gamma tau_0 =1.9003e-6 m.

30% of decays would be observed when L is longer than a certain multiple of L_mean.

Wait, the relation between the probability and the mean decay length is based on the exponential distribution. The probability that a decay occurs beyond a certain length is P = e^(-L / L_mean).

So for P=0.3, L = - L_mean * ln(0.3).

So L = L_mean * 1.20397.

Which brings us back to 1.9003e-6 *1.20397 ≈ 2.287e-6 m.

So again, the answer would be approximately 2.29e-6 m. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays, which is the point where 30% of decays are beyond that point. So it's the same as what I computed, but maybe the problem considers the minimum resolution to have a certain fraction, perhaps the minimum delta such that 30% are within delta. But that would be different.

Wait, no, if the resolution is the ability to detect, then if the decay occurs within delta, you can't see it, but if it's beyond delta, you can. So the fraction of decays beyond delta is what's detected. So if delta is the resolution, then the detected fraction is P = 1 - e^(-delta/(L_mean)).

Wait, no, wait: P(detected) = 1 - e^(-delta/(L_mean)).

Wait, no, because the decay probability is 1 - e^(-L/(L_mean)), so if the decay occurs at L < delta, then it's not detected. The probability of a decay occurring at L < delta is e^(-delta/L_mean). So the probability of the decay being detected (i.e., L >= delta) is 1 - e^(-delta/L_mean). So for at least 30% detected, 1 - e^(-delta/L_mean) >= 0.3.

Which we've already solved as delta = L_mean * ln(1/(1-0.3))= L_mean * ln(1/0.7)= L_mean * 0.35667.

Wait, wait, that would be for delta where P(detected) =0.3. Because 1 - e^(-delta/L_mean) =0.3 → e^(-delta/L_mean) =0.7 → -delta/L_mean = ln(0.7) → delta= L_mean * (-ln(0.7)).

So delta= L_mean * 0.35667.

Ah, that's different from what I thought earlier. So perhaps I got it wrong before.

Wait, wait, let me clarify.

If delta is the resolution (minimum distance to be detected), then the probability of a decay being detected is P = 1-e^(-delta/(L_mean)).

We need P >=0.3.

So,

1 - e^(-delta/(L_mean)) >=0.3 → e^(-delta/(L_mean)) <=0.7 → -delta/(L_mean) <= ln(0.7) → delta/(L_mean) >= ln(1/0.7) = ln(1.42857) ≈0.35667.

So delta >= 0.35667 * L_mean.

So L_mean is 1.9003e-6 m.

So delta =0.35667 *1.9003e-6 = approximately 0.35667 *1.9003e-6.

Compute 0.35667 *1.9003:

0.3 *1.9003 =0.57009,

0.05 *1.9003=0.095015,

0.00667 *1.9003 ≈0.01268.

Adding them: 0.57009 +0.095015=0.665105 +0.01268=0.677785.

So 0.677785e-6 m → 6.77785e-7 m.

Wait, that's about 6.78e-7 m. Which is 6.78e-7 m, which is 0.678e-6 m.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A)2.08e-6 m, which is about three times larger. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the mean decay length multiplied by some factor. Let me think again.

Another approach: The minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So to have a 30% chance, the average distance must be high enough. Alternatively, perhaps the minimum beta gamma tau_0 is considered.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is simpler. Let me think without getting into probabilities.

The minimum distance the particle must travel for the decay to be observed is such that the fraction of decays is at least 30%. So perhaps the approach is to calculate the average decay length and then find 30% of that.

Wait, no. The average (mean) decay length is L_mean = c gamma tau_0.

If the detector can resolve down to a distance of delta, then the probability that a decay occurs beyond delta is (1/e)^(delta / L_mean). 

Wait, maybe not exactly, but as per the exponential distribution.

But perhaps the question is simpler: the minimum distance that allows 30% of the decays to be observed is the average decay length multiplied by a certain factor.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here because the options don't match my calculations. Let me see what each step could have gone wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me double-check that.

Gamma = E/(m c²) → E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV/c². So E/(m c²) is 27 /3.41 = approx 7.918.

Wait, that's correct.

Next, c gamma tau_0: 3e8 m/s *7.918 *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *7.918 = 2.3754e9 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.3754e9 *8e-16 = (2.3754 *8) *1e-7 → 19.0032e-7 m → 1.90032e-6 m.

So that's correct.

Now, the delta is 0.35667 *1.90032e-6 = approximately 6.78e-7 m.

But the options are much higher than this. So perhaps the question is asking for the mean decay length, not the 30% point.

Wait, if we're to observe at least 30% of the decays, perhaps the mean decay length is the key factor. Because if the majority of decays (mean) are at the mean length, then perhaps the resolution needs to be at least the mean length to capture a significant fraction.

But then, the mean is 1.9e-6 m. Among the options, the closest is option A) 2.08e-6 m. Hmm, but that's larger than the mean. If the resolution is the mean decay length, then about 60% of the decays occur beyond that. Because for an exponential distribution, the probability beyond the mean is 1/e ≈ 0.368, so ~36.8%. So if the resolution is set to the mean, you would detect about 36.8% of the decays. So to get at least 30%, the resolution must be less than the mean.

Wait, no. Because if the resolution is the mean, then you can detect about 36.8% of the decays. So if you set delta to 0.35667 * mean, you get 30% detected.

Wait, but that's what we did earlier, leading to delta=6.78e-7 m. But that's not among the options. So perhaps the question expects a different approach, maybe considering the velocity.

Wait, perhaps another way: the beta factor, which is v/c. Because gamma is gamma and beta is v/c.

So beta = v/c.

But for a particle at high energy, beta is approximately 1. So gamma ≈ 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) ≈ 1 + (beta²)/2 when beta is close to 1.

But perhaps the exact calculation is needed. So beta can be found using the relation gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²).

But with gamma =7.918, let's compute beta.

gamma =7.918 → gamma²=62.70.

1 - beta² = 1/(gamma²) → beta²=1 - 1/62.70 →1 -0.01596 ≈0.98404 → beta≈sqrt(0.98404)=approx 0.992.

So beta ≈0.992.

So the velocity v =beta c=0.992 *3e8 m/s=2.976e8 m/s.

Hmm, perhaps the distance should be calculated as v * tau_lab, not c * tau_lab.

Wait, let's compute that.

Tau_lab=gamma tau_0=7.918 *8e-16 s=6.3344e-15 s.

So L= v * tau_lab = 2.976e8 m/s *6.3344e-15 s.

Compute 2.976e8 *6.3344e-15 = (2.976 *6.3344) *1e-7.

2.976 *6.3344 → let's compute:

2 *6.3344=12.6688,

0.976 *6.3344≈6.173.

So total≈12.6688 +6.173=18.8418.

So 18.8418e-7 m →1.88418e-6 m.

Which is approximately 1.88e-6 m.

Hmm, which is still not matching any option. Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is closer but not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses tau_0 as the lab frame lifetime instead of the proper lifetime? No, that's incorrect because tau_0 is the proper lifetime, so we must use gamma.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem assumes that the lifetime is given in the lab frame. But no, the question says it's the proper lifetime.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity more accurately.

Given gamma=7.91788, let's compute beta.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So 1 - beta^2 =1/(gamma^2)=1/(62.70)≈0.01596.

So beta^2=1-0.01596=0.98404.

beta= sqrt(0.98404)=0.99200.

So v=0.99200 *3e8 m/s=2.976e8 m/s.

So L = v * tau_lab = 2.976e8 m/s *6.3344e-15 s.

Compute 2.976e8 *6.3344e-15= (2.976 *6.3344) *1e-7.

Let me compute 2.976 *6.3344.

2 *6.3344=12.6688,

0.976 *6.3344:

Compute 6 *0.976=5.856,

0.3344 *0.976≈0.326.

So 5.856+0.326=6.182.

So 12.6688 +6.182=18.8508.

So L=18.8508e-7 m=1.88508e-6 m.

Which is approximately 1.885e-6 m.

Hmm, still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution, which is the distance that 30% of the decays occur beyond. So delta= L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

Wait, I think I calculated that earlier and it's 1.885e-6 m, which is about 1.88e-6 m.

But the options are 2.08e-6 m (option A), which is larger. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use beta gamma c tau_0.

Wait, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So beta gamma c tau_0 = 0.992 *7.918 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 0.992 *7.918 = approx 7.85.

7.85 *3e8=2.355e9.

2.355e9 *8e-16=1.884e-6 m.

Which is the same as before.

So delta=1.884e-6 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I need to look for another approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is looking for the proper lifetime multiplied by the speed, but that would be in the rest frame, which is irrelevant.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution in terms of the number of decay lengths. So perhaps it's considering the minimum number of decay lengths required to have a 30% chance. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be (gamma * beta * c * tau_0) * ln(1/(1-0.3)) which is around 0.3567 times that value.

Wait, gamma * beta c tau_0 is the decay length L_mean.

Wait, if the decay length is L_mean, then the fraction of decays observed beyond L is P = e^(-L/L_mean).

So to get P=0.3, L= L_mean * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L_mean *0.3567.

So L=1.9003e-6 m *0.3567=6.777e-7 m.

This is about 6.78e-7 m, which is 0.678e-6 m.

But again, none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the energy is given as 27 GeV, but that's the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh wait, that's a crucial point! Because if the energy given is kinetic energy, then the total energy would be K + m c².

Ah! That's probably where I went wrong.

The problem says the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. So I assumed that's the total energy. But perhaps it's the kinetic energy. Because in particle physics, when someone says a particle is accelerated to a certain energy, it's often the kinetic energy.

Wait, that would change everything. Because if the energy is 27 GeV as kinetic energy, then the total energy E is K + m c². So with m=3.41 GeV/c², E=27 +3.41=30.41 GeV.

So gamma would be E/(m c²)=30.41 /3.41 ≈8.901.

Oh, that's a big difference. So if E is 27 GeV kinetic, then gamma is higher.

So let me recalculate gamma:

E_total =27 GeV +3.41 GeV=30.41 GeV.

Gamma=E/(m c²)=30.41/(3.41) ≈8.901.

Now, L_mean= c gamma tau_0 =3e8 m/s *8.901 *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *8.901=2.6703e9 m/s.

Multiply by8e-16 s: 2.6703e9 *8e-16=2.13624e-6 m.

So L_mean=2.13624e-6 m.

Now, to find delta where P(L >= delta)=0.3, delta= L_mean * ln(1/0.7)=2.13624e-6 *0.35667≈0.761e-6 m.

Wait, wait, no, because earlier we found that for P(L >= delta)=0.3, delta= L_mean * ln(1/(1-0.3))= L_mean * ln(1/0.7)= L_mean *0.35667.

So delta=2.13624e-6 m *0.35667 ≈0.761e-6 m.

Wait, that's about 7.61e-7 m, which is 0.761e-6 m. Still not matching any options.

Wait, but perhaps in this case, the question is asking for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays, which would be the L where P(L >= delta)=0.3.

Wait, perhaps the options were calculated using gamma=8.901, but then using the mean decay length. So gamma=8.901, so L_mean= c gamma tau_0=3e8 *8.901 *8e-16=2.13624e-6 m.

So option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is very close to this value.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the mean decay length, which would be the point where about 37% of the decays are observed beyond that point. So the mean decay length is about 2.14e-6 m, which is close to option A, 2.08e-6 m.

But wait, the question states "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So if the resolution is set to the mean decay length, the observed fraction is about 36.8%, which is more than 30%. So that's acceptable. But the calculation for 30% gives a smaller delta, which would be about 0.76e-6 m.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is the mean decay length, which is option A, 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the energy is the total energy. Let me recompute with E=27 GeV as total energy.

In that case, gamma=27/3.41=7.91788.

L_mean =7.91788 *3e8 *8e-16=1.9003e-6 m.

If the question is asking for the mean decay length, then option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is larger than 1.9e-6 m. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but perhaps the question is not considering the 30% at all, and is just asking for the decay length. But no, the question specifically mentions 30%.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is using the speed of light multiplied by tau_0 and gamma, but without considering the velocity factor, which would be incorrect. But perhaps that's what leads to the given options.

Wait, if I compute gamma * tau_0 =7.918 *8e-16 s=6.3344e-15 s.

Then, L= c * tau_lab=3e8 m/s *6.3344e-15 s=1.9003e-6 m.

Which is 1.9e-6 m. But option A is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c, like 3e8 m/s, but that wouldn't change much.

Alternatively, perhaps the proper formula is (gamma * beta) * c * tau_0.

Which for gamma=7.918 and beta= approx 0.992.

gamma * beta =7.918 *0.992≈7.85.

So L= c * gamma * beta * tau_0=3e8 *7.85 *8e-16.

Wait,

3e8 *7.85 =2.355e9.

2.355e9 *8e-16=1.884e-6 m.

Again, same as before.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I have to conclude that the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m, based on gamma=8.901, which would be if the energy is kinetic.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects simply the calculation of gamma times tau_0 times c, without considering the velocity factor, which would give 1.9e-6 m. But the options don't have that either.

Alternatively, perhaps I have to recheck the initial calculation. Let me compute 27 /3.41 correctly.

27 divided by 3.41.

3.41 *7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 ≈0.9178.

So 7.9178.

So gamma=7.9178.

So c gamma tau_0=3e8 *7.9178 *8e-16=3e8 *6.33424e-15= (3 *6.33424) *1e-7=19.0027e-7=1.90027e-6 m.

Which is approximately 1.9e-6 m.

But the option is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this using more precise values.

Let me compute gamma again with E=27 GeV as the total energy.

gamma=27/3.41=7.91788.

Compute c gamma tau_0:

3e8 m/s *7.91788 *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *7.91788 =2.375364e9.

Multiply by8e-16: 2.375364e9 *8e-16= (2.375364 *8) *1e-7.

2.375364 *8=19.002912.

So 19.002912e-7 m=1.9002912e-6 m.

Which is 1.90029e-6 m.

So that's 1.9003e-6 m, approximately 1.9e-6 m.

The options don't have this. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m

So option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close to 1.9e-6 m but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the calculation in the problem uses a different value for c, such as 3e8 m/s, but that's standard. Or perhaps the energy is given as kinetic, leading to a higher gamma.

Wait, if the energy is 27 GeV as kinetic,

E_total = K + m c²=27 +3.41=30.41 GeV.

Gamma=30.41 /3.41=8.901.

So L_mean=3e8 *8.901 *8e-16=3e8 *7.1208e-15=2.13624e-6 m.

Which is 2.13624e-6 m.

That's approximately 2.14e-6 m. So option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close.

So perhaps the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the mean decay length multiplied by a factor related to the 30% probability. So with gamma=8.901, the mean L is 2.136e-6 m.

The delta for 30% is L=0.35667 *2.136e-6=7.61e-7 m.

But that's about 7.6e-7 m, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the resolution to be the mean decay length multiplied by the natural logarithm factor. But I'm not certain.

Given that, I'm inclined to think that the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m, perhaps due to using gamma=8.901 and rounding during calculations.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process and calculate the decay length. The proper lifetime of \( X^0 \) is \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \), and its mass is \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The energy of the particle in the Bubble Chamber is given as \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \). 

### Key Steps:
1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.918
   \]

2. **Determine the lab-frame lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \):**
   Using time dilation, \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau_0 \):
   \[
   \tau_{\text{lab}} = 7.918 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.3344 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
   \]

3. **Calculate the mean decay length \( L_{\text{mean}} \):**
   The mean decay length is given by:
   \[
   L_{\text{mean}} = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
   \]
   where \( \beta = v/c \). For a particle at high energy, \( \beta \approx 1 \). Thus:
   \[
   L_{\text{mean}} = \gamma c \tau_0 = (3 \times 10^8) \times (7.918) \times (8 \times 10^{-16}) \, \text{m}
   \]
   \[
   L_{\text{mean}} \approx 1.9003 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
   \]

4. **Determine the minimum resolution \( \delta \):**
   To observe at least 30% of the decays, we need the distance \( \delta \) such that the probability of decays occurring beyond \( \delta \) is 30%. For an exponential decay distribution:
   \[
   P(L > \delta) = e^{-\delta / L_{\text{mean}}}
   \]
   Setting \( P(L > \delta) = 0.3 \), we solve:
   \[
   e^{-\delta / L_{\text{mean}}} = 0.3 \implies \delta = -L_{\text{mean}} \ln(0.3)
   \]
   \[
   \delta = 1.9003 \times 10^{-6} \times 0.3567 \approx 6.78 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
   \]

5. **Reassess using total energy interpretation:**
   If the energy \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \) is interpreted as total energy (including rest mass), the total energy is \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.918 \). The mean decay length remains approximately \( 1.9003 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \). However, the closest option to this value is \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \), suggesting the problem may round or adjust calculations.

### Conclusion:
The minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is closest to **\( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**, corresponding to option A.
