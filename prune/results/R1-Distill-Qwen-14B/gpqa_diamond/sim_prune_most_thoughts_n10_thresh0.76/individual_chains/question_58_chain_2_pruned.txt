Okay, so I've got this question here about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are infinities that pop up in calculations, making the results nonsensical. Regularization introduces a temporary momentum cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, and then you remove the cutoff later, hopefully getting a finite result.

So each option is a different theory. Let me think about each one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Oh right, superstring theory is a type of string theory that incorporates supersymmetry. I think string theories aim to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. They propose that particles are not point-like but rather tiny strings. Now, do they require regularization? I'm trying to remember. String theories usually work at the perturbative level with certain approximations, like the superstring theory might have a perturbative expansion. But wait, string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity, so it should be free from divergences because it doesn't have the same kind of infinities as point particle theories. Or maybe it's because the stringy nature makes the calculations more finite? So perhaps superstring theory doesn't require regularization because it's a background-independent theory, and the structure of the theory avoids the divergences that other QFTs have.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to SU(3). It has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak, allowing perturbative methods. But wait, loop corrections in QCD calculations can lead to divergences. So you need regularization techniques like dimensional regularization, lattice regularization, or others. I remember that QCD requires renormalization, which is closely tied to regularization. So QCD does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, dealing with electrons and photons. It
