Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how to solve it. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says: We want to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of total volume. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to prepare this solution, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, let's start by breaking this down. Fe(OH)3 is iron(III) hydroxide. I remember that hydroxides are usually amphoteric, meaning they can react with both acids and bases. But in this case, since we're adding a strong acid, Fe(OH)3 will likely react with the acid.

The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid (like HCl) would produce Fe^3+ ions and water. The general reaction should be something like:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O

Right? So, each mole of Fe(OH)3 will react with 3 moles of H+ ions.

First, I need to calculate how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + (3*(16 + 1)) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me do the precise calculation: 0.1 / 106.85 = approximately 0.00093598 mol.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+, the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 0.00093598 ≈ 0.00280794 mol.

The acid solution is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol per liter (or 100 cm³, since 1 L = 1000 cm³). So, the volume of acid needed is moles / concentration.

Volume (L) = 0.00280794 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0280794 L, which is 28.0794 cm³. So approximately 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³. That's very close, so that's a possibility.

Wait, but wait. Is there any other reaction I'm missing? Like, could Fe(OH)3 react in another way? No, I think the main reaction here is with the strong acid, producing Fe^3+ and water.

But wait, the initial solution is 100 cm³ total. So when we add the acid, the total volume will be 100 cm³. So the volume of acid added (V) plus the initial solution (100 cm³) would be the total. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says 100 cm³ is the total volume after adding the acid. So the initial solution is 100 cm³, and the acid is added to it? Or is the initial solution just the Fe(OH)3 dissolved in 100 cm³? Hmm, no, the question says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the way it's phrased: "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the total volume after dissolution is 100 cm³. So the initial volume before adding acid is not specified. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the volume after adding the acid. So we have to add some amount of acid to 100 cm³ of solution to dissolve the Fe(OH)3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me read the question again: "dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So the total volume of the solution is 100 cm³. So that includes any
