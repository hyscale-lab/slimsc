Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound, and it has 8 carbon atoms in total. Wait, a benzene ring is 6 carbons normally, so substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. It also mentions that the FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the compound has both a carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe ester) and a halogen attached to the ring.

Hmm, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. Let's think about substituents that have a carbonyl and a halogen. The carbonyl could be part of a substituent like an acetyl group (like -COCH3), but wait, that's only one substituent. Or maybe a substituent that has both a carbonyl and a halogen. Alternatively, the two substituents could be a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, wait. Let's clarify: the FTIR shows peaks for both a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the compound has both a carbonyl group and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring. So, the ring is di-substituted, with one substituent being a halogen (like Cl, Br) and another being a carbonyl-containing group, maybe like an acetyl group or a ketone.

Wait, but in a 6-membered ring, if it's di-substituted, the substituents are in positions 1 and 2? Or perhaps in positions that are para or meta to each other. Wait, but it's di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring. So, the substituents are a X (like Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group.

Wait, but the carbonyl group could be part of a substituent attached
