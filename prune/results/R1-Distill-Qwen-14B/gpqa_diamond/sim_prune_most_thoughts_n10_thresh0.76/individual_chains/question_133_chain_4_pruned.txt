Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I need to find their concentration when given some amounts of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Alright, let me think through this.

First, I remember that orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it dissociates into different forms. The problem gives me the Ka values for H3PO4. Oh right, the three dissociation steps are:
1. H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

Orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-, are the conjugate base of HPO4^2-.

The solution contains two salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I think these are related to the different forms of phosphate ions. Let me write down their dissociations.

KH2PO4 is a diprotic acid. When it dissolves, I believe it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-: 
KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-

Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-:
Na2HPO4 → 2Na+ + HPO4^2-

Wait, but wait, Na2HPO4 is actually the sodium salt of HPO4^2-. So when it dissolves, it gives Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the solution has H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. Now, phosphate ions can be formed when HPO4^2- loses a proton.

But wait, the solution is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So they must form a buffer solution. Or maybe the H2PO4^- can donate a proton, and HPO4^2- can accept it, leading to some equilibrium.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. So I need to find how much PO4^3- is present in solution.

I think I should calculate the contributions from both salts, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each salt's dissociation.

First, find how much each salt contributes in terms of moles. Because the problem gives grams and molar masses, I can compute the moles.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007343 mol. That's about 7.343e-3 moles.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005616 mol, about 5.616e-3 moles.

Each mole of KH2PO4 gives 1 mole of H2PO4^-: so 7.343e-3 mol H2PO4^-.

Each mole of Na2HPO4 gives 1 mole of HPO4^2-: so 5.616e-3 mol HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. So the concentrations would be:

[H2PO4^-] = 7.343e-3 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036715 M

[HPO4^2-] = 5.616e-3 / 0.2 ≈ 0.02808 M

Now, I need to consider the equilibria of these species. H2PO4^- can donate a proton (to become HPO4^2-), and HPO4^2- can donate another proton to become PO4^3-.

But wait, the HPO4^2- is already in solution. So the PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

The reaction for that is:
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-

The Ka for this is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So the concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by this equilibrium.

But wait, since HPO4^2- is present, and H2PO4^- is also present, maybe their concentrations will influence each other. Hmm, so perhaps I need to find the pH of the solution first.

Wait, but wait: the solution is a buffer solution because it contains a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). So the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. The relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8))≈ 7.2075.

So pH = 7.2075 + log([HPO4^2-]/
