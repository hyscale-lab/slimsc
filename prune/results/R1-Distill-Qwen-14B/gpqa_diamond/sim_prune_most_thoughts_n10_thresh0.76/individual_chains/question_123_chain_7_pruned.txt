Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let's try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question says that a supernova occurred in our Galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Now, the question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, okay. So, we're dealing with frames of reference here. The problem is about relative motion and probably involves the concept of time dilation or length contraction due to special relativity because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light. But wait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second for easier calculations with standard units. Oh wait, no, maybe I don't need to because the options are in km. Hmm.

Wait, the speed given is 60,000 km/s. Let me calculate what fraction of the speed of light that is. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 divided by 300,000 is 0.2. So that's 20% the speed of light. So it's a relativistic speed, which means I probably can't ignore relativistic effects. Oh, but wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so maybe just consider their relative motion.

So the key here is to find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, so we're switching between two frames here: the ejecta's frame and the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s, right? Because the two frames are moving relative to each other at that speed. Because if the ejecta sees the Galaxy coming towards it at v, then the Galaxy sees the ejecta approaching at the same speed v, assuming no acceleration and in a straight line. So that makes sense.

So the problem is about calculating the distance in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. So, the time given is in the ejecta's frame, and we need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame. Hmm.

Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. So how does this compare to the time in the Galaxy's frame? Because of time dilation, the time experienced in each frame is different. Or perhaps the other way around.

Wait, let me get this straight. Suppose in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v =60,000 km/s. So, the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is Δt' =50 s. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time Δt, which would be the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, no. Wait, the time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. So when the ejecta experiences 50 seconds, how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame? Because the distance the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time according to the Galaxy, right?

So, to find the distance, I need to find out how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. Then, multiply that time by the speed v to get the distance.

Wait, but which direction are we looking at? So, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s
