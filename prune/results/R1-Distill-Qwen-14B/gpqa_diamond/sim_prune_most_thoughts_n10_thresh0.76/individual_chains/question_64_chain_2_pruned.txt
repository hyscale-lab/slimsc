Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

So, there's an equimolar mixture of salts A and B that weighs 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without any air. When heated, a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through a few tubes: first anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. 

The results are:
- Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60g.
- Tube 3 (copper) gains 0.80g, and CuO is formed.
- Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2) doesn't change in weight.
- Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm, okay. I think I need to figure out what's happening in each step. Let's break it down.

First, the heating of salts A and B. Since it's without air, probably a decomposition reaction. The products are gases. Let me think about possible gases that could form. Common gases from such reactions are like CO2, H2O (but that's liquid at higher temps?), NH3, SO2, HCl, etc. But since they are passing through tubes, maybe the gases are absorbed in the tubes.

The first tube is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a drying agent. It absorbs water. Because anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 is used for drying, it would absorb any water vapor. So if the weight of tube 1 increased by 3.60g, that must be the mass of water absorbed. Because Mg(ClO4)2 would gain the mass of the water. So the amount of water is 3.60g. 

Wait, but considering Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, when it absorbs water, it forms Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O. So the gain in mass is the mass of water. So 3.60g H2O. That's 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 moles of H2O.

Next, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. But it didn't change in weight. So maybe the gases passed through didn't react with Ca(OH)2. Wait, but Ca(OH)2 is a base. It would react with acidic gases like CO2. But if nothing happened, that suggests that either there was no CO2, or maybe another condition. Alternatively, perhaps the gases weren't acidic enough to react, or the solution couldn't absorb any more CO2. Wait, but wait, another possibility is that the gas that reacted with Mg(ClO4)2 was water, which is already accounted for. Then, maybe the gases that passed into tube 2 didn't contain CO2? Or perhaps the next step can help me figure it out.

Then, tube 3 is red-hot copper. The copper gains 0.80g, and forms CuO. So, the gas that passed through must be something that reacts with copper, perhaps. When copper is heated, it can react with certain gases. For example, CO could react with copper to form CuO. Let me see: 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. But wait, I'm not sure about that reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's H2S, but that doesn't fit. Or maybe it's H2 reacting with CuO, but that would require a catalyst, like in the hydrogenation of CuO. But in this case, the copper is red-hot, which would provide enough heat. So, if H2 is present, it could react with CuO to form water and Cu. Wait, but that reaction is H2 + CuO → H2O + Cu. But here, the copper is gaining mass, so maybe the gas is H2O? No, H2O wouldn't react that way. Alternatively, maybe the gas is SO2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's H2 reacting with CuO, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the copper is gaining 0.80g. Let me calculate the moles of CuO formed. The molar mass of CuO is 64 + 16 = 80 g/mol. So 0.80g is 0.01 mol. So, the reaction might be something that produces CuO.

Wait, another approach: the gas that reacts with copper is H2S? No, H2S is a gas, but when it's passed over Cu, maybe it doesn't react. Alternatively, maybe it's
