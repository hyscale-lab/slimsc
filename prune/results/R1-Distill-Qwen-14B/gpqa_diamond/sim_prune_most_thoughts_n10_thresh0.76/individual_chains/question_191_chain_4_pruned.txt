Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the final product is after a series of reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that name is a bit complex. Let me visualize the structure. So it's a cyclohexanone ring. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (that's CH2OH attached to the ring). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2C=CH? Wait, maybe I should draw it. Oh, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2? No, wait, correction. The structure is CH2=C(CH2-) something. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the substituent is CH2-C(=CH2)-. No, wait, wait. Let me think again. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is the same as isopropenyl. So the group is CH2-C(CH2-)=CH2? No, I think it's CH2-CH(CH2)-. Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2 with a double bond. No, wait, here's a better way: prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2- but wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent is the propenyl group attached at the 2-position. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, no. Let me think. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is CH2-C(CH2-)-. Hmm, maybe the structure is CH2-C(=CH2)-. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=C(CH2-)- something else. No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me get back to the molecule.

So the starting molecule is a cyclohexanone (cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1). At position 3, a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and at position 5, a prop-1-en-2-yl group. So the substituents are hydroxymethyl at 3 and isopropenyl (CH2-C(CH3)=CH2?) at 5.

First reaction: treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide. Sodium hydride is a strong base and a good nucleophile deprotonating agent. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So this is likely an alkylation reaction. 

But wait, the starting material has a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH) at position 3. In the presence
