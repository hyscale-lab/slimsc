Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let me try to think it through. Hmm, the question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized, and there are some unusual observations in the NMR and LC-MS analyses.

Alright, let's break down what's happening. The 1H NMR of the crude compound shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Wait, so each would integrate to about 0.5H each? But the problem says they integrate together to 1H, so maybe each is about equal. Also, they ruled out spin-spin coupling. So it's not a splitting due to coupling with another proton. Because if it were, like a doublet, you'd see each peak as part of a multiplet. So what else could cause two peaks from the same proton?

Then the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So the mass is the same, so they are not different compounds with different masses. But same mass could be due to isomers or something else.

Wait, the options are A to D. Let's think about each option.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If that were the case, the precursor would have a different mass. So in the LC-MS, one peak would be the product, the other the precursor. But the question says both have the same mass as expected. So A is unlikely.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in NMR, for chiral centers, the alpha protons would be equivalent in each enantiomer. Wait, but if there's a chiral center, the same proton in each enantiomer would have the same shift? Or would they be split? Wait, enantiomers have identical NMR shifts because they're notchiral, or wait no, actually, enantiomers are chiral but would have the same NMR shifts because the environment is same. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. If the molecule is chiral, and the alpha protons are in a chiral environment, each enantiomer would have the same shift, but in a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak unless there's some diastereotopicity or coupling. Wait, but in the case of enantiomers
