Okay, so I've got this question here about rotavirus and some experiments with mice. Hmm, let me try to unpack this. So, the setup is that they've tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP. Then they gave these to mice via oral gavage. 

Wait, the inner capsid proteins are probably part of the virus's structure. GFP is a fluorescent marker, so they can track where these proteins go in the mouse. But in the experiment, some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Oh right, because the stomach has a lot of acid, which might break down proteins or the GFP might get denatured or something. So not all the tagged proteins make it through the stomach.

Then, some of the proteins got entangled in the intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs include places like Peyer's patches, which are in the intestine. So the ones that didn't get destroyed by stomach acid probably made it to the Peyer's patches. 

They isolate the proliferating cell population from the Peyer patches. Proliferating cells could be B cells that are responding to the antigen, maybe. Then they sequence the variable heavy chain gene and see high variability. High variability suggests that each cell's gene is different, so this must be a process that causes diversity among the immune cells.

The question is asking which process is taking place. The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Let me think about each option.

VDJ recombination is part of the initial diversification of B cell receptors. That happens during the development of B cells in the bone marrow. VDJ is when the V, D, and J segments are rearranged to create a diverse antigen-binding site. But once the B cells are mature and encounter an antigen, what happens?

Somatic hypermutation occurs after the initial immune response. It introduces point mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor, increasing the diversity of the antibodies. This happens in germinal centers, where B cells proliferate and mutate their receptors, leading to affinity maturation.

Class switching recombination is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), which involves a different part of the gene than the variable regions. So this doesn't directly cause variability in the variable heavy chain.

In this experiment, the cells isolated are from the Peyer's patches, which are part of the mucosal immune system. Peyer's patches are sites where antigens are sampled and immune responses are initiated. B cells here, upon encountering an antigen, would start to proliferate. 

When the B cells in the germinal centers undergo somatic hypermutation, each cell's variable region can mutate, leading to a diverse population. Since the question states that the variable heavy chain genes show high variability, that points to a process that happens after the initial diversification of VDJ.

So VDJ is during development, but the question says the GFP is delivered via the gut, which is a mucosal route. The B cells are in the Peyer's patches, which are likely inducing a secondary immune response or at least an initial response. But the variable regions' high variability suggests ongoing mutation, which would be somatic hypermutation.

So the process is somatic hypermutation. Therefore, the correct answer is A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while the remaining proteins are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Fluorescent Peyer's patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene reveals high variability, indicating a process that generates diversity in the immune response.

To determine the process, the options are analyzed:

1. **Somatic hypermutation**: This process introduces point mutations in the variable region of B cell receptors, increasing diversity during the immune response. It occurs in germinal centers and aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene.

2. **Complement activation**: This process involves the complement system targeting pathogens but does not directly contribute to variability in B cell receptors.

3. **Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody produced but does not affect the variability of the variable heavy chain.

4. **VDJ recombination**: This initial diversification occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, not during the immune response in secondary lymphoid organs.

Given the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene and the context of Peyer's patches, the process occurring is **somatic hypermutation**, which generates diversity in the immune response after antigen recognition.

Answer: A
