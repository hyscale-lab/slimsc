Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, let me draw that structure mentally. It looks like a molecule with two double bonds, maybe? Or perhaps it's a larger structure with multiple substituents. Oh well, maybe the exact structure isn't too crucial for calculating the enthalpy of formation using bond energies.

The data provided includes enthalpy of atomization of carbon, and bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds. Oh right, enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break bonds in an element to form isolated atoms. So for carbon, each bond would break, but wait, each C atom is tetrahedral, so maybe it's the energy to break all four bonds in a carbon atom?

Wait, no, the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol. So that's the total energy to break all bonds in graphite or something to make individual C atoms. I remember that in carbon, each bond is shared, so maybe each C atom has four bonds, but in the solid state, it's a network. But for the purpose of this problem, I think we can take it as 1000 kJ per mole of carbon atoms, but wait, the units are kJ/mol, so maybe it's per mole of C atoms.

Wait, the way enthalpy of formation is calculated using bond energies is by considering the bonds broken in the reactants (elements) and bonds formed in the products (the molecule). So the standard approach is:

ΔH_f = [sum of bond energies of reactants] - [sum of bond energies of products]

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the enthalpy of formation is calculated as the energy required to break all bonds in the elements (reactants) and form all bonds in the compound (products). So the formula is:

ΔH_f = Σ (Bond energies of reactants) - Σ (Bond energies of products)

But wait, the reactants in the formation reaction would be the elements in their standard states. For hydrocarbons, that's H2 and C (graphite or whatever). So for each molecule, we
