Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, right? So the question is about the concentration of calcium ions when it's in a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex.

The problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. Oh wait, stochiometric means it's in a 1:1 ratio, I think. So each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA^4- molecule. 

The K for the complex, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. That's a big number, so the complex is really stable. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or maybe in some other charge state, but the K is given, so I don't need to worry about that).

Since the solution is at pH where everything is ideal, I can probably assume that the EDTA is completely deprotonated and available to form the complex. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. 

But wait, the question is about the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. Because in solution, the CaEDTA complex dissociates a little, right? So the dissociation equation would be:

CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The K for this is given as 5x10^10. Wait, no, wait. Because K for the formation is Kf, which is [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). But when the complex dissociates, the K for dissociation would be 1/Kf, right? Because formation and dissociation are reverse reactions. So K_dissociation = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the change as 'x'. So when the complex dissociates, it produces x concentration of Ca²+ and x concentration of EDTA. But wait, wait. The initial concentrations before dissociation are: [CaEDTA] = 0.02, [Ca²+] = 0, [EDTA] = 0. After dissociation, [CaEDTA] is 0.02 - x, [Ca²+] is x, [EDTA] is x. But since K is so large
