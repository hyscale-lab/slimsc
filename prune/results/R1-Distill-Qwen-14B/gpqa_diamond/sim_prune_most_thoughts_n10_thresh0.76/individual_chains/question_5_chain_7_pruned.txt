Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, right? So it's composed of components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given in terms of their 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The question is about finding the eigenvector of P in an arbitrary direction n, which is in the x-z plane.

Wait, but wait. The operator P is given along each component. The general operator in an arbitrary direction n is the dot product of P with the unit vector n. So, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. So n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator we're interested in is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

The eigenvector we're seeking corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, (P) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me write down each component matrix:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P is (n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] ) + (n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Let me factor out (ħ/2). So P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z ] ].

Wait, because when you add n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] and n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]], the result is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

So P is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

Now,
