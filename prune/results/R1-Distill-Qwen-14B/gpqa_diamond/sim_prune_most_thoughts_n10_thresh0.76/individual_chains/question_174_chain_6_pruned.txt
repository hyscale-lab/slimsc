Okay, so I have this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. So wait, rest-mass energy is given by E=mc², so M must be 300 GeV/c². 

Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. So, let's say the two masses are m1 and m2. Then, m1 = 2 m2. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. 

Wait, because M is the initial mass, so m1 + m2 is 0.99 M. But M is 300 GeV/c², so the sum is 0.99 * 300 GeV/c² = 297 GeV/c². 

But m1 is twice m2, so substituting: m1 = 2 m2. So 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 297 GeV/c². So m2 = 99 GeV/c², and m1 = 198 GeV/c². 

Wait a minute, that means m1 is about 198 GeV/c² and m2 is 99 GeV/c², but wait, the initial nucleus was 300 GeV/c². So the sum is 297, so the mass defect is 3 GeV/c². That mass defect would be converted into energy, right? So that's the energy released in the fission. 

But the question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. We're supposed to find the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. 

So, I should compute T1 correctly using relativity and then compute T1 using non-relativistic mechanics and subtract the two.

Wait, but since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. 

In the relativistic case, the energy of each fragment will include their kinetic energy plus their rest mass energy. But since the nucleus is at rest, the total energy is just the sum of the rest energies of the fragments plus their kinetic energies. 

Wait, no, the initial nucleus was at rest, so its total energy was Mc² = 300 GeV. After fission, each fragment has rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. So, the sum of the rest mass energies is 297 GeV, as calculated before. So the remaining energy, 3 GeV, must be the total kinetic energy of the two fragments. 

Wait, that's because 300 GeV = (m1 + m2)c² + (T1 + T2), where T1 and T2 are the kinetic energies of the two fragments. Since m1 + m2 is 297 Ge
