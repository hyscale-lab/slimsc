Okay, let's try to figure out which compound is C9H11NO2 based on the given spectral data. Hmm, so the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's start by calculating the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure.

The formula is C9H11NO2. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So, (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. Let's compute that. 2*9 is 18, plus 2 is 20. 20 minus 11 is 9, plus 1 is 10. Divided by 2 is 5. So five degrees: that could be a benzene ring (3 double bonds) plus maybe a carbonyl group and a double bond or ring. Or perhaps a benzene ring, a carbonyl, and an amide or something else. 

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are likely N-H stretches. N-H can be in amides or amines. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is probably a carbonyl group (C=O), maybe an amide or an ester or a ketone. But since the molecular formula has an O2, and considering the other groups, maybe an amide or ester.

Now, the 1H NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H: This looks like a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons, so maybe an ethyl group attached to something, like OCH2CH3.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H: This could be NH2 protons, but wait, amines or amides. Wait, but in amides, the NH is usually a singlet with a broad peak. If the protons here are not split, but it's a broad, maybe it's an NH group, but in an amide, the NH is usually a singlet. Alternatively, maybe a CH2 attached to an electronegative atom, but the shift is around 4 ppm, which is more like OCH2 or NCH2.

Wait, another thought: 4.0 ppm could be an OCH2 group. For example, if it's an ethyl ester, like OCH2CH3, but that's more at around 4.3 ppm perhaps? Or maybe it's a CH2 attached to an oxygen, like in an amide structure. Alternatively, maybe it's an NH group, but NHs tend to be around 1-5 ppm, but more specifically, amide NHs are usually lower, maybe around 7-8 ppm if it's an aromatic amine. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Moving on: 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with two sets of two protons each. So perhaps this is a CH2CH2
