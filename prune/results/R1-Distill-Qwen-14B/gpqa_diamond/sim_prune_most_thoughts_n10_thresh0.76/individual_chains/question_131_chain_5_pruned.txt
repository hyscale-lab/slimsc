Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, let's read the question again. So, we have a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride then reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with the molecular formula C13H16O3.

The NMR data for the anhydride is provided: 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Then, the products' 2D NOESY spectra are mentioned. The major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. The question is which resonances are connected in the major product's NOESY.

Hmm, okay, let's start by figuring out what the starting materials are and what the reactions involve.

First, the dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. Dehydration of such an acid would typically form an anhydride. But wait, dehydration of a diacid usually forms an anhydride, right? So, the starting material is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a cis double bond in between. Wait, no, wait: if it's a cis-alkene, that's between two CH groups with substituents on the same side. So maybe the diacid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond, so HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-COOH? No, wait, wait. Maybe it's a four-carbon diacid with a double bond in the middle. Like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH is succinic acid, but here it's HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH? No, wait, that's a diacid with a trans or cis double bond. Oh, wait, the question says the dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. So, maybe it's something like HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-COOH? No, wait, that's five carbons between the COOH groups. Maybe it's a four-carbon diacid with a double bond.

Wait, no, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond in between. Oh wait, no, because that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond, so like HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH? No, that would be a three-carbon chain with a double bond. Wait, maybe the diacid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH? No, that's a
