Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about coupled angular momentum states for two electrons in p orbitals. Hmm.

Alright, the state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. I remember that l1 and l2 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. Since each is 1, they are in p orbitals. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z and getting -ħ each. So, L1z and L2z are the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron. Each is measured and found to be -ħ. I need to find the probability of this happening.

Wait, orbital angular momentum states... For each electron in a p orbital, l=1, so the possible m values are -1, 0, +1. So, L1z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ, same for L2z.

But the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So, I think this is a state where the two individual angular momenta are coupled to a total L=2 with m=-1.

In such a coupled state, the possible m values come from adding the individual m1 and m2 values. Because m = m1 + m2. So, for each electron, m1 can be -1, 0, +1, and similarly for m2. When you add them together, you get possible m values from -2 to +2.

In this case, the total m is -1. So, how can m1 + m2 = -1?

Let me list all possible (m1, m2) pairs that add up to -1:
1. m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum -1
2. m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum -1
3. m1 = +1, m2 = -2 → but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So this isn't possible. So actually, only two possibilities: (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Each electron has m1 and m2 each ranging from -1 to +1. So possible pairs that sum to -1 are:
- (-1, 0)
- (0, -1)

So two possible ways to get m = -1.

Now, the state |1,1,2,-1> is an eigenstate of L², Lz, but not necessarily of L1z and L2z. So, to find the probability of measuring specific m1 and m2 values, I need to express the coupled state in terms of the product states of individual m's.

Wait, what's the product basis here? The product states are |m1, m2>, right? So |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of these product states that have m1 + m2 = -1.

The process is similar to how you construct Clebsch-Gordan states. For two p orbitals (l1=1 and l2=1), the total l can be 2 or 0 or 1? Wait, the possible total angular momentum quantum numbers when adding two l=1 particles. The possible l's are l=2 (since 1+1=2), l=1 (since 1-1=0)), and l=0 is not possible because 1+1 can't give 0. Wait, no, the possible l values when adding two angular momenta are l = |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2, in integer steps. So l1=1, l2=1: possible l=2, 1, 0.

But in this problem, the state is |1,1,2,-1>, so l=2 and m=-1. So I need to find the expansion of this state in terms of the product states |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a particular linear combination of the product states |m1, m2> with m1 + m2 = -1.

So, the state can be written as a sum of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. The coefficients are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, but I'm a bit rusty on Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Let me think. For two spin-1 particles (since l=1), when adding to total spin 2 (l=2), the state |m1, m2> for m_total = m would be given by the coefficients.

In our case, m_total is -1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> would be a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

So, the possible pairs are:

(-1, 0),

(0, -1).

Wait, but are there any other possibilities? For two p orbitals (l=1 each), the maximum m1 and m2 can be +1 each, so m_total can be up to +2.

So, for m_total = -1, the possible m1 and m2 are as I listed.

Wait a second, but is there any coefficient in front of each term? For example, the state |l=2, m=-1> would be a linear combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 to get l=2.

The general formula for |l, m> is a sum over m1, m2 such that m1 + m2 = m, of (CG coefficients) times |m1, m2>.

So, for l=2, m=-1:

The state is a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

The possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

The CG coefficient for each would be sqrt( ( (2 - (-1 + 0) ) )/ something )... I'm not exactly sure, but maybe I can recall that for two l=1 particles combining to l=2, the CG coefficients for m=-1 would be sqrt(2/3) for | -1, 0 > and sqrt(1/3) for | 0, -1 >? Or wait, maybe the other way around.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the ladder operators. The state |l=2, m=-1> can be built using the lowering operator on the |l=2, m=0> state.

But maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the possible ways to have m1 + m2 = m.

Wait, another approach: for two p orbitals, the possible |m1, m2> states that add up to m=-1 are | -1, 0 > and | 0, -1 >.

The state |l=2, m=-1> is a combination of these two product states. The coefficients are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for two spin-1 particles (l=1 each) combining to l=2 are as follows. For m_total = -2: only | -1, -1 > with coefficient 1.

For m_total = -1: it's a combination of | -1, 0 > and |0, -1>.

Wait, how do these coefficients look?

I think the CG coefficient for |l=2, m=-1> is sqrt(2/3) for |m1=-1, m2=0> and sqrt(1/3) for |m1=0, m2=-1> ?

Alternatively, perhaps the other way around. Maybe sqrt(1/3) for | -1, 0 > and sqrt(2/3) for | 0, -1 >.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should consider the general formula for CG coefficients.

The CG coefficients for combining two angular momenta j1 and j2 to get J and M are given by:

< j1 m1 j2 m2 | J M > = [ ( (2J + 1) (J + m1 + m2)! ) / ( (J - m1 + m2 + 1)! (J + m1 - m2)! ) ) ]^(1/2) * [ ( (j1 - j2 + m1 + m2)! (j1 + j2 - m1 - m2)! ) / ( (j1 + j2 + m1 + m2 + 1)! ( -j1 + j2 + m1 + m2 )! ) ) ) ]^(1/2) * (-1)^{j1 - j2 + m} ) * [ ( (j1 + j2 + m1 + m2 + 1)! ) / ( (j1 + j2 - m1 - m2 + 1)! ) ) ]

Wait, that looks complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps for specific cases, I can use known values.

Wait, another way: when you have two l=1 particles, the possible total L is 2, 1, 0.

The state |2, -1> is constructed from |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

The CG coefficients for these can be found, for example, using tables or known values.

From what I recall, for two spin-1 (p orbital) states combining to l=2, the coefficients for m=-1 are sqrt(2/3) for |m1=-1, m2=0> and sqrt(1/3) for |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, no, perhaps the other way around. Let me think of the state |2, -1> as being built from |m1, m2> with m1 + m2 = -1.

The CG coefficient for each term is determined by the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the square of the coefficients.

The sum of squares must be 1.

So, let's denote the coefficients as a and b, for |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

So, |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Earlier, I thought that a = sqrt(2/3) and b = sqrt(1/3), which would sum to 1.

Wait, let's see. If the state is |2, -1>, then it's a combination of | -1, 0 > and | 0, -1 >.

Let me check the CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

From the CG table, the coefficients can be looked up.

I think the CG coefficients for this case are:

For |m1, m2> = | -1, 0 >: the coefficient is sqrt(2/3).

For |m1, m2> = | 0, -1 >: the coefficient is sqrt(1/3).

Because when you add the squares: (2/3) + (1/3) = 1.

Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, perhaps I should think about the ladder operator approach.

The raising and lowering operators can be used to construct these states.

But maybe that's getting too involved. Let me think about the possible states.

Assuming that the state |2, -1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

So, the state is:

|2, -1> = c1 | -1, 0 > + c2 | 0, -1 >.

To find the coefficients c1 and c2.

From the theory, I think the coefficients are determined by the number of ways to reach that state. For the m=-1 state, you have two possible paths (from m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1), so the coefficients are determined by some symmetry.

Another approach: The number of ways to get m=-1 is two, so the square of the coefficients would be (1/3) and (2/3), adding up to 1.

Wait, perhaps the coefficients are sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), but I'm not entirely sure which term corresponds to which.

Wait, another thought: the state |2, -1> should be orthogonal to |2, -2> and other m states.

Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are symmetric in some way. But I might be overcomplicating this.

In any case, the important point is that the state |2, -1> is a combination of | -1, 0 > and | 0, -1 >. Each of these terms contributes to the probability of their respective m1 and m2 values.

Now, the question is, what's the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ each. That is, m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. But wait, wait a minute. Because in the coupled state |2,-1>, the sum of m1 and m2 is -1.

If both m1 and m2 are -1, their sum would be -2, which is different from m=-1. So, this situation isn't possible in this state. Because the coupled state's m is -1, and the sum of individual m's is -2. So, that's impossible.

Wait, let me think again. For the coupled state, the sum is m= -1. So any product state |m1, m2> that contributes to this coupled state must have m1 + m2 = -1.

So, if m1 is -1, then m2 must be 0 (since -1 + 0 = -1). Similarly, if m1 is 0, m2 must be -1.

In the product states that make up |2, -1>, m1 can't be -1 and m2 be -1, because that would sum to -2, which is not the m of the coupled state.

So, in the state |2,-1>, there's no component where both m1 and m2 are -1. Therefore, the probability of measuring m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 is zero.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the state is a combination of | -1, 0 > and | 0, -1 >, then the only possibilities are m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1. So, the probabilities are the square of the coefficients for those terms.

So, the probability of getting m1=-1 and m2=0 is |c1|², and m1=0 and m2=-1 is |c2|².

But what about the probability of measuring any other m1 and m2? Like m1=1 and m2=-2? Well, that's not possible because m2 can't be -2. So any m1 and m2 outside their allowed ranges for l=1 (i.e., m1 can't be beyond -1 to +1) don't contribute.

So, in this coupled state, the only possible m1 and m2 pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). No other pairs are possible.

Therefore, the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1 is zero because that's not a possible combination in this state.

So, the joint probability of getting both L1z and L2z as -ħ is zero. So, the answer should be D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals (orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l_1 = l_2 = 1 \)) forming a coupled angular momentum state \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle \). The goal is to determine the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \), corresponding to \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Coupled State and Total Angular Momentum**:
   - The coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) represents a system where the total angular momentum quantum number is \( l = 2 \) and the z-component is \( m = -1 \). The total \( m \) is the sum of the individual \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \): \( m = m_1 + m_2 \).

2. **Possible \( m_1, m_2 \) Pairs**:
   - For \( l_1 = 1 \) and \( l_2 = 1 \), the possible \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) values are \( -1, 0, +1 \). To satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \), the valid pairs are:
     - \( (m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0) \),
     - \( (m_1, m_2) = (0, -1) \).

3. **State Decomposition**:
   - The coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) is a linear combination of the product states \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \) that satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \). Specifically:
     \[
     |1,1,2,-1\rangle = c_1 |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle + c_2 |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle,
     \]
     where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

4. **Probability of Measuring \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \)**:
   - The measurement \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \) implies \( m_1 + m_2 = -2 \), which is inconsistent with the total \( m = -1 \) of the coupled state. Therefore, there is no component of \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) where both \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) does not include any contribution from the product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \), the joint probability of measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) is zero.

### Final Answer:
The joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \) is **0**.
