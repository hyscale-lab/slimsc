Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it. Let me start by breaking down what the question is saying.

The scenario is that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly good—it matches the expected molecule—except there are two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals. Together, they add up to 1H, which is what I'd expect. So, it's not splitting because of coupling since the integral is correct, and the coupling pattern doesn't explain it either. Hmm.

Then the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks with equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum as the expected compound. So the mass is the same, but there are two peaks on the LC-MS.

I'm trying to figure out what this means. Let me think about the possibilities.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a different mass, right? Because it's a starting material before the reaction. But the question says both peaks have the same mass. So if it's a precursor, the mass would be lower. So maybe A isn't the right answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they have the same mass. But in an achiral environment, how would an LC-MS separate them? Because if the LC column is chiral, it can separate enantiomers. But the question doesn't mention a chiral column. Wait, but the question says the LC-MS is done at elevated temperature. Hmm, maybe higher temps could cause something else. Enantiomers would have the same mass, so same m/z in MS. But would they elute at different times? If the column is chiral, yes. But the question doesn't specify if the LC uses a chiral column. Wait, the problem says the crude compound is a mixture. So if it's a racemic mixture, and the LC is chiral, you'd see two peaks. But if the LC isn't chiral, the enantiomers would elute together. So I'm not sure. But the NMR shows two alpha-protons. Oh, wait, enantiomers would have the same NMR spectrum because they are not structurally different in terms of splitting. Or wait, no—they have the same environment, so their protons would be equivalent, so why are there two peaks?

Hmm, maybe not B. Let me think next.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Not sure what that means. Double coupling—like maybe some extra splitting? Or perhaps it's a term for something else. Wait, during amide bond formation, like in an SN2 reaction or something? Not sure. If it's double coupling, that might create multiple peaks. But the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling. So maybe C is about something else. Alternatively, double coupling could refer to some kind of dimerization, but that would probably change the molecular weight, making the LC-MS show a higher mass. But no, the question says both have the same mass. So maybe not C.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would elute at different times in LC. Their masses would be the same since they have the same molecular formula. So that fits the LC-MS part. Now, the NMR part: diastereomers have different environments. So for an alpha-proton, if the molecule has some stereochemistry around it, the coupling could be different. But wait, the question says both peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. So perhaps the alpha-proton is in a different environment in each diastereomer. Hmm, but how does that lead to two separate peaks in NMR?

Wait, in a diastereomeric mixture, each diastereomer would have its own set of protons. But if the NMR is taken of the crude mixture, you'd see overlapping signals. But the problem says that for the alpha-proton, there are two peaks. So maybe the two diastereomers have the same alpha-proton environment, but different elsewhere. Wait, but why would the alpha-proton split into two? Or perhaps the two diastereomers have different coupling constants, making the splitting different, but the question says that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as an explanation. So maybe it's something else.

Wait, let me think again. The NMR has two peaks for the same proton, same integral, same shift (or similar shifts), but the problem says the shifts are similar. So perhaps they are in two different environments but very close in shift. But why would that happen? If the molecule is a diastereomer, the alpha-proton might be in a slightly different environment, causing a slightly different shift. But for diastereomers, each diastereomer would have its own set of protons, so the NMR would show each as a separate peak. But if it's a mixture, unless the diastereomers are in a 1:1 ratio and their peaks are close, making it look like two separate peaks. But the integral together adds up to 1H, which is what's expected. So maybe each diastereomer contributes one H, but their shifts are so similar that they look like two separate peaks. That could explain the NMR.

So for the LC-MS, if the diastereomers are present, the LC would separate them into two peaks, same mass, different elution times. So that fits. So D seems a possibility.

Now, the other options: A is about a precursor, which has a lower mass. Since the question's LC-MS shows same mass as expected, A is unlikely. B is about enantiomers, which would only separate on chiral columns. If the LC used a chiral column, then B could cause two peaks. But the problem doesn't specify that. But the NMR would have the same shift for each enantiomer, so maybe it would show a singlet? No, wait, in a racemic mixture, the NMR would show the same peaks as a single enantiomer because the environments are identical. So in the NMR, you wouldn't see two separate peaks for the same proton. So that would make B less likely unless the NMR is not properly accounted for. But the problem states that the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, which suggests they are in different environments. Enantiomers would have the same environment, so same shift. So perhaps B is not correct.

So the best options are B, C, D. Wait, no. Let's re-examine.

Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for same alpha-proton. If the compound is a racemic mixture, each enantiomer would have the same alpha-proton environment, so the NMR would show a single peak. So why are two peaks appearing? Maybe if the coupling is considered, but the question says coupling is ruled out. So probably, the two peaks are not due to coupling. So B is unlikely.

Option D, diastereomers, might have different environments for the same proton. For example, if the alpha-carbon is a stereocenter, and the two diastereomers have different configurations at that center. Wait, but diastereomers have different configurations at one or more stereocenters. So the alpha-proton would be in a different environment. So in each diastereomer, the alpha-proton would have a slightly different chemical shift. So when you mix them, you get two separate peaks in the NMR. The integral would add up to 1H each, but the question says they integrate to 1H together. So each contributes 0.5H? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe each diastereomer has one alpha proton, and they are each present in equal amounts. So each contributes 0.5H, but when the peaks are close, you see two peaks each integrating to 0.5, totaling 1H.

But the problem states that each peak has 'roughly equal integrals' and together sum to 1H. So perhaps each is about 0.5H. So if there are two diastereomers, each has an alpha-proton, but their shifts are so close that they look like two separate peaks. That could explain the NMR.

In the LC-MS, each diastereomer would have the same molecular weight, so same mass. They would elute at different times, so two peaks of same intensity (if both are present in equal amounts). So that fits. So D seems likely.

Another thought: Could it be that the amide bond hasn't fully formed, leading to some isomerism, like different conformers? But conformers usually don't split peaks in NMR unless there's a very fast exchange. But if the exchange is slow, you'd see separate peaks. But then, in the case of an amide, maybe some cis and trans isomerism. But that would be diastereomers. So that leads back to D.

So putting it all together, the most likely answer is D: the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts, roughly equal integrals (summing to 1H), and ruling out spin-spin coupling as the cause. LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature reveals two peaks of equal intensity, both with the same mass spectrum as the expected compound. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Analysis of the Options:

**A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
A precursor would have a different molecular weight, leading to a distinct mass in the LC-MS spectrum. However, the question specifies that both peaks have the same mass as the expected compound, making this option unlikely.

**B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images and have identical physical properties, including the same NMR shifts. If the LC-MS column is chiral, enantiomers could elute as separate peaks. However, the NMR spectrum of a racemic mixture would not show two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton, as the environments of the protons in enantiomers are identical. Thus, this option does not explain the observed NMR data.

**C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
The term "double coupling" is unclear, but it likely refers to some form of splitting in the NMR spectrum. However, the question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause of the duplicate peaks. Additionally, "double coupling" would not explain the LC-MS data, as it would not result in two distinct peaks of the same mass. This makes this option unlikely.

**D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images and have different physical properties. They can elute as separate peaks in LC-MS if their physical properties differ, which aligns with the LC-MS data showing two peaks of equal intensity but different elution times. In the NMR spectrum, diastereoisomers can cause the same alpha-proton to appear as two separate peaks due to differences in their chemical environments, consistent with the observed splitting. The integrals summing to 1H also support this explanation, as each diastereomer contributes equally to the signal. This option explains both the NMR and LC-MS observations.

### Conclusion:  
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, as this accounts for both the NMR and LC-MS data.
