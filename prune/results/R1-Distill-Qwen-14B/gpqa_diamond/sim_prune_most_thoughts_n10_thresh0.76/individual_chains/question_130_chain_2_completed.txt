Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's try to think it through. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is emitted by hydrogen when an electron transitions from the second energy level to the first. But in this case, the hydrogen is neutral and it's absorbing light, so it must be in the intergalactic medium or something like that.

Wait, the absorption is happening at the Lyman alpha wavelength. But when an object has a redshift, the observed wavelength stretches. So if the quasar emits light at 1216 Angstroms (which is in the ultraviolet range), and the hydrogen cloud is at a certain redshift, the observed wavelength would be longer.

But ground-based optical telescopes can't detect ultraviolet light because the atmosphere absorbs it. So if the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is absorbed by the hydrogen, but we can only see it in optical wavelengths, the absorption must have shifted into the optical range due to redshift.

So, the quasar emits the Lyman-alpha photon at 1216 Angstroms. The hydrogen cloud at some redshift z would absorb that photon. The observed wavelength λ is given by λ = 1216 * (1 + z). But since the cloud is in front of the quasar, the quasar's light is coming through, and we see the absorption line in the quasar's spectrum. Wait, no, actually, the cloud is in the line of sight, so the quasar's light passes through it, and we see absorption lines at longer wavelengths (if the cloud is at some redshift).

But wait, the issue is whether we can detect this absorption line using optical telescopes. So the Lyman-alpha absorption is originally at 1216 Angstroms (far UV). But if the cloud is at a redshift z, the observed wavelength λ_obs = 1216*(1+z) Angstroms.

We need λ_obs to be in the optical range for ground-based telescopes to detect it. What's the optical range? I think optical is roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. Wait, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, right? So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms.

So, for the absorption line to be in the optical, λ_obs must be less than 7000 Angstroms (since higher than that is infrared, and maybe some optical telescopes can't see that? Not sure, but I think for the sake of this problem, we're assuming that the maximum wavelength that optical can detect is around 700 nm or 7000 Angstroms).

Wait, but wait, no—the Lyman-alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm, which is in the far UV). When redshifted by z, the observed wavelength is λ = 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. For this to be visible in optical, it must be <7000 Angstroms.

Wait, no: if the wavelength is redshifted, it's longer. So for the absorption line to be in the optical, which starts around 4000 Angstroms (400 nm), the redshift must be such that 1216*(1+z) >= 4000 Angstroms. Because anything less than 4000 Angstroms would be in the UV, which optical telescopes can't see.

Wait, but if the observed wavelength is λ = 1216*(1+z), and we need λ to be in the optical (400-700 nm, or 4000-7000 Angstroms), then the minimum z is when λ=4000 Angstroms.

So setting up the equation:

1216*(1 + z) = 4000

Solving for z:

1 + z = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.292

So z ≈ 2.292

Wait, but let's compute it more accurately:

4000 / 1216. Let me compute that.

1216 * 3 = 3648. 4000 - 3648 = 352. 352 / 1216 = 0.289 approx. So 3 + 0.289= 3.289. So z ≈ 2.289, so approximately 2.29.

Looking at the options, the choices are 1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3.

Hmm, 2.29 is between 1.9 and 2.4. But the question is about the lower limit. So the minimum z such that the absorption line is in the optical.

Wait, wait. Because if z is larger, λ_obs is larger (more redshifted). So if the cloud is at z where λ_obs is 4000 Angstroms, that's the lowest possible z where the line is in the optical. If z is lower, λ_obs would be smaller than 4000 Angstroms, which is in the UV, and thus not detectable by optical telescopes.

So the lower limit on z must be when λ_obs is 4000 Angstroms. So z = (4000/1216) - 1 ≈ 2.29.

Looking at the options, the closest higher option is 2.4 (option C), but wait, option D is 1.9, which is less than 2.29. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe I should consider the maximum wavelength that optical can detect. Let me think again.

If the optical range is up to about 7000 Angstroms (700 nm), then the maximum z for which λ_obs is within optical is when λ=7000 Angstroms.

So:

1216*(1 + z) = 7000

1 + z = 7000 / 1216 ≈ 5.754

z ≈ 4.754

But the question is about the lower limit, so the minimum z where the absorption line is in the optical, right?

Wait, no. The lower limit would be when the absorption line is just entering the optical range. So the line is at the edge of optical. So for the line to be in optical, it must be longer than 4000 Angstroms. So the minimum z is when the line is at 4000 Angstroms. So z is approximately 2.29.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are around that. Let me check the options again.

Options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

2.29 is between D (1.9) and C (2.4). So the lower limit is 2.29, so any z larger than that would have the absorption line in optical. So the question is about the lower limit, meaning the smallest z for which it can be detected. So the minimal z is about 2.29, so the lower limit is z greater than or equal to 2.29. So any object with z >= 2.29 can be detected.

So the options are, the closest lower possible is D) 1.9, but that's below 2.29, so with z=1.9, the wavelength would be 1216*(2.9) = 1216*2.9 ≈ let's compute that.

Wait, 1216 * 2 = 2432, 1216 * 0.9 = 1094.4. So total 2432 + 1094.4 = 3526.4 Angstroms. Which is 352.64 nm, which is in the UV. So optical telescopes can't see that. So z=1.9 is too low; the line would be in UV, undetectable.

So the minimal z is around 2.29. So the options for the lower limit must be that z must be at least approximately 2.29. Among the options, the only one higher than that is C) 2.4 and A)3, but C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So if the question is asking for the lower limit, the minimal z is 2.29, which is approximately 2.3. So the lower limit is around 2.3, but the options don't have 2.3. The closest higher option is C) 2.4.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong. The lower limit on the redshift is the smallest z such that the object can be detected. So any object with z >= 2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the question is to pick the smallest z such that it can be detected, which is z=2.29, so the lower limit is z>2.29. So the options given would have to choose the closest higher option.

But the options are C) 2.4 and D) 1.9. So 2.4 is higher than 2.29, so it's possible. But wait, perhaps the question is phrased as the lower limit on redshift. So it's the minimal z, i.e., the smallest z such that the object can be detected. So if z is larger than 2.29, the line is in optical. So the minimal z is 2.29, and the question is looking for the lower limit, so the minimal z is approximately 2.3. So the options are either 2.4 or 1.9. 2.4 is higher than 2.3, so that would be the minimal z of the options provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimal z such that the line is in the optical, meaning any higher z is also okay. So the minimal z is around 2.3. So the options given are D)1.9, which is too low, and C)2.4, which is higher, so 2.4 would be the minimal z from the options.

Wait, but let's think again. The problem says 'lower limit on the redshift of this object such that they can be detected.' So the minimal z where they can be detected is approximately 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, meaning that any object with z >= 2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is the minimal z, which is 2.29. So the options must have a choice equal to or higher than 2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, but the problem is to choose from the options, so the correct answer would be C) 2.4.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating something. Wait, perhaps the quasar's light is observed, and the absorption is at 1216*(1+z), but perhaps the quasar itself has a high redshift, and we're looking at the intergalactic medium in front of it. Hmm, but I think that's more complicated. Or maybe it's the other way around: when the quasar's light passes through hydrogen clouds with lower redshift, then the absorption line appears at a lower wavelength than the quasar's emission.

Wait, no. Let me think: the quasar emits light at 1216 Angstroms (Lyman alpha). If the hydrogen cloud is at a redshift z, then the quasar's light at 1216 Angstroms would be observed at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But wait, the quasar itself could be at a higher redshift than the cloud. So if the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar, the observed wavelength would be at a longer wavelength than 1216 Angstroms.

Wait, no, sorry, let's get this right. The quasar is behind the cloud, so the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. So the quasar's emission is at 1216 Angstroms in its own frame. The cloud, which is at redshift z_cloud, will absorb light that comes from the quasar at 1216 Angstroms in the quasar's frame, which would be observed at 1216*(1 + z_quasar) in our frame. Wait, no.

Wait, the quasar is at redshift z_q. The cloud is at redshift z_c, which is lower than z_q. So the quasar emits light at 1216 Angstroms (in quasar's frame). When this light reaches the cloud, the cloud sees the light redshifted by (1 + z_c) compared to the quasar's emission. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So from the quasar's frame, the cloud is not moving away as much. So when the quasar emits light at 1216 Angstroms, the cloud, being at a lower redshift, would see that light at a wavelength of 1216 * (1 + z_cloud). But wait, for the cloud to absorb that photon, the photon's wavelength as seen by the cloud must match the Lyman alpha wavelength of the cloud's hydrogen. So the photon emitted by the quasar must have a wavelength of 1216 Angstroms in the quasar's frame, but when it reaches the cloud, it's redshifted by (1 + z_cloud) if the cloud is moving away.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the observer's frame. The quasar emits at 1216 Angstroms (rest frame), but due to the quasar's redshift, that light is observed by us at 1216*(1 + z_q). But the cloud is at a lower redshift, so the cloud's hydrogen is at some z_cloud < z_q. The cloud's hydrogen will absorb light that has wavelength 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the observer's frame. Because the cloud is in front of the quasar, the quasar's light passes through it. So the quasar's emitted light at 1216 Angstroms would have, at the cloud's position, a wavelength stretched by (1 + z_cloud). So the quasar's light at the cloud's location is 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. The hydrogen in the cloud will absorb that light if it's at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame. So, from the observer's perspective, the absorption line occurs at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms.

But wait, the quasar's light is further redshifted because the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So when the quasar's light (emitted at 1216 Angstroms, in its own frame) reaches us, it's at 1216*(1 + z_q). But the absorption happens at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. So the absorption line we observe is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So if the quasar's redshift is z_q, then in the quasar's frame, the cloud's hydrogen is at a wavelength of 1216 Angstroms, but the quasar's emission is redshifted to 1216*(1 + z_q). So the absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the observer's frame.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. The quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So when the quasar emits light at 1216 Angstroms, by the time it reaches the cloud, the wavelength is stretched by (1 + z_cloud). So the cloud's hydrogen, which has Lyman alpha at 1216 Angstroms in its rest frame, will absorb the quasar's light if the quasar's light is at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame. So in the cloud's frame, the quasar's light arrives at 1216 Angstroms, so the quasar's emission must be at 1216/(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms in the cloud's frame. But the quasar's emission is at 1216 Angstroms in its own frame. So the quasar's frame is at a higher redshift than the cloud's.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. The original question is about the cloud's redshift, so let's consider the cloud's redshift as z.

The Lyman-alpha absorption line from the cloud is observed at wavelength λ = 1216 * (1 + z) Angstroms.

We need this λ to be in the optical range, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms.

So 4000 < 1216*(1 + z) < 7000.

We can solve for z.

First, find the lower limit when λ =4000:

1 + z = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.292

z ≈ 2.292

Similarly, when λ =7000:

1 + z =7000 /1216≈5.754

z≈4.754

So the cloud must have z in (2.292,4.754) for the absorption line to be in the optical. But the question is about the lower limit, so the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the minimal redshift must be around 2.29. So the lower limit is z>2.29. So the minimal z is approximately 2.3. So the lower limit is 2.29, which is the minimal z.

But the options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So the minimal z is 2.29, and the options have 2.4 as the next higher, so option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but the question says 'lower limit on the redshift', which is the minimal z. So any z >=2.29 is acceptable. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the minimal possible z is 2.29, so the answer would be the option just above that, which is 2.4. But maybe the options are just giving approximate values. So 2.4 is the correct choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the Lyman-alpha emission of the quasar, but that's a different scenario. But the question states that the clouds absorb the quasar's light at Lyman alpha wavelength, so the cloud's own Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, and when redshifted by z, the absorption occurs at 1216*(1+z).

Wait, maybe I should think of the quasar's light being absorbed by the cloud, so the quasar's light is at 1216 Angstroms in the quasar's frame, which is redshifted when it reaches us. So when the quasar's light is emitted at 1216 Angstroms, the cloud at redshift z will absorb it when the wavelength is 1216*(1+z) in the observer's frame.

Wait no, the cloud is at redshift z, so the quasar's light (emitted at 1216) is observed at 1216*(1 + z_q), where z_q is the quasar's redshift. The cloud, which is at z_cloud < z_q, will absorb the quasar's light. The wavelength of the quasar's light when it reaches the cloud is 1216 * (1 + z_cloud). The cloud's hydrogen will absorb this if it's at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame. So 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must equal 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame, which is not possible because 1 + z_cloud would be >1. Wait, that can't be right. I think I'm mixing up frames here.

Alternatively, let me think that the cloud's hydrogen has a rest wavelength of 1216 Angstroms. When the quasar's light passes through the cloud, the quasar's light is at a wavelength of 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the cloud's frame because the cloud is moving away. So the cloud's hydrogen will absorb that if it's at 1216 Angstroms in their own frame. So 1216*(1 + z_cloud) = 1216? That doesn't make sense. I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the quasar emits light at wavelength 1216 Angstroms (quasar's rest frame). The cloud, at redshift z, will absorb that light when the wavelength, as observed in the cloud's frame, is 1216 Angstroms. So the quasar's light, when it reaches the cloud, has a wavelength of 1216 / (1 + z) Angstroms in the cloud's frame. So to have the cloud's hydrogen absorb it, we need 1216 / (1 + z) = 1216, which implies z=0, which can't be right. So perhaps I'm getting the direction of redshift wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the cloud is in the line of sight, so the quasar's light is redshifted by the quasar's redshift, and then the cloud's hydrogen, which is at a lower redshift, would see the quasar's light at a wavelength that's redshifted relative to the cloud's frame. So perhaps the cloud's hydrogen would absorb the quasar's Lyman-alpha emission if the quasar's emission is at 1216 Angstroms in the quasar's frame, and the cloud is at redshift z_cloud. So the quasar's light, when it reaches the cloud, is at wavelength 1216 * (1 + z_cloud). The cloud's hydrogen can only absorb at 1216 Angstroms in their own frame, so 1216 * (1 + z_cloud) must equal 1216 in the cloud's frame. Which again gives z_cloud=0, which doesn't make sense. So I'm getting stuck here.

But perhaps the initial approach was correct. The absorption line in the quasar's spectrum will appear at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms in the observer's frame. So if we observe the absorption line in the optical, which is up to 7000 Angstroms, the minimal z_cloud is when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) = 4000 Angstroms. So z_cloud ≈ (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 2.29.

So among the options, the only one higher than 2.29 is option C)2.4. So the answer must be C)2.4.

Wait, but another thought: optical telescopes can't see wavelengths longer than about 700 nm (7000 Angstroms), as the atmosphere blocks longer wavelengths (infrared). So the Lyman-alpha absorption line must be within 400-700 nm (4000-7000 Angstroms). So the minimal z is when 1216*(1 + z) =4000 Angstroms → z= (4000/1216 -1)= ~2.29. So the minimal z is approximately 2.3. So the options are 2.4 and 1.9. So 2.4 is the next higher option. So the correct answer is C)2.4.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift \( z \) of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman-alpha absorption lines can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Key Information**:  
   - The Lyman-alpha wavelength in the rest frame of hydrogen is \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \).  
   - Optical ground-based telescopes can detect wavelengths in the range \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \) (400 nm) to \( 7000 \, \text{Å} \) (700 nm).  
   - The observed wavelength of the absorption line is redshifted and given by \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z) \).

2. **Condition for Detection**:  
   For the Lyman-alpha absorption line to be detectable in the optical range, the observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) must satisfy:  
   \[
   4000 \, \text{Å} \leq \lambda_{\text{obs}} \leq 7000 \, \text{Å}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + z) \), the lower limit on \( z \) occurs when \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 4000 \, \text{Å} \):  
   \[
   1216 \cdot (1 + z) = 4000.
   \]

3. **Solve for \( z \)**:  
   \[
   1 + z = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.292, \quad z \approx 2.292.
   \]  
   Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \).

4. **Evaluate the Options**:  
   The given options are:  
   - \( z = 3 \) (A)  
   - \( z = 1.2 \) (B)  
   - \( z = 2.4 \) (C)  
   - \( z = 1.9 \) (D).  

   - \( z = 1.2 \) (B) and \( z = 1.9 \) (D) are below the calculated lower limit of \( z \approx 2.29 \), meaning the absorption line would be in the ultraviolet (UV) range and undetectable by optical telescopes.  
   - \( z = 3 \) (A) is above \( z \approx 2.29 \), but it is not the minimal redshift.  
   - \( z = 2.4 \) (C) is the smallest value greater than \( z \approx 2.29 \), making it the correct choice for the lower limit.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \), and the closest option provided is \( z = 2.4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
