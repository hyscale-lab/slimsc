Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and determining how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Hmm.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs is especially good for ring-closing metathesis and cross metathesis. But wait, what does that mean for this substrate?

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait, no. Let me think. The formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)2? Wait no, pent has five carbons. Oh wait, wait, no. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl branch on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, pentane has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. If it's 3-methylpent-1-ene, then the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2. Wait, no. Let me draw it out mentally.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. For 3-methyl, the substituent is on the third carbon. So the third carbon from the left (the first is the CH2=CH). So position 3 is the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-, wait wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Let me count again. Pentane is five carbons. For 3-methylpent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, on C3, there's a methyl group. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's four carbons after the double bond. Oh wait, no, because pent-1-ene is five carb
