Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons. The energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction. What is the angle between the directions of the photons? The options are A) 74, B) 172, C) 138, D) 96.

Hmm, okay, so this is a problem about particle collisions and photon emission. I remember that when particles annihilate, they can produce photons, and since energy and momentum must be conserved, we can use those principles to find the solution.

First, let's think about the setup. An electron and a positron are moving towards each other. The electron is moving from the left (so to the right) with a Lorentz factor (γ) of 4. The positron is moving from the right (so to the left) with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate into two photons.

Wait, but Lorentz factors relate to their velocities. So, their speeds are significant fractions of the speed of light. Since both are moving along the same line (horizontal axis), the collision is head-on.

I remember that for annihilation, the total energy and momentum before the collision must equal the total after. So, the combined energy and momentum of the electron and positron must equal the sum of the energies and momenta of the two photons.

Each photon has energy E = hf, and momentum p = E/c. Since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta will add vectorially.

Wait, but in this case, both photons are moving to the right—wait, no, the problem says one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but in different vertical directions. Hmmm, that's interesting.

Wait, no: the electron is moving from the left (rightwards), the positron from the right (leftwards). So, their initial momenta are opposite in direction.

Let me try to outline the steps.

1. Calculate the total energy and momentum of the system before annihilation.

2. After annihilation, we have two photons. Each photon has energy E1 and E2, but the problem states they have the same value, so E1 = E2 = E.

3. Since photons carry momentum, and their directions are given, we can find the angles based on their momentum vectors.

Wait, but the problem says one photon is moving in upper-right and the other in lower-right. So both are in the right direction but at certain angles above and below the horizontal (x-axis).

Wait, but if both are moving to the right, their momentum vectors have components in the x-direction. But their y-components will be opposite in direction. Hmm, but wait, how can that be? Because in the initial setup, the total momentum in the vertical (y) direction is zero, so the total momentum of the photons in the y-direction must add to zero. Since the two photons have the same energy, their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction in the y-component.

Wait, but let me think about this. Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2. Photon 1 has a direction in the upper-right, so its momentum has positive y-component. Photon 2 is lower-right, so negative y-component. But since both photons have the same energy, their momenta have the same magnitude. So, the sum of their y-components would be zero. That makes sense.

So, in the y-direction, the total momentum is zero.

But wait, in the x-direction, their momenta must add up to the total initial momentum of the system.

So, perhaps I should calculate the total initial momentum and energy, then use that to find the directions of the photons.

First, let's compute the rest mass energy of the electron and posit
