Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about reactions involving mCPBA and their products when analyzed by HPLC. 

Alright, first, what's mCPBA? Oh right, meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So, when alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides. 

The problem has two reactions: Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral.

Wait, so I need to figure out what the products are from each reaction and then see how they would elute on these columns.

Let me think about the epoxidation first. For an alkene, the geometry of the starting material affects the epoxide's configuration. mCPBA adds across the double bond in an stereospecific manner, forming an epoxide. The reaction is peracid addition, which typically leads to the formation of cis epoxides because the peracid approaches the same face of the double bond. Wait, no, actually, I think it's more about the endo rule or the stereoselectivity based on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, oct-4-ene is a symmetric molecule because it's 4-octene. Wait, no, (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH3? No, wait, octene is eight carbons. So the structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH3, but for E and Z isomers, the substituents on either side of the double bond are important.

Wait, (E)-oct-4-ene would have the two substituents on opposite sides. So for oct-4-ene, the double bond is between C4 and C5. So, the E isomer would have the two higher priority groups on opposite sides. Let me imagine: the groups on C4 and C5. On each carbon, the substituents would be CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with the double bond at position 4. No, wait, for oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 but with a double bond between C4 and C5, so it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3. Wait no, that's not right because oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 but with the double bond between C4 and C5. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's more accurate to think of oct-4-ene as CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3. Wait, that would actually be 5-octene, perhaps. Hmm, maybe I should just focus on the stereochemistry.

But regardless, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific, so the geometry of the starting alkene will influence the epoxide's configuration.

Wait, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the two substituents on the double bond are on opposite sides. So when mCPBA attacks, the peracid adds to the same face, leading to a cis epoxide. Because the two starting substituents are in trans, the epoxide would form a specific diastereomer.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the product. When you epoxidize a trans (E) alkene, the resulting epoxide will have the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides of the epoxide ring, making it a trans epoxide. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think: when the alkene is E, the substituents are opposite. The epoxidation by mCPBA adds the oxygen atoms on
