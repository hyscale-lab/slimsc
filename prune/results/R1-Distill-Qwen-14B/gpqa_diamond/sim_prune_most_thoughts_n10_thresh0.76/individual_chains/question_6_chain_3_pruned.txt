Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about a particle moving in two dimensions with a specific potential, and I need to find the energy spectrum. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. The options are different expressions for energy E in terms of n_x, n_y, and some constants.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials like this, especially in two dimensions, we often use polar coordinates because the potential might have some symmetry. Let me think about the form of the potential. It's V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I can factor out kr², which gives V = kr² [1/2 + (3/2)cos²θ]. 

Wait, that simplifies to V(r, θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Let me see, the first term is ½ kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential in radial direction. The second term is (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Hmm, what kind of potential is that?

I remember that cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² [ (1 + cos 2θ)/2 ] = (1/2)kr² + (3/4) kr² (1 + cos 2θ). Wait, let me compute that more carefully.

So, (3/2) kr² cos²θ = (3/2) kr² * [ (1 + cos 2θ)/2 ] = (3/4) kr² (1 + cos 2θ). So the entire V becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4) kr² cos 2θ.

Adding the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) = 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos 2θ.

Wait, that's interesting. So the potential is a combination of a radial term and a term that depends on cos 2θ. That suggests that the potential has angular dependence at twice the angle. So perhaps the system is separable in some coordinate system, maybe not just polar coordinates.

Wait, in two dimensions, another coordinate system is the prolate spheroidal coordinates or maybe just using Cartesian coordinates. Alternatively, sometimes when there's an angular term like cos2θ, it's useful to switch to Cartesian coordinates because cos2θ = (x² - y²)/(r²), if I'm not mistaken. Let me think: in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So x² = r² cos²θ, y² = r² sin²θ. So x² - y² = r² (cos
