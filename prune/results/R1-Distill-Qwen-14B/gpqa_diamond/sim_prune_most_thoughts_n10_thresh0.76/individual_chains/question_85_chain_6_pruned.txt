Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this. I think equilibrium temperature relates to how much heat a planet absorbs from its star and how much it radiates back. The formula I recall is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Oh wait, but albedo is the same for both planets here, so that part cancels out, right?

Wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo. So when I calculate the ratio, the albedo terms would be the same for both, so they'll cancel each other. So I don't need to worry about albedo here.

Now, the star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff of 6300 K. The planets have different masses and radii, but for equilibrium temperature, I don't think mass matters directly. What matters is their distance from the star because that affects the amount of stellar flux they receive.

Wait, but the question gives me data about the RV method and transit method. Oh, right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star, which relates to the planet's mass and orbital period. The transit method measures the dip in brightness, which gives the planet's radius and orbital period. But how does this tie into the equilibrium temperature?

Hmm, equilibrium temperature is more about distance from the star. So I need to find the distance of each planet from the star. Because the formula for equilibrium temperature depends on the distance a.

So how do I find the distance? Well, the RV method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula is something like K = (v*sin i) = ( (G * (M_star) * P) / (2π) )^(-1/3) ) * (M_planet / (M_star + M_planet)) )^(2/3) ) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star))^(1/3) ). Wait, perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, I've heard that the Doppler semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) )^(1/(P * 2π)) )) Wait, maybe that's too complicated.

Wait, I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ). But perhaps a better approach is to use the formula that relates the Doppler shift (K) to the planet's orbital period (P) and the velocity.

Wait, but in the question, the Doppler shifts are given as 0.03 Å
