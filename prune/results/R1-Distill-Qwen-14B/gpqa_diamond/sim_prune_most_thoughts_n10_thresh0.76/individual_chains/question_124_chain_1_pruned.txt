Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about particles being collided in a detector and how many reach the inner walls based on their Lorentz factor. So, Lorentz factors are important in relativity, right? They tell us how much time dilation or length contraction there is for an object moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

The setup: particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls. Now, the question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds reach the walls?

Hmm. So, the key here is probably figuring out how the Lorentz factor affects the distance the particles can travel before decaying. If a higher Lorentz factor means they live longer or travel further, then more would reach the detector walls. But wait, the time experienced by the particle is different from the lab frame. So, maybe the proper time for the particle is shorter, but from our frame, it appears longer.

Wait, the particles are fast-decaying, so their lifetime is short in the lab frame. The ones that reach the detector's walls must have a lifetime long enough for them to travel the radius of the detector. So, the time the particle has to live is the proper time multiplied by the Lorentz factor, right? Or wait, actually, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So, tau_lab = gamma * tau_proper.

But wait, the particle's speed is v, so the time it can live in the lab frame is the distance (radius of detector) divided by v. Because the particle needs to travel 30 meters (the radius) before decaying. So, the time available is t = 30 m / v.

But the proper lifetime is tau_0, so the lab lifetime has to be at least tau_0. So, tau_0 <= t = 30 / v.

Wait, but if the particle's lifetime is tau_0 in its own rest frame, then in the lab frame, it's gamma * tau_0. So, for the particle to reach the detector wall, gamma * tau_0 >= 30 / v.

But wait, v is related to gamma. Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,
