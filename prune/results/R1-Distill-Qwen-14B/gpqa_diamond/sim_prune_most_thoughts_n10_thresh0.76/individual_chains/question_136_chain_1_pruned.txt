Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see. The question is about vector fields and volume integrals of their divergence. Oh right, divergence theorem maybe? Oh wait, that's Gauss's law in another form. But I'm a bit rusty on some of the details. Let me think.

The problem says the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². Oh, so its magnitude is 1/r². And it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. So I guess the vector field looks like f(r) = (something) r̂ / r². Since it's radial, the other components (like θ and φ) are zero. So f(r) = F(r) r̂, where F(r) is 1/r².

We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of f over a sphere of radius R. Wait, the divergence of a vector field. Right, divergence is a measure of how much the field is spreading out from a point. So ∇ · f is the divergence here.

Wait, but I should compute ∇ · f for this specific field. Since the field is only radial, maybe the divergence simplifies. Let me recall the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. Oh right, in spherical coordinates, the divergence is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r) + ... but since f only has a radial component, the other terms are zero. So for f = f_r(r) r̂, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r).

So substituting f_r = 1/r²: 

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ]

Let me compute that. r squared times 1/r squared is just 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇ · f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0. Oh wait, that's interesting. So the divergence of this field is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin. Because r=0 is a point where the field might not be defined, since 1/r² would go to infinity there.

But then, the question is about the volume integral over a sphere of radius R. So if the divergence is zero everywhere inside the sphere (except the origin), then the integral should be zero. Or wait, wait a second. Because the divergence is
