Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? So I should figure out all the possible states of the three spins and calculate E for each, then sum up the exponentials.

Each spin S can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them all. Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3).

Let me see... The possible states are:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

For each of these, I need to compute H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, then E = -J * H.

Wait, but let me compute H for each state. Let's go one by one.

1. All +1: H = 1*1 +1*1 +1*1 = 3. So E = -J*3.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
H = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
H = (+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
H = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1. E = J.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck that. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
S1S2: 1*(-1) = -1
S1S3: 1*(-1) = -1
S2S3: (-1)*(-1) = +1
So total H = (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1. So E = J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1. E = J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1. E=J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1. E=J.

8. All -1: H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 +1 +1 =3. E = -J*3.

Wait, so looking at these, let's count how many states have E = -3J and E= J, and any others.

From the list above:

- The first state (all +1) has E=-3J.
- The last state (all -1) has E=-3J as well? Wait, no. Wait, no. The eighth state is all -1, H = 3, so E = -J*3 = -3J. So that's two states with E=-3J.

Wait no, in state 1, all +1: H=3, E=-3J.

State 8: all -1: each product is 1, so H=3, E=-3J. So two states with H=3, E=-3J.

Wait, but wait a second—what about the states in between?

Wait, states 2 to 7: each of them has H = -1, leading to E=J.

So how many states have E=J? Let's see:

States 2,3,4,5,6,7: that's six states.

So in total, two states with E=-3J and six states with E=J.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let's recount.

Wait, checking each state:

State 1: E = -3J. One state.

Wait, no, no, earlier I thought state 1 and 8 have E=-3J. So that's two states.

And states 2-7: each has E=J. So that's 6 states with E=J.

Wait, no: in state 2, E is J. Same for states 3,4,5,6,7. So that's 6 states with E=J.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of
