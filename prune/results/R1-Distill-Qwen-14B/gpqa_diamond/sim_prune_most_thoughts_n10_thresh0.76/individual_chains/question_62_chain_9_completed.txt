Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, let me draw that out mentally. So, it looks like there's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a CH2 group that's attached to both a hydroxyl group (-OH) and another cyclohexane ring. Also, there's a carbonyl group (aldehyde) on the cyclohexane ring. So the structure is something like cyclohexane with a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to one carbon, and a CHO group on the same carbon? Or wait, maybe the aldehyde is on a neighboring carbon? No, the name suggests the aldehyde is on the same carbon as the CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the numbering starts at the aldehyde. So position 1 has the substituents: a methyl group that's substituted with hydroxy and cyclohexyl. So the structure is an aldehyde (CHO) attached to a cyclohexane ring, and on the same carbon as the aldehyde, there's a CH group which is connected to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

So the structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) substituent on the same carbon as the aldehyde. Interesting.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl (triple bond) group attached. So it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Or wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so the structure is cyclohexane with a -CH2-C≡CH group? So that's a triple bond between the two CH groups. So the starting material is cyclohexylacetylene, perhaps.

I need to figure out the reagents to convert ethynylcyclohexane into the target. Let's think about what each step would do.

Looking at the options, each has multiple steps. Let me outline the possible steps needed for the synthesis.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group and a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) group. So perhaps we need to introduce some kind of substitution or addition.

Let me think about the sequence.

First, starting from ethynylcyclohexane. So I have a triple bond attached to the cyclohexane.

What reactions can I do with an alkyne?

One possible reaction is hydration. Alkyne hydration can be done in different conditions. For example, acidic hydration (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O) gives a ketone. But wait, wait. In this case, the ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH, so if I hydrate it, I might get a ketone or an aldehyde, depending on the conditions.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane. So when you do hydration, the triple bond becomes a double bond or a single with OH groups.

Wait, no, hydration of a terminal alkyne (like ethynyl group) with HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O typically gives a ketone. Because the triple bond is R-C≡CH. Hydration would add water across the triple bond, turning it into R-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the case of a terminal alkyne R-C≡CH, hydration (acidic) would give R-CH2-CO-OH? No, wait, no. Let me think. Hydration of a terminal alkyne (like propyne) with HgSO4 in H2SO4 gives a ketone. So for propyne, HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O would give propanone (acetone). Similarly, for ethynylcyclohexane, after hydration, it would give cyclohexylaceton? Because the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So when added water, it would become CH2-C(OH)-CH3, but wait, no, the triple bond is between two carbons. Wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Hydration would add H and OH across the triple bond. So it would become cyclohexane-CH2-C(OH)CH3. Wait, that's a ketone: cyclohexylacetone? Because the carbonyl is in the middle, making a ketone.

Wait, but in the target, we have an aldehyde group. So maybe we need a way to get from a ketone to an aldehyde. Or perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a Grignard reaction or some kind of deprotonation followed by alkylation.

Looking at the options, some of the first steps involve NaNH2 and methyl chloride or ethyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent.

So perhaps the first reagent is NaNH2, methyl chloride. That would deprotonate something and then do alkylation.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane has a sp-hybridized carbon. The triple bond is between two CH2 groups. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

In that structure, the terminal alkyne (C≡CH) is a good proton donor. NaNH2 is a strong base and can deprotonate the alkyne. Deprotonating a terminal alkyne (which is acidic) gives an acetylide ion. Then, treating with methyl chloride would methylate it.

So NaNH2 would deprotonate the ethynyl group to form the acetylide, which can then react with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) to form a new bond. So the acetylide (a strong base) attacks the methyl chloride, leading to CH2-C≡C-Me group attached to cyclohexane.

Wait, but wait. The starting structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating the alkyne gives cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C⁻, which then reacts with CH3Cl. So the acetylide (nucleophilic) attacks methyl chloride, leading to cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the acetylide is at the end. Let me think: the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating the terminal H (on the C≡CH) gives cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C⁻. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react with that. The acetylide would attack the methyl, so the CH3 would add to the sp-hybridized carbon. So the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. So that's a longer chain, but wait, that's not correct. Wait, no, because the acetylide is on the end. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Me.

Wait, that would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3, but wait, the CH3 would be on the same carbon as the triple bond. So that would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, no, the triple bond is between two carbons. After deprotonation and alkylation, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting the substitution wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group adds to the acetylide, making a new carbon-carbon bond. So the triple bond was CH2-C≡CH. After deprotonation, it's CH2-C≡C⁻. Then adding CH3Cl would make CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the acetylide adds a methyl group, leading to CH2-C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that's a longer chain.

Wait a second, perhaps I should think about what each step does. Let's look at the target molecule. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to a cyclohexane ring which also has an aldehyde group.

Hmm, perhaps the first step is to form a cyclohexyl-substituted cyclohexanol or something. Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a cyclohexane ring with substituents via cyclopropane or some other ring-forming reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps are for installing a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond, which can then be subjected to further reactions.

Wait, looking at the options, all the options start with NaNH2 and either methyl chloride or ethyl chloride. So the first step is deprotonation followed by alkylation.

So, after that, the next step in option A is H2/Pd. That's hydrogenation, perhaps reducing a triple bond to a single bond. So if the first step makes a longer alkyne, then hydrogenation would make a single bond.

But wait, let me think. After the first step (NaNH2, MeCl), we have an alkyne with a methyl group attached. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Me. Then, H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So we get cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-Me. Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would add two H's across each triple bond, turning it into a single bond. Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond (alkyne) to an alkane requires a catalyst like Lindlar's or using high pressure. Wait, no, H2 and Pd would reduce the triple bond to a single bond, but maybe with a cis addition. Wait, but in any case, hydrogenation of an alkyne (triple bond) with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically reduce it to a single bond, so the triple becomes a single, adding two H's.

Wait, but that's probably not what's intended here. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, but that would require a different catalyst, like Lindlar's for cis addition.

Wait, no. Let me think: hydrogenation of a triple bond to a single bond would produce an alkane. So in the case of CH2-C≡C-Me, after hydrogenation, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-Me? But that's not possible because the triple bond is between two carbons. So the structure after hydrogenation would be CH2-CH2-CH2-Me, but that's a single bond between the two central carbons. So that would be a butyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

But the target has a ring structure, perhaps. So maybe I'm going down the wrong path.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group to the triple bond, then hydrogenate it to a single bond. But perhaps the second step is something else.

Wait, looking at the target, the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So maybe that's formed via some kind of substitution or addition.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is to form a cyclohexylmethyl alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the steps involve forming a ketone, which is then converted into an aldehyde.

Wait, another angle: the target has an aldehyde group. So perhaps the key is to form that aldehyde from a ketone via some kind of reduction or oxidation.

Wait, no, oxidation of a ketone isn't possible because ketones are already oxidized. Wait, but maybe the starting material isn't directly leading to that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis goes through a Grignard-like reaction. Let's think about another approach.

If the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps the first step is to convert the triple bond into a diol via ozonolysis, but that's probably not applicable here because the options don't show that.

Wait, looking at the options, some involve O3 and a workup. For example, option B has O3 followed by H2O and NH4OH. Ozonolysis of a triple bond? Wait, ozonolysis is usually for alkenes. But perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me go back to the target molecule. The aldehyde is on the cyclohexane, and the same carbon has a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So that suggests that perhaps the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a secondary alcohol, but wait, oxidation of alcohols with a neighboring R group typically gives ketones, not aldehydes. So maybe it's a primary alcohol being oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a secondary alcohol that is then oxidized. Alternatively, maybe there's a substitution reaction.

Wait, perhaps the first steps add a methyl group to the triple bond, making a longer chain, then hydrogenation, then some kind of epoxidation or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to form a cyclohexylmethyl group that can be further functionalized.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider each option's steps.

Starting with option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

So, first, NaNH2 would deprotonate the ethynyl group to form the acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to form a new bond. So the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-Me. Then, H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond. Assuming it's fully hydrogenated, it would become CH2-CH2-CH2-Me. But that's a single bond, so perhaps the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

Wait, but that's a straight chain. Then Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and could cause elimination, perhaps forming an epoxide or a diol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxide ring opening, but that doesn't fit here.

Alternatively, maybe the Ba(OH)2 is part of a Hofmann elimination or similar. Or perhaps it's used for elimination to form a double bond. But I don't see how that would lead to the target.

Then the fourth step is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is the typical conditions for hydration of a triple bond. But if the triple bond was already hydrogenated in step 2, this wouldn't make sense. So maybe I'm getting the steps wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of a different group. Hmm.

Let's think about option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

Wait, step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S as workup. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, breaking the molecule into carbonyl compounds. So if step 2 is hydrogenation, perhaps it's hydrogenating an alkyne to a cis double bond. Wait, no, H2 and Pd would hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds. Unless step 2 uses a different catalyst like Lindlar, which would hydrogenate triple bonds to cis double bonds.

Wait, wait, looking at the options, option C's step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That's a common catalyst for hydrogenation, which would reduce triple bonds to single bonds. So after step 2, the triple bond would be gone, replaced by a single bond. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-Me attached to cyclohexane.

Then step 3 is ozonolysis. But ozonolysis requires a double bond, so if the triple bond was hydrogenated to a single bond, there's no double bond. So perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the steps wrong. Let me think again. Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride would form an alkyne with a methyl group. So cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-Me, but that's a straight chain. So now the molecule is cyclohexylpropane.

Then step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. So ozonolysis would require a double bond. But in this case, there's no double bond, so that wouldn't work. So option C's steps don't make sense because ozonolysis can't act on a single bond. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Let me check option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Hmm, NaNH2 is a strong base. In the presence of methanol, perhaps it's used for deprotonation and then alkylation. So the alkyne is deprotonated, then reacts with methanol. Wait, but MeOH is a nucleophile. So the acetylide (from deprotonation) would attack the methyl group of methanol? Wait, but that would form a new bond. So after step 1, perhaps we get cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-OCH3? Or perhaps the alkyne becomes a ketone. Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is deprotonation and alkylation with methanol to form an ether. But I'm not sure.

Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base and used for elimination reactions, like the formation of alkynes from alkanes via dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Li in liquid NH3 is used for Birch reductions or for forming Grignard-like reactions. Hmm.

Not entirely sure about option D.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3, H2O
4. NH4OH

So step 1: Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2, then react with ethyl chloride. So the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2Cl? Or perhaps CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3? Wait, no, the ethyl chloride would provide CH2CH3 as a substituent. So the structure after step 1 would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base. Perhaps it's used for elimination, forming a double bond. So the triple bond might be converted into a double bond via elimination. Wait, but the triple bond is already there. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for dehydrohalogenation, but there's no halide here.

Wait, I'm not sure. Another possibility is that step 2 is a deprotonation to form a lithium acetylide, but that might not change much.

Alternatively, step 2 could be used for forming a Grignard reagent, but I don't see a halide here.

Then step 3 is ozonolysis. But with O3 and H2O followed by NH4OH, that's a reductive workup, which would give aldehydes or ketones from alkenes.

Wait, but if after step 2, there's a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it. But I'm not seeing how that connects to the target.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the target molecule again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane ring, and the same carbon has a CH group attached to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, which is then oxidized to a CHO group.

Alternatively, maybe the steps involve forming a diol, which is then oxidized.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexane ring with both an aldehyde and a substituted methyl group. Let's imagine that the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the other group is a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis goes through a cyclohexyl-substituted alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the initial steps add a methyl group to the triple bond, then hydrogenate it to a single bond, then perform some kind of epoxidation or dihydroxylation, followed by opening to form an alcohol.

Wait, let's think about another possibility.

Another idea: The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and an aldehyde. So perhaps the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic substitution where a cyclohexyl group is added.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is used to create a cyclohexyl-substituted group. So, maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which then undergoes some kind of nucleophilic attack.

Wait, let me think again about the steps.

Looking at option C:

Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylate the alkyne to form CH2-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but wait, with a single bond, ozonolysis isn't applicable. So perhaps this isn't correct.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, but that would require a different catalyst.

Wait, another possibility: if the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but how does that fit?

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is partial, leading to a cis double bond, and then ozonolysis would cleave it.

Wait, let's imagine that.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (CH2-C≡CH), step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride → CH2-C≡C-Me. Then step 2 is H2/Pd → which would reduce the triple bond to a single bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

But then ozonolysis wouldn't act on that.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps are different. Let me think about the target again. The target has a cyclohexane ring, and on the same carbon as the aldehyde, a CH group attached to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

So that carbon has two substituents: OH and cyclohexyl, plus the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves installing both substituents onto the same carbon and then oxidizing to form the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps are to add a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group to the same carbon, then oxidize the adjacent carbon to an aldehyde.

But how to get both substituents onto the same carbon?

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a secondary alcohol which is then oxidized to a ketone, but then I don't see how that leads to an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the target is formed via a Grignard addition. Let me think.

Another approach: The target has an aldehyde group. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ketone, then reducing it to a secondary alcohol, then oxidizing it to an aldehyde.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because oxidation of secondary alcohols gives ketones, not aldehydes.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed directly from a primary alcohol via oxidation.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Form a primary alcohol.

2. Oxidize it to an aldehyde.

But how to form a primary alcohol from the starting material.

Wait, starting from ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps we can add a hydroxyl group via hydration.

Wait, but the initial steps in the options don't directly show that.

Wait, another thought: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde and the hydroxyl. So perhaps that cyclohexyl group comes from a ring-opening reaction or some kind of substitution.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Convert the ethynyl group into a ketone.

2. Then perform some kind of nucleophilic attack to add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule is formed via the formation of a cycloalkyl group attached via an epoxide, which is then opened to form the diol, and then further processed.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a cyclohexanol group.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to think of each option's reagents and what they could do.

Looking at option C:

After step 2, H2/Pd, the triple bond becomes a single bond. So the molecule is now cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

Then step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyls. But if there's no double bond, that wouldn't work. So perhaps option C is not correct.

Option B:

Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → forms CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 → perhaps eliminates a molecule, forming a double bond. So the triple bond becomes a double bond? So CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 → CH2-C=CH-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because Li in NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for deprotonating and eliminating. Alternatively, it could be a dehydrohalogenation, but there's no halide here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's used for deprotonating and forming a more substituted alkyne. Not sure.

Then step 3: O3, H2O → cleaves the double bond.

Wait, if step 2 forms a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

So for example, if the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2CH2 after step 2, that's a single bond. That can't be.

Hmm. Maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Another approach: Perhaps the steps are designed to form a cyclohexyl group via some kind of ring-opening or substitution.

Wait, given the time I've spent, maybe I should try to find which option's reagents would give the target structure.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and an aldehyde.

So perhaps the steps involve:

1. Adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenating the alkyne to a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form a carbonyl.

4. Some kind of reaction to add the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups.

Wait, another idea: The target's substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. That could be formed via a nucleophilic substitution where a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group are added to the same carbon. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexyl group is added via a Grignard reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne and alkylate it to add a methyl group.

2. Reduce the alkyne to a double bond.

3. Ozonolyse the double bond to form a diketone or dialdehyde.

4. Perform some kind of reaction to add the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups.

Alternatively, maybe the steps are:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne.

2. Reduce the alkyne to a cis double bond.

3. Perform ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups.

4. Perform a conjugate addition or similar to add substituents.

But I'm not making progress. I'll try to think of each option's possible outcome.

Option A:

Steps:

1. NaNH2, MeCl → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd → reduces triple bond to single bond: CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. Ba(OH)2 → strong base, possibly elimination or epoxidation. Maybe it's a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's for ketones. Alternatively, it could induce elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is often used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or in the epoxide ring opening.

Wait, after step 2, the molecule is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination if there's a suitable leaving group, but in this case, the molecule is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-Me, which doesn't have a leaving group. So I'm not sure what Ba(OH)2 would do here. Maybe it's a Birch reduction? Unlikely.

Hmm.

Then step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → this is the typical conditions for hydration of a triple bond, but the triple bond was already hydrogenated in step 2. So perhaps this step isn't applicable. So option A doesn't seem correct.

Option D:

Steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → deprotonate the alkyne, then react with methanol. So the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-OCH3.

Wait, but that would form an ether group. So the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-OCH3.

Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3 → strong base, perhaps for elimination or deprotonation. Maybe forms a Grignard reagent, but without a halide, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it deprotonates the ether to form an alkoxide, but that's not typically done with Li in NH3.

Not sure about this step.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. But the molecule has a triple bond (≡). So ozonolysis might not act on that.

Alternatively, maybe the Li in NH3 step converts the triple bond into a double bond, which would then be cleaved by ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is deprotonation and elimination, turning the triple bond into a double bond. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C=CH-OCH3.

Then step 3: ozonolysis of the double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave the C=C into carbonyl groups.

So, for example, the structure would break into two parts, each with a carbonyl group.

But I'm not sure how that leads to the target, which has a cyclohexyl group and an aldehyde.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but maybe I should make an educated guess based on the possible steps.

Finally, looking at the target, it seems like the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol. So perhaps the steps involve installing a primary alcohol, then oxidizing it.

Looking at the options, the steps involving H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O would hydrate a triple bond to a ketone, but to form an aldehyde, perhaps a different condition is needed, like catalytic hydrogenation to an alkene followed by oxidation.

Wait, another idea: To form an aldehyde, perhaps the starting triple bond is converted into an alkyne, then into an alkene via hydrogenation, then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate and alkylate the triple bond with a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Perform Baeyer-Villiger oxidation to form a ketone.

4. Then perform some kind of cyclopropanation or addition.

But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, considering all the options, option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd → reduces to CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but without a double bond, this wouldn't work.

So that's probably incorrect.

Looking at option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → forms an ether group.

2. Li/NH3 → perhaps forms a Grignard-like species, but without a halide, I don't know.

3. O3 → can't act on triple bond.

So perhaps not.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress, but perhaps I should go with option C.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the target is formed via a conjugate addition after forming a carbonyl.

Wait, if after ozonolysis, we have two carbonyl groups, then perhaps one is oxidized to an aldehyde, and the other is further modified to add the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne.

2. Reduce the alkyne to a cis double bond (using Lindlar's catalyst, but the options don't show that).

3. Ozonolyse the double bond to form two carbonyl groups.

4. React one of the carbonyls with a Grignard reagent to form an alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Another thought: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached as a substituent. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a new ring via some kind of cyclopropanation or other ring-forming reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexyl group is added via a substitution reaction, such as using a Grignard reagent.

Wait, but the options don't show any Grignard reagents. They show things like Li in NH3 and NaNH2, which are bases.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me look again.

Option C steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylate the alkyne to CH2-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd → reduce triple bond to single bond: CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but without a double bond, this can't work. So perhaps this is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is using a different catalyst to hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond, but the options say H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which typically fully hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds.

So I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option C, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the target molecule again. It has an aldehyde and a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon. So perhaps the steps are:

1. Form a cyclohexyl-substituted alcohol.

2. Oxidize the alcohol to an aldehyde.

3. Ensure the cyclohexyl group is attached correctly.

Wait, but how to form the cyclohexyl-substituted alcohol from the starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, and then a cyclohexyl group is added via a nucleophilic attack, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. I think I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the options, the correct sequence likely involves adding a methyl group, hydrogenating the triple bond, then performing ozonolysis to form a carbonyl which becomes the aldehyde. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde and hydroxyl. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a cyclohexyl group via a Grignard or similar addition to a carbonyl.

Wait, if after step 3, ozonolysis forms a carbonyl group, then perhaps a Grignard reagent is added to form an alcohol, which upon oxidation gives the aldehyde.

Looking at option C again: the fourth step is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination or epoxidation. Alternatively, it's used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids.

But I'm not connecting this to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate to a single bond.

3. Ozonolyse (but no double bond, so this is unlikely).

Hmm.

I think I've thought about this as much as I can. I'll go with option C as the correct answer, but I'm not entirely confident.


The target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. This substituent is a CH group attached to both a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a cyclohexyl group, and the same carbon also bears an aldehyde (-CHO) group. The synthesis begins with ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring with a terminal ethynyl (-C≡CH) group.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to add a methyl group, resulting in cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡C-Me.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Reduces the triple bond to a single bond, yielding cyclohexane-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-Me.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly causing elimination or epoxidation. However, the molecule at this stage lacks a suitable leaving group for elimination, making this step unclear.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Hydration of a triple bond, but the triple bond was already reduced in step 2. This step is redundant and does not lead to the target molecule.

**Conclusion**: Option A does not provide a plausible pathway to the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal alkyne and alkylates it with ethyl chloride, resulting in cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡C-CH₂CH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or deprotonation. However, the role of this step is unclear, as no halide is present for dehydrohalogenation.
3. **O₃, H₂O**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the molecule at this stage has a single bond from the triple bond reduction. This step is not applicable.
4. **NH₄OH**: A reductive workup for ozonolysis, but since ozonolysis was not feasible in step 3, this step is also redundant.

**Conclusion**: Option B does not provide a plausible pathway to the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal alkyne and alkylates it with methyl chloride, resulting in cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡C-Me.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Reduces the triple bond to a single bond, yielding cyclohexane-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-Me.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl compounds. However, the molecule at this stage has a single bond, making this step inapplicable.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or oxidation. However, its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

**Conclusion**: Option C does not provide a plausible pathway to the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the terminal alkyne and reacts with methanol, potentially forming an ether group, resulting in cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡C-OCH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or deprotonation. However, the role of this step is unclear, as no halide is present for dehydrohalogenation.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the molecule at this stage has a triple bond. This step is not applicable.
4. **NH₄OH**: A reductive workup for ozonolysis, but since ozonolysis was not feasible in step 3, this step is also redundant.

**Conclusion**: Option D does not provide a plausible pathway to the target molecule.

### Final Answer:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly lead to the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible, despite the inconsistencies in the steps.
