Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. So I think that means it's Li-6, because Lithium normally has 3 protons. Wait, no, wait. Let's think: Li has atomic number 3, so the isotope with 3 neutrons would have mass number 3+3=6. So X is Li-6, right? Or wait, no. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, wait. Let me get this straight.

Lithium has an atomic number Z of 3, which means 3 protons. The isotope with 3 neutrons would be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6. So the mass number A is 6. So the atomic mass would be that of Lithium-6.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is 0.96 times the speed of light, so we're dealing with relativistic effects here. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just kinetic energy but the total energy, which includes rest mass energy.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the question says the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, so I think they're asking for the total energy of the nucleus. Because in particle accelerators, the energy given to the particles is usually their kinetic energy, but in some contexts, it's the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic). Or wait, I think in high-energy physics, the energy given is the kinetic energy, but I might be wrong. Wait, no, maybe the question is asking for the total energy, because in colliders, the particles are accelerated to a certain energy which is their total energy. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh, wait, no, in accelerators, the energy is often given as the kinetic energy, but sometimes as the total energy. I'm not entirely sure, so maybe I should proceed with the total energy.

But wait, let's think about the relativistic equations. The total energy E is gamma
