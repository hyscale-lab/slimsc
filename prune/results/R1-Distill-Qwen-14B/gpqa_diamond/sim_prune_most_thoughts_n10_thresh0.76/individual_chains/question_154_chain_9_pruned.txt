Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out which compound it is based on the spectral data. Let me think through this carefully.

The question says that there's a white solid in a bottle, and the chemist gathered some spectral data. The options are four different compounds, all chloro-substituted aromatic compounds with various functional groups.

Let me start by looking at the mass spectrometry (MS) data first. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the highest abundance (100%). There's also a peak at m/z 158 with 32% abundance. So the molecular ion is 156, and a fragment is at 158. Hmm, that's interesting. Wait, usually, the molecular ion is the highest, but sometimes if there's a fragment that's more abundant, that's a clue. But in this case, the molecular ion is at 156, and a fragment is at 158. That suggests maybe a molecular ion plus some addition, but I'm not sure yet. Maybe I should think about the molecular formula.

Looking at the IR data: a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1, which usually indicates an -OH or -NH stretch. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 points towards a carbonyl group. So, a carbonyl, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, acid, ester, or something like that.

Now the 1H NMR: 11.0 ppm singlet (s, 1H) is a strong indicator. That's a broad peak, but in NMR, a singlet at 11 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. But wait, in the NMR, it's a singlet, so maybe it's an aldehyde? Because in carboxylic acids, the -OH is usually broad and might integrate as 2H? No, wait, no. Wait, in a carboxylic acid, the -OH is a broad peak, but in the NMR spectrum provided, the 11.0 ppm is a singlet for 1H. So that suggests maybe an aldehyde, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). Aldehydes typically appear around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But 11 is a bit high for that. Alternatively, the proton could be a carboxylic acid -OH, but that's usually a broad peak, not a sharp singlet. Oh wait, maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde, and the aldehyde is meta or para to something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl group.

Wait, looking at the NMR data again: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) is probably an aldehyde proton because a carboxylic acid's -
