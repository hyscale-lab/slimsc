Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct structure of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

The question provides FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different organic compounds, all of which seem to have a carboxylic acid group and some branching in the carbon chain.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The broad absorption around 3000 cm-1 is likely due to O-H stretching, which is common for alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since the compound has a COOH group, this makes sense. The strong peak at 1700 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, which aligns with the carboxylic acid as well. That's consistent across all options, so FTIR doesn't narrow it down much yet.

Now onto the 1H NMR. The key points here are the absence of vinyl hydrogens and the splitting patterns of certain signals.

No vinyl hydrogens mean there are no double bonds or aromatic structures, which fits because all the options are saturatedâ€”no rings or alkenes.

Looking at the splitting patterns:
- One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets.
- Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

I need to think about what these splitting patterns imply. Splitting in NMR arises from neighboring protons. Each neighboring set of protons splits the signal into multiple peaks. The order of splitting (like doublet of doublets, etc.) depends on the number of neighboring protons and their coupling.

Let's think about each option and their structures.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So, the structure is something like (CH3)(C2H5)C-C(C2H5)CH2COOH. Wait, maybe it's (CH3)CH(C2H5)CH(C2H5)CH2COOH. Wait, no, the formula seems to have two CH groups each attached to C2H5. Let me parse it correctly.

Wait, each of the two central carbons has two substituents: one is CH3 and the other is C2H5? Or perhaps each has a CH group attached to C2H5 and another group.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

The main chain is something like CH2CH2... but perhaps I should draw each structure.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
So, this would be a four-carbon chain? Let me see:

The structure is CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. Wait, so the two inner carbons each have a CH attached to a methyl group (CH3). So each of those carbons is connected to a CH3 and a CH2 group perhaps. So, the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH. Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)
