Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question says that cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Then product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to make product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, which gives product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. The options are from A to D: 6, 8, 10, 7.

Hmm, I think I'll need to break down each step and see what reactions are happening here.

First, cyclohexanone reacting with bromine. I remember that cyclohexanone has a ketone group. Bromine addition to ketones... Oh wait, I think that's the benzoin condensation or maybe it's an addition reaction. Or wait, no, wait. When ketones react with bromine, I think it's a halohydrin formation. Or maybe it's a bromination via some other mechanism. Wait, what's the reaction of ketones with bromine? Let me think. Oh right, when ketones are treated with bromine (Br2) in a solution like aq. NaOH, it's the haloform reaction. But wait, no, the haloform reaction is when a methyl ketone reacts with excess ICl or something similar. Wait, cyclohexanone is not a methyl ketone; it's a cyclic ketone. So maybe it's an addition reaction.

Wait, maybe it's an alpha bromination. Oh, wait, another possibility: cyclohexanone can undergo enol formation, and bromine can add across the double bond, but that might not be the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the bromine adds to the carbonyl group. Let me think. Carbonyl addition reactions: when you add Br2 to a ketone, perhaps it's an example of the Dieckmann reaction? Or maybe it's a dibromination. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromohydrin formation. Or perhaps it's an addition of Br- in some way.

Wait, maybe I should think about the conditions. The first step is treating cyclohexanone with bromine, forming product 1. I think that bromine (Br
