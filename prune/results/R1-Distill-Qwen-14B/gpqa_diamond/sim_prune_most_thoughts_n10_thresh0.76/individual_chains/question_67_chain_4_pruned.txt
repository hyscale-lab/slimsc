Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, the first electron has l1=1, the second has l2=1. The total angular momentum quantum number is l=2, and m is -1.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. So, I'm measuring each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction and want the probability that both are -ħ.

Hmm, okay. I remember that for angular momentum coupling, the state is a combination of the individual states. Let's think about how the states combine. 

Each electron is in a p orbital, which has l=1. So each has m values of -1, 0, +1. When you combine two l=1 states, the possible total L can be 0, 1, or 2. In this case, the total state is for L=2 and m=-1.

Wait, but what does the state |1,1,2,-1> look like? I think it's a combination of all possible ways to get L=2 and m=-1 from two l=1 states. So the state would be a linear combination of states where the individual m's add up to -1. Since m1 + m2 = m_total, which here is -1. So possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0), (0,-1). Because 1 + (-2) isn't possible because each m can only be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, no, the first particle has m1 and the second has m2. So for their sum to be -1, possible combinations are m1 = -1 and m2=0; m1=0 and m2=-1. Are there any others? No, because 1+ (-2) isn't allowed, so those are the only two possibilities.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a combination of these two states: |1, -1> ⊗ |1, 0> and |1, 0> ⊗ |1, -1>. But wait, how is this combined?

Hmm, I think the total state is a sum of all possible combinations that give L=2 and m=-1. So the state is normalized. Let me think about how the states are combined. I remember that when you couple two angular momenta, you can use Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. But I'm not too familiar with them. Alternatively, perhaps the state is a specific combination.

Wait, but perhaps the state |1,1,2,-1> is normalized such that it's the sum of |m1= -1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, each multiplied by some coefficient. But what are the coefficients?

Wait, another approach: the state |1,1,2,-
