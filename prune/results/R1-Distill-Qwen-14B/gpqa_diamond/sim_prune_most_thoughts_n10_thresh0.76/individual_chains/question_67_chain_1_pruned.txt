Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the problem again.

We have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>. So, l₁ and l₂ are both 1 for each electron. The total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z for each electron. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ.

Hmm. So, each electron's Lz component can be measured. Since their spins are ignored, we're only considering their orbital angular momentum. For a p orbital, l=1, so each Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ. So each electron has possible m values of -1, 0, +1. But in this coupled state, the total m is -1.

Wait, but when we couple two angular momenta, the total m is the sum of m₁ and m₂. So, m = m₁ + m₂. And in this case, m is -1.

So, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. I remember that when combining two angular momenta, the possible total m values range from -(l₁ + l₂) to +(l₁ + l₂), in integer steps. Since l₁ and l₂ are 1 each, their sum can be 2, so l can be 2, 1, or 0. Here, the total l is 2, so the maximum m is 2, and the minimum is -2. But in this specific state, m is -1.

So, the state is a combination of all possible pairs of m₁ and m₂ that add up to m=-1.

Wait, but the problem says to find the probability that both L₁z and L₂z are -ħ. So L₁z eigenvalues are m₁ * ħ, and L₂z eigenvalues are m₂ * ħ. So for both to be -ħ, m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1. Because m₁ is the z-component of the first electron, m₂ for the second.

So for the joint measurement, m₁ = m₂ = -1. So m_total = m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2. But in our state, the total m is -1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> has m=-1, which arises from all possible pairs of m₁ and m₂ that sum to -1.

Wait, let me think. The state with l=2 and m=-1 is a combination of all possible m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:
(-1, 0)
(0, -1)
(1, -2) → Wait, but m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1, so m2 can
