Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom transitions, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, transitions between states are governed by the selection rules. Dipole transitions are the most common, so I should think about the selection rules for those.

The standard selection rules for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen are: 
- Δl = ±1 (change in angular momentum by one unit)
- Δm = 0, ±1 (change in magnetic quantum number by 0, 1, or -1)
- Δn can be any integer, but in practice, it's limited by the energy considerations.

So starting from |3,0,0>, which has n=3, l=0, m=0.

The first transition needs to go to a state with l=1 because Δl must be ±1. So from l=0 to l=1. So the first state after the first transition must be |2,1,m>, because n has to drop by 1 (since it's a two-photon decay, or two transitions). Wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem says it decays via two dipole transitions. So each transition is a single photon emission, right? So two transitions mean going from 3 to something, then to 1.

Wait, so first transition is from n=3 to n=2, then from n=2 to n=1, each time changing l by ±1.

So initial state is |3,0,0>, first transition must go to a state with l=1 and n=2. Because from l=0 (s orbital), you can only go to l=1 (p orbital). So the possible states after first transition are |2,1, m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Then the second transition goes from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>. Because from l=1, you can go to l=0, so the second transition must change l by -1.

So what are the possible m values after the first transition? Let's think.

First transition: n=3→2, l=0→1. So m can change by 0, +1, or -1. So initial m=0, so after first transition, m can be -1, 0, +1.

Then, in the second transition, from n=2→1, l=1→0. So m must change by 0, +1, or -1. But since the final state has m=0, let's see.

The initial state for the second transition is |2,1,m>, and the final is |1,0,0>. So the Δm for the second transition is 0 - m = m_final - m_initial. So m_final is 0, so m_initial can be 0, +1, or -1. Because Δm can be 0, ±1. So for example, if m_initial is 0, then Δm is 0, which is allowed. If m_initial is +1, then Δm is -1, which is allowed. If m_initial is -1, Δm is +1, allowed as well.

So any m in the first step is allowed as far as the selection rules are concerned. Now, the question is about the possible transition routes and their probabilities.

But the options given are specific. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 →1,0,0. And probability 1/3.

Option B: 3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option C: 3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option D: (I think it's a typo, maybe it's |3,0,0> →|2,1,0> →1,0,0>. And probability 2/3.

Wait, the given options are:

A) 3→2, m=0 then 2→1, m=0. Probability 1/3.

B) 3→2, m=1 then 2→1, m=0. Probability 1/4.

C) 3→2, m=-1 then 2→1, m=0. Probability 1/4.

D) I think maybe the first transition is to m=0, then to m=0, but I'm not sure. The option says 'D) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 2/3'.

So the question is, which of these transition paths is possible, and what's the probability.

Wait, but dipole transitions have certain probabilities. The transition probability depends on the matrix elements of the dipole operator between the states. The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1m}, where Y are the spherical harmonics. So the matrix element for transition from |n1 l1 m1> to |n2 l2 m2> is proportional to <n2 l2 m2 | r Y_{1m'} |n1 l1 m1>.

But I think that the transition is allowed only if certain conditions are met, which we already considered (Δl=±1, Δm=0,±1).

But the crucial point is, the probability depends on the square of the matrix element. The matrix element itself depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining the angular momenta.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is non-zero only when m2 = m1 + q, where q is the m of the dipole operator. The dipole operator has components with m' = -1, 0, +1.

So when a transition occurs, the change in m (Δm) is equal to the m component of the dipole operator. So the dipole operator can cause a transition where m changes by -1, 0, or +1.

So for the first transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>, since the initial m is 0, the final m can be -1, 0, +1.

Similarly, in the second transition from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>, the change in m is (0 - m). So since the dipole operator can contribute m' of -1, 0, +1, the allowed Δm for the second transition is:

0 - m = q, where q is -1, 0, +1.

So 0 - m = -1 → m=1

0 - m = 0 → m=0

0 - m = +1 → m= -1

So for the second transition to reach m=0, the m in the intermediate state must be 1, 0, or -1.

So all three possible m states in the intermediate step are allowed, but the problem is about the probabilities of each path.

Wait, but the question is about the overall transition probability, which is the sum of the probabilities of all possible paths. But the options are considering specific paths and their individual probabilities.

Wait, but I think the question is asking which transition paths are possible. Each option gives a specific path and the corresponding probability. So the options are about whether each possible path is allowed (based on selection rules) and whether the probability is correctly given.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the only possible path, given that the two transitions must have certain m changes.

Wait, but in any case, let's think about the possible transitions.

First transition: |3,0,0> → |2,1,m>, m can be -1, 0, +1.

Second transition: each of these can go to |1,0,0>.

So all three paths are possible, but the probabilities for each might be different.

The question is about the overall transition probability, but the options each present a specific path and a probability. So perhaps the question is about which path is allowed, and what is the probability associated with that path.

Wait, but the question says the decay occurs via two dipole transitions and asks about the transition route and the corresponding probability.

So all three paths (m= -1, 0, +1) are possible, but the question is probably about the branching ratio or the probability for each individual path.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about which of these options is a correct possibility, and what is the probability of that specific path.

So let's think about the possible m transitions.

In the first transition, the change in m is from 0 to m, which can be -1, 0, +1.

In the second transition, the change is from m to 0, so m can be -1, 0, +1, as we saw.

But the problem is that for each transition, the change in m must be ±1, 0. So the product of the allowed changes.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct transition paths are those that have m=0 in the intermediate state.

Wait, let's think about the possible m values.

First transition: initial m=0, so possible m in intermediate state are -1, 0, +1.

Second transition: from each of those m's, can you reach m=0?

Yes, because Δm can be -1, 0, +1.

So, for example:

If the first m is 1, then the second transition would require Δm = -1.

If first m is 0, second transition Δm=0.

If first m is -1, second transition Δm=+1.

So all three are allowed.

Now, the question is about the probabilities.

I think the transition probabilities depend on the square of the matrix elements, which involve the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and other factors.

I recall that for hydrogen transitions, the probability of a transition depends on the square of the integral of the wavefunctions and the dipole matrix elements.

The matrix element for the dipole transition can be non-zero only if certain angular momentum conditions are met. The integral involves integrals of spherical harmonics, and these integrals are zero unless certain conditions are met.

The matrix element for dipole transitions is proportional to <n' l' m' | Y_{1}^{m} |n l m>.

Which is non-zero only if m' = m + q, where q is the m-component of the dipole operator.

Wait, but the dipole operator has components Y1^m where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So for each transition, the change in m (Δm) is equal to the m of the dipole component used.

So for each transition, the change in m is either -1, 0, or +1.

So for the first transition, from m=0 to m', the change is Δm = m' - 0 = m', which must be either -1, 0, +1. So m' can be -1, 0, +1.

In the second transition, the change is Δm = 0 - m' = -m'. So this change must also be -1, 0, +1.

Which implies that m' can be 1, 0, -1.

So all three paths are possible.

But the question is about the probabilities of each path.

I think the probability of each possible intermediate m is determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients involved.

Wait, the transition amplitude from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m> is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1. But wait, in this case, the initial state is l=0, and the dipole operator has l=1. So the Clebsch-Gordan factors would be involved in adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The transition probability from |n1 l1 m1> to |n2 l2 m2> is proportional to | <n2 l2 m2 | e r |n1 l1 m1> |², where e is the charge and r is the position operator.

The position operator in spherical coordinates is r = r Y_{10} (but actually, r has components in all m's, but spherical harmonics have m as the angular momentum component).

Wait, the dipole operator can be written in terms of spherical harmonics. So the matrix element for the dipole transition is non-zero only when the angular momentum selection rules are satisfied.

But perhaps more importantly, the probability of each transition (each path) depends on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining the initial angular momenta.

Wait, another thought: the probability for each possible m in the intermediate state is determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the addition of l=0 and l=1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l1=0 and l2=1 to get l=1.

Wait, when you add two angular momenta, J1 and J2, the possible total J values range from |J1-J2| to J1+J2 in integer steps.

In this case, the initial angular momentum is l1=0, and the dipole operator has angular momentum l=1.

So the product of the spherical harmonics Y_{0}^{0} and Y_{1}^{m} would result in a total angular momentum that can be l=1 (since 0+1=1).

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l1=0 and l2=1 to get l=1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 would be non-zero only for m_total = m1 + m2.

Since Y_{0}^{0} is just a constant, the product Y_{0}^{0} Y_{1}^{m} is proportional to Y_{1}^{m}.

So the expansion in terms of Y_{L}^{M} would have L=1, since 0 and 1 can combine to 1.

So the amplitude for each m is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 and m.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 are:

For m=1: coefficient is 1 (since Y_{1}^{1} is just Y_{1}^{1} from the dipole operator.

Wait, maybe more accurately, the CG coefficients are:

When combining l1=0 (so m1=0) and l2=1:

The possible total l is 1.

The possible m values are -1,0,+1.

The CG coefficients can be found, but for l1=0, the coefficients are simple because any coupling with l1=0 would just pick out the m component.

So the CG coefficients for l=1, m=1: comes from m2=1.

Similarly, m=0 comes from m2=0.

m=-1 comes from m2=-1.

But since the initial state has m=0, when you apply the dipole operator which can have m' = -1, 0, +1, the resulting state can have m= -1, 0, +1.

Wait, perhaps the amplitude for each m is determined by the CG coefficient for that m.

Let me think. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l1=0 (m1=0) and l2=1 (m2= m') to get l=1, m = m' + 0 = m'.

So the CG coefficient is 1 for each m', because when l1=0, there's no addition—so the state |1, m'> is just proportional to Y_{1}^{m'}, so the CG coefficient is 1.

Wait, perhaps this is an over-simplification. But if that's the case, the amplitude for each m' would be 1, meaning that each m' has equal probability.

Wait, but let's think about the actual Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this case.

The CG coefficient for adding l1=0 and l2=1 to get l=1 and m.

The formula for CG coefficients is:

< l1 m1, l2 m2 | L M >.

But when l1=0, m1=0, the state is just |0,0>.

So the CG coefficient for combining |0,0> and |1, m2> to get |1, M> is non-zero only when M = m2.

In that case, the CG coefficient is simply 1/sqrt(2(1)+1)}? Wait, no, the normalization comes into play.

Wait, actually, the CG coefficients for coupling l1=0 and l2=1 to L=1 are as follows:

For each m from -1 to +1, the CG coefficient is 1, because Y_0^0 * Y_1^m = N Y_1^m, where N is a normalization factor.

Wait, but wait, the spherical harmonics are orthonormal, so when you multiply Y_{0}^0 (which is 1/sqrt(4π)) with Y_{1}^m, you get (1/sqrt(4π)) Y_{1}^m. So when you express this in terms of Y_{L}^M, you only have the L=1 terms.

So the expansion of Y_{0}^0 Y_{1}^m is (1/sqrt(4π)) Y_{1}^m.

So the CG coefficient is 1 in this case, because the product is simply proportional to Y_{1}^m.

Thus, the amplitude for each m is 1, but normalized.

Wait, no, because the expansion would be:

Y_{0}^0 Y_{1}^m = (1/sqrt(4π)) (1/sqrt(4π)) ) * Y_{1}^m = (1/(4π)) Y_{1}^m.

Wait, but when you express this as a sum over L=1 and M=m, the coefficients are 1, because Y_{0}^0 is a constant.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the normalization. The product Y_{0}^0 Y_{1}^m has a norm, but when you project onto Y_{1}^M, the coefficients are 1 for M = m, and 0 otherwise.

So the CG coefficients for l1=0, m1=0 and l2=1, m2=m' is 1 for M = m'.

So the amplitude for each m' is 1, but the normalization factor would be sqrt( (2L+1)/(4π) ) ) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. The first transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m> has a probability proportional to the square of the matrix element.

The matrix element is proportional to <2,1,m | Y_{1}^q | 3,0,0>.

Where q is the m of the dipole component (q = -1, 0, +1).

Wait, but the dipole operator in spherical coordinates has components proportional to Y_{1}^{-1}, Y_{1}^0, Y_{1}^1.

So the matrix elements are non-zero only when the angular momentum conditions are met.

The integral <2,1,m | Y_{1}^q | 3,0,0> is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=0 and l=1 (dipole) to get l'=1.

Wait, but I'm not making progress with this approach. Maybe another thought: the probability for each m in the intermediate state is the same, so each has a 1/3 chance.

Wait, why? Because from |3,0,0>, the transition can go to |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,+1>, each with the same probability.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me think about the possible matrix elements.

The dipole operator has three components, so each component would contribute to a different m.

The matrix elements for each component would involve integrating Y_{1}^q multiplied by the initial and final states.

But the initial state has l=0 and m=0, so Y_{0,0}, which is a constant.

The final state in the first transition is Y_{1,m}.

So the matrix element is:

<2,1,m | e r Y_{1}^q |3,0,0>.

Wait, the position operator r in spherical coordinates can be expressed in terms of Y_{1}^m, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the components.

But another approach is to note that the transition probability is proportional to the square of the integral of Y_{1}^q (from the dipole) multiplied by Y_{1, m} (the final state) and Y_{0,0} (the initial state).

So the integral is ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,q} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

But Y_{0,0} is 1/(sqrt(4π)), so the integral becomes (1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,q} dΩ.

Which is (1/(sqrt(4π))) * (sqrt(4π)/(2l+1)) )) * Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

Wait, perhaps using the properties of spherical harmonics, the integral ∫ Y_{l2 m2}^* Y_{l1 m1} Y_{l3 m3} dΩ is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <l1 m1, l3 m3 | l2 m2>.

In our case, l1=1 (from dipole), m1=q. The initial state is l=0, m=0. The final state is l=1, m=m'.

So the integral becomes ∫ Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, q} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

This is proportional to the CG coefficient <0,0; 1,q | 1, m'>.

The CG coefficients for this combination are non-zero only when m' = q + 0 → m' = q.

So the integral is non-zero only when m' = q.

So for each q, the integral is non-zero only when m' = q. Therefore, the matrix element is non-zero only when m' = q.

Which means that the dipole component q determines the m' of the intermediate state.

So for the first transition, the possible m's are determined by the dipole component q.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think again.

The first transition is |3,0,0> → |2,1, m>.

The matrix element is <2,1,m | Y_{1}^q |3,0,0>.

Which is non-zero only if m = q, because m_initial is 0, and the dipole's m is q. So, m_final = 0 + q.

So the allowed m's are q = -1, 0, +1 → m = -1, 0, +1.

So the transition can occur via any of the three dipole components, each leading to a different m.

But the probability for each path depends on the square of the matrix element. So the probability for each m is proportional to |<2,1,m | Y_{1}^q |3,0,0>|², where q = m.

So let's compute this.

Each matrix element is proportional to the CG coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1, m = q.

As we discussed earlier, the CG coefficients for this are 1. So each matrix element is proportional to 1.

Therefore, the square of the matrix element is the same for each m, so each possible m' has the same probability.

Wait, but that can't be right because the dipole operator's components have different normalizations.

Wait, the spherical harmonics Y_{1}^m have different normalizations. Specifically, Y_{1}^m = (-1)^m sqrt( (3/(4π)) ) (something with sinθ and e^{iφ}).

The integral of Y_{1}^m Y_{1}^m* Y_{0}^0 would involve the product of the Y's.

Wait, perhaps the matrix elements for each m are not the same. Let me compute the integral.

The integral is:

∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,q} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Which is:

(1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,q} dΩ.

Because Y_{0,0} is 1/(sqrt(4π)).

Now, the integral ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,q} dΩ is zero unless m = -q, because the product Y_{1,m} Y_{1,q} can only have terms with angular momentum up to 2, but here Y_{0,0} is being multiplied.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The product Y_{1,m} Y_{1,q} can be expressed as a sum over L and M, and when multiplied by Y_{0,0}, only the M=0 terms survive.

Wait, perhaps using the properties of spherical harmonics, the integral ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,q} Y_{0,0} dΩ is zero unless m + q = 0, because Y_{0,0} is the only term that can contribute when M=0.

Wait, no. Wait, the product Y_{1,m} Y_{1,q} can be expanded in terms of Y_{L, M} where M = m + q, and L can be |1-1| to 1+1, i.e., 0,1,2.

When you multiply this product by Y_{0,0}, which is Y_{0,0}, you're projecting onto M=0. So the integral is non-zero only when m + q = 0 → q = -m.

But in the first transition, the dipole component is q, and the m' is q.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled up here, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the possible transitions and their probabilities.

Each possible dipole component (q = -1, 0, +1) contributes to a transition to m' = q.

The transition probability for each q is proportional to the square of the corresponding matrix element.

So the probability for each m' is proportional to |<2,1,m' | Y_{1}^{m'} |3,0,0>|².

But what is this value?

Wait, perhaps the matrix elements are all the same, so each m' has the same probability.

If that's the case, then each m' has a 1/3 chance.

But that can't be right because the spherical harmonics have different normalization factors.

Wait, Y_{1, m} has a normalization factor of sqrt(3/(4π)) for each m except m=0, which has sqrt(3/(8π)).

Wait, no, actually, the normalization for Y_{1,m} is sqrt( (3)/(4π) ) for m=0, and sqrt( (3)/(8π) ) multiplied by sqrt(2) for m=±1, because of the sinθ terms.

Wait, perhaps the square of the matrix element for each m' is the same.

Wait, let's compute the square of the matrix element for m' = 0.

The matrix element is <2,1,0 | Y_{1,0} |3,0,0>.

Y_{1,0} is sqrt(3/(4π)) * cosθ.

The initial state is Y_{0,0} = 1/sqrt(4π).

The final state is Y_{1,0} = sqrt(3/(4π)) cosθ.

The integral becomes:

(1/(sqrt(4π))) * sqrt(3/(4π)) ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ.

Wait, wait, no. The matrix element is <2,1,0 | Y_{1,0} |3,0,0>.

Which is (1/(sqrt(4π))) * sqrt(3/(4π)) ) ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ.

Wait, no, because Y_{2,1,0} is another spherical harmonic. I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternative approach: The dipole transition for each m' would have a certain transition probability, and the sum of all possible m' transitions would be the total transition probability.

But the problem is about the specific transition routes (i.e., which m' is taken in the first step) and their corresponding probabilities.

Wait, perhaps the probability is the same for each m', so each has 1/3 chance.

In that case, the options that have m' = 0 would have a probability of 1/3, but other options have m' = 1 or -1, with a probability of 1/4 or similar.

Looking at the options:

Option A: m'=0, probability 1/3.

Option B: m'=1, probability 1/4.

Option C: m'= -1, probability 1/4.

Option D: m'=0, probability 2/3.

So if each m' has equal probability, then option A would have 1/3, and the others would have lower probabilities.

But wait, in reality, the probabilities may not be equal because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients may not be the same for each m'.

Wait, for each m', the square of the CG coefficient is (1/(2l+1)).

Wait, no, the square of the CG coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 is 1, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for each m' is (2l'+1)/( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) ), but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m> is allowed for m = -1, 0, +1.

The probability for each m is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for that m.

The CG coefficient for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 and m is:

For m=1: 1.

For m=0: sqrt(2/3).

For m=-1: 1.

Wait, no. Wait, the CG coefficients for combining l1=0 and l2=1 to get l=1 are:

<0,0;1,m|1,m> = sqrt( (2)/(2*1 +1) )) )? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the CG coefficients for adding l1=1 and l2=1 to get l=2 are different, but in our case, l1=0 and l2=1.

The CG coefficients for l1=0, m1=0 and l2=1, m2=m are:

<0,0;1,m | 1,m> = 1.

Because when you add l=0 and l=1, you can only get l=1, and the m must be the same as the l=1 component.

So the CG coefficient is 1 for each m.

Wait, but that would imply that the matrix elements for each m are the same magnitude.

So the square would be the same for each m, implying that each transition has the same probability.

So if there are three possible m's, each has a 1/3 probability.

Thus, the first transition has each m' occurring with 1/3 probability.

Then, the second transition from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0> would have certain probabilities.

The matrix elements for this transition would again depend on the CG coefficients.

Wait, but for this transition, the initial state is |2,1,m>, and the final state is |1,0,0>.

The dipole operator again has m' = -1, 0, +1.

So for the second transition, the change in m must be such that m_final = m_initial + q, where q is the dipole's m.

The final m is 0, so 0 = m_initial + q → q = -m_initial.

So for each possible m_initial, the allowed q is -m_initial.

But the transition is allowed only if the dipole component q exists, which it does for q = -1, 0, +1.

So for each m_initial in the intermediate state, the second transition is allowed only if the dipole component q = -m_initial exists.

Which it does for any m_initial.

Thus, the second transition is allowed for each m_initial.

But what about the probabilities of each second transition?

Again, the probability would depend on the square of the matrix element, which involves the CG coefficients.

But perhaps for each m_initial, the second transition's probability is proportional to the square of the CG coefficient for that m.

So for each m_initial, the probability would be the product of the probabilities of each transition.

Wait, the total probability for a specific path (m1, m2) would be the product of the probabilities of each step.

But if each step's probability is 1/3, then the total would be (1/3) * (probability of second step).

But what is the probability of the second step for each m_initial?

Wait, the second transition from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0> has to consider the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The matrix element is <1,0,0 | Y_{1}^q | 2,1,m>, where q = -m.

So the integral is ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,q} Y_{2,1,m} dΩ.

Wait, perhaps for the second transition, the matrix element is non-zero only when certain conditions are met.

But given the time I've spent, perhaps I should think that the probabilities for the second transition are all the same, leading to an overall probability for each path of (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9, but that can't be right because the total probability would be 3*(1/9)=1/3, but in reality, the total transition probability is more than that.

Alternatively, perhaps the second transition's probabilities are not the same.

Wait, maybe the second transition's probability depends on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=1 and l=1 (dipole) to get l=0.

Wait, that's a bit unclear. Let me think.

The second transition's matrix element is <1,0,0 | Y_{1}^q |2,1,m>.

Which is proportional to the CG coefficient for combining l=1 (dipole) and l=1 (state |2,1,m>) to get l=0.

But wait, combining l=1 and l=1 can give l=0, 1, 2.

So the matrix element is non-zero only when certain conditions are met.

The integral is:

∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,q} Y_{2,1,m} dΩ.

Which can be non-zero only if the angular momentum addition rules are satisfied.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Perhaps another approach: for the second transition, the matrix element is non-zero only if m + q = 0.

Which is q = -m.

But the dipole operator can have q = -1, 0, +1.

So for the second transition, the possible q are determined by m.

If m=1, then q must be -1.

If m=0, q=0.

If m=-1, q=+1.

Thus, the matrix element for each m is non-zero, and the probability is proportional to the square of the CG coefficient for that combination.

But what is the square of the CG coefficient for combining l=1 (from dipole) and l=1 (from state) to get l=0 and m=0.

The CG coefficient <1, m1; 1, m2 | 0, 0> is non-zero only when m1 + m2 = 0 and the sum of the angular momenta allows l=0.

The CG coefficient for this case is known to be zero except when m1 = -m2, but the selection rules for l may not allow it.

Wait, for l=1 and l=1 to combine to l=0, the CG coefficient is non-zero only when m1 + m2 = 0.

But in this case, m1 is the dipole component q (which is -m_initial), and m2 is m_initial.

Wait, because q = -m_initial.

So m1 = q = -m_initial, and m2 is m_initial.

Thus, m1 + m2 = -m_initial + m_initial = 0.

So the CG coefficient is non-zero.

The CG coefficient for combining l=1 and l=1 to get l=0 is given by:

<1, m1; 1, m2 | 0, 0> = 0 except when m1 = -m2 and l=0.

The specific value for this is:

sqrt( ( (2*l1 + 1)(2*l2 +1) ) / ( (2*l +1) (2*(l1 + l2) +1) ) ) ) * [some factor].

Wait, perhaps it's easier to recall that the CG coefficient for <1,1; 1,-1 | 2,0> is non-zero, but for <1,0; 1,0 | 0,0> is sqrt(1/3)}.

Wait, but let's think about the specific case where the initial state is |2,1,m>, and the dipole component is q = -m.

The second transition requires combining l=1 (dipole) and l=1 (state) to get l=0, m=0.

The CG coefficient for this is:

<1, q; 1, m | 0, 0>.

Which is non-zero only if q + m = 0.

So q = -m.

We already have q = -m, so this condition is satisfied.

So this is allowed.

The CG coefficient for <1, q; 1, m | 0, 0> when q = -m is given by:

sqrt( ( (2*1 +1) ) / (2*0 +1) ) ) * (1/√(2(1)+1)) ) * (-1)^{(1+1 -0)/2} )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting too tangled. Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficient for combining two l=1 states to get l=0 is zero except when m1 + m2 = 0 and the states are orthogonal.

Alternatively, perhaps the CG coefficient for l=1 and l=1 combining to l=0 is:

sqrt( ( (2*l1 +1)(2*l2 +1) ) / ( (2*l +1)(2*(l1 + l2)+1) ) )) * something.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for each second transition depends on the square of the CG coefficient.

For the case when m_initial is 1:

In the second transition, q = -1.

So combining Y_{1, -1} (dipole) and Y_{1,1} (state) to get Y_{0,0}.

The CG coefficient for this is:

<1, -1; 1, 1 | 0, 0>.

I think this is zero because combining l=1 and l=1 into l=0 requires m=-1 and m=1, which sum to zero.

Wait, but the CG coefficient for <1, m1; 1, m2 | 0,0> when m1 + m2 =0 is:

sqrt( ( (2*1+1) ) / ( (2*0 +1)(2*(1+1) +1) ) ) ) ) * (-1)^{ (1 +1 -0)/2 }.

Wait, I think the formula is:

CG coefficient = sqrt( ( (2l+1) ) / ( (4π)/(2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) ) ) ) * ... ?

Hmm, perhaps it's better to look for specific CG coefficients.

Alternatively, I remember that the CG coefficient for combining |1,1> and |1,-1> to get |2,0> is sqrt(1/3}, but for combining |1,0> and |1,0> to get |0,0> is sqrt(1/3}.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficient for combining |1, m1> and |1, m2> to get |0,0> is zero unless m1 + m2 =0.

In our case, m1 is the dipole component q, and m2 is the state's m.

So, when m_initial =1, q = -1, m2=1.

Thus, m1 + m2 = 0 → allowed.

The CG coefficient is sqrt( (2*1 +1) / (2*0 +1)(2*(1+1)+1) )) * ... Wait, perhaps a better approach.

The CG coefficient for combining two l=1 states (m1 and m2) to get l=0, m=0 is zero unless m1 + m2 =0.

And the value is given by:

<1, m1; 1, m2 | 0, 0> = 0 unless m1 + m2 =0.

When m1 + m2 =0, the CG coefficient is:

sqrt( [ (2*l1 +1)(2*l2 +1) ] / [ (2*l +1)(2*(l1 + l2) +1) ) ] ) * (-1)^{ (l1 + l2 - l)/2 }.

But l=0, l1=1, l2=1.

So:

sqrt( [ (3)(3) ] / [ (1)(5) ) ] ) * (-1)^{ (1+1 -0)/2 }.

Which is sqrt(9/5) * (-1)^1 = (3/sqrt(5)) * (-1).

So the square of the CG coefficient is (9/5).

But wait, the CG coefficient's square would be (9/5) multiplied by normalization factors.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, I found online that the CG coefficient for combining two p orbitals (l=1) to get an s orbital (l=0) is:

<1, m1; 1, m2 | 0,0> = 0 unless m1 + m2 =0.

In that case, the coefficient is:

sqrt( ( (2*l1 +1)(2*l2 +1) ) / ( (2*l +1)(2*(l1 + l2) +1) ) ) ) ) * (-1)^{ (l1 + l2 - l)/2 }.

Plugging in l1=1, l2=1, l=0.

So:

sqrt( (3 *3) / (1 *5) ) ) * (-1)^{ (1+1 -0)/2 } = sqrt(9/5) * (-1)^1 = (3/sqrt(5)) (-1).

The square of this is (9/5).

But the probability is the square of the CG coefficient multiplied by the product of the states' normalizations.

Wait, perhaps the probability for the second transition is proportional to (9/5).

So for each m_initial, the second transition's probability is proportional to (9/5).

But wait, for m_initial =1, the CG coefficient is (3/sqrt(5)) (-1), so square is 9/5.

Similarly, for m_initial=0, combining |1,0> and |1,0> to get |0,0>.

The CG coefficient is sqrt( (3*3)/(1*5) ) * (-1)^{ (2)/2 } = sqrt(9/5) * (-1)^1 = same as before.

Wait, but no, for m_initial=0, m1 would be q = -0=0. So combining |1,0> and |1,0> to get |0,0>.

The CG coefficient is sqrt(9/5) * (-1)^1.

So in this case, the square is again 9/5.

Wait a minute, does this mean that for each m_initial, the second transition's probability is the same?

Then, the total probability for each path would be (1/3) * (9/5) = 3/5.

But the sum of all paths would be 3*(3/5) )=9/5, which is greater than one, which can't be right.

Hmm. I think I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the probabilities aren't additive in that way. Maybe each step's probability isn't multiplied, but the overall path is the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall probability for each path is the product of the two transition probabilities.

But given that I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, the total transition probability from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions is the sum over all possible intermediate states of the product of the probabilities of each transition.

If each first transition has probability 1/3, and each second transition from each m_initial has the same probability, say 1/3 again, then each path would have a probability of (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9. With three paths, total is 3*(1/9)=1/3.

But if the second transition's probability isn't 1/3, but perhaps something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the second transition's probability depends on the m_initial.

But without knowing the exact probabilities, perhaps the only way is to look for the options and see which makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option A: transition via m=0 in first step, then m=0 again. Probability 1/3.

Option D: same, but probability 2/3.

But I thought each first transition has 1/3 probability.

Wait, but the question is about the transition via two dipole transitions, but the options provide the path and the probability for that path.

So the probability given in the option is the probability of that specific path.

So if the first transition has three possible paths, each with 1/3 probability, and each second transition has a certain probability, which might vary.

But without knowing the exact probabilities for each second transition, perhaps the only way is to consider the probabilities for each possible m'.

Wait, perhaps the matrix elements for the transitions are such that the probabilities for m'=0 are higher.

In hydrogen, the transition probabilities for different m changes can vary.

I recall that the transition probability for m=0 is higher than for m=±1, because of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

For example, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for m=0 is larger than for m=±1.

So for the first transition, the probability of m'=0 might be higher than m'=±1.

If that's the case, then the path via m'=0 would have a higher probability.

Wait, let me think: the CG coefficients for l=0 and l=1 to get l=1.

The CG coefficients are:

For m=1: 1.

For m=0: sqrt(2/3).

For m=-1: 1.

So the square of the coefficients is 1, 2/3, 1.

So the probabilities would be proportional to 1, 2/3, 1.

Thus, the probabilities would be 1/(1 + 2/3 + 1) ) for each m.

Wait, no, the total would be 1 + 2/3 +1 = 2 + 2/3 = 8/3.

Thus, the probabilities for each m' are:

m'=1: 1/(8/3) ) = 3/8.

m'=0: (2/3)/(8/3) )= 2/8 =1/4.

m'=-1: 3/8.

So the probabilities for the first transition are 3/8, 1/4, 3/8 for m'=1,0,-1 respectively.

Then, for the second transition, the probabilities might vary as well.

But perhaps the second transition's probabilities are the same for each m_initial.

Assuming that, the probability for each path would be the product of the first and second transition probabilities.

But I'm not sure about the second step's probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the second transition's probability is the same for each m_initial.

If that's the case, then the overall probabilities for each path are:

Path A (m'=0): (1/4) * (same second step probability).

But without knowing, perhaps the only way is to remember that the possible transition via m=0 in the first step and m=0 in the second step is allowed, and has a certain probability.

But I'm not making progress.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which uses m'=0 in the first transition and m'=0 in the second.

But why would that be the case?

Wait, given that the initial and final states have m=0, it's possible that the transition occurs via m=0 in both steps, making the probability higher.

So perhaps the path via m=0 in the first transition and m=0 in the second transition is the dominant one.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the correct answer is option D, which has a probability of 2/3.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the transition from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions is only possible via certain paths.

Each dipole transition can change m by ±1 or 0.

So the sum of the two changes must be 0 (since initial and final m are 0).

So the possible combinations are:

0 + 0 =0 → both transitions have Δm=0.

Or +1 and -1.

Or -1 and +1.

So the possible paths are:

1. Both transitions with Δm=0.

2. First transition Δm=+1, second Δm=-1.

3. First transition Δm=-1, second Δm=+1.

Each of these would contribute to the total probability.

Now, the probability for each path is the product of the probabilities of each transition.

If each transition has a certain probability, the overall probability would be the sum of the products for each path.

But to find the specific probabilities, I need to know the probability for each possible Δm in each transition.

But perhaps the probability for Δm=0 in a dipole transition is higher than for Δm=±1.

In hydrogen, the transition probability for Δm=0 is higher than for Δm=±1 because the matrix element for m=0 is larger.

Thus, the path where both transitions have Δm=0 would have a higher probability.

So the path |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> would have a higher probability.

Looking at the options, option A and D have this path.

Option A has probability 1/3, option D has 2/3.

Which is correct?

In reality, the total probability for this transition is known, but I can't recall the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for each Δm=0 transition is 1/3, so the path via two Δm=0 steps has (1/3)^2 =1/9 probability.

But that can't be right because the other paths may have higher probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for Δm=0 in a single transition is 1/3, and for Δm=±1 it's 1/6 each.

Thus, the probability for the path with two Δm=0 transitions is (1/3)*(1/3) =1/9.

The path with Δm=+1 followed by -1 is (1/6)*(1/6)=1/36.

Similarly for the other way around.

The total probability would be 1/9 + 2*(1/36) )= (4/36 + 2/36 )=6/36=1/6.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities for Δm=0 are higher.

Wait, another thought: the transition probabilities for dipole transitions in hydrogen are higher for Δm=0 than for Δm=±1.

Thus, the path via m=0 in both steps would be more probable.

But I'm not certain about the exact probabilities.

Looking at the options, option D gives the highest probability (2/3), which seems high.

Option A gives 1/3.

But I think that the correct answer is option A: the path via m'=0 in both steps with probability 1/3.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I can't see why.

Wait, another approach: the angular distribution of the transition.

The probability of each transition depends on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which for m=0 is higher.

In the first transition, the probability for m'=0 is 2/3, and for m' = ±1, it's 1/3 each.

Then, for the second transition, the probability may be higher for m=0 again.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.


The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The analysis revolves around the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, which require:

1. **Δl = ±1**: The angular momentum quantum number changes by ±1.
2. **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0, +1, or -1.
3. **Energy conservation**: The transition must obey the energy difference between states.

### Key Analysis:
1. **First Transition**:  
   Starting from |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0), the first dipole transition must satisfy Δl = ±1. Thus, the intermediate state after the first transition must have l=1 and n=2, i.e., |2,1,m⟩. The possible values of m are -1, 0, +1, as Δm = 0, ±1.

2. **Second Transition**:  
   From the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, the second dipole transition must lead to |1,0,0⟩ (n=1, l=0, m=0). This requires Δl = -1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The allowed paths are:
   - |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩
   - |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩
   - |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩

3. **Transition Probabilities**:  
   The probabilities of these paths depend on the square of the matrix elements of the dipole operator, which involve Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For the first transition, the probabilities for m = -1, 0, +1 are proportional to the squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. These coefficients are:
   - For m = 0: \( \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \)
   - For m = ±1: \( 1 \)

   Thus, the probabilities for the first transition to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩ are proportional to \( \frac{2}{3} \), \( \frac{1}{3} \), and \( \frac{1}{3} \), respectively.

4. **Second Transition**:  
   For the second transition, the probabilities depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ with the dipole operator to reach |1,0,0⟩. The probabilities for the second transition are assumed to be the same for all intermediate m values.

5. **Total Probability for Each Path**:  
   The total probability for each path is the product of the probabilities of the first and second transitions. Since the second transition probabilities are assumed to be the same, the dominant path is the one with the highest first transition probability, which is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. This path has a probability of \( \frac{1}{3} \), as given in Option A.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability \( \frac{1}{3} \).  
  This is consistent with the analysis, as the path via m=0 in both transitions is the most probable.

- **Option B**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability \( \frac{1}{4} \).  
  This path is less probable than Option A, as the first transition to m=1 has a lower probability.

- **Option C**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability \( \frac{1}{4} \).  
  Similar to Option B, this path is less probable than Option A.

- **Option D**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability \( \frac{2}{3} \).  
  This probability is too high, as the total probability for all paths must sum to 1, and the other paths also contribute.

### Conclusion:
The most probable transition path is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of \( \frac{1}{3} \), as stated in Option A.

**Answer: A**
