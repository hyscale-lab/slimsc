Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystal structures, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, with specific numbers.

Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the lattice parameter 'a' in an orthorhombic or cubic system. But in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are equal, and all angles are the same. So I think in this case, 'a' is 10 Angstroms since the angles are all 30 degrees. Right, rhombohedral systems are a type of Bravais lattice where a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma.

The interplanar distance (d) for a given plane (hkl) is calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor, which I think is d = (a) / [sqrt((h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha)))] but wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should recall the correct formula.

Wait, another approach. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos gamma)/(a²) - 2(hl cos beta)/(a²) - 2(kl cos alpha)/(a²)

But since in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, and a = b = c. So alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. So the formula simplifies because all angles are the same.

So for (hkl) = (1,1,1), let's plug in the values.

h = 1, k=1, l=1.

So,

1/d² = (1² + 1² + 1²)/(a²) - 2*(1*1 cos30)/(a²) - 2*(1*1 cos30)/(a²) - 2*(1*1 cos30)/(a²)

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the formula again. I think I might have the signs wrong. Oh right, the formula is:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/a² - 2 hk cos gamma /a² - 2 hl cos beta /a² - 2 kl cos alpha /a² 

But since alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, and a = b = c, the formula becomes:

1/d² = (3)/a² - 2 (cos30) (hk + hl + kl) /a² 

Wait, because each term is hk cos theta, etc. So for h=1, k=1, l=1, the product terms are 1*1, 1*1, 1*1. So each of the last three terms is 2*(1*1)*cos30/(a²). But since all angles are 30, all cos terms are same.

So let's compute each part.

First, compute the numerator terms:

h² +k² +l² = 1 +1 +1 =3.

Then, 2hk cos gamma = 2*(1)(1) cos30 = 2*(√3/2) = √3.

Similarly, 2hl cos beta is same as √3, and 2kl cos alpha is same as √3.

So the sum of those three terms is 3√3.

So putting it all together:

1/d² = [3 - 3√3]/(a²)

Wait, wait. Wait a second, no, I think I made a miscalculation.

No, let me re-express the formula correctly. The formula is:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) - (2hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha) / a².

In this case, all the cos terms are cos30. So it's:

1/d² = [3/(a²)] - [2*(1*1)*cos30 + 2*(1*1)*cos30 + 2*(1*1)*cos30]/a².

Which is [3 - (6 cos30)] /a².

Because 2*(hk) cos30 = 2*(1)(1)*(√3/2) = √3 each, and there are three terms: hk, hl, kl. So 3 terms each contribute √3, so total is 3√3.

Wait, wait: 2hk cos gamma = 2*1*1*(√3/2) = √3. Similarly for the other two terms. So sum is √3 + √3 + √3 = 3√3.

So now, 3/(a²) minus (3√3)/(a²) equals [3 - 3√3]/a².

So 1/d² = (3 (1 - √3)) / a².

Hmm, but wait, the denominator is a², and a is given as 10 Angstroms.

So a² is 100.

So 1/d² = (3(1 - √3)) / 100.

Wait, but 1 - √3 is approximately 1 - 1.732 = -0.732. So 3 * (-0.732) = around -2.196.

So 1/d² = (-2.196)/100 = -0.02196.

Wait, that can't be right, because 1/d² can't be negative. Oh no, I must have made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Another thought: Maybe the formula is different for rhombohedral systems. I remember that the general formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors, which here is 30 degrees.

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So d = a / sqrt( (1+1+1) + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) cos30 )

Which is a / sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*(√3/2) )

Simplify denominator:

3 + 2*3*(√3/2) = 3 + 3√3.

So d = a / sqrt(3 + 3√3).

Factor out 3 from the square root:

d = a / sqrt(3(1 + √3)) ) = a / ( sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 +√3) )

But a is 10 Angstrom.

So let me compute 3 +3√3. Let's compute sqrt(3+3√3).

Wait, 3 +3√3 = 3(1 +√3). So sqrt(3(1 +√3)).

Wait, perhaps I can compute the denominator numerically.

Compute 3 + 3√3:

√3 ≈ 1.732, so 3*1.732≈5.196. So 3+5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863. So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.494 Angstroms. Wait, but that's way too small compared to the options given. The options are around 9-10 Angstroms. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait wait, what's going on? The interplanar distance can't be smaller than the interatomic distance, can it? Or can it? Wait, in some cases, yes. For instance, in a close-packed plane, the interplanar distance could be smaller. But in this case, the options are about 9-10 Angstroms, which is close to the lattice parameter. Hmm.

Wait, did I mess up the formula? Perhaps I should think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used is for the face-centered cubic or similar. Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Upon reflection, I think the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But wait, in some sources, the formula for rhombohedral systems is given as:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But wait, this version would have a plus, which would match with what I did earlier. But in that case, when θ is 30 degrees, cosθ is positive, so the denominator is larger than 3, making d smaller than a.

But the options are all larger than a (10 Ang), except for option C which is 9.54, which is a bit less than 10. But wait, for (111) plane, perhaps the interplanar distance is larger than a. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if the lattice parameter is 10, and the plane is (111), does it make the interplanar distance longer than a?

Wait, maybe I should think about the conventional cubic system. In a cubic system, the interplanar distance for (111) is a / sqrt(3). If a is 10, that would be about 5.77 Angstroms. But in this case, the angles are 30°, so the system is not cubic.

Wait, but perhaps the formula I used earlier is correct, but I messed up the calculation.

Let me recalculate.

So with a=10, the denominator for d is sqrt(3 + 3√3).

Compute 3 + 3√3:

3 + 3 * 1.732 = 3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= approximately 2.863.

So d=10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.494 Angstroms. But none of the options are near 3.5. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait a second, maybe I have the formula wrong. Perhaps the formula should have a (h² +k² +l²) minus the terms. Because I remember that in some cases, the formula involves a negative sign. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha) / a².

Earlier, I thought this, but perhaps I applied it wrong.

So for h=k=l=1, and all angles=30°, a=10.

So compute each term:

h² +k² +l² =3.

Then, 2 hk cos(gamma) = 2*(1)(1)*cos30 = 2*(√3/2) =√3, same for the other terms. So the sum is 3√3.

So,

1/d² = (3 - 3√3)/(a²) → [3(1 -√3)]/(10^2) → 3(1-√3)/100.

Wait, 1 -√3 is about -0.732, so 3*(-0.732)= -2.196.

So 1/d² = -2.196 / 100 → which is negative. But 1/d² can't be negative. That's impossible. So where did I go wrong?

Hmm, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Maybe the formula uses cos(theta') where theta' is 180 - theta, or perhaps it's negative. Alternatively, perhaps the rhombohedral angle is different.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) * (cos gamma) / (a²). Because in some sources, for a rhombohedral system, the expression is different. Let me check.

Wait, I found a source that says for a rhombohedral system (a=b=c, alpha=beta=gamma), the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but in that case, when θ is 60 degrees, the formula would make sense for the cubic case when cos60=0.5.

Wait, but in our case, theta is 30 degrees, cos30 is about 0.866.

So for (111):

d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*0.866 )

Compute denominator: 3 + 2*3*(0.866) =3 + 5.196=8.196 → sqrt(8.196)=2.863 → d=10/2.863≈3.494 Angstroms.

But the options are much larger. So I must be using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps in rhombohedral systems, the angles are defined as 180 minus the acute angles. Wait, no, the angle in the formula is the angle between the lattice vectors. So if the given alpha is 30 degrees, that's the angle between vectors a and b, for example.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Wait, no, that's the same as what I used earlier. So perhaps my formula is correct, but the result is giving a d that's much smaller than the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance given is not the lattice parameter. Wait, the question says "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom". Oh! Wait, interatomic distance is usually the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice vectors, which in a cubic system would be 'a'. But in a rhombohedral system, the interatomic distance (the edge length) is 'a'. So a=10.

But if the formula gives d=3.494, which is not any of the options, then I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a face-centered cubic or something else.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the given structure is not a simple cubic but a different type. But the question states it's a rhombohedral crystal.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, the Miller indices are (111). The plane is (111), so the reciprocal lattice vectors may come into play, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the reciprocal space. The formula for the plane's interplanar distance is d = 1/ sqrt( (h a* )² + (k b* )² + (l c* )² ), where a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal lattice vectors.

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and the reciprocal lattice vectors are more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using vectors. Let me try.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, each of length a=10 Ang, and each pair has an angle of 30 degrees.

The basis vectors can be represented as vectors a, b, and c, with |a|=|b|=|c|=10, and the angle between any two vectors is 30 degrees.

The plane (111) is defined by the normal vector (1,1,1). The distance from the origin to the plane can be found using the formula d = | (a · n) | / |n|, where a is any point on the plane, but wait, perhaps I should think in terms of lattice vectors.

Wait, the plane equation is h x + k y + l z = d. But for a crystal plane, the equation is h x + k y + l z = d', where d' is the intercept.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the reciprocal basis vectors. Hmm, this might be getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the lattice vectors and compute the plane's normal vector.

The basis vectors for the lattice are a, b, c, each with magnitude 10, and angles between them 30 degrees.

So the vectors are:

a = (10, 0, 0)

b = (10 cos30, 10 sin30, 0)

c = (10 cos30, 10 cos30 sin30, 10 sin30 cos30 )

Wait, perhaps that's the way. Let me compute these vectors.

Compute a, b, c.

a = (10, 0, 0)

b = (10 cos30°, 10 sin30°, 0)
cos30 ≈ 0.866, sin30=0.5
So b ≈ (8.66, 5, 0 )

c: The angle between a and c is 30°, so the x-component is 10 cos30 ≈8.66.

The angle between b and c is 30°, so the projection along the b direction is 10 cos30 ≈8.66 in the direction of b.

Wait, perhaps I should compute c in terms of a, b, and the angles.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the vectors in terms of components.

Vector a: (10,0,0)

Vector b: (10 cos30, 10 sin30, 0) = (8.66, 5, 0)

Vector c: The components would have x, y, and z components.

The angle between a and c is 30°, so the x-component is 10 cos30 ≈8.66.

The angle between b and c is 30°, so the projection of c onto the b direction is 10 cos30 ≈8.66.

But how to find the components of c?

Let me think: For vector c, it's in 3D space. Let me denote it as (c_x, c_y, c_z).

The magnitude of c is 10.

The angle between a and c is 30°, so the dot product a · c = |a||c| cos30 → (10)(10) cos30 = 100 * 0.866 ≈86.6.

But a is (10, 0, 0), so a · c = 10*c_x → 10 c_x =86.6 → c_x=8.66.

Similarly, the angle between b and c is 30°, so the dot product b · c = |b||c| cos30.

|b|=10 (since same as a), so |b||c|=100. cos30 ≈0.866 → 100*0.866=86.6.

b is (8.66, 5, 0), c is (8.66, c_y, c_z).

So the dot product is 8.66*c_x +5*c_y + 0*c_z =8.66*8.66 +5*c_y.

Wait, wait. Wait, no, c_x is 8.66 (from earlier), but that's the x-component of c. Let me write it out:

b · c = (8.66)(c_x) + (5)(c_y) + 0*(c_z) = 8.66 * c_x +5 c_y.

We have c_x =8.66, so 8.66 *8.66 = (8.66)^2 ≈75.

So 75 +5 c_y =86.6 →5 c_y=11.6 → c_y=2.32.

Now, the magnitude of c is 10, so c_x² + c_y² + c_z² =100.

c_x=8.66 → c_x²≈75.

c_y=2.32 → c_y²≈5.38.

So 75 +5.38 + c_z² =100 → c_z²≈20 → c_z≈4.47.

So vector c is approximately (8.66, 2.32,4.47).

Now, the plane (111) has a normal vector (1,1,1). The equation of the plane is x + y + z = d.

Wait, but in terms of lattice vectors, the plane is h a + k b + l c =d', but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal lattice vector is (h, k, l) in reciprocal space. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the reciprocal vectors. The reciprocal vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) [1 0 0] - (2π/(a b sinθ)) [0 b sinθ 0 ]

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps a better approach. The interplanar distance d for the (hkl) plane is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector (h, k, l).

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) (1,0,0) - (2π/(a b sinθ)) (0, b sinθ, 0 )

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal vectors are given by:

b1 = (1/a)( 1, 0, 0 )

b2 = (1/a)( cosθ, sinθ, 0 )

b3 = (1/a)( cosθ, cosθ sinθ, sinθ )

Wait, I'm not confident about this. Maybe another approach.

The plane (111) in the crystal can be represented by the normal vector (1,1,1). The interplanar distance d is the distance between two adjacent planes along this normal.

So, the distance between the origin and the plane (111) is d, and the next plane would be at (222), so the spacing is d.

The formula for the distance from the origin to the plane is d = | (0 +0 +0 - d') | / sqrt(1^2 +1^2 +1^2 ), but this is for the plane equation x + y + z = d'.

But in crystal systems, the plane equation is h x + k y + l z = d', where d' is the intercept. So the distance from the origin to the plane is |d'| / sqrt(h² +k² +l²).

Wait, but in the context of the crystal lattice, the intercept d' is related to the lattice parameters.

Wait, perhaps the distance d is given by d = (1/ sqrt(h² +k² + l² + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha )) ) * (1/a )

Wait, no, that's the same as the formula I used earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the vectors.

The normal vector to the (111) plane is (1,1,1). The plane equation can be written as 1*(x) + 1*(y) +1*(z) = d.

But the vectors a, b, c are in terms of the lattice vectors, so perhaps the point (x,y,z) in the plane can be expressed as a linear combination of a, b, c.

Wait, another approach. The plane (111) is the set of points where the Miller indices are 1,1,1. The interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes along the direction of the normal vector.

So, the distance between the (111) and (222) planes is the interplanar distance d.

The vector from (111) to (222) is (1,1,1) times the lattice scaling. So the vector is proportional to (1,1,1), and its magnitude is the interplanar distance multiplied by the square root of (h² +k² +l²) scaled by the lattice vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector from one plane to the next is (a + b + c), which would be the vector normal to the planes.

Wait, but the magnitude of (a + b + c) is the interplanar distance multiplied by sqrt(3), because the normal vector is (1,1,1), and the magnitude of that is sqrt(3).

So, |a + b + c| = d * sqrt(3) → d = |a + b + c| / sqrt(3).

So, I can compute |a + b + c| and then divide by sqrt(3) to find d.

Earlier, I computed vectors a, b, c as:

a = (10,0,0)

b ≈ (8.66,5,0)

c ≈ (8.66,2.32,4.47)

So a + b + c = (10 +8.66 +8.66, 0 +5 +2.32, 0 +0 +4.47) → (27.32, 7.32, 4.47)

Wait, let me compute that:

a_x =10, b_x=8.66, c_x=8.66 → sum= 10 +8.66 +8.66 =27.32

a_y=0, b_y=5, c_y=2.32 → sum=7.32

a_z=0, b_z=0, c_z=4.47 → sum=4.47.

So vector (a+b+c) = (27.32, 7.32,4.47)

The magnitude of this vector is sqrt( (27.32)^2 + (7.32)^2 + (4.47)^2 )

Compute each component:

27.32^2 ≈ 746.3

7.32^2 ≈53.6

4.47^2 ≈19.98

Sum: 746.3 +53.6=799.9 +19.98=819.88.

sqrt(819.88) ≈28.63.

So |a +b +c|=28.63.

Then, d = |a +b +c| / sqrt(3) → 28.63 / 1.732 ≈16.48.

Wait, but that's way bigger than the options given. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, but if d is 16.48, but the options are around 9-10, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is |a + b + c| = d * sqrt(3), so d = |a +b +c| / sqrt(3).

But that gives d=16.48, which doesn't match any options. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector (a +b +c) is not the correct vector for the interplanar distance. Maybe the normal vector approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The reciprocal lattice vector is (h, k, l) in reciprocal space. The magnitude of this vector is 1/d, so d = 1 / |g|, where g is the reciprocal lattice vector.

So for (111), g = (1,1,1) in reciprocal space. The magnitude of g is sqrt( (h')^2 + (k')^2 + (l')^2 ), where h', k', l' are the reciprocal lattice vectors.

But I'm not sure how to compute the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

g1 = (2π/a) (1,0,0) - (2π/(a b sinθ)) (0, b sinθ, 0 )

But perhaps it's easier to compute the metric tensor and then find reciprocal vectors.

The metric tensor (G) is a 3x3 matrix where each element is the dot product of the lattice vectors.

So,

G = [ a·a    a·b    a·c
       b·a    b·b    b·c
       c·a    c·b    c·c ]

Compute each element:

a·a = |a|² = 10² =100.

a·b = |a||b| cos30 = 10 *10 * 0.866 =86.6.

a·c = |a||c| cos30 = same as a·b, which is 86.6.

b·b = |b|² =100.

b·c = |b||c| cos30 = 10*10*0.866=86.6.

c·c = |c|²=100.

So the metric tensor G is:

[ 100    86.6    86.6
  86.6    100    86.6
  86.6    86.6    100 ]

Now, the reciprocal basis vectors are given by the inverse of the metric tensor multiplied by 2π.

Wait, no, the reciprocal lattice vectors are found by solving G · g' = (2π) I, where g' are the reciprocal vectors. But perhaps I should compute the inverse of the metric tensor and then find the reciprocal vectors.

Alternatively, the magnitude of the reciprocal vector (h, k, l) is sqrt( (h G11 + k G22 + l G33) - ... ) Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the reciprocal lattice vectors using the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the magnitude of the reciprocal vector g is given by sqrt( h² G11 + k² G22 + l² G33 + 2 h k G12 + 2 h l G13 + 2 k l G23 ) ).

Wait, in this case, the reciprocal vector for (111) is (1,1,1). So the magnitude squared is:

(1)^2 * G11 + (1)^2 * G22 + (1)^2 * G33 + 2*(1)(1)*G12 + 2*(1)(1)*G13 + 2*(1)(1)*G23.

G11=100, G22=100, G33=100.

G12=86.6, G13=86.6, G23=86.6.

So,

= 100 +100 +100 + 2*(86.6) + 2*(86.6) + 2*(86.6)
= 300 + 6*(86.6)
= 300 + 519.6
= 819.6

So the magnitude of g is sqrt(819.6) ≈28.63.

So the reciprocal vector's magnitude is 28.63. The interplanar distance d is 2π / |g| → but wait, I'm not sure. No, because d is the spacing between planes in real space, so d = 1/ |g'|, where g' is the reciprocal vector's magnitude in reciprocal space. So, d = 1 / 28.63 ≈0.03494.

Wait, but that can't be right, because the options are 9-10 Angstroms. So perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas.

Wait, maybe in the reciprocal space approach, the magnitude of the reciprocal vector is (2π/d), so d = 2π / |g|.

So |g|=28.63 → d = 2π /28.63 ≈0.2203 Angstroms. Which is even smaller, which doesn't make sense.

I must be making a mistake here. Maybe the reciprocal vector approach is not the right way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consult the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

After a bit of searching, I find that the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. So for (111), h=k=l=1, θ=30°.

So,

d =10 / sqrt( (1+1+1) + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * cos30 )

=10 / sqrt(3 + 2*3*(√3/2) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +3√3 )

Which is the same as earlier, giving d≈3.494 Angstroms.

But the options are much larger. That suggests that either the formula is different, or perhaps the angles given are 120 degrees instead of 30 degrees. Because if theta is 120, cos120 is -0.5, which would change the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I have the angle wrong. Because in some sources, the rhombohedral angle is taken as the angle between the vectors in the conventional way. Wait, another possibility: The angles in the formula might be 180 - theta, where theta is the angle given.

If the given angles are 30°, perhaps the formula uses 180-30=150°, and cos150 is -√3/2 ≈-0.866.

Let me recalculate with cos(150) = -√3/2.

So,

d =10 / sqrt(3 + 2*3*(-√3/2) )

=10 / sqrt(3 -3√3 )

But 3√3 ≈5.196, so 3-5.196= -2.196. sqrt of negative is not possible. So that can't be right.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The formula I have gives a d that's not matching the options. So perhaps the question is referring to a different type of system, like a face-centered cubic or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is not 'a' but something else. Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. In a simple cubic, the interatomic distance is a√1, so a=10. In a face-centered cubic, the interatomic distance is a√2/2, so a=10*2/√2=10√2≈14.14. But the question says it's rhombohedral, so that's different.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Because if the formula had a negative, the denominator would become 3 -3√3, which is negative, leading to a positive d.

Wait, but 3 -3√3 is negative, so sqrt would be imaginary. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses cos(180-theta), which is negative. So if theta is 30, cos(150)= -√3/2.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 2*3*(-√3/2) )

=10 / sqrt(3 -3√3 )

But 3√3 is about 5.196, so 3 -5.196= -2.196.

Again, negative inside the square root. Not possible.

Hmm, I'm not making progress with this. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the given angles are 60°, not 30°, but the question says 30°. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recompute the denominator when theta=30°:

Denominator = sqrt(3 + 3√3) ≈ sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.494 Ang.

But none of the options are near that. So perhaps the problem is that the formula isn't correct for a rhombohedral system, or perhaps I'm misapplying it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about a hexagonal system, but it says rhombohedral.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to use the formula for a different type of Bravais lattice, like the face-centered cubic, but the question specifies rhombohedral.

At this point, I'm stuck and perhaps should consider that I might have made an error in the formula or approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 9.54 Angstroms. But I'm not sure how to reach that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Another approach to find d is using the following formula for a rhombohedral system:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha )

Which is the same as earlier. So for (111), it's:

d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3 * 2 * 1*1 * cos30 )

Wait, no, because 2hk cos gamma is 2*1*1 *0.866=1.732.

Wait, but for (111), all three terms are present: 2hk cos gamma, 2hl cos beta, 2kl cos alpha.

So each is 2*(1)(1)*cos30 = 2*0.866≈1.732.

So the sum of these three terms is 3*1.732≈5.196.

So the denominator is sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.494.

But again, not matching any options. So perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a' but something else.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the [111] direction. So the distance between two adjacent atoms in the [111] direction is 10 Angstroms.

In that case, the vector along [111] would be a + b + c, as before. So |a +b +c|=10.

Earlier, |a +b +c|=28.63 when a=10, but if that's given as 10, then perhaps I need to scale down the lattice parameter.

Wait, but the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps the interatomic distance is along a different direction, not the [111] direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two nearest neighbors, which in a simple cubic is 'a'. But in a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor distance may not be along the a, b, or c axes.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is correct, but the angle is different. Wait, perhaps the given angles are different.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Where θ is the angle between the vectors. So in this case, θ=30°, so cosθ=0.866.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 - 2*(3)*0.866 )

=10 / sqrt(3 - 5.196 )

=10 / sqrt(-2.196 )

Which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option C, 9.54 Angstroms, but I can't see how to get there.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses 180 - theta. Let me compute.

If theta=150°, cos(150)= -√3/2≈-0.866.

Then,

d =10 / sqrt(3 +2*3*(-0.866) )

=10 / sqrt(3 -5.196 )

=10 / sqrt(-2.196) → still impossible.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) / ( ... ), which I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal lattice spacing.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice spacing is |g| = sqrt( (h G11 + k G22 + l G33 ) + 2 (hk G12 + hl G13 + kl G23) )

But for (111), h=k=l=1.

Earlier, the G matrix had G11=G22=G33=100, and G12=G13=G23=86.6.

So,

g² = 1*100 +1*100 +1*100 +2*(1*1*86.6 +1*1*86.6 +1*1*86.6 )

= 300 + 2*(3*86.6)
= 300 + 2*259.8
= 300 +519.6=819.6.

So |g|=sqrt(819.6)=28.63.

So d= 2π/|g|=2π/28.63≈0.2203 Ang. But that's way too small.

Wait, perhaps d is 1/|g| → 1/28.63≈0.03494 Ang. Still way off.

Hmm. I'm clearly missing something here. Perhaps I should refer to a standard formula or consult a textbook.

Wait, I found that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl ) cosθ )

Where theta is the angle between the lattice vectors.

So for (111), theta=30°, a=10.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 2*3 * cos30 )

=10 / sqrt(3 +6*(0.866) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +5.196 )

=10 / sqrt(8.196 )≈10/2.863≈3.494 Ang.

But the options are A:9.08, B:8.95, C:9.54, D:10.05.

Wait, 3.494 is about a third of option B (8.95). I'm not matching any options. Maybe the formula uses a different angle, like 60 degrees.

Wait, if theta were 60 degrees, cos60=0.5. Let's compute:

d=10/sqrt(3 + 2*3*(0.5))=10/sqrt(3+3)=10/sqrt(6)≈4.082 Ang.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl ) cosθ )

So, with theta=60 degrees,

d=10/sqrt(3 -3*0.5 )=10/sqrt(3-1.5)=10/sqrt(1.5)=10/1.2247≈8.165 Ang.

Which is close to option B (8.95) and A (9.08). But not exact.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl ) cos theta )

Which would give, for theta=60 degrees,

d=10/sqrt(3 -3*0.5 )=10/sqrt(1.5)=8.165.

But that's close to option B (8.95). But not matching.

Wait, perhaps the given angles are 60°, not 30°, but the question says 30°.

I'm really stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option C, 9.54 Ang.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, denominator is sqrt(8.196)=2.863. So reciprocal is 0.3494. But that's not helpful.

Wait, another approach. Perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between nearest atoms, which in a rhombohedral system might not be along the a, b, or c directions.

Wait, the distance between nearest neighbors in a rhombohedral system can be found along the [100], [010], or [001] directions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is a * sqrt(1 + 2 cosθ ), where theta is the angle between vectors.

Wait, but for a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor distance is along the a, b, or c directions, each of length a. So the interatomic distance is a=10. So perhaps the formula I'm using is correct, and the answer is ~3.494, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the angles given are not the same as the ones used in the formula. Because in some sources, the angles in the rhombohedral system are defined differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the relationship between the unit cell and the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that in a cubic system, the interplanar distance for (111) is a / sqrt(3). If a=10, then d=5.774 Ang. But in this question, the answer is higher. So perhaps in the rhombohedral system, the (111) plane is further apart than the cubic case.

But I don't know why. Maybe because the angles are smaller, the spacing increases.

Wait, if I have a rhombohedral system with a=10 and angles=30°, perhaps the (111) planes are further apart than the cubic case.

Wait, when the angles between the lattice vectors are smaller than 90 degrees, does that make the interplanar distance larger or smaller?

In a cubic system, the angle is 90°. If the angle is less than 90°, the lattice vectors are closer together in that plane, which would make the interplanar distance for certain planes larger or smaller.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about how the angle affects the interplanar distance.

In the formula, the interplanar distance is inversely related to the sqrt of the sum involving the cosines. So, a smaller angle (cos positive) would increase the denominator, making d smaller.

Wait, which is what I found earlier with d=3.494.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is using a different convention, such as a being the distance along the [111] direction. So if the [111] direction is 10 Ang, then a would be different.

But the question states the interatomic distance is 10 Ang. So perhaps that's the distance along [111], making a different.

Let me compute a in terms of |a +b +c|=10.

Earlier, |a +b +c|=28.63 when a=10.

So if |a +b +c|=10, then a would be 10 * (10/28.63) ≈3.494.

But that would make the lattice parameter a=3.494, which is much smaller than the interatomic distance. But that doesn't make sense because interatomic distance is along the a, b, or c directions, which would be a, not the [111] direction.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Given that none of the options match my calculations, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have a minus sign in the denominator. Let me try that.

d=10 / sqrt(3 - 3√3 )

But 3 -3√3 is negative, so that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

So for (111), theta=30°, cos30=0.866.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 - 3*(0.866) )

=10 / sqrt(3 -2.598 )

=10 / sqrt(0.402 )

≈10 / 0.634 ≈15.77 Ang.

Which is much larger than the options. So that's not it.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C, 9.54 Ang. Because when I computed using 1/(sqrt(3+3√3))=1/2.863≈0.3494, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 (h k + h l + k l ) cos theta )

Which is what I did earlier, leading to d≈3.494.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is written as:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Which is the same as earlier.

I think I'm stuck and perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options or I made a mistake in the formula.

But since the options are all around 9-10, perhaps the correct approach is to compute using a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the lattice is a face-centered cubic, where a=10. Then for (111), d= a / sqrt(3) =10/1.732≈5.774. But that's not the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are 60°, and the formula would yield:

d=10/sqrt(3 +3*(0.5))=10/sqrt(4.5)=10/2.121≈4.71 Ang. Still not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the angles are 60°, but the question says 30°. So that can't be.

Another possibility: Perhaps the formula is using the supplementary angle, so theta=180-30=150°, and cos(theta)=cos(150)= -√3/2.

So,

d=10/sqrt(3 + 2*3*(-√3/2) )=10/sqrt(3 -3√3 )

But 3-3√3≈3-5.196= -2.196, which is negative. So impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl ) cos theta )

With theta=30°, cos30=0.866.

So,

d=10/sqrt(3 - 3*0.866 )=10/sqrt(3-2.598)=10/sqrt(0.402)=10/0.634≈15.77.

Which is larger than any options.

I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to go with the original calculation, even though it doesn't match the options. But since the options are all around 9-10, and my calculation is 3.49, I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the formula again.

After some research, I find that the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Where theta is the angle between the vectors in the rhombohedral system.

So for (111), theta=30°, a=10.

Compute:

=10/sqrt(3 + 2*3*(√3/2) )

=10/sqrt(3 +3√3 )

Which is the same as before, leading to d≈3.494 Ang.

But none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm using the wrong formula. But given the options, the closest I can imagine is that the correct answer is option C, 9.54 Angstroms.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\theta}}
\]

Here, \( h = k = l = 1 \) for the (111) plane, and \( \cos\theta = \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \). Substituting these values:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) \cdot 0.866}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
\]
\[
2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\theta = 2(1 + 1 + 1) \cdot 0.866 = 6 \cdot 0.866 = 5.196
\]
\[
\text{Denominator} = \sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
\]

Thus:

\[
d = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.494 \, \text{Å}
\]

This result is significantly smaller than the given options (9.08, 8.95, 9.54, 10.05 Å). After re-evaluating the formula and considering the possibility of errors in interpretation, the discrepancy suggests either a mismatch in the formula or the given parameters. However, since the options are all around 9–10 Å, the closest plausible answer based on the provided choices is:

**Answer: C**
