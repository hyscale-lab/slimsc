Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. The question involves a series of reactions starting with benzene, and each step forms a product. Then, the final product is matched with the options given. Hmm, I need to figure out each step one by one.

First, benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitrating benzene involves using a nitrating mixture, which is HNO3 and H2SO4. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution here. The nitration of benzene usually adds a nitro group. Where does it go? Benzene is symmetric, so the nitration at the first position is the same as any other, but I think the major product is nitrobenzene, which would be meta substitution if there's another substituent, but wait, in this case, it's just benzene. Oh wait, nitration of benzene gives a single productâ€”nitrobenzene. So product 1 should be nitrobenzene. Or wait, maybe the position is ortho, meta, para? No, wait, benzene has only one ring, so adding nitro group as the first substituent will just be nitrobenzene. But wait, sometimes reactions might lead to mixed isomers, but nitration is usually a single product in the case of benzene, with the nitro group in a specific substitution. Wait, actually, no, the nitration of benzene gives a mixture of ortho and para? Or no, wait, no, in the case of benzene with no other substituents, the nitration gives a single product because all positions are equivalent. So product 1 is nitrobenzene, where the nitro group is attached at a specific position, but since it's benzene, the position doesn't matter as all are same.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: in benzene, each carbon is equivalent. So when we add a nitro group, the product is simply nitrobenzene, which is a single structure because all positions are the same.

Then, product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Iron is a catalyst for bromination. But wait, nitro groups are meta directors. So bromine with Fe would add a bromine atom in the meta position relative to the nitro group. So in nitrobenzene, adding a bromine in the meta position would give 1-bromo-
