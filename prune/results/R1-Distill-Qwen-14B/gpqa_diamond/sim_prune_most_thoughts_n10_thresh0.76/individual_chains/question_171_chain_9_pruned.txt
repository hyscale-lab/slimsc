Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. The substances given are all benzene derivatives, and I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed.

Hmm, electrophilic substitution on a benzene ring. The directing effects of substituents will determine where the bromine adds. The substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they can direct incoming electrophiles to ortho, meta, or para positions.

Wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each compound, I need to figure out how much of the product is para-substituted.

Let me list the substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3: Toluene. CH3 is an activating group, meta director? Or is it ortho/para? Oh right, methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group because it's an electron-donating group. So substitution occurs mostly at ortho and para positions. But in a para-substituted product, the major product would be para, but the question is about the weight fraction. But wait, for toluene, the major products are ortho and para. So the para would be a significant fraction, but the exact ratio depends on steric factors and the directing effect strength.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's ethyl benzoate. The substituent is COOEt. Wait, the COOR group is a meta director because it's an electron-withdrawing group (due to the carbonyl). So bromine would add mostly at the meta position. So para would be a minor product. So the fraction would be lower than groups that are ortho/para directors.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorobenzene. Cl is an electron-withdrawing group (since it's more electronegative) but it's ortho/para directing because it's a deactivating, but ortho/para-directing substituent. So substitution occurs at ortho and para. So major products are ortho and para. So para is a significant fraction, but perhaps less than toluene because Cl is a weaker activating group than methyl? Or wait, Cl is deactivating, so maybe the ring is less reactive, but the directing is ortho/para.

Wait, no, the reactivity affects how easily the reaction occurs but not the position. So for Cl, same as methyl but deactivating. So the major products are ortho and para.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene. NO2 is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So substitution occurs mainly at meta, so para would be minor. So the para fraction would be low.

5) C6H5-C2H5: Ethylbenzene. Similar to toluene, but the ethyl group is a stronger activating group than methyl. So it's ortho/para-directing. So more substitution at ortho and para. So para is a good fraction.

6) C6H5-COOH: Benzoic acid. The COOH group is a strong electron-withdrawing group (due to the two electronegative oxygens and the carboxylic acid). So it's a meta-directing substituent. So substitution occurs mainly at meta, so para is a minor product. So low para fraction.

Wait, but wait. For benzoic acid, the substituent is -COOH. So it's a meta director. So for substitution, most products would be meta, so para would be minimal. Therefore, the weight fraction of para is the lowest among these.

So now, I need to compare the para fractions for each.

Let me try to list each substituent's effect:

Substance 1: CH3 (ortho/para, activating) → para is major, but perhaps more than methyl compared to others?

Substance 2: COOEt (meta director, deactivating) → para is minor.

Substance3: Cl (ortho/para, deactivating) → para is major but less activating than methyl.

Substance4: NO2 (meta director, deactivating) → para is minor.

Substance5: C2H5 (ortho/para, activating, but perhaps stronger than CH3) → para is major.

Substance6: COOH (meta director, deactivating) → para is minor.

Wait, so for the para fraction, we have substances 1,3,5 having higher para, and 2,4,6 lower.

But among 1,3,5, which has the highest para fraction? Because the substituent's directing strength might influence whether more para is formed.

Wait, when a substituent is ortho/para directing, the major product is a mix of ortho and para. The ratio depends on the substituent's ability. For example, activating groups (like -NH2) tend to give more para substitution than ortho because of steric hindrance. Or wait, it's the opposite? Let me think: for toluene (CH3), substitution occurs in ortho, meta, para positions. But wait, no, CH3 is activating and ortho/para director. So the major products are ortho and para. But the ratio: typically, para is more than ortho because ortho has more steric hindrance. So for toluene, the para isomer is major. Similarly for ethylbenzene, the para is even more favored because the ethyl group is bulkier, so ortho is less favored.

Wait, so ethyl group is a larger substituent than methyl, so the ortho position would be more hindered for substitution. So for ethylbenzene (substance5), more para is formed compared to toluene (substance1), which in turn has more para than chlorobenzene (substance3), which in turn has more para than the others.

Wait, but wait, substance3 is chlorobenzene. Cl is a deactivating group but ortho/para director. So the ring is less reactive, but substitution occurs at ortho and para. But since Cl is a meta director? No, wait, Cl is ortho/para director but deactivating. So bromine will substitute at ortho and para, but the ring is deactivating, so the reaction is slower, but the position is determined by the substituent.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to rank the para fractions.

Substituent → effect on para fraction:

- Deactivating, meta: NO2 (substance4), COOEt (2), COOH (6): para is minor, so their para fractions are low.

- Activating, ortho/para: CH3 (1), C2H5 (5), Cl (3): para is major.

Now, the order of para fractions from lowest to highest.

The lowest para fractions are the deactivating, meta directors: 4, 2,6.

Wait, but wait: substance6 is COOH. It's a strong EWG, more so than COOEt? Maybe.

So for the deactivating, meta directors, the para fraction is low. So in order, the lowest para fractions would be 4 (NO2, most deactivating and strong meta director), then 6 (COOH, which is even stronger), then 2 (COOEt, which is less strong but still EWG). Or wait, wait: NO2 is a stronger EWG than COOEt. So perhaps the order is 6 < 2 <4? No, because NO2 is more deactivating than COOEt. So the para fractions for these three (4,2,6) would be in order 4 < 2 <6? Wait, I'm not so sure.

Wait, the meta directors have low para fractions. So the lower the para fraction, the lower the position in our overall order.

Wait, but maybe the substituent's effect on the reactivity doesn't influence the position, just the rate. So for the meta directors, the para is formed in low amounts.

So the deactivating, meta directors: 4 (NO2), 2 (COOEt), 6 (COOH). Their para fractions are all low. So in order of increasing para fraction, the lowest would be the substance with the strongest meta-directing effect. So among
