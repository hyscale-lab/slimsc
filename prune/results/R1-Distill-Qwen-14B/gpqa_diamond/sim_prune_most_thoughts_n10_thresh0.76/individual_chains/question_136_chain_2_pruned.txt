Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere. Alright, the field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r², and it's only got a radial component. So, I remember that divergence in spherical coordinates is a bit different from Cartesian. 

Wait, the field is purely radial, right? So in spherical coordinates, the vector field f(r) can be written as f(r) r̂, where r̂ is the radial unit vector and the magnitude is 1/r². So f(r) is (1/r²) r̂. 

I think the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates for a radial field is something like (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r), where f_r is the radial component. Oh wait, yes, that's right. So for a purely radial field, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r) multiplied by r²? Wait no, wait, the formula is: ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r) + ... but since there are no angular components, the other terms (those involving the angles) are zero. So ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * f_r). 

So f_r is 1/r². So plugging in, that becomes (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Let's compute that. r² times 1/r² is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence is zero? Wait, that can't be right because then the integral would be zero. But wait, wait, I think I might have a mistake here. Let me double-check.

Wait, f(r) is (1/r²) r̂, so f_r = 1/r². Then ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) So r² * (1/r²) is 1, derivative is zero. So ∇·f = 0. So the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at r=0, but inside the sphere of radius R, except maybe at the origin.

Wait a second, but wait, what about the origin? Because if the field is
