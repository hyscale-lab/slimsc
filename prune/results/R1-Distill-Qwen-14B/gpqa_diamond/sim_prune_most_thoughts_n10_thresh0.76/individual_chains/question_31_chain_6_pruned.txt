Okay, I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's go through it step by step. So, the question involves a series of reactions starting with toluene and going through several steps to form product 3. Then, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.

First, let's break down each reaction.

The first step is treating toluene with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitration typically occurs when toluene reacts with a nitric acid and sulfuric acid mixture. Since toluene is methylbenzene, the nitration would add a nitro group. The nitration is usually directed by the methyl group as an activating group. The nitro group would enter the ring at the position ortho to the methyl group because methyl is an activating group and ortho/para directing. Wait, but wait, no, wait. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So the nitration would occur either ortho or para to the methyl group. But since the reaction isn't specified for conditions that would prefer one over the other, I think the major product would be a mix, but for the sake of this problem, maybe product 1 is the nitro group in the para position. Or perhaps it's a meta director? No, no, nitration in toluene tends to give more para than ortho because of steric hindrance. Wait, no, I think that the nitration of toluene actually gives a mixture, but the major product is the para isomer because the methyl group directs the nitro group to para. So product 1 would be para-nitrotoluene, I think.

Wait, but the question says "forming product 1" as a single product. So perhaps it's the more substituted or more stable structure? Or maybe it's a mix but the next step will proceed based on that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: the first step is nitration of toluene, product 1 is nitrotoluene, probably para.

Next, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 in sulfuric acid is a strong oxidizing agent. I think it's used for oxidizing nitro groups. So, the nitro group (NO2) in para-nitrotoluene would be oxidized. Wait, what's the oxidation product of nitrotoluene? Let me recall. I think that
