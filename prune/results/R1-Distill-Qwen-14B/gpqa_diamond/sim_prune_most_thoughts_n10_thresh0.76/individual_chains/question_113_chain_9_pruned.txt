Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound. The question provides data from several spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in the IR around that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak could also be from an -OH group in a ketone? No, wait, ketones don't have O-H. Oh right, maybe an alcohol's O-H. Alternatively, if it's a broad peak around 3000, it could be an amine, but I don't see any info pointing towards that. Let's keep that in mind.

Then there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a conjugated carbonyl group or maybe an amide, but amides usually have lower wavenumbers. Alternatively, the 1650 might be an C=C stretch in a conjugated system, like an aromatic ring.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests there's an alkene group in the molecule. Maybe a conjugated diene or something else with double bonds.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, 45 is a significant mass. Let me think about common fragments. For example, a methyl group (CH3) is 15, but that's not it. Maybe a carbonyl group. Oh wait, the m/z 45 could be a fragment like (CH3CO)+ which is 45 (C=O is 28, CH3 is 15, 28+15+2=45? Wait, 12*2 + 1*3 +16 +1
