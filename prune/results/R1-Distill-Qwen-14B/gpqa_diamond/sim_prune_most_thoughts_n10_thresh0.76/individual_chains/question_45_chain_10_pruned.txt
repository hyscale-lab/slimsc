Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized. Each particle's energy depends on its quantum number. 

Wait, each particle is a spin-1/2, so electrons maybe? Oh right, but in a 1D well, like a particle in a box scenario. The energy levels for a single particle are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), which the problem simplifies to E multiplied by n squared. So E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so each particle's energy is n² E, where n is the principal quantum number.

But wait, there are four particles here. Since they're identical fermions, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each state can only have one particle. But how does that work in a 1D box? Because in a 3D box, particles have multiple quantum numbers, but in 1D, it's just one, n.

Wait, in a 1D box, each state is characterized by a single quantum number n. So for fermions, each n can hold only one particle because spin doesn't give an extra state in 1D—since spin is 1/2, which for electrons is two possible states (spin up or down), but wait, wait. Oh wait, in 1D, is spin considered as part of the state too? Or no, because spin isn't another degree of freedom in the same way as in 3D. Hmm, wait, in a 1D box, the quantum state is determined by n and spin. But wait, in a 1D box, the spatial wavefunction is given by ψ_n(x), and the spin part can be up or down. So each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins. So for each n, you can have two particles: spin up and spin down.

Wait, but wait, the problem says four identical spin-1/2 particles. So each particle has spin 1/2, and in a 1D box, each spatial state (n) can have two particles with different spins. So the maximum number of particles that can occupy a single n level is two. So the filling would be similar to how electrons fill up orbitals in atoms, each orbital can hold two electrons with opposite spins.

So for four particles, we need to fill the lowest energy levels with as many as possible, each with two particles per n level.

Okay, so let's list the energy levels. The energy for each particle is E_n = n² E. So the ground state is the lowest energy configuration.

In the ground state, the first level (n=1) can hold two particles. Then the next level (n=2) can hold two more. So for four particles, we'd have two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy is (2 particles)*(1² E) + (2 particles)*(2² E) = 2*1 E + 2*4 E = 2E +8E =
