Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question involves an operator P, which has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is represented as a matrix in a certain basis. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with an eigenvalue of -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The task is to find the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²), where A is the operator. So in this case, I'll need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩, then plug them into this formula.

Wait, but the state is given in the eigenbasis of P_z? No, wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, but the state is an eigenstate of P_x. So the state isn't necessarily an eigenstate of P_z, hence the uncertainty.

So the first step is to compute ⟨P_z⟩. To do that, I'll need to multiply the state vector by P_z, then take the inner product with the state vector. Alternatively, since the state is given as a column vector, I can compute the expectation value as the conjugate transpose of the state multiplied by P_z multiplied by the state.

But wait, the state is given as a column vector. Let me write down the components:

The state |ψ> is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So that's ψ₁ = -1/2, ψ₂ = 1/√2, ψ₃ = -1/2.

P_z is given as a matrix:

First row: ħ, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0,0,-ħ

So P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ along the diagonal.

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is ψ† P_z ψ.

But since P_z is diagonal, the expectation value is just the sum of |ψ_i|² multiplied by the diagonal elements.

Wait, because if the operator is diagonal, then ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ is the sum over i of ψ_i^* (P_z)_ii ψ_i.

Since the state is given, I can compute each term.

So let's compute each term:

(ψ₁)^2 * (P_z)₁₁ + (ψ₂)^2 * (P_z)₂₂ + (ψ₃)^2 * (P_z)₃₃

Wait, but ψ has complex numbers? Let me check. The state vector elements are -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2. All real numbers, so ψ
