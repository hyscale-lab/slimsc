Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and honestly, it's a bit intimidating because I'm just starting to learn about this. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves identifying Compound X, which has the formula C11H12O. It reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and we need to figure out which option (A, B, C, D) is correct.

Wait, but what's the reaction here? Oh, right! 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides. It's known as a catalyst or maybe part of the epoxidation process. Wait, no, no, wait. Oh, actually, that's an amine, and I think that in certain conditions, it can help in the epoxidation of alkenes, maybe using peracids or something else. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a ring-opening reaction. Hmm, but given the product's NMR, maybe it's an epoxide.

But wait, the product's structure is what's given through the NMR signals. So maybe Compound X is an epoxide that, upon reaction, forms something else, but wait, the question says that the reaction is done, and the product's NMR is given. Wait, no, actually, the question says the product's theoretical NMR is given, so we have to find the structure of the product and then see which option is the starting material, Compound X.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me read the question again. The product is formed when Compound X reacts with that reagent. So the product's NMR is given, and we need to find what Compound X was. So perhaps Compound X is an epoxide, and the reaction is a ring-opening? Or maybe the reaction converts a double bond into an epoxide.

Wait, another thought. The reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a catalyst for certain reactions. Oh! I remember that it's used in the Sharpless epoxidation,
