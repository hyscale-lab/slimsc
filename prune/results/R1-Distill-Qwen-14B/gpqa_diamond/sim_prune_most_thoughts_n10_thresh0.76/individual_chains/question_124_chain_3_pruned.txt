Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about particles moving in a detector and their Lorentz factor. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to think through this.

The problem says that particles are collided in the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new type, fast-decaying, and they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls. So, the initial situation is 1/3 reach, and we want to find the factor when it's 2/3.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma is the factor by which time dilates and lengths contract from the perspective of an observer. But how does that relate to the particles traveling through the detector?

I remember that the proper time (the time experienced by the moving particle) is different from the lab frame's time. So, the particle's lifetime as seen from the lab is longer due to time dilation. But how does that affect how far they travel before decaying?

Oh right, the mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame is gamma times its proper lifetime. So, if a particle has a proper lifetime tau, the lab sees it as gamma * tau. How far it travels is velocity multiplied by the time before decay.

Since these are ultra-relativistic particles, their velocity v is approximately the speed of light c. So, the distance they can travel before decaying is approximately c * gamma * tau.

But wait, the problem is about how many particles reach the detector walls. So, the ones that reach the walls must have a lifetime long enough to travel the radius of the detector. So, the condition is that the distance they travel equals the radius of the detector.

So, the distance D is c * gamma * tau. But since the particles are produced at the center, the radius is 30 meters. So, any particle that can reach that distance would reach the wall.

Wait, but the problem states that initially, at gamma ~20, only one third (1/3) of the particles reach the wall. So, that means that 2/3 decay before reaching the wall. So, perhaps the time they have is such that the mean lifetime is just enough for some fraction to reach the wall.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the decay length. The decay length is the average distance
