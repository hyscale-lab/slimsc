Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, or was it d in parsecs? Because parallax is in arcseconds, and 1 parsec is the distance where the parallax is 1 arcsecond. So yeah, plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs.

The problem says the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So substituting plx as 1/d, that would make N proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that. Wait, 1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5, because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, and 1 divided by that is d^5. So N ‚àù d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Oh, right, the question is asking for the number of stars per unit distance, like per parsec. So perhaps we need to find the derivative of N with respect to d, or maybe think about it in terms of a differential.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number density. If N
