Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question gives me some data: the distance to the galaxy is 10^10 parsecs, and the angular size of the event horizon is 1e-17 degrees. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula I think is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Oh right, and A is given by π r_s^2, where r_s is the Schwarzschild radius. So first, I need to find the radius of the event horizon.

But how do I get the radius from the angular size and distance? Angular size θ is given in degrees, but I think I need to work in radians. Oh, right, because the formula for angular size is θ ≈ r / D, where r is the size and D is the distance, when θ is small (in radians). So, converting θ from degrees to radians: θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180).

So, θ_rad is 1e-17 degrees * (π / 180). Let me calculate that. 1e-17 * π is about 3.14e-17, divided by 180 gives roughly 1.74e-19 radians.

Now, using θ ≈ r_s / D, so r_s = θ_rad * D. D is given as 1e10 parsecs. But wait, I need to convert parsecs to meters because the units for the Schwarzschild radius are in meters. Oh right, 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So D is 1e10 * 3.086e16 meters = 3.086e26 meters.

So r_s = θ_rad * D = (1.74e-19 radians) * (3.086e26 m). Let me compute that: 1.74e-19 * 3.086e26. Hmm, 1.74 *3.086 is about 5.36, and the exponents are 1e7 (because 1e-19 * 1e26 is 1e7). So r_s ≈ 5.36e7 meters. Wait, that's about 5.36e7 meters, or 53.6 kilometers? That seems really big for a supermassive black hole, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Supermassive black holes are millions to billions of solar masses. The Schwarzschild radius for a solar mass is about 3 km. So for a million solar masses, that's 3e6 km or 3e9 meters, which is 3e9 m. But according to my calculation, r_s is about 5e7 meters, which is 50 million meters, or 5e4 km. That's 50,000 km, which would correspond to a mass of about (r_s / 3e3 m) ) * M_sun. Wait, (5e7 m)/(3e3 m) is about 1.66e4, so about 16,666 solar masses. That seems a bit low for a supermassive black hole, but maybe the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck:

θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees.

θ_rad = 1e-17 * π/180 ≈ (1e-17) * 0.00001745 ≈ 1.745e-21 radians? Wait, no, wait: 1 degree is π/180 radians, which is approximately 0.01745 radians. So 1e-17 degrees is 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Oh wait, earlier I thought 1e-17 * pi/180 is about 1e-19, but 1e-17 * 0.01745 is about 1.745e-19. So previous calculation was correct.

So r_s = theta_rad * D = 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 m. Let me compute that: 1.745 * 3.086 ≈ 5.37, and 1e-19 * 1e26 is 1e
