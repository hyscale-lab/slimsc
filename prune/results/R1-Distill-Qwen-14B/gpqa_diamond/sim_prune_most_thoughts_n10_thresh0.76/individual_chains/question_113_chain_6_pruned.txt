Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas, all with carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The goal is to figure out which one is the correct formula based on the spectral data provided.

Let me start by going through each piece of information given.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It has a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad O-H peak. So, could this be a carboxylic acid group?

Then, the FTIR also shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is typical for a carbonyl, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 cm⁻¹ might be a conjugated carbonyl, perhaps an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, or maybe an amide, but there's no mention of N in the options, so probably not an amide. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, typically in alkenes. So the compound must have some double bonds, like an alkene group. So we're looking for something with a double bond, maybe a conjugated system.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. I remember that 45 is a common mass for certain fragments. Let me think: 45 could correspond to (CH3)2O (which is 45), but wait, (CH3)2O is ether, but that's not in the options. Alternatively, maybe (CH3)COO- would be something else. Wait, 45 could also be the fragment from a ketone group losing certain
