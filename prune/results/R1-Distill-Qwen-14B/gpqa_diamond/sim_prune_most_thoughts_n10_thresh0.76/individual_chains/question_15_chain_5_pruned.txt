Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

So, the setup is that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, both Earth-like. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest chance of transiting because they have limited time. Both are detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But both have the same mass. Interesting.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2 has period P, Planet_1 has P/3. Both have circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit.

The host stars: the star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they ended up same size. So same radius, but different masses. Planet_1's star is more massive.

I need to find which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability of a transit depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. But how do other factors like orbital period, star mass, and planet size influence this?

Wait, transit probability isn't just about alignment. It's also about the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. Oh right, the probability is proportional to (R_planet / a)^2 * (1 + (R_star / a))^(-1) or something like that? Or wait, I think the formula is (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2 + R_star^2)^2, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is approximately (R_p / (a(1 + m_star/M_planet))) but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, the transit probability is roughly (R_planet)/(a) squared, but considering the star's size as well.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the formula for the transit probability. The probability P is given by (R_p + R_s)^2 / ( (a_p (1 + (M_s/M_p)) )^2 ), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating it. Let's think about the factors that influence the transit probability.

Transit probability is higher when the planet is closer to
