Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, the formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that looks a bit complicated. I think it's some kind of hydrocarbon with double bonds. But wait, I'm not entirely sure; let me parse the structure.

So the molecule is made up of carbon and hydrogen atoms. The formula seems to have multiple CH3 groups attached. Like, maybe it's a branched structure with some double bonds. Maybe a diene or something. But the exact structure isn't crucial right now. The question is about enthalpy of formation, so I need to recall how that's calculated.

I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. The general formula is:

Enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) = [Σ (Bond energies of bonds broken) ] - [Σ (Bond energies of bonds formed) ]

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the energies of the bonds in the reactants (elemental forms) and the bonds formed in the product. So for a molecule, it's the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the elements (like C-C, C-H, etc.) minus the sum of the bond energies in the molecule. But wait, for the elements, like carbon and hydrogen, their standard states are considered. Carbon is graphite, and hydrogen is H2 gas.

So the formula is:

ΔHf = [ (number of C atoms × enthalpy of atomization of C) + (number of H atoms × bond energy of H-H) ] / 2 (because each H2 molecule has two H atoms)  ]  - [ sum of all bond energies in the molecule ]

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. When forming the molecule from its elements, you break bonds in the elements and form bonds in the compound.

Each carbon atom in the compound comes from elemental carbon. The enthalpy of atomization for carbon is given as 1000 kJ/mol, which I think is the energy required to break a C-C bond in graphite. So each C atom contributes 1000 kJ when it's atomized.

Wait, but in the molecule, how many C-C bonds are broken? Hmm, wait no, maybe I'm getting confused. Because
