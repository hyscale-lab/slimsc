Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and it's transiting its star, which has a radius 1.5 times the Sun's. The orbital period is 3 days. Now, there's a second planet with a radius of 2.5 Earth radii, and we need to find the maximum orbital period such that it also transits and undergoes occultation. So, what's going on here?

Wait, transiting means the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, right? And occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the star blocks the planet's light. Both events require the planets' orbits to be aligned along the same line of sight and same orbital plane, which they already are according to the question.

But how does the orbital period affect this? I think the key here is about the Hill sphere or the Roche lobe. Wait, no, maybe it's about the orbital stability. Or perhaps it's about the synodic period and whether the two planets can align in such a way that both events happen. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the size of the orbits. For both transiting and occultation to occur, the planets must orbit in such a way that their orbital distances allow them to pass in front and behind the star. But both planets need to have their orbits such that their paths cross the line of sight. So, perhaps it's about the maximum possible orbital period before the second planet's orbit is too large to be in the same system, maybe regarding the star's habitable zone or something else.

Wait, but the problem mentions that both planets are in circular orbits and share the same orbital plane. So, the main thing is their orbital periods. The first planet has a period of 3 days. The second's period is what we need to find.

I remember that for a planet to transit, its orbit must be edge-on relative to our line of sight. Also, for an occultation to occur, the planet must be larger than the star's disk when seen from our perspective, but wait, that's not the case here. Wait, occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so the star's light blocks the
