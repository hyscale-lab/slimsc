Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

Alright, the problem says that a supernova occurred, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, but how does this work with reference frames? I remember that when dealing with different frames, especially moving relative to each other, I need to consider the concept of relative velocity and possibly the effects of special relativity, like time dilation or length contraction. But wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. So maybe it's a simpler problem involving relative motion.

Wait, the problem is multiple-choice, so perhaps I can approach it using classical mechanics first and see if that makes sense. Oh, but wait, the speeds involved here are really highâ€”60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Wait, that's 60,000,000 m/s. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, so 6e7 m/s is 20% the speed of light. That's significant. So relativistic effects might come into play.

Wait, but let me think. If both
