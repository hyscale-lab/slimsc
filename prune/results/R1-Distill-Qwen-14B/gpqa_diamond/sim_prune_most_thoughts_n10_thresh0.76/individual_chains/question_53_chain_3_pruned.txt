Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think it through. So the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra.

First, the FTIR shows peaks for an ester group. Ester groups have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700 cm^-1, which is a strong peak. So the compound must have an ester functional group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's break them down.

- Two aromatic H signals: that suggests the ring has two types of aromatic protons. For a di-substituted benzene ring, the substitution pattern could be para, ortho, or meta. But wait, in a di-substituted ring, the number of unique aromatic protons depends on the substituents and their positions. For example, para substitution would lead to two sets of equivalent Hs, each as a doublet. But if the substituents are different, like in the case of an ester and another group, the splitting could be more complex. Alternatively, if the substituents are in the ortho positions, maybe we have more than two signals? Hmm, not sure, but the question says two signals, so maybe the substituents are such that the aromatic protons are in two distinct environments.

- Two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets or more complex splitting due to coupling with adjacent protons. The doublet of quartets suggests that a proton is coupling with two different sets of protons. Maybe it's adjacent to another group, like a CH2 or another CH group. Wait, but the problem says there are no CH2 signals, so perhaps the vinyl groups are part of an ester or another structure where CH2 isn't present.

- Two signals for â€“CH3 groups. So there are two different methyl groups. Each as a singlet? Or split? Since they're separate signals, they must be in different environments. For example, one methyl could be attached to an oxygen (like in an ester) and the other maybe part of a substituent on the ring.

So the compound has an ester group, a di-substituted benzene ring, some vinyl groups, and two different methyl groups.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has an ester substituent on the benzene ring. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe the benzene ring has an ester group and another substituent, like a vinyl group or another ester.

Wait, another point: the NMR shows no CH2 groups. So the molecule doesn't have any methylene (CH2) groups. That would mean any vinyl groups are either isolated or not part of a longer chain.

If the compound has an ester, it's likely in the form R-O-CO-R'. For ester groups, the carbonyl is in the IR. The ester's oxygen would be part of the substituent on the benzene ring.

Now, considering the di-substitution: perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group. Or maybe both substituents are ester-derived.

Wait, but the NMR has two vinyl H signals. So perhaps the substituent is a group that has two sets of vinyl protons. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester? Or perhaps a substituent like a styryl group (vinyl attached to the ring), but that might require more than two signals.

Wait, another thought: if the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring, and perhaps another substituent that's an ester. The vinyl group could be part of a substituent like CH2CH2COOR, but without CH2 groups, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-R, but that might have more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. For example, something like benzene with two ester groups, but wait, the ester would be a single group
