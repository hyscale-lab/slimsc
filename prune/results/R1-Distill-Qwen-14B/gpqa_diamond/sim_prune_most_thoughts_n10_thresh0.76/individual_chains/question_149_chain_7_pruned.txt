Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let's start by reading the problem carefully.

The question is about analyzing a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is what we expect. So, that suggests that each peak is about 0.5H, maybe? But the key point is that they integrate together to 1H, so it's not like they're splitting each other or anything. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the reason for the double peaks. Oh, wait, because if it was coupling, like if one proton was next to another with a similar shift, you'd see splitting. But in this case, they're saying based on the coupling they can rule that out. So what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Then looking at the LC-MS. The crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So the mass spectrum is consistent with the expected molecule. So it's not a fragment or a different isomer. What else? Well, if it's a racemic mixture, enantiomers, then the LC-MS would probably show two peaks because they have the same mass but different retention times if the column is chiral. But wait, the question says the LC-MS was done at elevated temperature. Hmm. Oh wait, if the LC-MS is using a regular column that isn't chiral, then enantiomers would elute at the same time, so you'd only see one peak. But if the column is chiral, then they'd split into two. But the question says two peaks of equal intensity with same mass, so maybe the column is chiral. So if the compound is a racemic mixture, that would explain two peaks in the LC-MS. But in the NMR, if the compound is a racemic mixture, then each peak in the NMR would represent protons from different enantiomers. Wait, but in that case, the NMR would average the signals because they are enantiomers. Unless... wait, no. For an enantiomer, the environment of the protons would be the same when considering all spatial arrangements. So their NMR signals would overlap. Hmm, that's confusing. So in the NMR, if the compound is a racemic mixture, would you see two peaks for the same proton?

Wait, no. Enantiomers are mirror images, so their proton environments are identical in terms of structure, so the NMR would show a single peak. Unless the sample is not pure. But in this case, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. So what else could cause that?

Another possibility: diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would have different NMR signals. So if the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, each would have their own set of protons. So in the NMR, individual protons from each would give separate peaks. But wait, the question says the integral is 1H because both peaks add up, so that suggests that each peak is for the same 1H, but split into two. Oh wait, no. If it's a diastereomer mixture, each diastereomer would have their own set of protons. So a single proton in each diastereomer would give a different shift. So if there are two diastereomers, each would contribute a peak for that alpha proton. So together, the integral would be 2H? No, because each diastereomer would have 1H of that proton. So if the mixture is 50:50, the integrals would add to 2H, but the question says it adds up to 1H. Wait, the question says together they integrate to 1H, the expected integral. So each peak is 0.5H maybe? Hmm, but that doesn't make much sense because each diastereomer would have the full 1H. Unless the two diastereomers are each present at 50% concentration, so each contributes 0.5H, so total 1H. But wait, the integral is for each peak. So maybe each peak is 1H? But the question says together they add to 1H, so that wouldn't fit. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, the NMR integrates each peak. So each peak is about 0.5H each. So together 1H. But why would each diastereomer contribute 0.5H? That would only happen if each diastereomer has 0.5H in that position. But that can't be right because each molecule has 1H. So perhaps the diastereomers are in a 1:1 ratio, but each contributes 1H each, so the integral would be 2H. But the problem says they integrate to 1H, so that's not matching. So perhaps di
