Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We're asked to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what's happening here. So acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When we titrate them, they'll react in a neutralization reaction. The reaction should be something like:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO-Na+ + H2O

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.

First, I need to find out the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 mL of water, the total volume becomes 40 mL. So the concentration after dilution would be half of the original because the volume doubles. So 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, that's right because concentration is moles per liter. So the moles of acetic acid before dilution are 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 mL water, total volume is 40 mL, so 0.04 L. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's see what happens at 25% titration and at equivalence.

First, let's find out the equivalence point.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution is 0.001 mol (since initial was 0.02 L * 0.05 = 0.001, and adding water doesn't change moles, only concentration).

So moles NaOH needed = 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. The diluted acetic acid is 20 mL of 0.05 M, so 0.02 L *0.05 = 0.001 mol. Then after adding 20 mL water, volume is 40 mL, so concentration is 0.025 M. So same moles, 0.001 mol.

So to neutralize that, moles NaOH = 0.001. So volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL.

So equivalence point occurs when 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question is about the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 mL? Because 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: 25% of the equivalence point. So when 25% of the required NaOH is added, that's 2.5 mL.

So for 25% titration, we're adding 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH.

Let me calculate the moles of NaOH added: 0
