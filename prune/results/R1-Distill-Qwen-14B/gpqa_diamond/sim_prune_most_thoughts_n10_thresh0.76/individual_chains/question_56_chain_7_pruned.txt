Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the |3,0,0> state decays to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons, and dipole transitions have certain selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules again? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the angular momentum quantum number l can change by one unit, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

So the initial state is |3,0,0>. The final state is |1,0,0>. So the initial n is 3, l is 0, and m is 0. The final n is 1, l is 0, m is 0. Wait, but wait, going from l=0 to l=0 isn't allowed by the selection rules. Because Δl has to be ±1. So that can't happen in a single transition. Oh, right, the question says it's via two dipole transitions. So it must go through an intermediate state.

So first, the 3,0,0 state must transition to some higher or lower state, but according to selection rules, l can change by ±1. So from l=0, it can go to l=1. So the first transition is from n=3, l=0, m=0 to a state with l=1, but m can change by 0, ±1.

Wait, but in the first transition, the state can only go to l=1. So possible states are |3,1, m'>, where m' is m ±1 or same. Since m started at 0, m' can be -1, 0, +1.

So possible first steps from |3,0,0> are to |3,1, -1>, |3,1,0>, or |3,1,1>.

Then, from there, another dipole transition is needed to reach |1,0,0>. Let's see the second transition.

In the intermediate state, l is 1. So for the second transition, Δl must be ±1 again. So from l=1, we can go to l=0 or l=2. But the target is |1,0,0>, which has l=0. So the second transition must decrease l from 1 to 0.

So for the second transition, l goes from 1 to 0. So the second state must be |n',1,m''> transitioning to |1,0,0>. Wait, but the target n is 1. So the second transition must change n from 3 to 1 in two steps. Oh wait, no, the first transition might change n, but for hydrogen, the energy levels are quantized. So n can only be integers, and each transition can only change n by ±1 (or more, but in dipole, it's usually ±1).

Wait, no, actually, is that a correct statement? The selection rule for n is a bit more flexible. I think the main selection rule for electric dipole is that Δn ≠ 0, and for hydrogen, it's usually allowed as long as Δl is ±1. So for example, n can change by more than 1, but you have to consider the possible states in between.

Wait, but for the first transition, from n=3, l=0, we can go to n=2, l=1, because Δl = +1. Or could we go to n=4, l=1? Hmm, but that's a higher energy state. If the state is decaying, it's going from higher to lower energy, so probably from n=3 to lower n. So the first transition would likely go to n=2, l=1, m= something.

Wait, but the initial state is |3,0,0>. Let's consider possible first transitions. So from |3,0,0>, l=0. So the first transition must go to l=1. So possible states are |3,1, m'>, but n can't be higher than 3 because we're decaying, or wait, no, maybe it can. But in the case of emission, the atom is going from higher energy to lower energy, so n would decrease. So first transition could be from n=3 to n=2, with l=1.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the energy levels. The energy of a hydrogen state is given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So n
