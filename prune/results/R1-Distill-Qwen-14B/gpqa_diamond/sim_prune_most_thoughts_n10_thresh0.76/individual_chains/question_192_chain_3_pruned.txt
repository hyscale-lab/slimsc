Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. 

The setup is this: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity, radius r, and its center is a distance s away from the main conductor's center. So the cavity isn't at the center of the big sphere. Then, someone places a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. Now, the question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. P is at a distance L from the main center, and l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. The angle between l and s is theta. 

Wait, okay, so I remember that in electrostatics, especially with conductors, the charges redistribute in certain ways. Since the conductor is uncharged, I think the total charge on it is zero. But when we place a charge inside the cavity, that would induce some charges on the conductor.

Right, when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces an opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, because the conductor is neutral, that inner surface would have -q. Then, the outer surface would have +q to balance, since the total is zero. But wait, noâ€”wait, if the conductor was initially neutral, the induced charges would have to sum to zero. So, the inner surface would have -q, making the outer surface +q. Because the conductor's initial charge is zero, so the total charge after induction is zero. So, the inner surface has -q, outer has +q.

But the point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field there is due to all the charges enclosed within the Gaussian surface. So for the conductor, any charges outside the Gaussian surface (which is at P) won't contribute. Wait, no. Wait, the Gaussian surface is a sphere around point P, but the conductor's outer surface is at radius R. So, the +q on the outer surface is at R. So for a point outside the conductor, the field is due to all the charges inside the Gaussian surface, which includes the conductor and the cavity, but wait, the conductor's outer surface is the only part that contributes to the field outside, right?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor itself is neutral, but
