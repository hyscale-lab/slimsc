Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options given are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The possible choices are combinations of these, labeled A to D.

First, I need to recall what each symmetry entails and whether they're required for SMEFT operators.

Starting with Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? So all the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. That means Lorentz (option 1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh wait, but in effective field theories, I think they usually have global symmetries, not necessarily the full Poincare because diffeomorphisms are not part of the symmetry group in a fixed background. Or wait, no. Wait, wait, SMEFT is a relativistic theory, so it should respect Poincare symmetry. Because Poincare includes translations and Lorentz transformations. But wait, in the effective theory, the background is usually fixed, so maybe the full Poincare isn't required? Or is it that the theory must be Poincare symmetric because it's a field theory in Minkowski space.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: The Standard Model is a Poincare-invariant theory. SMEFT extends it, so SMEFT operators must also respect Poincare symmetry. So both 1 and 2 would be required.

Wait, but wait. In effective theories, sometimes you can have operators that are not Lorentz invariant, but no, SMEFT specifically is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely required.

Now, what about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. Well, in the SMEFT framework, the operators have to be constructed in such a way that they are invariant under both, I think. So yes, Poincare symmetry (option 2) must be respected.

Wait, but maybe Poincare is a subset of the symmetries that include Lorentz and translations. So if the theory respects
