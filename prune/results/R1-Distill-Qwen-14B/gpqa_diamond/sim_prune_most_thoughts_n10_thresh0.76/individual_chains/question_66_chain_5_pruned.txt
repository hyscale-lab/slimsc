Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model plus higher-dimensional operators. But wait, what's an effective theory again? Oh right, it's a way to model physics beyond a certain scale by adding higher-order terms to the Standard Model Lagrangian. 

The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think about each symmetry.

Lorentz symmetry: I think that's the one that includes rotations and boosts. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, all operators must respect this. Because if they don't, the theory would predict different outcomes in different inertial frames, which doesn't make sense physically. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

Poincare symmetry: That includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like momentum conservation). Wait, but Poincare is a bigger symmetry group that includes Lorentz and translations. But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are local, so they must respect local symmetries. Or do they? Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Because Poincare symmetry implies that the theory is invariant under diffeomorphisms, but SMEFT is constructed in a way that incorporates all the Standard Model symmetries, which are local. Wait, no, the Poincare group is about spacetime symmetries, including translations. But I remember that SMEFT doesn't require all operators to respect all Poincare symmetries because some operators can break translation invariance, but wait, no. Because the way SMEFT is constructed is by adding operators that are invariant under the Standard Model group and Lorentz symmetry. Wait, but Poincare includes translations, so do the SMEFT operators respect that? Because the operators are supposed to be local, I think they have to be translationally invariant. Otherwise, the theory would depend on the point in space, which shouldn't happen. So Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. But SMEFT operators are part of a local theory, so they must be invariant under Poincare? So if they respect Lorentz, do they automatically respect Poincare? Or not necessarily? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, I think all operators in SMEFT are local, so they must
