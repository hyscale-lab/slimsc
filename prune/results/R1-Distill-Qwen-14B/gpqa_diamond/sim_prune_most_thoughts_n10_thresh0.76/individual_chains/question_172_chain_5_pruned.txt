Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere relates to the thermal energy of the star. The hotter the star, the more energy the atoms have, right?

They mention the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that's the energy difference ΔE. I think this is connected to the Boltzmann distribution, which tells us how particles are distributed in energy levels in thermal equilibrium (LTE here).

Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. So for two states, say E_upper and E_lower, the ratio is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

But wait, the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So let's clarify: in star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state compared to the ground state (or perhaps the ratio compared to star_2) is higher. Wait, the question states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So maybe the ratio n_excited/n_ground in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is the population of a specific level. So n1 for star_1 and n2 for star_2. The problem says n1 = 2 * n2.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get this clear. The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2. So if star_2 has x excited atoms, star_1 has 2x. But wait, is that the same as the ratio of excited to ground states? Or is it the absolute number of excited atoms?

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is the ratio of the populations of two energy levels. Let's say for each star, the ratio is R =
