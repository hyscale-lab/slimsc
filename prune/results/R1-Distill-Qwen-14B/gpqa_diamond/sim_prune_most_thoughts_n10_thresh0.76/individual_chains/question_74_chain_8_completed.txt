Okay, so I've got this problem here about radioactive decay probabilities. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that an atom has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it has decayed. Wait, but wait, in radioactive decay, I remember that the decay process follows an exponential law, right? So the decay constant is involved, and the probability of decay isn't just a fixed percentage over a certain time. Hmm.

Wait, the probability given is 32% over 100 minutes. So that would mean that the survival probability is 68% after 100 minutes. Because 100% minus 32% decayed is 68% remaining. Oh right, because the decay formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where N(t) is the remaining quantity after time t.

But wait, the problem is about the probability that it decays in a specific time period, given that it hasn't decayed yet. So, they told us that after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. Now, we need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So that would be from 50 to 200 minutes total, but wait, no, wait. Or is it the next 150 minutes after the 50, which would make it 200 minutes total? Or do we consider the next 150 minutes from the current point, so 50 +150=200 minutes from the start? But the problem says "the next 150 minutes," so I think it's the total time since the start, but no, no, wait. Let me read the question again.

No, the question says: 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. What's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? So the next 150 minutes is from the current time, so the total time would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. So wait, the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

I think in radioactive decay, the probability of decay in a certain time is independent of when you start. So the probability that it decays between t1 and t2 is the same as starting a new timer at t1. So after 50 minutes, the remaining time is 150 minutes, but does that mean the same as considering 150 minutes from now, but with an updated survival probability?

Wait, no. Let me think. The decay probability in a given time is based on the remaining time. So, the probability of decay between t=0 and t=100 is 32%. So the decay constant λ can be calculated from that. Because the survival probability after time t is P = e^(-λt). So, if after 100 minutes, the survival is 68%, then 68% = e^(-λ*100). So taking the natural log, ln(0.68) = -λ*100. So λ = ln(1/0.68)/100 ≈ ln(1.47)/100. Let me compute ln(1.47). Hmm, I think ln(1.6) is about 0.47, but 1.47 is a bit less. Maybe approximately 0.386? So λ ≈ 0.00386 per minute.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it precisely. Let me think. ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So λ would be 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the problem says that after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So the survival probability up to 50 minutes is e^(-λ *50). The question is, what is the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes? So the time from 50 to 200 minutes.

In radioactive decay, the probability that it decays between t and t+Δt is given by the decay probability formula, which is 1 - e^(-λΔt). But wait, that's the probability if you start fresh. But since the atom has already survived 50 minutes, we need to find the probability from t=50 to t=200.

Wait, but the survival up to t=50 is e^(-λ*50). The probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes from now. Because the decay process is memoryless. So the probability is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, but wait, the initial 32% is given for 100 minutes. So we can find λ from that. Let me recompute λ.

Given that the survival after 100 minutes is 68%, so:

e^(-λ *100) = 0.68 => λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100 = ln(1.47)/100 ≈ 0.38566/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So now, to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes (from t=50 to t=200), that's the same as the probability of decay over 150 minutes. So it's 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Let me compute that. λ=0.0038566 per minute. So 150 * λ ≈ 150 * 0.0038566 ≈ 0.5785.

So e^(-0.5785) ≈ 0.561. So 1 - 0.561 ≈ 0.439, which is about 43.9%. Looking at the options, the closest is option A:44% or D:48%.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate more accurately. Let me compute λ precisely. 

Given that the survival after 100 minutes is 0.68.

So λ = ln(1/0.68) /100 ≈ ln(1.47006) /100.

What's ln(1.47006)? Let me think. I know that ln(1.4) is approximately 0.3365, ln(1.5)=0.4055. 1.47 is between 1.4 and 1.5.

Let me compute it more accurately. Let me use a calculator approach in my mind. Let me approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the exact equation from the given data. Wait, maybe I don't need to compute λ explicitly because the decay probabilities can be combined.

Wait, the survival probability after 100 minutes is 0.68. So the decay probability in 100 minutes is 0.32.

If I denote t1=100, P(t1)=0.32.

We have P(t) = 1 - e^(-λ t).

So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100) => e^(-λ *100)=0.68.

We need to find the probability of decay in 150 minutes from t=50. So Δt=150. So the probability is P(150)=1 - e^(-λ *150).

But since we have λ from 100 minutes, perhaps we can relate the two.

We can write λ *150 = (λ *100) * (150/100) )= 1.5 * (λ *100).

Since e^(-λ *100) = 0.68, so e^(-1.5 * λ *100) = (e^(-λ *100))^1.5 = (0.68)^1.5.

So P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5.

Compute (0.68)^1.5. Let's see. 0.68 squared is 0.4624. The square root of 0.68 is about 0.8246. So 0.4624 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.381.

So 1 - 0.381=0.619, which is 61.9%? That can't be right because the options don't have that. Wait, wait, I think I messed up the calculation.

Wait, another approach: 0.68^1.5 is equal to sqrt(0.68^3). 0.68^3= 0.68 *0.68=0.4624, 0.4624 *0.68 ≈ 0.314. sqrt(0.314)= approx 0.5606. So 1 - 0.5606≈ 0.4394, which is about 43.94%. So approximately 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but another way: perhaps the decay is 32% in 100 minutes. So maybe the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 32% * (150/100) = 48%? But that approach is incorrect because the decay is exponential, not linear. So that would be a wrong method.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is being treated as a conditional probability. So the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.

Wait, perhaps the total time is 50 +150=200 minutes. So the probability that it decays in 200 minutes minus the probability that it has already decayed in 50 minutes.

Wait, no, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed before 50. That is, it's a conditional probability.

So, the approach would be:

Probability = (Probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes) / (Probability of surviving 50 minutes).

Because it's given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, so the conditional probability.

So:

P(decay between 50 and 200) = [1 - e^(-λ *200)] - [1 - e^(-λ *50)] = e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200).

But wait, the probability is conditional, so it's [P(50 < t < 200)] / [P(t>50)].

Which simplifies to [e^(-λ50) - e^(-λ200)] / e^(-λ50) = [1 - e^(-λ150)].

Which brings us back to the same 43.94%, which is approx 44%. So the correct answer is option A) 44%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 52% and option D is 48%. Hmm. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, another approach: the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so the half-life can be found, and then use it to find the probability in 150 minutes from the current time.

Wait, wait, but wait. The half-life T_1/2 is related to λ by T_1/2 = ln(2)/λ.

But perhaps it's easier to express λ in terms of the half-life. But wait, wait, but the given data is for 32% decay in 100 minutes, which isn't a half-life, which is 50% decay. So perhaps we can find the half-life first.

Wait, but given that after 100 minutes, 32% have decayed, which means 68% have survived. So 0.68 = e^(-λ*100) => λ = ln(1/0.68)/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So now, after 50 minutes, the atom has not decayed, so the probability it's still there is e^(-λ*50)= e^(-0.0038566 *50) ≈ e^(-0.19283)= approx 0.825.

Now, the question is, what's the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes (from t=50 to t=200). So the time from now is 150 minutes.

The probability is 1 - e^(-λ*150).

λ=0.0038566 per minute. So λ*150=0.57849.

e^(-0.57849)= approximately 0.561.

So 1 -0.561=0.439, which is 43.9% or about 44%, which is option A.

But wait, another approach: Maybe the question is phrased as the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, but considering that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. So the total time is 200 minutes, and the probability of decay in 200 minutes minus the probability of decay in 50 minutes.

Wait, no, the probability that it decays within 200 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ *200), and it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, so the conditional probability is [1 - e^(-λ*200)] - [1 - e^(-λ*50)] ) divided by e^(-λ*50).

Which again gives [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) = 1 - e^(-λ *150) ≈ 43.9%.

So, the answer should be 44% option A. But looking at the options, option A is 44%, which is one of the choices.

But wait, wait. Let me check the calculation of e^-0.578.

Using more precise calculation: 0.57849.

Let me think about e^-0.578.

We know that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488.

0.578 is between 0.5 and 0.6, so the value would be between 0.5488 and 0.6065. Let's use linear approximation, but perhaps a better way is to compute it.

Alternatively, using a calculator:

e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.561.

Yes, that's what I had earlier. So 1 - 0.561=0.439, which is 43.9%, close to 44%, so option A.

But wait, the options don't have 44% as the correct answer? Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A)44%

B)40%

C)52%

D)48%

So yes, 44% is option A.

Wait, but wait another thought. The initial decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, which is less than 50%, implying a longer half-life. Maybe I should think about the half-life.

Wait, the half-life T_1/2 is ln(2)/λ. We have λ=0.0038566 per minute.

So ln(2)=0.6931. So T_1/2=0.6931 / 0.0038566≈ 180 minutes. So the half-life is about 180 minutes.

So after 50 minutes, the remaining quantity is (1/2)^(50/180) = (1/2)^(1/3.6) ≈ approximately (about 0.825) or 82.5% remains. Which matches what I found earlier.

So the decay probability in the next 150 minutes would be 1 - e^(-λ *150). But with λ=0.0038566, λ*150=0.5785, e^-0.5785≈0.561. So 1-0.561=0.439≈43.9%, which rounds to 44%.

So the correct answer is option A) 44%.


To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential law. The survival probability of an atom after time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. From the problem, we know that the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68% (since the decay probability is 32% over 100 minutes). This allows us to calculate \( \lambda \):

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68 \implies \lambda = \frac{\ln(1/0.68)}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

The question asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability problem. The probability of decay in a given time interval is memoryless, so the decay probability in the next 150 minutes depends only on the survival probability up to the current time.

The survival probability after 50 minutes is:

\[
P(50) = e^{-\lambda \cdot 50} \approx e^{-0.0038566 \cdot 50} \approx 0.825.
\]

The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:

\[
P_{\text{decay}} = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}.
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \) and \( \lambda \cdot 150 \approx 0.5785 \):

\[
e^{-0.5785} \approx 0.561 \implies P_{\text{decay}} = 1 - 0.561 \approx 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%.
\]

Rounding to the nearest option, the probability is approximately 44%. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
