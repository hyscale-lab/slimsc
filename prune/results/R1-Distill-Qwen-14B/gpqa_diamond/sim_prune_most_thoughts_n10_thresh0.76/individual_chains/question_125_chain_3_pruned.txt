Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: We have a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that this is a harmonic oscillator potential because it's quadratic in r. The question is about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, right. In quantum mechanics, for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. I think the energy depends on the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the potential is symmetric in all directions, so the energy should be the same regardless of the direction of the quantum numbers.

Wait, for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ℏω, where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh wait, wait. No, I think each direction contributes a quantum number, say nx, ny, nz, and the total n is nx + ny + nz. So the energy would be E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ℏω. Or is it (n + 3/2) where n is the sum?

Yes, I think so. So n is the principal quantum number in this context, which is nx + ny + nz. Each of these can be 0,1,2,... So for n=0, energy is 3/2 ℏω. That's the ground state.

Now, the states are degenerate because different combinations of (nx, ny, nz) can give the same n. For example, n=0: (0,0,0) → only one state. n=1: (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) → three states. n=2: possible combinations are (2,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), and (1,0,1) etc. Wait, no, wait. For n=2, the possible (nx, ny, nz) combinations where nx + ny + nz =2. The number of states is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to that equation. But wait, each permutation counts as a different state except when some are the same. So for n=2, the number of states is (2
