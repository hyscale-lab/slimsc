Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it carefully again.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to select the correct reagents A and B from the options given. Let me break it down step by step.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide like NaCN, it's probably a nucleophilic addition. In such reactions, the ketone's carbonyl group is attacked by the cyanide ion. But what reagent would facilitate or be involved here?

Wait, I think that the addition of NaCN to a ketone typically requires some acid catalysis. Oh right, I remember that when you add a nitrile to a ketone, you usually need an acid like H3O+ (which is sulfuric acid maybe?), because the acid helps protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic. So the first step is the acid-catalyzed addition of the cyanide.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is likely H3O+ because that's the catalyst for the nucleophilic addition of CN⁻ to the ketone. That makes sense. So, looking at the options, any option where A is H3O+ would be a candidate. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, okay, so the nitrile group is turning into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I recall that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. There are different methods for nitrile hydrolysis. One common way is under acidic conditions with water and heat. Another is using a strong base. Wait, but the product here is a carboxylic acid, not an amide or an acid chloride or anything else. So the conditions are probably for the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid.

Wait, the reagent B is given as H2O, but maybe it's part of a hydrolysis process. Oh, but what's the catalyst? For the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid, I think it's typically done with a strong acid or a strong base, and heat.

Wait, another thought. If you have a nitrile adjacent to an alcohol group, like in this molecule, then maybe it's a hydrolysis under specific conditions. Let me think about possible reactions. Oh, wait, maybe it's a hydrolysis where the nitrile is converted to an acid via a two-step process: first to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid. Or perhaps using a strong acid and water.

Wait, another approach: when a nitrile is treated with H2O and a strong acid like HCl, it can hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Or wait, sometimes, for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, you use a mixture of H2SO4 and H2O under reflux, right? So the reagent B might be something like HCl or another strong acid. Because in the options, B could be HCl or CH3COOH.

Looking at the product, it's a carboxylic acid, so it's the fully oxidized form. The reaction is probably using an acid catalyst. So, for the second step, reagent B is HCl because that would provide the acidic conditions needed for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the question states that reagent B is H2O. So the reaction is with B, which is H2O, but maybe B is the catalyst? Wait, no. Let me read the problem again. The second reaction says: ... + B (H2O) --> ... So the reagent B is H2O
