Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question is about treating two compounds, A and B, with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment produces two different diketones. I need to find out which starting materials A and B are from the options given.

Wait, wait. I remember that when you treat certain compounds with HCl, NaNO2, and H2O, especially under acidic conditions, it's related to diazotization reactions. Diazonium salts maybe? Oh, right! Diazotization is typically done with primary aromatic amines, right? But wait, no, wait. Diazonium salts are formed from aromatic amines, but in some cases, maybe aliphatic amines can form diazonium salts under certain conditions. Or perhaps this isn't about amination... Hmm.

Wait, another thought. Oh, wait! There's a reaction called the Stephen reduction or something else. No, maybe I'm mixing it up. Another possibility: when a compound has a leaving group, perhaps a substitution reaction occurs. But wait, hydrochloric acid, sodium nitriteâ€”oh, maybe it's about the Beckmann rearrangement. That's when you have a hydroxylamine reacting with a ketone or aldehyde, forming an oxime, which can undergo rearrangement. But the conditions here are HCl, NaNO2, and water. Oh! Right, when you have a ketone and you treat it with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and H2
