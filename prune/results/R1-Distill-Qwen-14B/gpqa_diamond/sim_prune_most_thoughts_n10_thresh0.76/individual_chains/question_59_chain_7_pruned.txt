Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it looks a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that's a mix of an acid and a base, so I think the first thing I need to do is figure out whether the overall solution is acidic or basic.

Let me list out the given information. We have:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

Wait, but wait a second. I remember that mixing an acid with a base can lead to a neutralization reaction. So maybe the HCl and Ba(OH)2 will react first, and then whatever is left will determine the pH. Oh, right, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and HCl is a strong acid, so they should react completely.

But first, I need to calculate the moles of each component because that's the key to figuring out the reaction.

Let's start by calculating moles for each solution.

For CH3COOH: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M, so moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl: volume is 400 mL → 0.4 L. Molarity 0.2 M → 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2: volume is 300 mL → 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M → 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of OH- ions because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+ ion.

So the moles of H+ from HCl are 0.08 moles.

Now, when you mix an acid and a base, they react based on H+ and OH-.

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the moles of H+ from HCl are 0.08, and OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18. So which one is in excess?

The OH- is in excess because 0.18 > 0.08. So the H+ will completely neutralize 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait another thing. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely, right? So all the OH- comes from it. HCl is a strong acid, so all H+ comes from that.

So after neutralizing, the remaining OH- is 0.10 moles. But wait, that's just the part from the Ba(OH)2 that wasn't neutralized. Oh, but actually, the Ba(OH)2 is in solution, so when we neutralize some of it with HCl, how much Ba^2+ and OH- is left?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of total moles after mixing all three solutions.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. We have three solutions mixed together. So the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL
