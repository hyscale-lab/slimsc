Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my titration calculations, but let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? That would make the concentration of acetic acid half, since we're doubling the volume. So the new concentration is 0.025 M. Because Molarity is moles/volume, so if you double the volume, concentration halves.

Next, we're titrating this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part asks about the pH at 25% titration, and then the pH at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Wait, 25% titration. So that means we've added 25% of the NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. Let me think: equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

So first, I need to find the equivalence point volume. Let's calculate the moles of acetic acid initially. The initial volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) times 0.05 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

Since acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base, the reaction is 1:1. So moles of NaOH needed at equivalence point is also 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration. 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, but wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³ after dilution. Hmm no, equivalence point depends on moles, not the total solution volume. So yeah, 10 cm³ is correct.

So 25% titration means we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Because 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. Right?

Wait, so when we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, how many moles of NaOH is that? Moles = 0.1 * (2.5 / 1000) = 0.0025 * 0.1? Wait, wait, 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L. So 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles of NaOH.

Wait, no. Wait, 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 liters. So 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mo
