Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one when approximating the matrix exponential function with a fractional approximation.

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that in solving PDEs numerically, especially with methods like finite differences, we often end up with systems of equations that can be represented as matrix equations. For heat equations, the matrix might be sparse because each point only interacts with its neighbors. 

When dealing with higher dimensions, the matrix becomes larger and solving the system directly can be computationally intensive. So, methods like matrix exponentiation or using iterative solvers are often employed. Oh wait, but the question mentions higher-order finite differences and parallel splitting. 

Parallel splitting... I think that refers to methods like the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method or similar splitting techniques where you split the problem into smaller parts that can be solved concurrently. This is done to make the computation more efficient on parallel architectures.

The question says the matrix exponential is approximated by a fractional approximation. Matrix exponentials are often used in methods like the exponential time integration, where the solution is expressed in terms of the exponential of the matrix multiplied by time steps. But approximating this exponential can be tricky. Fractional approximations might refer to using a rational function approximation or something like Padé approximants to approximate the exponential function.

Now, the key factor for converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. Sequential algorithms process steps one after another, while parallel algorithms handle them simultaneously. For heat equations, the sequential approach might involve solving each time step after the previous one. To make it parallel, perhaps the time steps are split or the spatial dimensions are handled in a way that allows parallel computation.

Wait, the key factor here—what's necessary to make this split possible? I'm thinking about the structure of the problem. If the approximation of the matrix exponential can be broken down into parts that don't interfere with each other, that would allow parallel processing.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: That's about ensuring the numerical method doesn't produce growing errors. But stability is important regardless of whether it's sequential or parallel. Not sure if it's the key factor here.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal boundary conditions can complicate things, but I'm not sure how that directly relates to converting to a parallel algorithm. Maybe it's more about how the boundaries are handled, but perhaps not the main factor for parallelism.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: If the approximation function has complex roots, that might affect the stability or the form of the approximation. But does it relate to parallel processing? I'm not quite getting the connection.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fraction decomposition is a method used to break down complex fractions into simpler parts. If the approximation can be linearly decomposed, that might allow the problem to be split into independent parts, each handled by a processor in parallel. That sounds plausible.

Wait, so if the fractional approximation can be written as a sum of simpler fractions, each corresponding to a different term that can be computed independently, then each part can be assigned to a different processor. That would make the algorithm parallel because each part
