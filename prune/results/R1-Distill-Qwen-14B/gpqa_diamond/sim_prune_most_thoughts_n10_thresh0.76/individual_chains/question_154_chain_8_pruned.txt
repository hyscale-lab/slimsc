Okay, so I've got this problem where a chemist found an unnamed white solid, and I need to figure out what it is using the spectral data provided. Let's break down the information step by step.

First, the mass spec data shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%) and another peak at 158 (32%). I remember that molecular ion peaks usually correspond to the molecular formula's exact mass. The 158 peak is probably a fragment or maybe an isotope. Let me think about the possible molecular formulas here. The molecular weight is 156, so maybe the formula is something like C8H7O3? Or maybe another combination. Wait, let me calculate the possible formula. Let's think about the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's see, benzaldehyde is C7H6O. If it has a Cl and another OH group, maybe the formula is C7H5ClO2? Let me calculate the molecular weight. Carbon is 12*7=84, Hydrogen 5=5, Cl is about 35.5, O is 2*16=32. Total is 84+5+35.5+32=156.5. Hmm, but the molecular ion is at 156. So that might not fit. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl, so C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5, 2*16=32. Total is 84+5+35.5+32=156.5. Again, same as option A.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Chloroformate is ClCO-O-. Phenyl group would be C6H5. So the formula is C6H5ClO2CO? Wait, no, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O- attached to something. So phenyl chloroformate would be C6H5ClCO2? Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: C7 is 84, H5 is 5, Cl is 35.5, O2 is 32. So total 84+5+35.5+32=156.5. Same as before. Hmm.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same as option B, formula would be C7H5ClO2, same molecular weight 156.5. So all options except C have molecular weight around 156.5. But the molecular ion is at m/z 156, which is 1 lower than that. Oh wait, maybe the molecular formula is C8H7O3Cl? Let me calculate that
