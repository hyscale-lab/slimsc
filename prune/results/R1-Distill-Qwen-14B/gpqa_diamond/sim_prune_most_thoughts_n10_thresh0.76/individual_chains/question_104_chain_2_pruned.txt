Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets by measuring the Doppler shift of the spectral lines. 

Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, which relates to the planet's orbit. The formula I think involves the velocity semi-amplitude, K. The Doppler shift is related to this K. Oh right, the shift in wavelength is proportional to the velocity. So the shift (delta lambda) is proportional to K, which is the star's velocity.

So the formula for K is given by:
K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( 1 / ( (P * (1 - e²)^(1.5) ) ) ) ) 

But wait, since the planets have similar masses to Neptune, their masses are much less than the stars' (which are like the Sun). So M_p is negligible compared to M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, which is the Sun's mass. So K simplifies a bit.

K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_star^(1/3)) )  * (1/(P * (1 - e²)^1.5 )) )

Wait, but maybe it's better to think in terms of the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift is proportional to the star's velocity, K. And K is related to the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the distance from the star.

Wait, another approach: the RV method's detected velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) (P)^(
