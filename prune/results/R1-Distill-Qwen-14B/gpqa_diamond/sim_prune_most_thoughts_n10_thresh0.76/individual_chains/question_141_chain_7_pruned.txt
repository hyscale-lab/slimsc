Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are. The options are A) 4, B) 1, C) 2, D) 3.

Hmm, wait, first off, I'm a bit confused about the structure of the starting material. The name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, right? So numbering the positions, 1 and 2 would be adjacent. Oh wait, maybe the 'd' is a typo? Oh, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene, but that doesn't sound right. Or perhaps it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Maybe the 'd' stands for something else. Oh wait, perhaps it's a typo, and the correct name is 1-bromo-2-chlorobenzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-fluorobenzene? Or perhaps it's a deuterated compound. Wait, the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a strong base. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation reaction or some kind of elimination.

Wait, wait, maybe the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the benzene ring has bromine at position 1 and a deuterium (d) at position 2. So
