Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem has two separate reactions, and I need to figure out the major products A and B, then choose the correct option from A to D. Alright, let's break them down one by one.

First Reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol treated with THF, KH, H+ gives product A.

Hmm, I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. Wait, but when it's followed by H+, that usually implies some kind of acid workup. So what reactions involve strong bases like KH in THF? Oh right, I think this is about deprotonation and then possibly some kind of elimination or cyclization.

The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro means it's connected through a single atom, right? So 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Let me imagine the structure. The spiro atom is the 1-position, connected to a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) and another part which is non-5-en-ol. So the molecule has two rings connected at the spiro carbon.

Wait, maybe it's a bicyclic system? Because when you have spiro compounds reacting, sometimes they undergo ring-opening or cyclization. But in this case, with a strong base like KH, maybe it's a deprotonation followed by an elimination reaction. 

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So it's a spiro compound with two rings: one is a 3-membered ring (since the first number is 3) and the other is a 5-membered ring. Wait, no, wait. The notation spiro[m.n]... means m and n are the number of carbons in each ring attached to the spiro atom. So spiro[3.5]non... would have a total of (3 + 5 + 2) because the spiro carbon is shared. Wait, non is nine carbons. Hmm, maybe not. Wait,
