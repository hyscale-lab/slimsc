Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh right, the formula is something like Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Since both planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out, so I don't need to worry about that.

Wait, but how do I find the distance of each planet from the star? The problem gives me information about the RV method and the transit method. Oh, right, the RV method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis (a) through the Doppler shift. The transit method gives the radius of the planet and the semi-major axis from the depth of the transit.

But in this problem, both methods are used, so I probably need to find the semi-major axis for each planet using the RV data. Oh wait, the RV data gives the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for RV is something like K = (v*sin i) where K is the semi-amplitude. But I also know that K depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the distance a. Oh right, the formula is K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ (some power)) ... Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital period and a.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty. Let me recall the radial velocity formula. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3 * (1 - e^2)) ) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )

Hmm, but this might get complicated. Alternatively, I remember that for circular orbits (e=0), the formula
