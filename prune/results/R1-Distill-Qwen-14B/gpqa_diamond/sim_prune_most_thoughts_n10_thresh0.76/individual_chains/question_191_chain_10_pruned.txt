Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think through it step by step. The question involves a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the structure of the final product, product 4. Let's break it down.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize that. So, it's a cyclohexanone ring (so a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 1). At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group, which is CH2OH. And at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is CH2-C(CH2)-. Wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2? No, wait, the substituent is at the 2 position. So the structure is CH2-C double bond CH2? Wait, no, maybe it's more like CH2-CH2-C. No, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is the substituent where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is attached at carbon 2. So it's CH2=C(CH2...? No, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second carbons, but the substituent is attached at the second carbon? Wait, no, maybe it's CH2-CH-CH2, but with a double bond between the first and second. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. It's probably an allyl group attached at the central carbon. So it's like CH2-C=CH2, but attached at the middle carbon. So the substituent is CH2-C=CH2, but attached to the cyclohexane ring at the central carbon. So the 5 position on the cyclohexane has a CH2-C=CH2 group.

Wait, no, maybe I got the numbering wrong. Let me think: the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl. So the substituent is propene where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is attached at carbon 2. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2, but the substituent is attached to the middle carbon. Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the substituent is attached to carbon 2 of propene. So propene is CH2=CH-CH3. Wait, no, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, propene is CH2=CHCH3, but that's prop-1-ene. So the substituent prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-
