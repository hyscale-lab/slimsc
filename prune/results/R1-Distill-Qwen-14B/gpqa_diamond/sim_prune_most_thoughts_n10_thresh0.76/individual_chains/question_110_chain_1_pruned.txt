Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs, but they have different capabilities in terms of the brightness of stars they can observe. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with varying properties, and I need to determine which of them can be seen by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. Oh right, the key is to look at their apparent magnitudes because both instruments have limits on how bright (or rather, how dim) the stars can be for them to detect.

First, I should recall the information given about each spectrograph. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V magnitude. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, no, the user said the opposite. Oh, wait, no, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, no—brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So a star that's brighter than 17 mag would have a magnitude less than 17. Because the magnitude scale is inverted: lower numbers mean brighter. So stars with V mag ≤17 can be observed by ESPRESSO.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the star's apparent magnitude should be ≤16.

Wait, no, let me double-check. Wait, the question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." Oh wait, no, the wording is confusing. Wait, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that would be magnitude less than 17, right? Because higher magnitude means dimmer. So if a star is brighter than 17, its apparent magnitude is, say, 16 or lower. Because magnitude 1 is brighter than magnitude 17.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The scale is such that lower magnitudes mean brighter. So a star with apparent magnitude 17
