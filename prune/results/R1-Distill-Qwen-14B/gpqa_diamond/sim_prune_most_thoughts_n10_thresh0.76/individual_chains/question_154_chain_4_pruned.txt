Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question says. 

The chemist found a white solid, and they've got some spectral data to help identify it. The options are four different compounds. I need to use the mass spec, IR, and NMR data to figure out which one it is.

Starting with the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the highest, so that's the molecular weight. There's another peak at m/z 158, which is 32% intensity. Hmm, molecular weight 156. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O, but with substituents. Benzaldehyde is C7H7O (wait, no, benzaldehyde is C7H6O? Wait, let me think again. Benzaldehyde is C6H5CHO. So molecular formula is C7H6O. If it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, then the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Chlorine is about 35.5, O is 16. So 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5, 2*16=32. Total: 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Wait, but the m/z is 156. So that's close. Also, the molecular ion is at 156, so that fits. But wait, the other peak is 158, which is 2 mass units higher. That might suggest something like a chlorine plus a hydrogen loss, or maybe a double bond rearrangement. Or maybe the molecular ion is 156, and the 158 is a fragment with an additional Cl or something. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C6H5COOH, formula C7H6O2. Adding Cl, so the formula becomes C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as option A? Wait, no, wait. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl, makes it C7H5ClO2. So molecular weight: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5 for Cl, 2*16=32. 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. So same as option A. So molecular weight is 156.5, but the molecular ion is at 156, perhaps because it's an M-1 peak or something? Or maybe it's M+2? Wait, the molecular ion is at 156, which is 156.5 minus 0.5, which is possible. But the other peak is at 158, which is 2 more. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula has a chlorine and another oxygen? Let me check.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That's OClC(O)OPh? Wait, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-. So phenyl chloroformate would be ClCOOPh. The molecular formula is C6H5O2ClCO? Wait, no, wait. Let's see: chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R. For phenyl, R is C6H5.

So the formula would be C6H5-O-CO-Cl. So that's C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as A and B. Oh, so same molecular weight. So all three options A, B, C have the same formula? No, wait
