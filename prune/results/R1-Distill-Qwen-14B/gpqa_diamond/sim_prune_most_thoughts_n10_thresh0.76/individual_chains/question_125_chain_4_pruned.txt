Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². The question is asking for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that energy.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh right, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n is the total quantum number. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Each direction (x, y, z) has its own quantum number, right? So n_x, n_y, n_z. And the total energy is E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). So the total quantum number n is n_x + n_y + n_z.

But sometimes people refer to the energy levels as being determined by the principal quantum number, which I think is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy levels are E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is this sum. So for each energy level, the possible n is 0,1,2,... etc.

So the ground state is n=0: E = (3/2) ħω. First excited state is n=1: E = (5/2) ħω. Second excited state is n=2: E = (7/2) ħω. Third excited state is n=3: E = (9/2) ħω. Oh wait, wait. No, wait
