Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it. Hmm, the question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². Oh, right, that's the Hooke's law kind of force, so it's like a 3D version of a quantum harmonic oscillator.

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for the same energy eigenvalue. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, in three dimensions, it's a bit different. Oh right, because it's isotropic, the potential is symmetric in all directions. So the energy levels can be considered in terms of the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, in 3D, the energy is given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers. Alternatively, since it's isotropic, we can use the concept of the principal quantum number. Oh, right, sometimes people use n = n_x + n_y + n_z, so the energy can be written as E = ħω (n + 3/2). Because for each direction, the ground state is (1/2) ħω, so adding three directions gives 3/2 ħω for the ground state. Then each additional quantum number adds another ħω.

Wait, but wait, when we say the "third excited state", we have to think about what that means. The ground state is the lowest energy,
