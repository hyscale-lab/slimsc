Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0).

Hmm, wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators like Sx, Sy, Sz are related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices used to represent spin-1/2 particles. The S matrices are usually (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Let me think: the standard Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So Sx would be (ħ/2)σx, Sy is (ħ/2)σy, and Sz is (ħ/2)σz.

Looking at the matrix S given here: it's [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]. Wait, that's the same as the Pauli matrix σy multiplied by i. Let me check. The Pauli matrix σy is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] exactly. Oh wait, no, wait. No, wait. Let me write them out.

Pauli matrices:

σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σz = [[1,0], [0,-1]]

So the given S is exactly σy. So S = σy.

Given that, the operator Ay is c·S = c·σy. And c is h/(4π). So let me write that:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Wait, and since σy is the Pauli y-matrix. So the operator Ay is proportional to σy.

Now the question is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So we need to solve Ay |φ> = a |φ>, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

But since Ay is a 2x2
