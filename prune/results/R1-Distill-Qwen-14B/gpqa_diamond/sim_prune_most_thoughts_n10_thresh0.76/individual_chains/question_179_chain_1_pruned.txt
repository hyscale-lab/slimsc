Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about matrices and their properties. Hmm. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question shows four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The options are statements about these matrices, and I need to figure out which is correct.

Let me think about each statement one by one.

Option A says: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Wait, e^X is the exponential of matrix X. So, if I multiply a vector by this exponential, does the norm change? I remember that unitary matrices have the property that when you multiply a vector by them, the norm stays the same. The exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. But what about any matrix? If X is not skew-Hermitian, then e^X might not be unitary. So let's check if X is skew-Hermitian.

Skew-Hermitian means X^dagger = -X. Let me compute X^dagger and see.

X matrix:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So the conjugate transpose (dagger) of X is the transpose of the complex conjugate.

Transposing X:
Row 1 becomes column 1: i, 1, 2i
Row 2 becomes column 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3 becomes column3: 2i, 1, -i

Now take complex conjugate of each element.

So X^dagger:
Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Wait, wait, maybe I should compute each element's conjugate first and then transpose.

Original X:

First row (conjugated):
i → -i, -1 → -1, 2i → -2i.
Second row: 1 → 1, 0 →0,1→1.
Third row: 2i→-2i, -1→-1, -i→i.

Then transpose, so rows become columns.

So X^dagger is:

First column: -i, 1, -2i
Second column: -1, 0, -1
Third column: -2i, 1, i.

Wait, let me write X^dagger:

X^dagger element (1,1) is conjugate of X(1,1) → conj(i) is -i.
(1,2): conj(X(2,1)) → conj(1) is 1.
(1,3): conj(X(3,1)) → conj(2i) is -2i.

So first row of X^dagger: (-i, 1, -2i)
Second row: (X's column 2 after conjugation, then transpose)
X's column 2 before transposing is (-1, 0, -1). After conjugation, it's (-1, 0, -1), since they are real. So second row is (-1, 0, -1).
Third row: conj(X(3,1), X(3,2), X(3,3)). Wait, no. Wait, conjugate of X is first, then transpose. So X's third row after conjugation is (-2i, -1, i). When transposed, the third row of X^dagger is (-2i, 1, i). Because taking the elements from X's first column after conjugation.

Wait, perhaps I should make it more systematically:

Original X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1,
