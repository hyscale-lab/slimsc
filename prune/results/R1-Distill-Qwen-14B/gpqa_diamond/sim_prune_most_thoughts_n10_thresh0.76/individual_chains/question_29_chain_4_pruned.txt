Okay, so I have this genetics question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate this compound by using EMS mutagenesis. After sequencing, some changes are found in the first exon. I need to determine which mutation would likely eliminate the compound.

First, I remember that the anti-nutritional compound is synthesized by the gene, so probably the gene product (a protein) is responsible. So, if we can disrupt the gene's function, the compound won't be made.

Looking at the wild-type gene sequence: it starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then there are some codons, and the sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. The mutants have changes in the beginning of the first exon.

Mutant 1: The sequence shows a change from CGC to CGC in the first part? Wait, let me check. The wild-type is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. Oh wait, looking more carefully. Let me compare each mutant to the wild-type.

Wait, perhaps I should write out the changes for each mutant. Let's look at each:

Wild-type (WT):
5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT… TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATG TTCTACGCTG GTACTTCTGTGGATGAA… I think I need to break it down more clearly. Let me look at the first part.

Wait, the way the sequences are presented, perhaps the differences are in specific regions. Let me compare each position.

Looking at the first part of each mutant:

Mutant 1: The first part is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Wait, in the wild-type, after ATG, the next codons are TTT, CTC, GCT, etc. Let me see where the change is.

Wait, perhaps I should look for where the mutation occurs. Let me compare each mutant's sequence to the WT.

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant 1:
ATG T TCT ACG CTG G… Hmm, wait, the WT is ATG TTT CTC GCT ... So after ATG, WT has TTT, CTC, GCT. Mutant 1's sequence after ATG is TTCTACGCTG... Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me realign.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for where the change is in the amino acid sequence. Because the question is about disrupting the gene function, which would likely involve a premature stop codon or a change in the protein structure.

Looking for a frame shift or a stop codon
