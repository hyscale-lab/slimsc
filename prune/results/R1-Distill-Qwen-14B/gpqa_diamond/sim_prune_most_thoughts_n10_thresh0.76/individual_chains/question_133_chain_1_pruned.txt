Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Alright, let's break it down.

The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4●2H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-).

Wait, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? But phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. Oh yeah, because H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it has three dissociation steps. The given Ka values are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12.

So, the salts in solution are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O. Let me think about what these salts dissociate into.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. It dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion.

Na2HPO4●2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate decahydrate? Wait, no, the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So when it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion.

Wait, but in solution, these ions can undergo hydrolysis. Because phosphate ions are weak bases, they can accept protons. So, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-.

But the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. So I need to find out how much of the HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- will convert into PO4^3-.

Wait, but maybe I need to consider the buffer system here. Since we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 in solution, the solution might be a buffer
