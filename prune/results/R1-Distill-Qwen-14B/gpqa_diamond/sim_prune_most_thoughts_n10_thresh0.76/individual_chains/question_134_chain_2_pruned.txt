Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions are when acids and bases react to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is usually around -57 kJ per mole of H+ because they release a lot of heat, right?

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Let me write down the volumes and molarities. 

HCl: 500 mL, 0.2 M. So moles of HCl would be 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so 0.1 moles of H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL, 0.3 M. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but since it's diprotic, each mole gives two H+ ions. So moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL, 0.5 M. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-. Each mole gives 2 OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. OH- ions would be 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, I need to find out how much H+ and OH- are reacting. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The amount of heat released depends on the moles of H+ and OH- that react. But wait, which one is the limiting reactant here?

Total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. OH- is 0.2 moles.

So OH- is the limiting reactant because 0.2 moles can only react with 0.2 moles of H+. That leaves 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

The neutralization reaction uses 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), but wait, wait, isn't it per mole of acid or base? Oh, no, it's per mole of H+ because each mole of H+ contributes to the neutralization.

So for 0.2 moles reacting, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57) kJ. Let me compute that: 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ, so -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait. The options are given in kcal and kJ. Let me check the units. Oh, option B is -11.42 kJ, so that seems close. Option D is -16 kJ, which is bigger. So my calculation gives about -11.4 kJ, which would match option B.

But wait, another thought: when H2SO4 is present, since it's a diprotic acid, but in the neutralization, each mole can donate two H+ ions. But in this case, the OH- is the limiting reagent. So all the OH- will be used up, and the H+ will be in excess.

Alternatively, sometimes when dealing with polyprotic acids, only the first H+ is considered in neutralization. But I'm not sure. Wait, no, in neutralization, all available H+ (from both H+ and H2SO4) will react until the OH- is consumed.

So my initial approach seems correct. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles react, releasing 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ of heat. Since the reaction is exothermic, the enthalpy change is negative, so -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options: option B is -11.42 kcal, wait, no. Option B is -11.42 kJ, which would be close. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I compute the moles correctly?

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So yes, correct.

So the reaction would neutralize 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-, producing 0.2 mol H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options:

Option B is -11.42 kJ. That's very close. But perhaps I should be more precise, perhaps the exact value is considered.

Wait, but wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given as -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-), so 57.3 is sometimes used as a more precise value.

So 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ, so 11.46, so the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options: option B is -11.42. Hmm, that's close. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the moles.

Wait, 500 mL is 0.5 L, 0.2 M → 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

300 mL is
