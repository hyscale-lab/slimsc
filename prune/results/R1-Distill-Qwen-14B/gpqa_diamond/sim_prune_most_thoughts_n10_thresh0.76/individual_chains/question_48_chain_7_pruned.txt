Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. Let me go through each step carefully.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so it has a six-membered ring with a ketone group. Now, the first step is treatment with bromine (Br2). I think bromine adds to the double bond in alkenes, but wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone is a ketone, but to add Br2, maybe it's undergoing some kind of conjugate addition or perhaps a ring-opening? Alternatively, maybe it's an enol formation. Hmm, or perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another possibility: cyclohexanone can undergo a reaction with bromine via an enol intermediate. So, the enol form of cyclohexanone would react with Br2. Enols can undergo electrophilic addition, so the bromine would add across the double bond of the enol. But wait, cyclohexanone isn't aromatic, so the enol would form, but how would the bromine add?

Alternatively, another reaction: when ketones like cyclohexanone are treated with bromine, it can undergo a dihydroxylation if there's a double bond, but wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm confusing with another reaction. Oh
