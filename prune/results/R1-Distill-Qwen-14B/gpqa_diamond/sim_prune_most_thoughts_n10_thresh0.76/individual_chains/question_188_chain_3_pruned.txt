Okay, so I've got this problem about crystallography. Hmm, rhombohedral crystal, right? I remember that rhombohedral structures have all sides equal and all angles equal, so α, β, γ are all the same. In this case, each is 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance... Oh, right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (2hk cos α) + (2hl cos β) + (2kl cos γ) )) or something like that. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up with something else. Oh wait, no, maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ). Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( [ (h² + k² + l²) + (2hk cos α) + (2hl cos β) + (2kl cos γ) ] ). Or wait, maybe it's (a²) under the square root. No, wait, no, the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ), but wait, that might not be correct. Because in cubic systems, some terms drop out because angles are 90 degrees. So, for a cubic system, cos α etc. are zero, and the formula becomes d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² ). But in this case, it's a rhombohedral system, so all angles are 30 degrees, so their cosines are cos(30°), which is sqrt(3)/2, about 0.866.

So the (111) plane—so h=1, k=1, l=1. So plugging into the formula.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me think again.
