Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry problem to solve. It's about the Cope rearrangement, which I've heard a bit about but need to think through carefully.

Okay, the question has two parts, A and B, each resulting from different reactions. Let me tackle them one by one.

First, Reaction A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methylbenzene. The reagents are BuLi followed by H+. I remember that BuLi is a strong base, often used to deprotonate compounds, especially in conjugated systems. The starting molecule has an ether linkage with a 1,5-diene. 

Wait, the structure: the main part is a benzene ring attached to a methylene group (CH2OCH2...?), no, wait. Let me draw it. The compound is ( (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy )methylbenzene. So, benzene-CH2-O-CH2-C(=CH2)-CH3? Or wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2CH=C(CH3)- , but wait, butenyl is four carbons. Let me count: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2– but actually, butenyl is four carbons, so numbering: position 1 is the end. So it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl: the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2– but if it's 3-methyl, then on the third carbon. So the substituents would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. So the group is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-O-CH2-attached to benzene? Wait, the starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy
