Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that in three dimensions, the potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². So that's the setup.

The problem asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I should recall how the energy levels work in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz. Wait, actually, in 3D, the quantum numbers are usually expressed as n_x, n_y, n_z for each direction. But since it's isotropic, the potential is symmetric in all directions, so the energy depends on the sum of these quantum numbers.

Wait, no, wait. Another approach: The energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total number of quanta, right? Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the sum of the three quantum numbers. Oh right, each direction contributes n_i + 1/2, so the total energy would be E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. That makes sense because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, and since it's 3D, you add all three.

But wait, another way to think about it: the energy levels are quantized and depend on the principal quantum number n, which is n = n_x + n
