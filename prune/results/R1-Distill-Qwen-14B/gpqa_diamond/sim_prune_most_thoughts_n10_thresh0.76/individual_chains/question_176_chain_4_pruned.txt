Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says the state of the system is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, in quantum mechanics states are usually normalized. So maybe I should check if this state is normalized. Let's compute the magnitude squared of each component and add them up.

So the state vector is a column vector: [-1; 2; 1]. The inner product is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh wait, so the norm is sqrt(6), right? So the state isn't normalized. So I need to normalize it. Or wait, does the problem assume it's already normalized? Maybe I should proceed, but I'll remember that.

Wait, when you take measurements, the state must be normalized because probabilities are involved. So I think I should normalize the state first. So the normalized state ψ would be (1/sqrt(6)) multiplied by the vector [-1, 2, 1]. So ψ = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Got it. Now, the operators P and Q are given. Let me note them down.

Operator P's matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

And Q is given as:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

Wait, so the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1. So when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1,
