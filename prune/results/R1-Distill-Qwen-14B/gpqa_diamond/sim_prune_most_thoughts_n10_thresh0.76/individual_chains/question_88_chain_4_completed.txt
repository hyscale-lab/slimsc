Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice orally. Then, some of the fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, and some get entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They then isolate the fluorescent Peyer patches and look at the variable heavy chain gene, which shows high variability. The question is asking which process is happening here.

Alright, let's break down what I know. Rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis, and I remember that Peyer patches are regions in the small intestine where a lot of immune responses happen, especially for stuff coming from the gut. These patches are part of the mucosal immune system. So when they tag the proteins with GFP and give them to mice, the idea is that the immune system will react to these proteins.

Fluorescence being destroyed by stomach acid and mucus suggests that the proteins are somehow being broken down or prevented from entering the bloodstream in those areas. But some do make it to the Peyer patches. Peyer patches are a type of lymphoid tissue, so the immune cells there probably process the antigens (like the GFP-tagged proteins) presented by antigen-presenting cells.

Now, the variable heavy chain gene shows high variability. I'm thinking about immune processes that lead to diversity. The options given are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Somatic hypermutation is a process where B cells diversify their antibodies after antigen encounter. It leads to the production of a wide variety of specific receptors. This happens in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues during the immune response. So when B cells are activated, they undergo hypermutation, increasing the diversity of their antibodies, which helps in a more effective immune response.

Complement activation isn't about diversityâ€”it's more about the complement system attacking the pathogen once the antibody has targeted it. So that's probably not the answer here.

Class switching recombination is when a B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), which is part of the immune response but doesn't create new variable regions. So that's process C, but the question is about variability in the variable regions, not the class.

VDJ recombination happens during the initial formation of the B cell receptor in the bone marrow. It's how the diversity of the antigen receptors is created in the first place by joining different V, D, and J segments. But this happens during B cell development, not in response to a specific antigen. So if the question is about high variability in the variable genes after exposure, it's more likely to be somatic hypermutation.

So putting this together: the GFP-tagged proteins are getting processed in the Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. The immune cells, probably B cells, are taking up these antigens, presenting them, and then generating a response. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests that each B cell is producing slightly different antibodies, which is exactly what somatic hypermutation does.

So the process taking place is somatic hypermutation. That would be option A.


The question involves an experiment where GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are administered to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is lost due to stomach acid and intestinal mucus, but the proteins reach the Peyer patches, where the variable heavy chain gene in the proliferating cell population shows high variability. This suggests an immune response involving B cells, which produce antibodies with diverse variable regions.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, where B cells diversify their antibody variable regions to enhance specificity. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene after antigen exposure.
- **B) Complement activation**: This process involves the complement system attacking pathogens tagged by antibodies but does not explain the observed variability in the variable regions.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not generate variability in the variable regions.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, generating initial diversity in antigen receptors but not the subsequent variability observed after antigen exposure.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is best explained by somatic hypermutation, which diversifies antibody specificity during the immune response. This process aligns with the experimental observations in the Peyer patches.

Answer: A
