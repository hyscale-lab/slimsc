Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. But wait, under what conditions?

I think the cyanide ion (CN-) would attack the carbonyl carbon in a ketone. The general reaction for ketones with HCN or CN- would give a cyanohydrin. Oh right, the cyanohydrin formation! The product would have a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group on the same carbon, which matches the first product. So the product is a cyanohydrin.

But wait, the reaction conditions. To form a cyanohydrin, I think you usually need an acid catalyst. So reagent A here is probably something that provides H+ to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Like H3O+ (which is option A and B for part A), or maybe something else like H2SO4 or H2SO3? Or maybe NaHSO3?

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I remember that NaHSO3 can be used in the formation of bisulfite adducts, but in this case, it's with CN- from NaCN. So maybe the reaction is under acidic conditions. So H3O+ as the acid, which is option A and B.

But let me think about the second reaction. The product from the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which has a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. Then, in the second reaction, this compound is treated with reagent B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I misread that. Let me check the second reaction again.

Wait, the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) gives 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, starting with a nitrile group and hydroxyl, and then upon treatment with B and water, it becomes a carboxylic acid. Oh, wait no, the starting material is a nitrile, and the product is a carboxylic acid. So what's happening here?

Wait, but the molecule is a bit complicated. Let me see. The starting material has a nitrile group (CN) and a hydroxyl (OH), and the product is a carboxylic acid (COOH). So how does that happen? The nitrile must be oxidized to a carboxylic acid.

But wait, oxidation of nitriles usually requires specific conditions. For example, using a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 under acidic
