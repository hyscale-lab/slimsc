Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what each part is about.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to give a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to form product 3. The question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

Hmm. I remember that when dibrominated compounds react with KOH, elimination reactions can happen, especially dehydrohalogenation. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane probably undergoes an elimination to form an alkene. Let's think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure. When KOH is used, it's a strong base, so it would likely cause an E2 elimination, removing two Br atoms and forming a double bond.

So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Wait, what's the structure? Adamantane has four rings, and the 1 and 3 positions are probably on adjacent bridgeheads. Eliminating two Br atoms would form a double bond between two bridgehead carbons. But wait, can bridgehead carbons form double bonds? I remember that in norbornene, a bicyclic compound, bridgehead double bonds are possible because of the structure's stability. So yes, elimination would form an exo double bond in adamantane.

So product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe it's a more substituted structure. Wait, the NMR data for product 1 is given. Let's look at that. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR has a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or ketone.

Wait, but elimination of two Brs would give a double bond, which doesn't have a carbonyl. So if product 1 has a carbonyl, perhaps I got the reaction wrong. Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution.

Wait 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base, but in certain conditions can lead to substitution. Wait, but dibromides usually undergo elimination when treated with a strong base. Hmm, but maybe if the structure is such that elimination is difficult, substitution could occur. But I thought substitution would require a good leaving group and perhaps a less hindered structure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double-elimination, but I'm not seeing how that would form a carbonyl. Or perhaps it's not elimination but a substitution to form some kind of ether. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, which is a C=O stretch.

Oh wait! Maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of oxidation. No, KOH isn't typically an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening or something else.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane when treated with KOH could form an epoxide? No, because epoxidation usually requires peracids. Alternatively, could it form a carbonyl via elimination and then some process? I'm getting
