Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I remember that regularization is a process used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or something so the results are finite, then you take the cutoff away in the end.

So, which theories don't need this? Let's go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity and it's supposed to be finite, meaning it doesn't have the same kind of infinities as other quantum field theories. Because strings have higher dimensions and maybe they don't have the same loop divergences. So maybe regularization isn't needed here.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong force. Wait, I remember that at high energies (or equivalently, short distances), QCD becomes asymptotically free. But still, when doing loop calculations, you get divergences. So QCD would require regularization, perhaps using methods like lattice regularization or dimensional regularization. So it does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED does have divergences, especially in higher-order loop diagrams. For example, the electron self-energy has divergences. So they must use regularization techniques. I think QED does need regularization, like using the cutoff method or other techniques.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't have the same divergences because they don't involve the same quantum loop effects. But wait, even in classical E&M, you can have issues like the infinite charge density at a point charge, or the self-energy of a charge. But these are more about the classical treatments. Do these require regularization? Or do they get handled differently because they're not quantum theories?

Hmm, because the question is about which theory never requires regularization. Regularization is a quantum field theory technique. So classical theories don't require regularization because they don't have the same divergent integrals in the
