Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So the setup is that there's a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. The magnetic moment is aligned with the magnetic field initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm. I remember that in such scenarios, when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, which affects the energy levels and can lead to oscillations in expectation values. Since the magnetic moment is involved, I think this has to do with the interaction between the spin and the magnetic field.

Wait, the magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma * Sz. So, the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin component in the z-direction. The magnetic field applies a torque, and the energy of the system is given by the Zeeman term, right? The energy E is -mu · B. So, in the initial state, when B is along +Z, the energy would be proportional to Sz, which has eigenvalues ±ħ/2 times some factors.

But then the field is turned off and turned on along Y. So the initial Hamiltonian was something like H_initial = -gamma * B * Sz. After the switch, the new Hamiltonian becomes H_new = -gamma * B * Sy, I think, because the field is along Y now.

Wait, but mu is gamma * S_z in the initial case. So, if the field is along Y, the magnetic moment will interact with the Y-component of the spin. So the new Hamiltonian should involve Sy.

Wait, but spin matrices are involved here. I remember that spin operators for different axes are represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, Sx is (ħ/2) σx, Sy is (ħ/2) σy, Sz is (ħ/2) σz.

But the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the moment. So the expectation value of Sz, which is related to mu_z, since mu_z is gamma * <Sz>.

So the initial state: the particle's spin was aligned along +Z, meaning that the spin state was |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. When the magnetic field was along +Z, the state was an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. But when the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, which doesn't commute with Sz.

So the state after the field change is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. That means the system will evolve over time, and expectation values will oscillate.

I need to find the time dependence of <Sz(t)>, and specifically its oscillation frequency.

Let me think about the time evolution. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. After the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B Sy. Wait, but Sy is (ħ/2) sigma_y, so H = -gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y).

Wait, but the energy expression is E = -mu · B. So if the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, then the Hamiltonian should be H = -gamma B · S. So in this case, B is along Y, so H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, but Sy is (ħ/2) sigma_y, so H = -gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y). Let me compute the actual expression. Let me see, H = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y. Let me write this as H = - (gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y.

But I'm not sure about the sign here. The energy for a magnetic moment in a field is E = -mu · B. So if mu is in the same direction as B, the energy is lower. So when mu and B are aligned, it's lower energy. But when the field is along Y, and the initial state is |+z>, which has Sz = ħ/2, so Sy for |+z> would be? Let me recall that the eigenstates of Sy are the |+y> and |-y> states.

Wait, maybe it's easier to represent the state in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian. Because when the system is in an eigenstate of H, the expectation values don't change with time. But when it's not, you get oscillations.

The initial state is |+z>. Let me express this state in terms of the eigenstates of H. The eigenstates of H are |+y> and |-y>, because H is proportional to Sy. So, the |+y> state is an eigenstate of Sy with eigenvalue +ħ/2, and |-y> with
