Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let's see... The Lagrangian is given, and the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed. Hmm.

Wait, so the interaction term is written as L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). I think this implies that the boson X couples to fermions. Because the term looks like it's mixing the fermion field with X. So, when the boson X decays, it can produce fermion-antifermion pairs.

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So, for a decay X → f f̄ to be possible, the combined mass of the fermions should be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because, in particle physics, the rest mass of the parent has to be at least twice the mass of the child particles (since each gets at least half the mass, assuming they're at rest).

Let me list the masses of all the known fermions:

- e⁻ (electron): about 0.0005 GeV
- μ⁻ (muon): ~0.105 GeV
- τ⁻ (tau): ~1.777 GeV
- u quark: ~0.003 GeV (current quark mass)
- d quark: ~0.006 GeV
- s quark: ~0.095 GeV
- c quark: ~1.27 GeV
- b quark: ~4.13 GeV
- t quark: ~173 GeV (way too heavy)

Wait, but wait, the fermions that X can decay into would be those where the sum of their masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV. But wait, actually, for the decay X → f f̄, each f should have mass m such that 2m ≤ m_X. Because the rest mass of X is 6 GeV, so each fermion must have mass <= 3 GeV. Because when the boson is at rest, the two fermions would each have at least their rest mass; if each is m, then 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the quarks are confined, so in decays, you can't have them as free particles. So if X is decaying into quark-antiquark pairs, they would have to form hadrons, but in the Lagrangian given, the coupling is to ψ_f, which are maybe the Dirac fermions, so perhaps the decay would be into quark pairs. But wait, but the problem is about the kinematically allowed decays, which are determined by the mass. So regardless of whether they can be observed as free particles, but whether the decay is possible. But, in reality, quarks can't be observed as free particles, so perhaps the decay would only be to leptons or maybe to quarks which form mesons or something. Hmm. But the question is just about the kinematics, not about detection. So I should consider all possible fermions where m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the interaction term is written as λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So, perhaps f is a field index for the fermions. So, the boson X couples to all the fermions in the theory. So, which fermions are there? Let's think about all possible charged leptons and quarks.

Let me list the possible fermions:

Charged leptons:
- e⁻, e⁺
- μ⁻, μ⁺
- τ⁻, τ⁺

Quarks:
- u, d
- c, s
- t, b (but t is way too heavy)
Wait, but considering all quarks, but their masses are:

e: ~0.0005 GeV
μ:
