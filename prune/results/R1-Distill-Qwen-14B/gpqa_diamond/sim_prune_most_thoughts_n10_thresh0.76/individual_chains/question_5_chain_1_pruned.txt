Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let me think about what it's asking. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, with eigenvalue +ℏ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is along a direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, so the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, which means the vector n has components (nx, 0, nz) because it's in x-z. So the operator P can be expressed as the sum of its components in the x, y, and z directions, each multiplied by the corresponding unit vector. But since n is in x-z, the y-component might be zero, but wait, no, because P is the operator along n, so I think P would be proportional to nx P_x + nz P_z or something like that. 

Wait, wait. The operator P is along the direction n. So the operator is P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z) ? Or more accurately, P = nx P_x + ny P_y + nz P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, ny is zero. So P = nx P_x + nz P_z.

But I'm supposed to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ℏ/2. So I need to find a vector |v> such that P |v> = (ℏ/2) |v>.

Hmm, but how do I approach this? Let's see, the problem gives me the components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ℏ/2.

So P_x is (ℏ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ℏ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ℏ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P is nx P_x + nz P_z. Because ny is zero.

So the first step is to write down the matrix for P. Let me compute that.

Let me define a and b as nx and nz, respectively. So a = nx, b = nz. Then,

P = (a)(ℏ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]] + (b)(ℏ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]]

So factor out ℏ/2:

P = (ℏ/2) [ a * [[0,1],[1,0]] + b * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Adding the matrices inside:

For the element (1,1): a*0 + b*1 → b
(1,2): a*1 → a
(2,1): a*1 → a
(2,2): a*0 + b*(-1) → -b

So the matrix becomes:

[[b, a], [a, -b]]

But all multiplied by ℏ/2.

So P = (ℏ/2) * [[b, a], [a, -b]]

Now, I need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix for eigenvalue +ℏ/2. Because the question says the eigenvalue is +ℏ/2.

Wait, so the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ℏ/2) |v>

Wait, no, more precisely, the eigenvalue is +ℏ/2. So,

P |v> = (+ℏ/2) |v>

Hmm, substituting P:

(ℏ/2) * [[b, a], [a, -b]] * |v> = (ℏ/2) |v>

We can divide both sides by (ℏ/2) to simplify:

[[b, a], [a, -b]] * |v> = |v>

So the matrix equation is:

[[b, a], [a, -b]] * [v1; v2] = [v1; v2]

Which gives the system of equations:

b v1 + a v2 = v1
a v1 - b v2 = v2

So let's write these two equations:

1. (b - 1) v1 + a v2 = 0
2. a v1 + (-b - 1) v2 = 0

Which is a homogeneous system, so the determinant of the coefficients must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

Wait, but to find the eigenvectors, perhaps I can subtract the identity matrix multiplied by eigenvalue. Wait, no, because the equation is [[b, a], [a, -b]] |v> = |v>. So it's equivalent to ([[b, a], [a, -b]] - I) |v> = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[[b-1, a], [a, -b -1]]

Wait, the determinant of this matrix must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

So determinant is (b-1)(-b -1) - a^2 = 0.

Calculating:

(b-1)(-b -1) = -(b-1)(b+1) = -(b² -1) → -b² +1

Then minus a²: -b² +1 -a² = 0 → 1 - (a² + b²) = 0 → a² + b² = 1.

Which makes sense because a is nx and b is nz, and since n is a unit vector, nx² + nz² =1. So the determinant condition holds.

So the system has non-trivial solutions, which is expected.

Now, to find the eigenvectors, we can take one equation and express the variables in terms.

Take the first equation: (b-1)v1 + a v2 = 0.

So v2 = [(1 - b)/a ] v1.

But wait, we need to avoid division by zero. Hmm, let's see. Alternatively, express v1 in terms of v2.

Alternatively, we can express v2 in terms of v1.

Let me think: rearrange the first equation,

(b-1) v1 + a v2 = 0 → a v2 = (1 - b) v1 → v2 = [(1 - b)/a ] v1.

Wait, but if a is zero, this approach would fail. So I need to handle that case separately. Hmm, but in general, a and b are variables such that a² + b² =1.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to take the ratio of the two equations.

From equation 1:

(b-1) v1 + a v2 =0 → (b-1) v1 = -a v2 → v1 = [ -a/(b-1) ) ] v2.

From equation 2:

a v1 + (-b -1) v2 =0 → a v1 = (b+1) v2 → v1 = [ (b+1)/a ] v2.

So we have two expressions for v1 in terms of v2.

Set them equal:

[ -a/(b-1) ) ] v2 = [ (b+1)/a ] v2.

Assuming v2 is not zero, we can divide both sides by v2.

So:

- a/(b-
