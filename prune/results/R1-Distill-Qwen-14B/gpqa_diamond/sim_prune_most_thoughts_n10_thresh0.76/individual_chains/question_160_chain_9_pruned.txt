Okay, so I have this physics problem about diffraction, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The setup is an aperture shaped like a N-sided polygon. All apothems are the same length 'a'. When a monochromatic light of wavelength Î» falls vertically on it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh wait, and they mention that tan(theta) is approximately theta because the angles are small.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, diffraction occurs, and the pattern observed is due to interference of light waves from different parts of the aperture. The far field region means we're looking at the Fraunhofer diffraction, which happens at a large distance from the aperture, so the wavefronts are approximately plane waves.

The problem is about a polygonal aperture with a very large number of sides, N approaching infinity. So as N becomes infinitely large, the polygon would approximate a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides becomes a smooth circle. Wait, but wait, the apothems are all the same length. The apothem of a polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, so if all apothems are the same, it's a regular polygon. So for N approaching infinity, it's a circle with radius equal to the apothem. Wait, no, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint, which is the same as the radius for a regular polygon. No, wait, no. For regular polygons, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. For a circle, of course, the apothem is the same as the radius. So if N is infinite, the aperture becomes a circle with radius a. So the problem reduces to the diffraction by a circular aperture.

Wait, but wait the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. For a circular aperture, the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern has a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by dark rings. The first minimum occurs at a certain angle. But wait, do the minima refer to the minima after the central maximum? So the first minimum is the innermost dark ring.

But wait, I thought for circular apertures,
