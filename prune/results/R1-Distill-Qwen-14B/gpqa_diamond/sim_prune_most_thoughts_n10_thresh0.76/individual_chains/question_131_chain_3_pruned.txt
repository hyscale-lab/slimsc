Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question says that a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene was dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with the formula C13H16O3.

Let me first think about the initial steps. The dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. Dehydration of a diacid usually forms an anhydride, but the structure would depend on where the double bond is. Since the starting material has a cis-alkene, the resulting anhydride will have certain properties.

The anhydride's NMR is given: 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a region where aromatic protons usually show up, but wait, this is an anhydride. Alternatively, maybe it's from an enol ether or some conjugated system. Wait, if the anhydride has a conjugated double bond, maybe the protons are deshielded. But a singlet suggests equivalent protons. Maybe it's a substituted aromatic ring with all equivalent protons? Or perhaps it's an internal anhydride with a bridged structure.

Looking at the 13C NMR, two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 ppm is around where a carbon adjacent to an oxygen might be, like a carbonyl or an aromatic carbon. 165 ppm is probably a carbonyl carbon, like from the anhydride. Hmm, but wait, an anhydride has two carbonyl groups. So maybe the 165 ppm is one of them, and the 137 ppm is another carbon, perhaps a CH that's part of a ring or double bond.

Wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. If it's a singlet, maybe the protons are in a symmetrical arrangement. Maybe they're on a cyclopentadienyl ring? Like, perhaps the anhydride is a cyclic structure with symmetry. Oh wait, but the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid. Dehydration would form an anhydride, and if the acid is cis, then the dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride with a double bond. Like, if the acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not a dicarboxylic with a cis-alkene. Oh, wait, maybe the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not a diene. Alternatively, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, but that's a longer chain.

Wait, no. The dicar
