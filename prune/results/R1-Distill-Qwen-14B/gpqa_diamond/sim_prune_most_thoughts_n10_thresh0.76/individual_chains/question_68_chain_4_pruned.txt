Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

The problem is about a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu. The magnetic moment is given as mu equals gamma multiplied by Sz. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction, and the particle's moment is aligned with this field. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on in the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment after this change.

Hmm. I remember that when a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque which causes it to precess. But wait, this situation changes because the field direction changes. Oh right, when the field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, which affects the energy levels and the dynamics of the spin.

So the particle has spin 1/2, so its spin magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin operator. But in the problem, it's written as mu = gamma * Sz. Wait, that's a bit confusing because I thought the magnetic moment is proportional to the entire spin vector. Or maybe the problem is considering that the initial state is along the z-direction, so maybe mu is aligned with the initial field along z. Oh, wait, no—the magnetic moment is usually given by mu = gamma * S, where S is a vector. So perhaps the problem statement is simplifying it here. Anyway, moving on.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu·B. But wait, the standard form is H = -mu·B. Let me think: mu is the magnetic moment, and B is the magnetic field. The energy is minimized when mu is aligned with B, so the Hamiltonian would be proportional to the dot product.

In the initial state, since the magnetic field is along Z, the Hamiltonian would be H_initial = -gamma * Sz * B. Because mu = gamma * Sz, so H_initial is proportional to Sz. So the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, meaning the spin is aligned along Z.

Then, suddenly the magnetic field is turned off, meaning the magnetic field along Z is zero, and then another field is turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -gamma * S_y * B. Wait, because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, and the new field is along Y, so the dot product is mu · B = gamma S · B. So H_final is proportional to S_y.

Wait, but when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B = -gamma B S_y. So the system's Hamiltonian suddenly changes from being proportional to Sz to S_y.

I think this is a time-dependent problem because the Hamiltonian changes abruptly. So the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously, but the time evolution will be governed by the new Hamiltonian.

Wait, but when the field is suddenly turned off and the new one is turned on, the system's state remains the same as it was before the change. So the initial state after the
