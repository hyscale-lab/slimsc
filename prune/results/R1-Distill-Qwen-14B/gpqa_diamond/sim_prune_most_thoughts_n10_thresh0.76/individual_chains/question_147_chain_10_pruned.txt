Okay, so I have this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is about finding the velocity of particle A in a given reaction. 

The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, an antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. Wait, is that the rest mass? I think so. 

Wait, so the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. But wait, the question says the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh right, so maybe the initial kinetic energy is small compared to their rest mass energy. But I'm not sure if that matters here. 

Since the problem is about conservation of energy and momentum, I guess I need to use those principles. But wait, because this is a high-energy physics problem, maybe I should consider relativistic effects. Oh right, because the velocity of A could be a significant fraction of c, so we can't ignore relativistic effects.

Let me outline the steps. The initial system is a proton and an antiproton. The final system is two A+ and two A- particles. So, the initial momentum and energy must equal the final. 

But wait, the initial momentum might be dominated by the antiproton since the proton is presumably at rest? Or wait, no, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm. Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, but the proton is at rest? Or
