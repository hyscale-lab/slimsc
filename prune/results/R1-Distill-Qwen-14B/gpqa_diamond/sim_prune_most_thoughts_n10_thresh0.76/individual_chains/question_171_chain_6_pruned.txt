Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrophilic substitution reactions. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about six different benzene derivatives undergoing an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine. We need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out.

Alright, let's list out the substituents we're dealing with for each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3 → Toluene (methyl group attached to benzene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 → Benzoyloxy ethyl benzene? Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. So that's a benzoyloxyethyl group? Or maybe it's more like a phenyl acetate? Wait, no, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5, so the substituent is O-CO-C2H5? Or wait, benzene with a group that's -O-CO-C2H5? I'm a bit confused. Wait, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Oh wait, that's benzene with a group that's -CO-O-C2H5. So that's like an ester group. So the substituent is a -O-CO-ethyl group? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The structure is CO-O-C2H5 attached to benzene. So the group is O-CO-ethyl, which is an ester group. So it would be a phenyl ester? So the substituent is an ester group, specifically a benzoyloxyethyl group. Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as the substituent is an ester, like OAc (acetate) but with a longer chain. Wait, no, wait. The substituent is -CO-O-C2H5. So it's an ester group, the acetyloxy group, but in this case, the acyl group is from benzene? No, wait, benzene has a COOEt group. So it's an ester substituent: R is phenyl, so it's
