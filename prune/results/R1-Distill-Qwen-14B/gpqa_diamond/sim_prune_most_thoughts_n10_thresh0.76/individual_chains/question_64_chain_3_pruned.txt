Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see if I can break it down.

So, the problem says we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B that weighs 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through several tubes: first through anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then through Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally through red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g, and tube 2 doesn't change. Also, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm, okay. Let's try to figure out what's going on here. So when salts A and B are heated, they produce gases. Then, these gases are passed through these tubes, which presumably react with the gases.

First, let's think about the setup. The tubes are used to identify the gases. Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong desiccant but also reacts with certain gases. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is used to dry gases, especially those that are moisture-containing. But wait, does it react with other gases too?

When a gas is passed through Mg(ClO4)2, if the gas is something like water vapor, Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it, increasing the tube's weight. But if the gas is something else, like CO2 or H2, maybe it doesn't react. Wait, but wait, but CO2 is a gas that reacts with Mg(ClO4)2? Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought. Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb water. So if the gas mixture has water vapor, the Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it, causing the tube to gain weight. But in this case, the tube's weight increased by 3.60 grams. So that suggests that the gas passing through has water vapor. But wait, wait. No, because Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, so it absorbs water, turning into Mg(ClO4)2·H2O? Or maybe more water of crystallization?

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is something that reacts with Mg(ClO4)2. Wait, but I'm a bit hazy on that. Let me think. Mg(ClO4)2 is a deliquescent salt. It can absorb water from the air, which would increase the mass of the tube. So if the gas contains water vapor, tube 1 would gain mass equal to the water it absorbed.

So the 3.60g gain in tube 1 suggests that 3.60g of water was present in the gas mixture. Because Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb
