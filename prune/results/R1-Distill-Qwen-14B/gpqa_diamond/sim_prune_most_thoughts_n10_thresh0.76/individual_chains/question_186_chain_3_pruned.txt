Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about the Cope rearrangement of a specific compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my Cope rearrangements, but I'll try to think it through.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me visualize its structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane means it has two rings: a bridge with two carbons and another with two, right? So, the structure should have a seven-membered ring with two bridges. The 2-azabicyclo indicates a nitrogen atom at position 2. And there's a vinyl group (CH2-CH2) attached at the same position as the nitrogen, I think.

Wait, the structure is 2-vinyl, so the vinyl is attached to the nitrogen. So the molecule is a bicyclic compound with a bridgehead nitrogen and a double bond in the ring, I believe. The double bond is at position 5-ene, so that's between carbons 5 and 6 maybe?

The Cope rearrangement typically occurs in 1,5-dienes. Oh wait, wait. In the case of bicyclic systems, I think the Cope rearrangement can also happen in certain bridged or annulated systems. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of a norbornene-type compound undergoing an electrocyclic reaction or some kind of sigmatropic rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes. The molecule needs to have conjugated double bonds in a 1,5-diene system. But in this case, the structure is a bicyclo compound, so does it have two double bonds?

Wait, the compound is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So, the parent bicyclo system has a double bond at position 5. The vinyl group (CH2-CH2) is attached at position 2. So, the molecule has two double bonds: one in the bicyclo ring (at 5) and the vinyl's double bond.
