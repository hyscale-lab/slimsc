Okay, let's try to tackle this science problem step by step. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll break it down.

So, the question is about a chemical reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. Let's go through each part carefully.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. That makes me think that X might be a diatomic molecule with isotopes. For example, maybe X is something like D2O (deuterated water) if the element is hydrogen. Or perhaps it's something else. The heavier isotope suggests that one of the atoms in X is a heavier version, like deuterium instead of protium.

The reaction is violent when X reacts with liquid Y. The products include gas W, which has molecules with the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of neutrons and protons? So each W molecule has n = p, so the atomic number equals the mass number minus n. Let me think: for a molecule, the total neutrons and protons per molecule. So for example, H2O has molecules, but their atoms have different n and p. But W's molecule must have each atom's neutrons equal protons. Wait, no, maybe it's per molecule. Like, the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons in total. Or per atom? Hmm.

Wait, the question says "the gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." Oh, wait, the molecule as a whole. So for example, if W is H2, each H has 1 neutron and 1 proton, but wait, each H atom in H2 has just one proton and one electron, but neutrons can vary. Wait, no. Wait, if it's hydrogen, like protium, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (since protium has mass number 1). So H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons in the molecule. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe another gas.

Wait, let's think of another gas. What about CO2? No, that's a molecule with C=O-O. But C has 6 protons, O has 8. Let's see: each CO2 molecule has 6 + 16*2 = 48 protons and (6 + 16*2) neutrons? Wait, no, no. Wait, the number of
