Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. Hmm, the question is asking about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let me think. I remember that when dealing with heat equations, finite difference methods are common. Higher order approximations probably mean using more terms to make the solution more accurate. Parallel splitting—oh right, that's a method to make the algorithm run faster by using multiple processors or threads. So the idea is to break down the problem into parts that can be solved simultaneously.

The matrix exponential function is involved here. Wait, matrix exponentials are often used in solving systems of linear differential equations, right? So in the context of heat equations, which are PDEs, discretizing them leads to a system that can be represented with matrices. The solution might involve exponentiating this matrix, maybe using something like the method of lines where you convert the PDE into a system of ODEs.

Now, the question says the matrix exponential is approximated by a fractional approximation. Fractional approximation methods, like using Padé approximants, which are rational functions that approximate the exponential more accurately than Taylor series, especially for larger time steps. So fractional approximation is a way to compute the matrix exponential efficiently.

The key factor for converting sequential to parallel is probably something about how the computation can be split. Stability analysis (Option A) is important for ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up, but I don't think it's the key factor here. Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions (Option B) might affect the setup but not directly the parallel conversion. 

Complex roots of fractional approximation (Option C) or linear partial fraction (Option D). Wait, Padé approximants can sometimes be expressed as a linear combination of terms, perhaps involving partial fractions. If the approximation can be broken down into terms that don't interfere with each other when computing different parts, that could allow parallel processing.

Linear partial fraction decomposition would split the matrix exponential into terms that can be computed independently. Like, if the exponential is a sum of terms each involving different parts of the matrix, each part can be computed on a different processor. So the ability to split the computation into linear partial fractions would enable parallelism. 

Alternatively, complex roots might complicate things, but maybe that's more about stability or how the approximation behaves. Or perhaps the roots allow for a certain type of decomposition. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the question mentions "parallel splitting." Splitting methods in numerical analysis often refer to decomposing the problem into subproblems that can be solved in parallel. For linear systems, this might involve something like the waveform relaxation method or domain decomposition. 

In the context of matrix functions, if the approximation can be written as a sum of terms that can be computed separately, then each term can be handled in parallel. So maybe the linear partial fractions allow that splitting. For example, if the matrix exponential can be expressed as a sum of exponentials of smaller matrices or something, each part can be processed in parallel.

So looking at the options again, option D says "Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation." That would mean decomposing the approximation into parts that
