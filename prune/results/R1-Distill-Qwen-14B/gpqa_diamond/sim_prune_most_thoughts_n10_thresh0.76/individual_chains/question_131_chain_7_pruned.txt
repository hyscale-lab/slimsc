Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to digest all the information.

So the question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. This acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products, major and minor. Both have the molecular formula C13H16O3. The NOESY NMR spectra show a cross-peak in the major but not in the minor. The question is about which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, the initial reaction: dehydration of a cis-dicarboxylic acid to form an anhydride. Dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride by losing a water molecule. Since the starting material has a cis-alkene, I'm guessing that the dehydration is forming a cyclic anhydride, maybe a five-membered ring because that's common. Wait, but the anhydride structure isn't given, so perhaps I'll need to think about the NMR data provided.

The anhydride's 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. Wait, 7 ppm is usually aromatic or something deshielded. But wait, could it be an alkene proton? No, alkenes are usually upfield, maybe around 4-6 ppm. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's something like a carbonyl adjacent proton, but that's more around 2-3 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic ring with equivalent protons. But wait, the problem says it's a single peak in the 1H NMR. So maybe it's a singlet in the aromatic region. So perhaps the anhydride is something like a substituted cyclopentane with equivalent protons?

Wait, the 13C NMR shows two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 is probably a carbon adjacent to an electronegative group, like an oxygen. Maybe a carbonyl group? Wait, 165 ppm is a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester or anhydride. So maybe the anhydride has two carbonyl carbons. But wait, an anhydride typically has two carbonyl groups. So perhaps the 137 is an sp3 carbon adjacent to a carbonyl, like a CH2 connected to an oxygen, and 165 is the carbonyl.

Wait, but wait: what about the 1H NMR single peak at 7 ppm. Maybe that's the protons on the oxygen in the anhydride? No, usually those are deshielded and maybe in the 5-6 ppm range. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic ring, but the starting acid is a dicarboxylic acid
