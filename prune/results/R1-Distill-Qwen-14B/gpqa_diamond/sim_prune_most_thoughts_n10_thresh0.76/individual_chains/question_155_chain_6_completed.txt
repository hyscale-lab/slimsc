Okay, so I'm trying to find the uncertainty in P_z for this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Right, I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

First, let me make sure I understand the setup. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2]. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which means that the state can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of P_z.

Wait, but how do I find the expectation values? Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ψ† O ψ, where O is the operator matrix, and ψ is the state vector.

So I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. Let me write down the matrix for P_z. From the problem statement, it's a 3x3 matrix:

P_z = [[ ħ, 0, 0 ],
        [0, 0, 0 ],
        [0, 0, -ħ ]]

So the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ. The off-diagonal elements are zero.

The state vector ψ is [-1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2].

First, compute ⟨P_z⟩. Let's compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward. Each component of ψ will be multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z, then summed. So:

⟨P_z⟩ = (-1/2)*ħ + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ)
= (-ħ/2) + 0 + (ħ/2)
= (-ħ/2 + ħ/2) = 0. So the expectation of P_z is zero.

Now, ⟨P_z²⟩. Well, since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared will have each diagonal element squared. So the matrix P_z² is:

P_z² = [[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ],
         [0, 0, 0 ],
         [0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ] ]
= [[ ħ², 0, 0 ],
   [0, 0, 0 ],
   [0, 0, ħ² ] ]

So when we compute ψ† P_z² ψ, it's:

(-1/2)^2 * ħ² + (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 + (-1/2)^2 * ħ²

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/4) * ħ² = ħ²/4
Second term: (1/2) * 0 = 0
Third term: (1/4) * ħ² = ħ²/4

Adding them together: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (ħ²)/2.

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this simplifies to sqrt( (ħ²/2) - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ² / 2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Did I make any mistake?

The state vector is [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2]. Its squared magnitude should be 1 because it's a normalized state. Let's check:

(-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 +1)/4 = 4/4=1. Yep, normalized.

So the calculations for the expectation values should be correct.

Looking back at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches our result.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ for the given quantum system, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The operator $P_z$ is given as a diagonal matrix:

\[
P_z = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\hbar
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The state of the system is the column vector:

\[
\psi = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1/2 \\
1/\sqrt{2} \\
-1/2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = (-1/2)(\hbar) + (1/\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = -\hbar/2 + 0 + \hbar/2 = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is also diagonal:

\[
P_z^2 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \hbar^2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = (-1/2)^2(\hbar^2) + (1/\sqrt{2})^2(0) + (-1/2)^2(\hbar^2).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar/\sqrt{2}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
