Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon it absorbs to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, so I'll need to calculate the right momentum.

First, I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels of a diatomic molecule are quantized. The molecule can change its vibrational state and rotational state when it absorbs or emits a photon. But wait, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor accounts for bond length fluctuations, especially during vibration. But for this problem, maybe the main focus is on the vibrational transition since the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state.

Wait no, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So that would be the first vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0) or maybe J=1? Wait, no. For the rigid rotor model, the ground state is J=0, but in the non-rigid model, perhaps it's similar. So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0.

When the molecule absorbs a photon, it goes to the next lowest energy state. The next state would be either increasing the vibration or rotation. But since the question is about the lowest possible energy next state, I think it's referring to the first excited state, which is probably the next vibrational state, v=1. Because increasing the vibrational state requires more energy than rotational, maybe. Or does it? Wait, no, the vibrational energy levels are higher in spacing than rotational. So the energy difference for vibration is larger. So if the molecule absorbs a photon that allows it to transition to the next state, which is the lowest possible energy, that would be the next vibrational state. Because the rotational transitions can be smaller, but the problem is about the next state in general.

Wait, no, the "next state" with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the least energy increment. But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest in both vibration and rotation. So the next state could be either a transition to a higher vibrational state (v=1, J=0
