Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, wait a second, I think the formula might be a typo. 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, benzene rings can't have two substituents without a number. Oh, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps the "d" stands for something else. Wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe the "d" is a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene or something else. Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure.

Wait, maybe the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, but that's toluene with bromine at the para position? No, wait, 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene would have bromine at position 1 and methyl at 2. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the question is about 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,3-dimethylbenzene. Wait, but the question's correct structure is probably 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions. So if I have a benzene ring with a bromine and some substituents, and I'm treating it with a strong base, perhaps it's an elimination reaction. So maybe it's a case of forming a benzyn intermediate, which can undergo various reactions.

Wait, but wait, NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base. So when you have a benzene ring with a leaving group like bromine and adjacent groups, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a benzyn (aryne) intermediate. The benzyn can then undergo various reactions, such as dimerization or trapping with other species, but perhaps in this case, the substituents on the benzene ring can influence where the elimination happens and what products form.

Wait, the structure in question is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So perhaps that's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene? Let me draw it. So the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1 and two methyl groups at position 2. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So the ring would look like: Br at position 1, methyl groups at position 2 (so two methyls on C2?), making it a 2,2-dimethyl group. So the structure is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene.

So when treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base, the base would abstract a proton beta to the bromine, leading to elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond (benzyne). But wait, the positions matter here. So in 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene, the bromine is at position 1, and the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. But position 2 has two methyl groups. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2 or 6, which is adjacent to the bromine.

Wait, but position 2 has two methyl groups. So the H that's abstracted would be either from position 2 or 6. Wait, but if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2, then elimination would occur between C1 (Br) and C2 (which has two methyl groups). But wait, can there be two possible sites for elimination? Or maybe the structure allows only one possibility.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that when you have the bromine at position 1 and methyl groups at position 2, the adjacent positions (ortho) are 2 and 6. But in this case, position 2 is already substituted with two methyl groups, so perhaps the hydrogen available for abstraction is only at position 6. Or is there a hydrogen at position 2?

Wait, benzene rings with substituents adjacent to each other: in 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene, the substituents are at C1 (Br) and C2 (two CH3 groups). So the structure is such that C1 has Br, and C2 has two CH3. Therefore, the adjacent carbons to C1 are C2 and C6. But C2 is substituted with two CH3 groups, meaning that perhaps there are no hydrogens on C2 available for deprotonation. Because if C2 has two CH3 groups, then the structure is something like:

       CH3
       / \
      C   C
     /     \
Br---C---C---
     \     /
      CH3

Wait, no, actually, the structure would have the Br on C1, and C2 has two CH3 groups. So the possible positions for H elimination would be from C2 or C6. But if C2 has two CH3 groups, perhaps all the hydrogens adjacent to C1 are on C6. Or wait, perhaps C2 is adjacent to C1, but C2 has no H's because it's substituted with two methyl groups. That would mean that the base can't abstract a hydrogen from C2, so the only possible H's to abstract are from C6, which is also adjacent to C1.

Wait, but C6 is adjacent to C1 as well. So if C1 is Br, the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. So if C2 has no H's because it's substituted with two CH3 groups, then the only H available for elimination is from C6. So the base would abstract a hydrogen from C6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. Wait, but wait, triple bonds between adjacent carbons are not common in benzene rings. No, wait, when you eliminate HBr from adjacent positions, you form a triple bond, creating a benzyn (aryne) intermediate.

So in this case, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, it would eliminate Br and form a triple bond between C1 and C6. But wait, if the Br is at C1 and the H is at C6, elimination would be between C1 and C6, forming a triple bond between those two positions. But wait, C1 and C6 are adjacent? Because in benzene, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. So elimination between C1 and C6 would form a triple bond between C1 and C6, which would be a meta position relative to the original substituents?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to imagine the ring. Let's number the benzene ring with C1 at the top. Then C2 would be to the right, C3 down-right, C4 bottom, C5 down-left, C6 left, and back to C1. So, in this setup, C1 has Br, C2 has two CH3 groups, and the adjacent carbons to C1 are C2 and C6. Now, C2 has two CH3 groups, so perhaps no H's are available on C2. So the base can't abstract a H from C2, so the only option is C6. So the base would take a H from C6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. But wait, wait, if H is abstracted from C6, then the elimination would be between C1 (Br) and C6, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. But wait, that's adjacent carbons, so the triple bond would be between C1 and C6. Hmm, but that's a possibility.

Wait, but wait, when you have a benzene ring with substituents at C1 and C2, and you eliminate H from C6, the triple bond would form between C1 and C6, creating a aryne (benzyn) structure. Now, this benzyn can undergo various additions. But wait, in this case, the substituents on the ring would influence where the addition occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that elimination can occur in two different positions, leading to different products. But in the case where C2 has two methyl groups, perhaps only one elimination site is possible.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. So the structure is: Br on C1, two CH3 groups on C2. When NaNH2 is added, it deprotonates a hydrogen beta to Br. So the possible positions for H abstraction are adjacent to Br, which are C2 and C6.

But C2 has two CH3 groups, so perhaps there are no H's available there. So the base can only abstract a H from C6. Therefore, elimination occurs between C1 (Br) and C6, forming a triple bond between them, creating a benzyn intermediate.

But wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. If C2 has two CH3 groups, then each CH3 has three H's. So maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that C2 has one methyl group, but the question says 2-d, which is likely a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene, which is 2,2-dimethyl-1-bromobenzene.

In that case, the structure is a benzene ring with Br at position 1, and two methyl groups at position 2. So in this structure, each of the adjacent carbons to C1 (C2 and C6) has substituents. C2 is substituted with two methyl groups, so perhaps the H's on C2 are not available. So the only available H's are on C6, which is adjacent to C1. So the base would abstract a H from C6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6, creating a benzyn (aryne) ring.

Once the benzyn forms, it can undergo various reactions. But in the case of NaNH2 in ammonia, perhaps the benzyn is formed and then, because it's a strong base, maybe the benzyn can dimerize or undergo some kind of addition.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible organic products formed. So perhaps the benzyn can form, and then it can react to form different products. Let me think about what reactions benzyn can undergo.

Benzyn is a highly strained molecule with a triple bond. It's very reactive and can undergo various reactions, including:

1. Dimerization (like forming biphenylene), but I don't think dimerization would occur under these conditions. Not sure.

2. Electrophilic addition: the triple bond can react with an electrophile to form a substituted benzene. But in this case, the solvent is ammonia, which is a weak base. Wait, but the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a liquid at low temperatures and can act as a base. So perhaps the benzyn would react with ammonia.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, and in condensed ammonia, perhaps the conditions favor elimination rather than addition. Alternatively, maybe the benzyn would undergo some kind of ring-opening addition.

Wait, another possibility: the benzyn can form, and then undergo trapping by another molecule, perhaps leading to coupling products. Alternatively, the benzyn could add to itself.

Wait, but perhaps in this case, the benzyn can undergo a ring-opening via an addition reaction. For example, if the benzyn has two substituents adjacent to each other, perhaps the addition of a nucleophile can occur.

Wait, but in this case, the benzyn would have a triple bond between C1 and C6, which are adjacent positions, and the substituents on the ring are Br (now gone, since it's eliminated) and two methyl groups on C2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, let me try to approach this differently. Let's think about the possible products formed.

If the benzyn forms between C1 and C6, then perhaps the ring becomes highly strained, and when it reacts, it can add something across the triple bond. But in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps the benzyn doesn't react further, but maybe the reaction stops at the formation of the benzyn. Or perhaps the benzyn can undergo some cycloaddition or other reaction, but I'm not too familiar with that.

Wait, another thought: when you have a benzene ring with a leaving group (like Br) in the presence of a strong base, you can get dehydrohalogenation to form a benzyn intermediate. Then, depending on the structure, the benzyn can undergo different types of reactions.

In this case, the benzyn is formed between C1 and C6. Now, the benzyn has substituents: two methyl groups on C2 and the triple bond between C1 and C6. So the ring has the substituents adjacent to each other in a way that may influence the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the benzyn can undergo a ring expansion or some other rearrangement, but that's probably more advanced than this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn can react with another molecule, leading to coupling products. For example, two benzynes could couple to form a biphenylene structure, but I'm not sure if that's a product formed under these conditions.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible organic products. Let me think: does the reaction form only one product, or multiple?

Wait, perhaps the initial elimination leads to only one benzyn structure, so the number of products depends on the number of possible traps or reactions that benzyn can undergo.

Alternatively, maybe the benzyn doesn't form because the structure doesn't allow elimination.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. So, C1 has Br, C2 has two methyl groups. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, then elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6, creating benzyn. But wait, would this lead to any possible addition products?

Wait, considering that the benzyn has two methyl groups on C2 and a triple bond between C1 and C6, perhaps the benzyn can react in such a way that the addition occurs in two different positions.

Wait, but in this scenario, the benzyn is symmetrical in some way. Let me imagine the structure. The triple bond is between C1 and C6. Then, C2 has two methyl groups, and C3 and C5 may have H's. Wait, no, in benzene, all positions are symmetric, but in this case, the substituents are at C1, C2, and C6. Hmm, maybe the structure is such that the benzyn can add in two different ways, leading to different products.

Wait, perhaps when the benzyn forms, it can add a nucleophile (like NH2-) at different positions, leading to different products. For example, the addition could occur at C3 or C5, if those positions are available.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn can add in two different positions, leading to two different products. If that's the case, then the number of products would be two.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps the elimination leads to a single benzyn structure, which can undergo two different reactions leading to two products. Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn can rearrange or add in two different ways, leading to multiple products.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn forms, but due to steric hindrance from the two methyl groups on C2, the addition can only occur in one position, leading to a single product.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible outcomes.

If the benzyn forms between C1 and C6, then the triple bond is between those two positions. The substituents on C2 are two methyl groups, which are bulky. So when the benzyn undergoes some reaction, perhaps the addition is directed by these substituents.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the benzyn can trap an amide ion (NH2^-) from the solution, leading to nucleophilic addition. Alternatively, maybe the benzyn can dimerize, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn can undergo cycloaddition with another benzyn molecule, but again, I'm not certain.

Wait, but the problem states that NaNH2 is present in condensed ammonia. So the solvent is NH3, and the base is strong. Perhaps the benzyn can react with the amide ion. Let me think about such a reaction.

When a benzyn reacts with an amide ion (NH2^-), perhaps it can add across the triple bond, leading to the formation of a substituted benzene. But where would that addition happen?

In the benzyn structure, the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and C2 has two methyl groups. So when the nucleophile (amide ion) attacks, it can add to either the C2 position or another position.

Wait, but in the benzyn, the positions adjacent to the triple bond are C1 and C6. The substituents are on C2. Let me imagine the structure: the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and C2 has two methyl groups. So the benzyn is symmetric about the C1-C6 axis. Therefore, when the nucleophile attacks, perhaps it can attack either the C2 position or perhaps other positions, but considering the positions available.

Wait, perhaps the benzyn is symmetric, leading to only one product upon addition of the nucleophile, regardless of where it adds. Alternatively, perhaps the addition can occur in two different positions, leading to two different products.

Wait, but considering the substituents, perhaps the addition is directed. For example, the two methyl groups on C2 are bulky, making one position more favorable for addition than the other. Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn can add the nucleophile at either end of the triple bond, but due to symmetry, it leads to the same product.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible products. If the benzyn adds NH2^- across the triple bond, perhaps it would form a benzene ring with substituents at C1 and C6. Wait, but wait, adding across the triple bond would lead to a six-membered ring again, but perhaps with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the benzyn (which has a triple bond between C1 and C6) reacts with NH2^- to form a benzene ring where the nucleophile adds to C1 and C6, leading to a structure where the positions adjacent to the triple bond have the nucleophile added. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn can undergo an addition reaction, and the product could have the added group at C3 or C5, depending on where the nucleophile attacks.

Wait, but in the case where the benzyn is symmetrical, perhaps the addition leads to only one product. So the number of possible products would be one.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn can add in two different positions, leading to two different products. But if the structure is symmetric, perhaps both additions lead to the same product.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as I thought, and instead, the product is a single compound.

Wait, another angle: if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene, elimination leads to a benzyn with substituents that block one side, leading to only one possible site for addition. Therefore, only one product would form.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think about another possibility. Maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent added in such a way that there are two possible products.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn can form two different products based on where the addition occurs.

Wait, perhaps the benzyn can add the amide ion in two different positions, leading to two distinct products. For example, perhaps the nucleophile can attack either the C2 position or another position, leading to two different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn can't form because the substituents are too bulky, so no product forms, but that's not an option here.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about what the possible products could be.

If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene and it undergoes elimination to form a benzyn between C1 and C6, then perhaps the benzyn can undergo a ring-opening reaction. When the benzyn reacts with NH2^-, perhaps it adds across the triple bond, leading to a new substituent in a specific position.

But wait, in the benzyn structure, the substituents are on C2, which is adjacent to C1 and C3. So when the benzyn forms, the ring has Br at C1 (which leaves), and two methyl groups on C2. So when the benzyn forms, the triple bond is between C1 and C6.

Wait, but wait, if the triple bond is between C1 and C6, then the adjacent carbons would be C2 and C6. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn structure leads to two possible positions for the addition of the amide ion. So, for example, the addition could occur at C3 or C5, leading to two different products.

Wait, but considering the substituents, perhaps the addition would occur in a position that's most favorable, leading to only one product. Alternatively, perhaps the addition occurs at C3 and C5, but due to symmetry, both lead to the same product.

Wait, but the starting substituents are at C1 and C2. So when the triple bond forms between C1 and C6, the substituents are at C1 (Br, which leaves) and C2 (two CH3). So the benzyn would have substituents at C2 and the triple bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, but perhaps the benzyn can add the amide ion at either C3 or C5, which are both meta to the substituents. So if the addition occurs at C3, you get one product, and at C5, another. But if the structure is symmetric, perhaps these two positions are equivalent, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, maybe the amide ion can add to either end of the triple bond, but since it's a symmetric structure, both additions lead to the same product.

Hmm, this is getting really confusing. Let me try to think of a simpler example. For instance, when 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene is treated with a strong base, you can form a benzyn, which can then add a nucleophile in different positions. But in that case, perhaps the substituents would direct the addition to specific positions.

Wait, in the scenario I'm considering, the substituents are at C2 and C6. Wait, no, in the starting material, the substituents are at C1 (Br) and C2 (two CH3). So after elimination, the substituents are at C2 and the triple bond between C1 and C6.

So, perhaps when the benzyn forms, the addition of the amide ion can occur at either C3 or C5, but because the substituents are at C2, which is ortho to both C1 and C3, perhaps the nucleophile would add at C3 and C5, leading to two different products.

Wait, but if the structure is symmetric, perhaps adding at C3 and C5 leads to the same product, as they are mirror images. So in that case, only one product would form.

Alternatively, maybe the nucleophile can add in two different positions, leading to two different products, thus making the total number of products two.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again: the benzyn has a triple bond between C1 and C6. The substituents are at C2 (two methyl groups). So when the nucleophile attacks, it could add to either C3 or C5. But would those positions be equivalent, or would they lead to different structures?

If the substituents at C2 are two methyl groups, which are bulky, perhaps the nucleophile would prefer to add on the opposite side, leading to a specific product.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn can add the nucleophile in two different positions, leading to two distinct products.

In that case, the number of possible products would be two.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn can form only one product because of symmetry.

Wait, another point to consider: when the benzyn is formed, the positions adjacent to the triple bond are C2 and C6. So perhaps the nucleophile can attack either C2 or C6, but wait, C2 already has two methyl groups, so it's unlikely to have a hydrogen for attack. So perhaps the nucleophile can only attack C6, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nucleophile can attack C3 or C5, which are meta to the substituents.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Let me think of the possible options again.

The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the reaction forms only one product, then the answer is B)1.

If it forms two products, the answer is C)2.

But how?

Another approach: perhaps the starting material can undergo elimination in two different ways, leading to two different benzynes, which then each form their own products.

Wait, but in the starting material, 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene, the only possible elimination is between C1 and C6, as C2 is substituted with two methyl groups, so no H's available.

So only one benzyn forms. Then, when it reacts, it can form one or more products.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn can undergo addition in two different positions, leading to two different products.

But if the benzyn is symmetric, perhaps it can only form one product upon addition.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as I thought, and the product is a single compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn can't form because the starting material's structure doesn't allow for elimination.

But I think elimination is possible because the substituents are adjacent.

So, if the benzyn forms, and then reacts in only one way, leading to a single product, then the answer is B)1.

Alternatively, if it can form two products, the answer is C)2.

I'm torn between B and C.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the benzyn can add the amide ion in two different positions, leading to two different products. For example, adding to C3 and C5, which are both meta to the substituents.

If the substituents are on C2, then adding to C3 and C5 would create two different products because the substituents (methyl groups) are on C2, which is adjacent to both C1 and C3. So, perhaps in one case, the product would have a substituent at C3, and another at C5, but wait, the starting material already has substituents.

Wait, no, the starting material's substituents are at C1 (Br) and C2 (two methyl groups). After elimination, the Br leaves, and the triple bond forms between C1 and C6. Then, when the benzyn adds the amide ion, perhaps the product would have a new substituent at C3 or C5.

If the addition occurs at C3, then the product would have a NH2 group at C3. If it occurs at C5, the NH2 would be at C5. But since the starting material has substituents at C2, perhaps the addition can only occur at one of these positions due to steric hindrance.

Wait, but in reality, the addition could occur at either C3 or C5, leading to two different products: 3-aminophenyl-2,2-dimethyl and 5-aminophenyl-2,2-dimethyl. But are these structures distinct? Or are they the same due to symmetry?

Wait, the benzene ring is symmetric. Let's consider the substituents. After elimination, the substituents are at C2 (two methyl groups) and the triple bond between C1 and C6. When the benzyn adds NH2, the product would have an NH2 group at C3 or C5.

Wait, but the positions C3 and C5 are symmetric with respect to the substituent at C2. So adding NH2 at C3 and C5 would result in two different products unless they are mirror images, which in a benzene ring would be the same due to rotation.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents at C2 would make C3 and C5 not equivalent. Because the substituent at C2 (two methyl groups) would break the symmetry between C3 and C5. So adding NH2 at C3 and C5 would lead to two different products.

Wait, but that depends on whether the structure is chiral or not. Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring's substituents make C3 and C5 distinct.

So, in that case, the reaction could lead to two different products, making the total number of products two.

But wait, perhaps the benzyn can only add the amide ion in one position due to steric hindrance, leading to only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn can add in both positions, leading to two products.

But without more information, it's hard to be certain. But given the options, perhaps the correct answer is that there are two possible products, so the answer is C)2.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia, a strong base. This typically leads to dehydrohalogenation, forming a benzyn (aryne) intermediate via elimination of HBr. The structure of the starting material is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and two methyl groups at position 2. 

When NaNH₂ abstracts a β-hydrogen, elimination occurs between the bromine at C1 and a hydrogen at C6, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The resulting benzyn has substituents at C2 (two methyl groups) and the triple bond between C1 and C6. This intermediate is highly reactive and can undergo further reactions, such as nucleophilic addition.

The benzyn can react with the amide ion (NH₂⁻) from the solvent, leading to the addition of the nucleophile across the triple bond. The possible positions for addition are C3 and C5, which are meta to the substituents on the benzene ring. Due to the bulky methyl groups at C2, the addition at C3 and C5 results in two distinct products: one with the NH₂ group at C3 and another at C5. These positions are not equivalent because the substituents at C2 break the symmetry of the molecule.

Thus, the reaction produces two distinct organic products. 

Answer: C
