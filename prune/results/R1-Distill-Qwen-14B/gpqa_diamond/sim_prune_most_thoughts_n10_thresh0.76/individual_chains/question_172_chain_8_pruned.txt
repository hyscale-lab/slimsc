Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let's see what the question says. So, there are two stars, star_1 and star_2. The iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, also the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

The question is about finding the correct equation for the effective temperatures T1 and T2 of the stars, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). 

I remember that in LTE, the excitation of atoms is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are energies, k_B is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as delta E = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but since star_1 has twice as excited atoms, that probably means the population ratio is 2. Let's think: the excited state population is higher in star_1. So for star_1, the ratio (n_i / n_j) is 2. For star_2, it's 1, perhaps? Wait, no, let me make sure. The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, maybe the ratio is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2. Or perhaps the ratio is 2 when comparing star_1 to star_2. Let me re-read that part.

It says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Oh, so (n_i star_1) / (n_j star_1) is 2 times (n_i star_2)/(n_j star_2). Or wait, maybe it's that the excitation (like the ratio) is twice. Hmm, perhaps I should write it as (n_i / n_j)_1 = 2 * (n_i / n_j)_2. 

Assuming that the statistical weights (g_i and g_j) are the same for both stars, which is probably the case since we're talking about the same element, iron. So the ratio simplifies to exp( - delta E/(k_B T) ) for each star. 

So for star_1: (n_i / n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-delta E/(k_B T1)). Similarly for star_2, it's (g_i/g_j) * exp(-delta E/(k_B T2)). 

But wait, the problem says that the excitation is twice in star_1 compared to star_2. So (n_i / n_j)_1 = 2 * (n_i / n_j)_2. 

So putting it together:

(g_i/g_j) * exp(-delta E/(k_B T1
