Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think through each option carefully.

The question gives four options, a to d, and then the choices are A to D, each corresponding to one of the options. So first, I should probably understand each option's description.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth, right? So Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So I guess this would have the same density as Earth.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but they're giving the density here. So its density is the same as Earth? So same as option a. But wait, how does mass affect density? Well, density is mass divided by volume. So a planet with more mass but same density would have a larger volume. So if it's 2 Earth masses, but same density, its radius would be larger. Because volume scales with radius cubed. But in this option, density is given as 5.5, same as Earth. So its density is the same as Earth, same as a.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition implies same density. Because Earth's density is determined by its composition—like the materials inside. So if another planet has the same composition, it would have the same density as Earth. So that would mean its density is 5.5 g/cm³. So same as a and b.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition implies same density. So density is 5.5, same as Earth. So same as a, b, c.

Wait a minute, but wait. Are any of these options different? Because if all have the same density, then the question's answer must be that all have same, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says "which one has the highest density?" So if all options a-d have the same density, then they all have the same, but that's not the case. Because perhaps I'm wrong about some of them.

Wait, let me think again. Option a is Earth-mass and Earth-radius. So same as Earth, so density 5.5. Option b is 2 Earth masses
