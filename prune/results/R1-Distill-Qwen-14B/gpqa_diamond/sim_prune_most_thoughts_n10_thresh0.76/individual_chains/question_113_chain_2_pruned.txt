Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question gives me the data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2.

Starting with the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O), maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (C=C) stretch, but I'm not too sure about that. Alternatively, it might be conjugated with another group.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe part of a ring or as a substituent.

Looking at the Mass Spec data, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, m/z 45 is a significant clue. I remember that 45 is the mass for (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. Or wait, no, acetone is (propan-2-one), molecular formula C3H6O. But maybe more importantly, I think the fragment at 45 could come from a ketone group. Because in mass spec, when a molecule breaks, a common fragment is the methyl ketone (like (CH3)2CO) which is 58? Wait, no, wait, molecular weight of (CH3)2CO: C3H6O. Carbon is 12*3=36, H is 6, O is 16. Total 36+6+16=58. Oh, but wait, the peak here is at m/z 45. So maybe it's something else. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment at m/z 45 could be from a ketone where the carbonyl is at the end, like R-CO-R'. Maybe the loss of a certain group leads to a fragment with 45. Alternatively, 45 could correspond to (CH3)CO- (like an acetyl group without the R). Let's think: CH3CO is C2H3O2? Wait, no. Wait, the molecular formula for CH3CO (acetyl) is C2H3O. Wait, but that doesn't add up. Let me calculate: C=12, H=1, O=16. So C2H3O has a molecular weight of (2*12)+(3*1)+(16) = 24 +3 +16=43. Oh, but the mass here is 45. Hmm, maybe not.

Another thought: the fragment could be a ketone where R-CO- is part of a larger structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl group that's part of a ring, like in a cyclic ketone. But I'm not too sure.

Now, let's look back at the other data. The NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, so the molecule must have a double bond. So maybe it's an ester with a double bond? Or perhaps a ketone and an alcohol, but that might complicate things.

Wait, the FTIR has a strong peak at 1700. That's a strong carbonyl. The 1650 could be a conjugated double bond (like an alkene) or another carbonyl group. But 1650 is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl, so maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugation. Alternatively, maybe an ester or amide, but amides have lower carbonyl peaks.

But wait, looking at the options, all the compounds have either O, O2, etc. So the functional groups are either alcohols, ketones, esters, carboxylic acids, etc.

Let me try to think about each option and see which fits.

Option A: C6H12O2. The degrees of unsaturation can be calculated. For C6H12O2: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one DoU could be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR says it has vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond. That uses up one DoU. So another DoU could be from the O-containing groups. Wait, the formula has two oxygen atoms. So possible structures: maybe a cyclic ester (lactone), or an ester with a double bond, or a ketone and an alcohol, but that might not fit the IR.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU for C6H10O is (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2= 2. So two DoU: could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc. But this might be a cyclic ketone or an aromatic ring.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is (2*6+2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. So either two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. But the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, so DoU would account for that plus another (like a ring or another double bond).

Option D: C6H12O. DoU is (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU: either a ring or a double bond. But again, the NMR says there are vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond.

Wait, but the FTIR has two strong carbonyl peaks. Hmm. Two carbonyl groups? That would require two C=O bonds. Let's see which options can have that.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Could have two carbonyl groups? Like a diketone? But would that fit the NMR and the mass spec?

Option C: C6H10O2. Maybe an ester (which has a carbonyl) and perhaps something else. Wait, an ester is R-O-CO-R, so that's one carbonyl. Another carbonyl would require another group, but with two oxygen atoms, perhaps another ester or a ketone. Wait, but with two oxygen atoms, maybe a cyclic ester (lactone) which has one carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe a structure with both an ester and a ketone, but that would require more oxygen unless it's an anhydride. Hmm, but an anhydride would have two carbonyls. Wait, but anhydrides have two carbonyl groups. For example, a cyclic anhydride would have two. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, the IR has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Those could be two different carbonyls. For instance, maybe one is an ester (around 1700) and another is a ketone (around 1700 as well, but maybe in a conjugated system lower to 1650). Alternatively, maybe one is a carboxylic acid (which is around 1700), but if it's a broad peak, that could be the O-H. Wait, but the very broad peak at 300
