Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal, but the angles between them are the same. Oh wait, I think in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all the same, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are equal too. So in this case, the angles are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance... so that's the distance between atoms in the lattice, which would be the lattice parameter 'a' I suppose. Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is equal to 'a', right? So here, a = 10 Angstrom.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distance d is calculated using the formula from X-ray crystallography. Oh right, the formula is 1/d² equals the sum of (sin²θ)/(h²) for each plane. Wait, no, wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, no, the interplanar distance formula for a crystal is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) * (1 + 2cosα * ... wait, no, that's not right either. Let me think.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a cubic system? Oh, for a cubic system, the formula is d_hkl = a
