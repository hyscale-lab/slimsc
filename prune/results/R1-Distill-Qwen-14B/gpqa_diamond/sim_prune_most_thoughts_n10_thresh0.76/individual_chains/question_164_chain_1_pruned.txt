Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem is about binary star systems. There are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and their periods are given. The period for system_1 is 2 years, and for system_2, it's 1 year. Wait, the period is the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Oh right, primary eclipse is when the hotter star is eclipsed by the cooler one, or something like that. But I think for this problem, the key is that the period relates to the orbital period of the two stars around their common center of mass.

Then, they did spectroscopic observations and found radial velocity (RV) variations. In system_1, the velocities have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of the system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm. So I need to find the mass ratio or something like that. Wait, I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocity method gives us the velocities of each star around the center of mass. The more massive star has a smaller orbit, so lower velocity? Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star.

But wait, the amplitude of the radial velocity is related to the mass. I think the formula comes from Kepler's laws. Let me think. The mass function involves the radial velocity and the period. Oh right, the mass function is (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ), where i is the inclination. But since both systems are eclipsing, their inclinations are close to 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately 1. So we can ignore that.

But I'm not sure if we can directly compare the masses from the RV data. Let me think about the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (P (1-e²)^0.5 ) )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2) )^(2/3) )

Wait, but since e is probably not given, perhaps we can assume e is zero, or that it's negligible. So maybe the formula simplifies.

Wait, alternatively, in a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The ratio of their velocities is inversely proportional to their masses. So if the mass of star 1 is M1 and star 2 is M2, then V1/V2 = M2/M1. Because M1 * V1 = M2 * V2 (conservation of momentum). So V1 = (M2/M1) * V2.

So in system_1, the two velocities are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. Let's say the bigger velocity is V1 and the smaller is V2. Because typically, the more massive star moves slower. So M1 is more massive than M2 if V1 is the velocity of M1. So M1/M2 = V2/V1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is 0.5 times M2. Then the total mass of the system is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, but this is just for system_1. How about system_2?

In system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. Assume the larger velocity is for the less massive star. Let's say velocity a is 15 and velocity b is 10. So mass ratio would be M_a / M_b = V_b / V_a = 10/15 = 2/3. So M_a is (2/3) M_b. The total mass would be M_a + M_b = (2/3 + 1) M_b = (5/3) M_b.

Wait, but wait a second. The velocities in each system are for the two stars. So for system_1, the masses are M1 and M2, and their velocities are V1 = 10, V2 =5. So M1/M2 = V2 / V1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 = 0.5 M2. So M_total_1 = M1 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Similarly, for system_2, the velocities are V_a =15, V_b=10. So M_a / M_b = V_b / V_a =10/15 = 2/3. So M_a = (2/3) M_b. So M_total_2 = M_a + M_b = (5/3) M_b.

But how do these relate to each other? We need to find the mass ratio between system_1 and system_2.

Wait, but perhaps we can use the fact that the orbital period is the same for both stars in a binary system. So the period of system_1 is 2 years, and system_2 is 1 year. Wait, but earlier I thought the period was the same for both stars. Because they orbit each other with the same period. So the period P is the same for both stars in a system. So in system_1, P is 2 years, system_2, P is 1 year.

Wait, but how does the period relate to the mass?

I remember that Kepler's third law relates the period and the mass. The formula
