Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which statement about the Mott-Gurney equation is correct. Hmm, I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation is related to the current-voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices, specifically in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * V² / L³. So, J is the current density, ε is the dielectric constant, μ is the carrier mobility, V is the voltage, and L is the length of the device.

I think the Mott-Gurney equation applies when the current is limited by the space charge, meaning the charge builds up in the device and creates a potential gradient that opposes further injection. This is usually in the case of a single-carrier device, like an LED or a photodiode under certain conditions.

Wait, okay, the equation assumes a few things. I remember that in the derivation, they make approximations. One is that the device is single-carrier, so only electrons or holes are moving, not both. Also, it's probably for a situation where the contacts are ideal, maybe ohmic contacts. Ohmic contacts would mean that the potential barrier is zero, so there's no injection barrier. That would make sense because if there were a barrier (like a Schottky contact), that complicates things with the injection process.

Another point is that the Mott-Gurney equation assumes negligible trap effects. So the material is trap-free, meaning no impurities or defects that trap the carriers. If there were traps, the current might follow a different regime, like the trap-limited current.

Also, I think the derivation neglects some terms related to diffusion. Oh wait, wait. The Mott-Gurney equation is in the SCLC regime, which is for very high voltages where the space charge dominates. In this case, the current is limited by the electric field created by the space charge, and the main contributions are from the drift current. So if the equation already accounts for drift, maybe the diffusion current is negligible. Or wait, maybe in the derivation, they neglect diffusion terms because drift dominates.

Let me think about the options.

Option A: Valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, no, because in SCLC the drift current is important. If drift were negligible,
