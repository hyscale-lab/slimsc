Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's reacted with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Then product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form product 4. The question is about how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in product 4. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, I'll try to imagine the structure of the starting material. 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. The substituent is at position 7, which is the bridgehead. So the structure has a tert-butoxy group attached to the bridgehead (position 7) of norbornene (since it's a diene, but the substituent is at 7). So the starting molecule is a norbornene derivative with a bulky tert-butoxy group.

The first reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and with dibromomethyl groups... wait, I think this is a substitution reaction. The dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups. So perhaps the norbornene is undergoing some kind of Diels-Alder reaction? Or maybe it's an addition reaction.

Wait, the starting material is a diene (norbornadiene), and the other molecule is cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups. Wait, no, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a cyclohexene with substituents at 5 and 6 positions. Each substituent is a dibromomethyl group, which is (CH2Br)2, I think. So each is a -CH2Br2 group? No, wait, dibromomethyl would be -CH2Br, but two bromines on the same methyl? Like -CBr2H? Or is it -CH2Br but with two such groups on the ring?

Wait, the structure is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has at positions 5 and 6 two groups, each being a dibromomethyl. So each of those positions has a methylene group that's substituted with two bromines. So each substituent is -CH2Br? Wait, no, wait. Dibromomethyl would be a methyl group with two bromine substituents. So it's -CH2Br or -CBr2. Wait, no, methyl is CH3. So dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2? No, that's impossible because a carbon can't have five bonds. Oh wait, dibromomethyl is CH2Br2? No, that's impossible because it's CH2Br2 would have four bonds. Wait, no, wait. Dibromomethyl is probably -CH2Br, but with another Br on the same carbon? Wait, wait, maybe each substituent is a -CHBr2 group. So each substituent is a methylene bromide with two Brs. So, like, CHBr2 groups attached to the cyclohexene ring at positions 5 and 6.

So, the molecule is cyclohexadiene with two substituents at 5 and 6, each being -CHBr2. So structure is:

Positions 1 and 3 are double bonds (1,3-diene), positions 5 and 6 have -CHBr2 groups.

So when this reacts with the norbornene compound, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction. The norbornadiene is the diene, and the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile? Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, norbornadiene is a good diene for Diels-Alder. The dienophile would usually be something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl, but here the dienophile is this substituted cyclohexadiene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a [4+2] cycloaddition.

But wait, the reaction uses sodium iodide, which is a good source of iodide ions. So maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. The dibromomethyl groups are good leaving groups. So perhaps the norbornene is acting as a nucleophile, attacking the cyclohexadiene at the dibromomethyl positions.

But each cyclohexadiene has two substituents (positions 5 and 6), each with -CHBr2. So when 2 equivalents of this are used, perhaps each substituent on the cyclohexadiene is attacked twice.

Wait, but the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group, which is a bulky, electron-donating group. So maybe the norbornene is a diene that can undergo some conjugate addition or cycloaddition.

Alternatively, considering that the reaction is done in the presence of NaI, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. Each -CHBr2 group is a good leaving group because Br is a good leaving group, especially when a base is present. But wait, NaI is a source of iodide, which is a better nucleophile than bromide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a SN2 substitution, where the iodide ion replaces the bromide. But the groups are CHBr2, so each substituent is CH2Br2? No, because that's impossible; each would be CHBr2, meaning each substituent is CH2Br2? Wait, no, perhaps each substituent is CH2Br, and there are two of them on the same carbon? No, that's not possible as that would be CHBr2, which can't have two leaving groups.

Wait, maybe the molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, meaning each of the substituents at 5 and 6 is a dibromomethyl group. So each substituent is -CH2Br, but each substituent has two Brs. Wait, no, that can't be. Because a methyl group can't have two Brs attached. Unless it's -CBr2H. So each substituent is -CHBr2, but that would make each group a -CHBr2 group.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is -CH2Br, but with two Brs in total on each substituent? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the substituent is a -CH2Br group, but there are two of them on the cyclohexadiene. So the cyclohexadiene has two -CH2Br groups at positions 5 and 6.

Wait, perhaps I should think of
