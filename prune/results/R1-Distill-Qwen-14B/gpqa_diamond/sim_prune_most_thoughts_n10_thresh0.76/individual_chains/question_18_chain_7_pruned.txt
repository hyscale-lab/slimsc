Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see if I can think it through.

Alright, the question is about determining the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. We've got their masses and some elemental abundance ratios. Hmm, so I remember that the notation [X/Y] means the logarithm of the ratio of the number of X to Y atoms compared to the Sun. So for example, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, which means that Star_1 has silicon relative to iron at 10^0.3 times the solar ratio.

Wait, but the problem gives [Fe/H]_1 as 0, which I think means that the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is 0, so log(nFe/nH) would be the same as the solar value.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So that simplifies to log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. Wait, but wait, 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5-12 → which is -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, for Mg, the Sun's log(nMg/nH) is 7. So 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5. Wait, because 7 is the value after 12, so 7-12 =-5. So nMg/nH is 10^(-5) per hydrogen.

But wait, let me think again. The notation is 12 + log10(nX/nH) = some number. So for the Sun: nFe/nH = 10^(7.5 -12) = 10^(-4.5), which is about 3.16e-5. And Mg is 10^(7-12) → 10^-5 → 1e-5.

Now, let's look at the given abundances for the stars. 

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → This means log(Si/Fe)_1 = 0.3 → Si/Fe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is higher than in the Sun by a factor of ~2.

- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H is same as the Sun. So Fe/H = 1.

Wait, but if Fe/H is the same as the Sun, that means the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as Sun, which is 10^(-4.5).

But since [Fe/H] is 0, that implies that Star_1 has the same metallicity as the Sun for
