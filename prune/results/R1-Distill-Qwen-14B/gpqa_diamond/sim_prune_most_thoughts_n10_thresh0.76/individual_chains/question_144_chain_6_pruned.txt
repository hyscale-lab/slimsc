Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm. Let me think. I remember that decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the mean decay distance is gamma times c times the lifetime, multiplied by the velocity, because distance is velocity times time. Wait, maybe I should write that down.

So, gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? Gamma equals E divided by m, because E is the total energy, and m is the rest mass. Oh wait, E here is given as 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV. So Gamma (the factor) would be 8 / 1.2, which is about 6.666... or 20/3. 

Next, the lifetime of the particle. The mean lifetime is the inverse of the decay width, I think. Oh wait, the width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. Wait, no, the relationship is Γ = ħ * τ, or maybe Γ = ħ / τ? Let me think. I remember that the natural line width is ħ times the decay rate, which is 1/τ. So Γ = ħ * (1/τ), so τ = ħ / Γ. 

But wait, the units here are in GeV. I need to be careful with units. Let's see. The decay width Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32
