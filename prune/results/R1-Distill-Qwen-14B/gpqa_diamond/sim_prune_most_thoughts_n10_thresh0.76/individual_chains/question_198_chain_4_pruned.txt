Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt-containing species.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, the stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. So, for each complex, βn is the constant for the nth complex. Like, for Co(SCN)_n^2- or something like that.

So the complexes would be Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, Co(SCN)_4. The β values are given for each step. So the formation of each complex is stepwise. Like, β1 is for Co^2+ + SCN- ↔ CoSCN^2-, β2 is the next step, adding another SCN-.

Wait, but sometimes people use overall stability constants, like for the formation of Co(SCN)_n from the ions. But in this case, since the βs are given as 9,40,63,16, perhaps each β represents the stepwise formation. Wait, but β4 is 16, which is smaller than β3. That's interesting. Usually, each step's β might get smaller, but not sure. Hmm.

The problem is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, which one is blue? I remember that Co complexes with different numbers of SCN- can have different colors. Like, I think Co(SCN)_4^2- is blue. So the question is about the percentage of the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex.

So, the question is about finding the fraction of Co in the form of [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But wait, I need to consider all possible species in solution. So, the total cobalt concentration is the sum
