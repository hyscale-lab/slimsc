Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let me think this through step by step.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The molecule is ethan-1-one with a substituted phenyl group. The substituents on the benzene ring are a bromine and a nitro group. The numbering is such that the ketone (ethan-1-one) is attached to the benzene ring at position 1. Then, the bromine is at position 3 and the nitro group is at position 5. Wait, no, waitâ€”wait, the substituents on the benzene ring are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group. So the ketone is at position 1, which would make the substituents at 3 and 5. Oh wait, in aromatic rings, positions are numbered so that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So let me think again.

Wait, the phenyl group is connected to ethan-1-one, so the benzene is attached to the carbonyl carbon (which is position 1 of the ketone). So the structure is a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached, and then on the ring, at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment (the ketone), we have a bromine and a nitro group. So the ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone.

Now, I need to think about the steps needed to introduce these substituents in the correct positions.

Benzene can undergo electrophilic substitution reactions. The key here is directing. Nitro groups are meta-directing, and bromine is also meta-directing. But wait, the order in which the substituents are introduced will affect where the next substituent goes.

Wait, the target has a nitro group and a bromine. Let me think about the order of adding these groups and the ketone.

The ketone is at position 1. So the first step might be to introduce a substituent that will direct the next substituent to the correct position.

Wait, benzene rings with substituents: when you add a group, its directing
