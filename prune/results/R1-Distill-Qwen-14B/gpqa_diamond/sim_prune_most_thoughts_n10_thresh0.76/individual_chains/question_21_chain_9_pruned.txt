Okay, so I need to solve this chemistry question about isomers and tautomerism. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The question is asking about two parts, A and B. Part A is identifying which compound does not show tautomerism. The options given for A are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Part B is about which of the two compounds shows optical isomerism: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate.

I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond to form different structures, like in keto-enol tautomerism. So, for a compound to show tautomerism, it should have a structure that allows for such a shift.

Let me start with part A. Benzoquinone is a derivative of benzene with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone usually has two ketone groups in the para positions, right? So, its structure is a benzene ring with two O double bonds attached opposite each other. Now, can benzoquinone tautomerize? Tautomerism usually requires a conjugated system where a hydrogen can move. Benzoquinone has a conjugated system, but since both are ketones, maybe the movement isn't possible. Wait, wait, no. Benzoquinone is actually a diketone, so in the ortho, meta, or para positions. Wait, in para positions, it's a fixed structure. But I'm trying to think if it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. For that, you need alpha hydrogens. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups, but if the structure is such that there are alpha hydrogens available, then tautomerism is possible. Wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups, but their positions determine if there are alpha hydrogens. If the quinone is para, then each ketone is at positions 1 and 4. So, each is attached to a benzene carbon. Wait, but in that case, the adjacent carbons (like position 2 and 3, etc.)â€”do they have hydrogens that can shift?

Alternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, it's a cyclic triketone.
