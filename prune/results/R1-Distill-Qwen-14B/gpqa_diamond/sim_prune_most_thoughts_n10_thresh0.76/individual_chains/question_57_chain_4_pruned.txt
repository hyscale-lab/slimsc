Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering amplitude and phase shifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momenta. The phase shifts are δ0=90 degrees, δ1=67, δ2=55, δ3=30, δ4=13 degrees. And we're ignoring the rest. The electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm not sure if that's relevant for this part.

Wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, the scattering amplitude is usually denoted as f(θ, ω), but when you're looking along the incident direction, θ would be 0 degrees. So f(0, ω).

I remember that the scattering amplitude in partial wave expansion is given by the sum over l of (2l+1) e^{iδl} (something). Or maybe it's the sum (2l+1) [e^{iδl} -1 ] times some spherical harmonics or something. Wait, no, the general form is f(θ,φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [e^{iδ_l} - 1 ] (Pl(cosθ)) e^{i l φ}.

But wait, when θ is zero, because we're along the beam direction, cosθ is 1. So Pl(1) is 1 for all l, since Pl(x)=1 at x=1.

And φ would be zero as well because the scattering is along the same direction, so e^{i l φ} becomes e^0=1.

So the amplitude f(0,0) would be sum from l=0 to ... of (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l} -1) *1 *1.

But wait, the imaginary part of the amplitude is what's being asked. So I need to compute the imaginary part of this sum.

Each term is (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l} -1). Let's expand e^{iδ_l} as cosδ_l + i sinδ_l. So (e^{iδ_l} -1) becomes cosδ_l -1 + i sinδ_l.

Multiplying by (2l+1), each term becomes (2l+1)(cosδ_l -1) + i (2l+1) sinδ_l
