Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, mathematically, that's N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Hmm, right, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh wait, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So the formula is plx = 1/distance, or plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. Wait, more accurately, plx in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So if plx is small, the star is far away, and if plx is large, the star is nearby.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I need to find how N depends on r.

Let me get the relation straight. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But plx is 1/r. So substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that. 

1/( (1/r)^5 ) is the same as (r^5). So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, that would make N ∝ r^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars would increase as r^5? That seems high, but let's think carefully.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check that substitution. Because plx is 1/r. So plx = 1/r. So 1/(plx)^5 = (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. That means the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. Hmm, but wait, that's counterintuitive. Because when you look further away, you should see fewer stars in a unit distance, right? Because stars are more spread out. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no, no. Let me think again. The number of stars observed at a certain distance depends on the volume. The number of stars in a spherical shell (like a thin slice) at distance r with thickness dr is proportional to the surface area (4πr²) times dr. Because the volume of the shell is 4πr² dr, and if stars are
