Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where this density matrix ρ is located in the qubit space. Hmm, the question gives me ρ as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. 

Wait, what's the geometrical position of a density matrix? Oh right, I think for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has coordinates (x, y, z), and any single-qubit state can be represented on it.

But wait, how does this density matrix translate into those coordinates? I remember that for a pure state |ψ>, the Bloch vector is given by the coefficients of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the vector (x, y, z). So to find r, I need to express ρ in that form.

Let me write down the given ρ. It's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Wait, |0><0| is the projection operator for state |0>, same for |1>. Let me write them out in the computational basis. 

|0><0| is:
[[1, 0],
 [0, 0]]

|1><1| is:
[[0, 0],
 [0, 1]]

Adding them together gives:
[[1, 0],
 [0, 1]]

So ρ is (1/2) multiplied by this matrix, which gives:
[[0.5, 0],
 [0, 0.5]]

Hmm, so ρ is a diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal. Now, I need to write this as (I + r·σ)/2. 

The identity matrix I is:
[[1, 0],
 [0, 1]]

So (I + r·σ)/2 would expand to (I/2) + (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So calculating each term:
σ_x is off-diagonal, σ_y has imaginary terms, but our ρ is real and diagonal, so maybe the x and y components are zero.

Let me compute (I + r_z σ_z)/2, considering that maybe r_x and r_y are zero. Because ρ has no off-diagonal terms, which would come from σ_x and σ_y. So maybe r_x = r_y = 0.

So (I + r_z σ_z)/2 = [ [[1, 0],[0,1]] + r_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ] / 2.

That gives:
[ [ (1 + r_z)/2 , 0 ],
  [ 0, (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

Compare this to the given ρ, which is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So (1 + r_z)/2 must be 0.5, same for (1 - r_z)/2.

Let me solve for r_z.

(1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Wait, that can't be right because then the other term (1 - r_z)/2 = (1)/2 = 0.5. So both diagonal terms are 0.5, which matches. But then r_z is zero, so r = (0, 0, 0)?

Wait, let me think again. If r is (0, 0, 0), then the density matrix is (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which is exactly the given ρ. So yes, the Bloch vector r would be zero.

So the position is at the origin. Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which should be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

For a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere. The general form of a density matrix in this representation is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector. The task is to determine the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) corresponding to the given \( \rho \).

First, expand the given \( \rho \) in the computational basis. The projection operators \( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| \) and \( \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \) are:

\[
\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Adding these matrices gives:

\[
\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} = I.
\]

Thus, the given \( \rho \) becomes:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.5 & 0 \\
0 & 0.5
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, compare this with the general form \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} (I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}) \). Expanding \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \), we have:

\[
\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z,
\]

where the Pauli matrices are:

\[
\sigma_x = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\sigma_y = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\sigma_z = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since \( \rho \) is diagonal and has no off-diagonal terms, the contributions from \( \sigma_x \) and \( \sigma_y \) must vanish. This implies \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \). The remaining term is \( r_z \sigma_z \), so:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r_z \sigma_z \right).
\]

Substituting \( \sigma_z = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\), we get:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 + r_z & 0 \\
0 & 1 - r_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \( \rho = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.5 & 0 \\
0 & 0.5
\end{bmatrix}
\), we find:

\[
1 + r_z = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad 1 - r_z = 1.
\]

Solving these equations gives \( r_z = 0 \). Therefore, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the density matrix is at the origin in the Bloch sphere.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
