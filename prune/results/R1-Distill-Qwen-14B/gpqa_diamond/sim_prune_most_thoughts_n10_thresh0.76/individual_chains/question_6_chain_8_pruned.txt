Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, potentials often lead to specific types of energy levels, especially when they can be separated into parts that depend on r and θ.

Wait, so let me break down the potential. The first term is (1/2)kr², which looks familiar. Oh right, that's the potential for a simple harmonic oscillator in one dimension. But wait, in two dimensions, a simple harmonic oscillator might have terms in each direction. Oh, but wait, the potential here is in polar coordinates, so maybe it's a radial harmonic oscillator part and another part that depends on the angle θ.

The second term is (3/2) kr² cos²θ. That's a bit more complicated. Cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Remember, cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in: (3/2) kr² * (1 + cos(2θ))/2. Let me compute that: that's (3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos(2θ). So maybe the potential can be rewritten as V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos(2θ). Wait, adding the first and the new terms: (1/2 + 3/4) kr² is (5/4) kr². So V(r,θ) becomes (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos(2θ).

Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the potential can be expressed in terms of separate r and θ contributions, leading to a product of operators in the Hamiltonian. Because in polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian usually splits into radial and angular parts.

The general form of the Hamiltonian in polar coordinates is something like (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + V(r,θ). So the potential here is V
