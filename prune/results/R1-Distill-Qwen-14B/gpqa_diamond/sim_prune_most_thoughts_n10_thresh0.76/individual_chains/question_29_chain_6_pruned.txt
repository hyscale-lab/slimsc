Okay, so I've got this question about barley genetics and mutations. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. That compound makes it unusable for food, so they want to get rid of it. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. Then they used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and looked at the gene sequences, focusing on the first exon area.

The options are Mutant 1 to 4, and we need to pick which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I'm a bit rusty, but I think the key here is understanding how mutations in the gene could lead to a non-functional compound. So maybe a disruption in the gene's function would stop the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

Looking at the sequences, the intact gene has a certain sequence, and each mutant has a change somewhere in the first exon. Let me compare each mutant.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, looking at the first part, it seems that in Mutant 1, maybe the fifth base is changed. Let me see: the intact starts with ATGTTT, while Mutant 1 is ATGTTT... Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me see each line.

Wait, maybe I should look at each change more carefully. Let me line them up:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, looking at the start, the intact is ATGTTT. Mutant 1 has ATGTTCTA... Wait, let me count the letters.

Intact: ATGTT T C TCG... Wait, maybe it's better to compare each corresponding part.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for frameshifts or in-frame changes. Because EMS typically causes point mutations, mostly substitutions. So, the question is about which mutation would disrupt the gene's function, perhaps creating a premature stop codon or altering the protein enough to disable it.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The initial part is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC… So, comparing to the intact gene, perhaps there's a substitution at position 6. Wait, the intact gene has TTTCTCGCTGGTACT... Hmm, looking at the first few codons might help.

Wait, let's look at the first 15 bases of each:

Intact: 5' ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT A CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ...

Wait, maybe I should consider each variant's effect.

Another approach: the anti-nutritional compound is made by the gene product. So, if the gene is non-functional, the compound isn't made. So, which mutation causes a non-functional gene? That could be a nonsense mutation (introduces a stop codon) or a frameshift that alters the reading frame, leading to a truncated protein or a completely different one.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: Let's compare. Intact has ...TTCTCGCTGGTACT. Mutant 1 has ...TTCTACGCTGGTACT. So, perhaps a substitution in the third codon. Let me count the bases. Let's
