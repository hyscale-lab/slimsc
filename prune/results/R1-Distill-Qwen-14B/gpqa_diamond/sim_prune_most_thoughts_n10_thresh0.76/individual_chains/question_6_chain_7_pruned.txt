Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The problem states that a particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions in a potential V(r,θ) given by (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials, we often look for separable solutions and use coordinate systems that make the problem easier. Since the potential depends on r and θ, maybe polar coordinates are appropriate here. Oh wait, because the potential is in two dimensions, so polar coordinates (r, θ) make sense.

Let me write down the potential again: V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I can factor this as V(r,θ) = (k r²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Wait, 1 + 3 cos²θ? Hmm, maybe that's not the most helpful way to look at it. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to see it as a sum of terms in r² and r² cos²θ.

Wait a second, the potential has an r² term and another term proportional to r² cos²θ. So, the potential isn't spherically symmetric because it depends on θ. So maybe we can't use spherical coordinates in the same way as central potentials. But since it's two-dimensional, perhaps cylindrical coordinates are better, but I'm not too sure.

Wait, another thought: The potential can be written as (1/2)k r^2 + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out r²: V(r,θ) = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

Hmm, maybe I can separate this into terms that depend only on r and terms that depend on θ. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution to simplify the problem. Let me think about the form of the Hamiltonian.

The Hamiltonian in two dimensions (assuming polar coordinates) is H = (-ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dψ/dr) ) + (1/(r²)) (d²ψ/dθ²)
