Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius but has some dark spots on one hemisphere. The problem is about figuring out the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation as these spots.

Hmm, okay. So, first, let me parse the details. The star's radius is the same as the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in spots with a 20% filling factor. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So when the star rotates, these spots come into view, causing the brightness to dip. But since it's only one hemisphere, the effect is like a planet transit but not exactly the same.

Wait, the question says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So, we need to find Rpl/Rstar, such that the dip from the planet is the same as the dip from the spots.

I remember that the change in brightness during a transit is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula I recall is ΔF ≈ (R_planet / R_star)^2. But wait, this is only when the planet blocks the star's light. However, in this case, the spots on the star are causing a dip because they are cooler and emit less light.

So, the dip from the spots isn't just about the area but also the temperature difference. So perhaps I should model the flux from the star normally and the flux when the spots are visible.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So, the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, but a hemisphere is half the star. So the area of the star is 4πR², so a hemisphere is 2πR². So the spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4 π R².

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the spots as covering a certain fraction of the star's surface. Filling factor is 20%, so the area is 0.2 * surface area of the star. The star's surface area is 4πR², so spots are 0.2 *4πR² = 0.8π R². Wait, wait, is the filling factor the fraction of the surface covered? I think that's correct. So one hemisphere is covered, so maybe the 20% is per hemisphere? Or is the 20% the total coverage of the entire star? Hmm, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% for that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

The area of the hemisphere is 2πR², so spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4 π R².

Each spot has a temperature of 6000K - 1000K = 5000K, but wait, no. The star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. So the flux from the spots is less than the surrounding.

When the star rotates, we see the spots as they come into view. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, the maximum dip in brightness would be when the spots are fully facing us. But the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation, so the maximum dip should be when the spots are completely in front. So the amplitude is the difference in flux when the spots are visible versus when they're not.

Wait, but the star's total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spotted areas. When the spots are
