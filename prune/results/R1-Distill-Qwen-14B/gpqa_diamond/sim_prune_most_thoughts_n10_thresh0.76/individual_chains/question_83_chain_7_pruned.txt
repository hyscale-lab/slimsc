Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with titration calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. We start by diluting 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So the reaction should be a neutralization where the acid donates H+ to the base. The equivalence point is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the initial steps. The initial volume and concentration of acetic acid. So the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be volume (in liters) multiplied by concentration. 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters, so 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Then we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles/volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but when we titrate with NaOH, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. So for the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added should equal the moles of acetic acid.

But the problem asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. So first, let's handle each part.

Starting with the 25% titration. That means only a quarter of the required NaOH has been added. So the moles of NaOH added will be 25% of the moles of acetic acid.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 moles. So 25% of that is 0.0002
