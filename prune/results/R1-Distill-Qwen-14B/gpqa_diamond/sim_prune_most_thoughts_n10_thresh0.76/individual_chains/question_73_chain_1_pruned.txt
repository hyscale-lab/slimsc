Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see what I remember about relativity.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, I think about relative velocity. Wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up normally like they do in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)), right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract their speeds.

So let me plug in the numbers. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. Since both are in the same direction, the relative speed of the first from the second's perspective would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c*0.5c)/(c²)). Wait, but let me think about the signs. Since both are in the positive direction, the relative velocity should be positive. So subtracting 0.5c from 0.6c gives 0.1c in the numerator. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. That matches option C and D for the relative speed part.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the formula (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1v2)/(c²))? Or is it the other way around? Because relative velocity depends on the frame. If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, then from B's frame, A is moving at (0.6 - 0.5)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)/1 ) c. Yeah, that's right. So the relative speed is (0.1)/(0.7)c = about 0.1428c, so 0.14c when rounded to two decimal places.

So that part should be either C or D, because their v_rel is 0.14c.

Now for the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic kinetic energy, but wait, the total energy would be the sum of their rest mass energies plus their kinetic energies? Or wait, no. In relativity, the total energy includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. But when considering the system's total energy, you have to consider each object's energy from the same reference frame. Wait, but the problem states that they are moving in the same direction at their respective speeds. So each has their own energy as observed from the lab frame?

Wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." So from the lab frame, each astronaut has their own energy, and the total is the sum
