Okay, so I've just started my new job at this structural biology lab, and the first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. The PI gave me the amino acid sequence and four plasmid options. I need to figure out which plasmid to use.

Hmm, the main goal here is to express the Human P53 protein. I remember that when cloning genes into E. coli, the plasmid's origin of replication and selection markers are important, but more importantly, the presence of a strong promoter and the correct reading frame are critical. Since the PI said to produce it quickly, the construct must be correctly designed for expression.

Looking at the options, each plasmid is a DNA sequence starting with ATG, which is the start codon. So, each is a possible coding sequence. But I need to find which one correctly encodes the given amino acid sequence.

Wait, wait. The amino acid sequence starts with M (methionine), which is correct because the first codon is ATG. So each plasmid starts with ATG, but the sequences after that might differ.

I think I should look for the start codon followed by the correct sequence that translates into the given amino acids. The longer the sequence, the more likely it's the correct one. But all options are long, so I need another strategy.

Wait, perhaps the plasmids differ in their coding sequences. Maybe some have the correct ORF. Oh, right, sometimes plasmids have multiple cloning sites with different restriction sites, but the question says the sequences are different.

Wait, the question states that each plasmid has a different sequence. So I need to find which of these DNA sequences corresponds to the given amino acid sequence when translated.

Another approach: The correct plasmid should have the same length of nucleotides as the coding sequence of the P53 protein. Let's see: the amino acid sequence has 393 amino acids (counting the MEEPQSDPSVE...etc.). Each amino acid is encoded by three nucleotides, so the coding DNA should be about 393 *3 = 1179 nucleotides. But looking at the options, they are longer because each plasmid probably includes other elements like promoters, RBS, etc.

Wait, but in the plasmid sequences, the AT
