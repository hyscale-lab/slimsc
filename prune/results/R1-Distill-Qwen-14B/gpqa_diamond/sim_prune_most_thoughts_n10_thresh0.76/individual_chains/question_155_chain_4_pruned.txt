Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It looks a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The setup is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The state vector is provided, and I need to calculate the uncertainty.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I'll need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

Wait, but the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Does that mean anything for the expectation values of P_z? Since P_x and P_z don't commute (they are different components of angular momentum), the state won't be an eigenstate of P_z. So the uncertainty shouldn't be zero.

The given state is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me write this as |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ].

I think the first step is to compute ⟨P_z⟩, the expectation value of P_z. Then compute ⟨P_z²⟩, and finally take the square root of their difference.

So, the matrix form of P_z is given as:
[ [ℏ, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -ℏ] ]

So P_z is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries ℏ, 0, -ℏ.

To find ⟨P_z⟩, I'll compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Let's compute that. Since the state is a column vector, the conjugate transpose (bra) would be the row vector [ -1/2*, (1/√2)*, (-1/2)* ].

But wait, are the components real numbers? Yes, in the given state, all the elements are real. So the conjugate transpose is just [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Now, multiplying the bra with P_z:

[ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] multiplied by P_z matrix.

Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal, the matrix multiplication simplifies to each component multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

So the product P_z ψ is:

First component: (ℏ)(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = -ℏ/2
Second component: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = 0
Third component: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (-ℏ)(-1/2) = ℏ/2

So P_z ψ = [ -ℏ/2, 0, ℏ/2 ]^T.

Now, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the inner product of ψ with P_z ψ.

So ψ† (P_z ψ) = (-1/2)(-ℏ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ℏ/2).

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)(ℏ/2) = ℏ/4
Second term: 0
Third term: (-1/2)(ℏ/2) = -ℏ/4

Adding them up: ℏ/4 + 0 - ℏ/4 = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Wait, that's interesting. So the average P_z is zero. What about ⟨P_z²⟩?

P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element because P_z is diagonal. So P_z² is:
[ [ (ℏ)^2, 0, 0 ],
  [0
