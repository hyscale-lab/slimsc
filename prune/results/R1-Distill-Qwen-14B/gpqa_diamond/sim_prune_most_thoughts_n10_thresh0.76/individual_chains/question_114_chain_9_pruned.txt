Okay, so I’ve got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let's break each reaction down.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. Adding NaCN, which is sodium cyanide. I remember that in the presence of a proton source, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. So, maybe this is an example of the cyanohydrin formation. The cyanohydrin reaction usually involves the addition of a nitrile group to a carbonyl. The conditions are typically an acid catalyst. So, A must be an acid. Because without acid, the reaction might not proceed.

Wait, but what's the cyanohydrin formation? Oh, right, when you add CN- to a ketone, it does a nucleophilic addition, but for that, a proton is needed to make the carbonyl more electrophilic. So, the acid (like H3O+) would protonate the carbonyl, making it easier for the cyanide to attack. Then, after the addition, another protonation step might happen, but I think the product is the cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol and a nitrile on the same carbon in this case.

So the first part: reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Looking at the starting material, it's a nitrile with a hydroxyl group adjacent to it. The product is a carboxylic acid. So, how do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I think the typical method is hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions. But wait, what are the conditions for nitrile to carboxylic acid?

Hmm. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids with strong acid, or under strong basic conditions followed by acid work-up. Alternatively, sometimes you use a two-step process with different reagents. But in this case, the reaction is with B and water. So what reagent B would facilitate this?

Wait, I think that in the presence of H2O and a strong acid, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids. Or maybe it's a hydrolysis with acid catalysis. Alternatively, using a strong base like HCl might be involved. Let me think: The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually goes through an intermediate amide. But wait, maybe under acidic conditions, the nitrile is protonated, making it more reactive. Or perhaps it's done using H2O in the presence of HCl. Alternatively, if the nitrile is in a solution with H3O+ or another acid, then it hydrolyzes.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-hydro
