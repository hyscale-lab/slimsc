Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectral data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Hmm, that molecular formula. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, but here, X (halogens) are zero, right? So, plugging in the numbers: C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2.

So, (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2? Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate. 2C is 18, plus 2 is 20. Then subtract H, so 20-11=9. Then add N (1), so 10. Then subtract X, which is 0 here. So 10/2 is 5 degrees of unsaturation. Five. That could be a benzene ring (which accounts for 3, since a benzene has three double bonds), plus maybe an amide group or ester, which would have another double bond. Or perhaps a ring plus some other structures.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretching. So, amine or amide groups. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like an ester, amide, or maybe a ketone. But in this case, the compound has an amide or ester since there's an O in the formula. So 1720 is typical for ester (maybe around 1740-1720) or amide (lower, maybe around 1650-1700). Wait, but 1720 is a bit high for amide, more like ester. Hmm, but sometimes amides can have higher carbonyl peaks, especially if they are less conjugated.

Then the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: that
