Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through. The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. I need to figure out what the product looks like after a Cope rearrangement.

Wait, what's a Cope rearrangement again? Oh right, it's a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that typically occurs in 1,5-dienes. The reaction forms a new six-membered ring, right? So the diene has to be conjugated with a double bond, and the rearrangement moves the groups in a specific way.

Let me draw the structure of the starting material. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene means it's a norbornene structure. So, the bridgehead is at positions 1 and 4, I think. The compound is 2-vinyl, so there's a vinyl group attached at carbon 2. The bridge is a bicyclo with two two-membered bridges and one one-membered bridge. Wait, norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, right? But this compound is 2-vinyl, so perhaps the substituent is on carbon 2, and the double bond is at position 5.

So the structure: looking at norbornene, which has two fused rings, a five-membered and a six-membered ring? No, wait, norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1], so it's a bicyclic system with bridges between carbons 1-2, 2-5, and 5-7 or something like that. Wait, maybe I should number the carbons. Let me imagine norbornene: it's a bicyclic system where carbons 1, 2, 3 form a bridge, 2, 5, 4 form another bridge, and 5, 6, 7 another part. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try to sketch it. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene has seven carbons. So positions 1,
