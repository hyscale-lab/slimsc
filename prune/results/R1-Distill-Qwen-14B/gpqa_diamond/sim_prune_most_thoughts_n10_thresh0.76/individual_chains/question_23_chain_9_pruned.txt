Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about the reaction of a specific compound with hydrogen bromide, HBr. The compound given is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Hmm, let me draw that structure in my mind.

So, the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is 3-en-1-yl, meaning the double bond is between carbons 3 and 2. Wait, no, wait: the numbering—oh right, but-3-en-1-yl. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but wait, no, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 because the en is the 3 position. So the structure is CH2CH2... Wait, maybe I should think of the butenyl group. Let me break it down.

But-3-en-1-yl would be: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 is butyl, but with a double bond starting at position 3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH₂-CH2 but wait, butenyl is four carbons with a double bond. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH₂CH₂ but wait, the double bond is between C3 and C4? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-O- attached to benzene? No, wait, I think I'm mixing up the positions.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ but the double bond is between C2 and C3, right? Because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂, but the double bond is between C3 and C4. No, wait, no, but I think the correct structure is CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ but with a double bond starting at C3. Wait, maybe I should write it out.

The formula is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the butenyl group is CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CH₂? No, wait, no. Wait, the substituents are on the second carbon of the butenyl group. Let's see: the butenyl group is four carbons, with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3? Or 3 and 4? Because but-3-en-1-yl implies that the double bond starts at carbon 3.

Wait, the structure of but-3-en-1-yl would be CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, no, but wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ with the double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me count the positions. The butenyl is four carbons in total. The numbering starts from the end closest to the oxygen. So, position 1 is the first carbon
