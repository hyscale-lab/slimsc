Okay, so I have this question about cosmology and quasars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my cosmology, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. I'm supposed to find the comoving distance of this quasar from Earth using the Lambda-CDM model parameters given.

Wait, what's a comoving distance? Oh right, comoving distance is a way to measure distances in an expanding universe. It's the distance between two points measured along a path that is comoving with the expansion of the universe. So for a given scale factor 'a', the comoving distance is fixed, regardless of the expansion.

The parameters given are the Hubble constant H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density parameter Ω_m = 0.3, dark energy density parameter Ω_λ = 0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ω_total = 1). 

The peak wavelength is about 790 nm. I remember that in the context of quasars, the emission lines can be broad and sometimes we observe them in certain parts of the spectrum. Oh wait, the Lyman-alpha emission line is around 121 nm in the rest frame of the quasar. But if the observed wavelength is much longer, that suggests redshift due to the expansion of the universe.

Wait, but the peak here is at 790 nm. Let me think: if the rest wavelength is,
