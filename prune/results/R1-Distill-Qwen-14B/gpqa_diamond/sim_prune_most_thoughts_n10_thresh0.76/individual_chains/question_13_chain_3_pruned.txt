Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. It's a bicyclic compound, right? The structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, I think. So, it's like a ring system with two rings, maybe a norbornene structure. And the configuration is R, which is the (+) form. So (R)-limonene.

The first reaction is with Pd/C under hydrogen. So that's hydrogenation. Stirred with palladium on carbon, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. They add hydrogen, so they're probably adding H2 across a double bond. Limonene has a double bond in the bicyclic structure. Let me think: the structure of limonene is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So when hydrogenated, it would add H2 across the double bond.

Wait, but "after 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed", so that suggests only one H2 is added. But hydrogenation typically requires two H2 molecules per double bond, right? Like each double bond can take two H's. Oh wait, maybe it's a partial hydrogenation, or perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalytic hydrogenation of a different site. Hmm.

Wait, limonene's structure: it's a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So it's a bridged bicyclic compound. When hydrogenated, it would become bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So that's a saturated structure. So product 1 would be the hydrogenated limonene, which is called something like adamantane? Or maybe just the saturated version, which I think is called bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. 

But wait, the starting material is (R)-limonene, which is a chiral molecule. When hydrogenated, does the configuration change? Well, hydrogenation typically adds H2 across the double bond, which is a syn addition. So the double bond is in a bridge position. Let me draw the structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-
