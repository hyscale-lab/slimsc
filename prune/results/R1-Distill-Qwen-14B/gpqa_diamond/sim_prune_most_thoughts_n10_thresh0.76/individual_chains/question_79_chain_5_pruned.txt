Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The question is about identifying Compound X, which has the formula C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the resulting product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to figure out what Compound X is.

First, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base, often used in elimination reactions. So, this reaction likely leads to an elimination, forming a double bond. So, if Compound X is treated with a strong base, it probably loses a small molecule like H2O or HX, forming an alkene.

The product's NMR data is given. Let me look at the 1H NMR first.

1H NMR:
δ 2.28 (3H, s) → That's a singlet, so probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't cause splitting. Maybe attached to an electronegative atom or part of a ring.
δ 2.31 (3H, s) → Another singlet, another methyl. Could be a geminal (same carbon) or perhaps two different methyl groups.
Wait, but wait. Two different singlet methyl groups? Like in something like a substituted oxirane? Or maybe they are attached to different carbons.

Then, the aromatic region:
δ 6.75 (1H, d)
7.08 (2H, d)
7.68 (1H, d)
7.71 (2H, d)

Hmm, this looks like a typical pattern for a para-substituted aromatic ring with substituents that create a diad. Alternatively, maybe it's an ortho-substituted situation, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let's think. 1H NMR splitting in aromatic regions can sometimes indicate coupling between protons. So, for example, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, you can have two doublets for the protons adjacent to the substituents. Alternatively, if it's a vinyl group attached to the benzene, like in a styrene, the protons on the double bond would have specific coupling.

Wait, the product's 1H NMR shows multiple doublets. Let's count the protons:

Looking at the signals:
- 1H (d) at 6.75
- 2H (d) at 7.08
- 1H (d) at 7.68
- 2H (d) at 7.71.

Wait, that adds up to 6 protons. But a benzene ring has 6, so perhaps this is a substituted benzene. Let me think about substitution patterns.

In a para-substituted benzene ring, if there are substituents, the protons ortho to those substituents will couple with each other. But wait, maybe it's a vinyl group attached to the benzene, which would lead to a substitution pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the 13C NMR data as well.

13C NMR:
δ 21.3 (1C, s) → Probably a methyl group attached to something.
δ 28.4 (1C, s) → Another methyl, maybe attached to a less electronegative atom.
Then the rest are around 126-144, which is typical for carbons in aromatic or vinyl environments. The 141.5 and 144.1 could be carbonyls or possibly carbons attached to electronegative atoms or double bonds.

Wait, looking at the 13C data, there's a peak at 197.7, which is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group. But wait, wait. 197 is quite high, which is typical for a ketone or an acyl group. Alternatively, could it be an ester? Hmm, but the product is from an elimination reaction, which suggests maybe a ketone isn't formed. Wait, perhaps an epoxide?

Wait, the starting material is compound X, which is C11H12O. So, after reaction, the product's formula would be C11H10O, probably, because elimination would lose two hydrogens (like losing H2O or something else). Wait, but 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, so more likely an E2 elimination, which would lose HX or something. Hmm.

Wait, but the product's formula isn't given. Let me think about the possible structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure would have an oxirane (epoxide) ring connected to a benzene ring with a methyl group in the para position.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So, the oxirane is connected to a propenyl group which is attached to a phenyl.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. The oxirane has a methyl and a styryl group attached.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So, an epoxide with a styryl group (vinyl benzene) attached.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the reaction. The starting material is compound X, which when treated with a strong base (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) would undergo elimination, probably forming a double bond. So, the product is likely an alkene.

But looking at the product's NMR, there's a singlet at δ 197.7 which is a carbon. Wait, 197 is a carbonyl. But if the product is an alkene, that would usually not have a carbonyl. Unless it's a ketone, but that's unexpected with elimination.

Wait, maybe the product isn't the alkene but something else. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction with a base might cause ring-opening. But wait, that might not fit the given product data.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diol, and the base induces elimination to form a double bond, but then what would the product look like?

Wait, but the product's 13C NMR shows a carbon at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So, perhaps the product is a ketone. Hmm. But the starting material is C11H12O. If it's a diol, elimination would form a double bond and lose H2O, so the product would have C10H10O (if the diol was C11H12O?), but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let's think about each option and what their product would be.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure would be an epoxide ring connected to a styryl group (vinyl benzene) where the vinyl is attached to a para-methyl benzene. So, the structure is an epoxide with a substituent from which a double bond can form.

If that's the case, when treated with a strong base, perhaps it would ring-open. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide isn't the starting material but the product. Wait, the product is from the reaction, so if the starting material is an epoxide, perhaps the base does something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction doesn't change it—like maybe it's a different reaction. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the 1H NMR of the product. The aromatic region has four sets of signals. Let's map them.

The aromatic protons:

- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

So, four peaks, adding up to 6H. Hmm, perhaps that's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each with a vinyl group or something.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents that cause two sets of doublets. For example, in a para-dimethyl benzene, but the splitting might be more complex.

Wait, but the 13C NMR shows a carbon at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So, perhaps the product is a ketone, but how does that fit with the reaction?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enone, with a conjugated double bond and a ketone. Because that would have a carbonyl group.

Wait, let's think about the product. If the product has a structure like a benzene ring with a conjugated carbonyl and double bond, that would account for the aromatic and carbonyl signals.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows a carbon at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So, perhaps the product is a cinnamaldehyde or similar, but in this case, the molecular formula would be different.

Wait, the product is from an elimination reaction, so it's likely forming a double bond. So, maybe the product is a styrene derivative with a ketone group, but that seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol ether, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide with a conjugated carbonyl. Wait, but the 1H NMR doesn't show any obvious signs of an epoxide, like the typical two doublets for the oxygen-bearing carbons.

Wait, perhaps the product is a vinyl ketone, which would have a conjugated system.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

- 21.3 (s) → likely a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split the peak (maybe a carbonyl, like a ketone's methyl).
Wait, but 21 is low for a CH3 attached to a carbonyl. Usually, such methyl groups are around 20-30 ppm. Similarly, 28.4 is another methyl, perhaps attached to a carbon that's not as electronegative, like a CH2 or a ring.

Wait, 197.7 is the carbonyl carbon. So, perhaps it's a ketone. So, the structure would be something like a benzene ring connected via a double bond to a carbonyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, like a methyl vinyl ketone attached to benzene? For example, something like (E)-4-methyl-3-phenyl-2-buten-4-one?

But let's think about the options again.

Looking at the options, only option D is 2-styrylepoxide. Wait, but that's an epoxide with a styryl group. But the product's NMR doesn't show an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an elimination from an epoxide. Wait, no. Epoxides are strained and can undergo ring-opening under acidic or basic conditions. But with a strong base, perhaps it's an E2 elimination.

Wait, if the starting material is an epoxide (like option D, 2-styrylepoxide), treatment with a strong base might cause the epoxide to open and form a double bond. But wait, epoxide opening
