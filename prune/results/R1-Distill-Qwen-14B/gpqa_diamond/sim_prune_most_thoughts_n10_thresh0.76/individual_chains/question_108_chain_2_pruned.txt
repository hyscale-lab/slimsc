Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm.

The setup is a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis. The problem says m is small, and B is 1 Tesla. We need to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic term) with the transition energy ΔE. The transition has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. The options are whether ⟨H⟩ is much greater, much less, equal, or just greater than ΔE.

Wait, so first I should probably understand what each term represents. The paramagnetic coupling term is likely the Zeeman term. The Zeeman effect arises when an atom is placed in a magnetic field, causing the energy levels to split. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For electrons, μ is proportional to the magnetic quantum number m, so H would be proportional to m*B.

The transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two energy levels in the hydrogen atom. The wavelength λ is given as 0.4861 μm, which I think is the Balmer series. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So, I can calculate ΔE using this.

Let me jot down the equations I need:

1. For the paramagnetic term: H = μ_B * m * B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. But wait, actually the expectation value ⟨H⟩ for the Zeeman term would be proportional to m. Since m is small, maybe that affects the comparison.

Wait, no. The paramagnetic term is the Hamiltonian itself, so the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be that term. Because for each state, m is fixed, so ⟨H⟩ would be -μ_B * m * B. But wait, maybe it's more precise to say that the energy shift is proportional to m*B. 

But the problem says m is small. Hmm. Let me think: suppose m is small, like m=1 or m=0. Then the paramagnetic term would be small. But we need to compare this with the transition energy ΔE.

Wait, but wait. ΔE is the energy between two levels, like between n=2 and n=1 or something, which is a much larger energy than the Zeeman splitting, right? Because the hydrogen atom's energy levels have transitions on the order of eV, whereas the Zeeman effect is much smaller, in microelectronvolts or something. 

Wait, but I should calculate both terms to compare.

Let me compute ΔE first. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is the Balmer-alpha line, corresponding to a transition from n=2 to n=1. Wait, no, wait. Balmer series is transitions to n=2. So 0.4861 μm is the H-alpha line, which is n=3→n=2. Let me double-check: The H-alpha line is at about 656 nm (0.656 μm), wait no, maybe I got that confused. Oh wait, 0.4861 μm is about 486 nm, which is H-beta. Because H-alpha is longer wavelength (about 656 nm). So H-beta is 486 nm, which is the transition from n=4 to n=2. Hmm, but that's not super important for the calculation.

The energy of the photon is given by E = hc/λ. Let's calculate that. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. λ is 0.4861 μm, which is
