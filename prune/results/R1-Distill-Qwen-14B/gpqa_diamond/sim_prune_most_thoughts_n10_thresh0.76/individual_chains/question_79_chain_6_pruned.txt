Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, undergoes a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, they give the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product. I need to identify what compound X was from the options given.

First, the reaction conditions: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? It's often used in ring-opening reactions, like for epoxides. Wait, no, wait. Or is it more about elimination? Hmm. Oh wait, I think it's a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So maybe it's used for deprotonation to form an enolate, or for elimination reactions, like in the formation of alkenes from epoxides? Or perhaps it's involved in opening epoxides. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh, wait, another possibility: in some cases, 1,4-diazabicyclooctane derivatives are used in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide. Because epoxides can ring-open under basic conditions.

Wait, but the product's NMR data is given. So perhaps the reaction is an epoxide ring-opening, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an elimination. Let me think more about the reaction.

Wait, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclooctane is a bulky, non-nucleophilic base. So reactions where it's used include deprotonation, maybe in elimination reactions. But under what conditions? The solvent is nonpolar, temperature is 403 K (which is about 230°C). So maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide? Or perhaps a different kind of reaction.

Wait, the product's NMR shows some signals. Let's look at the 1H NMR data. The signals are:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s). So two singlets, each integrating to 3H. That suggests two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom or in a symmetric environment.

Next, δ 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So aromatic protons. The doublets suggest coupling with one neighboring proton each.

The 13C NMR data shows:

21.3 (s), 28.4 (s), then several carbons in the aromatic region. 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C). Then two carbons around 141 and 144, which are probably carbonyls or something else. Wait, but the highest is 197.7, which is a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester, but more likely a ketone because it's around 200.

Wait, putting it together. The product has a carbonyl group—so maybe the reaction is leading to a ketone. So perhaps the starting material was an epoxide, and the reaction involved ring-opening followed by some process.

Wait, but the reaction conditions: using a base like 1,4-diazabicyclooctane. If the starting material is an epoxide, perhaps it's undergoing ring-opening under basic conditions. But wait, under basic conditions, epoxides typically open with a nucleophile. But 1,4-diazabicyclooctane itself is a base; maybe it's deprotonating something else, or maybe the solvent is acting as a base.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, like dehydrogenation. Or maybe it's an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but the conditions here are basic.

Wait, another point: the product has a carbonyl group. So if the initial compound had an epoxide, and under basic conditions, maybe it's undergoing a ring-opening to form a carbonyl. Wait, how would that happen?

Wait, when an epoxide is treated with a strong base, it can ring-open to form an alkoxide, which then could eliminate to form a carbonyl group, perhaps via an elimination reaction. So, for instance, if you have a cyclic ether like an epoxide, and it's treated with a strong base, maybe it abstracts a proton, leading to the opening of
