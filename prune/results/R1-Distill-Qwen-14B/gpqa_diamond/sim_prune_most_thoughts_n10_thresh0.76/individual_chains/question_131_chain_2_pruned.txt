Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit challenging, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let me read through the question carefully. So, the problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. This acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR spectra give some clues: the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, with the formula C13H16O3.

The key part is about the NOESY spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. The question is which resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

Alright, let's think about each step.

Step 1: The dicarboxylic acid with cis-alkene dehydrates to form an anhydride. Dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride, which has a cyclic structure with two carbonyl groups. Since the starting material has a cis-alkene, the dehydration would form an anhydride where the two carbonyls are adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, but the anhydride's NMR info says 1H has a single peak at 7 ppm. 7 ppm is usually where aromatic protons appear, but wait, this is an anhydride. Anhydrides typically have carbonyl groups, but maybe there are some protons near those carbonyls. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated system. Or perhaps the anhydride is cyclic and has an exo-methylene group, which could resonate around 6-7 ppm.

Wait, the 13C NMR has peaks at 137 and 165 ppm. 165 is likely a carbonyl carbon (like a ketone or ester or anhydride). 137 ppm is probably a carbon attached to an oxygen, maybe a carbonyl adjacent to a double bond. So perhaps the structure is a cyclic anhydride with a double bond nearby.

Wait, the starting material is a diacid with a cis-alkene. When it dehydrates, the anhydride would form from two -COOH groups losing a water. So the structure would have a structure like O=C-O-C-O=C-O, but with a double bond nearby. Alternatively, maybe it's a bicyclic structure.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the possible structure of the anhydride. Let's say that the diacid is something like HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH, but that doesn't have a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's a straight chain
