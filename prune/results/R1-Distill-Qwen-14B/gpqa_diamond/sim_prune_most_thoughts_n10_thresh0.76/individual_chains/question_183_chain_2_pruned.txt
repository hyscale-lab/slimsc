Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A to D, with numbers 1,3,5,0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency (also called the degree of unsaturation) is a way to determine the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond counts as one, each triple bond as two, etc. So, to find the index, I can use the formula:

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = [2C + 2 - H - X + N]/2

Where C is the number of carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens. Since this molecule probably doesn't have N or X, maybe I can ignore them.

But wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh right, that's the hydroiodination reaction. Red phosphorus and HI is typically used for the hydroboration of alkenes, but wait, no, maybe it's for adding to triple bonds. Or wait, another thought: when an alkyne reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it gets converted into an alkane. Because the triple bond becomes single, adding two molecules of HI. Or wait, another possibility: maybe it's a dihydrohalogenation of an alkyne. Let me think. When you have excess HI and red phosphorus, I think it's for the hydration of alkynes, but no, wait, maybe it's for converting triple bonds into single bonds with two H additions. So, for each triple bond, adding two H and two I, making a single bond.

But wait, the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (cyclohex-3-ene) and a vinyl group (vinylcyclohexane), which is another double bond. Wait, let's look at the structure.

The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the cyclohexene ring has a formyl group (CHO) at position 2, a vinyl group (CH2CH2?) Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So at position 5, it's attached as a substituent on the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, cyclohex-3-ene means there's a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 of the cyclohexane ring. Then, at position 2, a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2=CH-). So the structure has at least two double bonds: the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl substituent.

But wait, wait, maybe I should draw the structure mentally. The cyclohexane ring has a double bond between 3 and 4 (so
