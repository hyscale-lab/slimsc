Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy it provides to a nucleus. The question is asking me to find the energy so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we have to use the theory of relativity equations.

First, let me break down the problem. The nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making it a 6 nucleon nucleus. So the mass number A is 6. So the mass of the nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, but in practice, for these calculations, we usually use the atomic mass unit or convert it into energy using c squared.

Wait, but the nucleus is being accelerated, so we need to find its kinetic energy or its total energy? The question says the energy of the RHIC. I think RHIC accelerators provide kinetic energy, but sometimes people refer to total energy. Wait, no, in particle physics, when they say the energy of the collider, they are usually talking about the kinetic energy per particle. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes it's the total energy. Let me think.

The formula for the total energy of a relativistic particle is gamma times m c squared. The kinetic energy is (gamma -1) times m c squared. So in this problem, which one are we being asked to find? The
