Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which I think means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex effectively. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Hmm, right. I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand like EDTA, the formation constant (Kf) is involved in the dissociation of the complex. The complex should dissociate into the metal ion and the ligand. Since the solution is at ideal pH, we don't have to worry about the protonation state of EDTA; it's already in the form that can bind Ca²+.

So the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M. Let me denote the complex as CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4−. The dissociation reaction would be:

CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4−

Wait, no, actually, wait. EDTA is usually in the form H4Y, and at high pH, it's deprotonated to Y^4-. So the complex is CaY²−, right? Because Ca²+ has a +2 charge, and EDTA is -4, so the complex is (CaY²−) or CaY²−. So the dissociation equation is CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4−. But since Y^4− is the same as the ligand in solution, maybe the situation is that the ligand is in excess? No, wait, in this case, the solution is only the complex, so when it dissociates, it produces Ca²+ and Y^4−. But wait, if the solution only contains the complex, then the initial concentration is 0.02 M of CaY²−, and dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4−. So the concentration of Y^4− would be equal to the concentration of Ca²+ because each dissociation releases one of each.

Wait, but the formation constant Kf is given as 5e10. Formation constant Kf is for the formation of the complex: Ca²+ + Y^4− ⇌ CaY²−. So the Kf expression is Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]).

Since we're dealing with the dissociation of the complex, we can use Kf as the reciprocal of the dissociation constant. Wait, no. The formation constant is for the formation of the complex. The dissociation would have an equilibrium constant Kd, which is 1/Kf. So Kd = [Ca²+][Y^4−]/[CaY²−] = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if I'm applying Kf correctly here. Let me think.

The problem is about the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So the equilibrium expression for the dissociation is:

CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4−

The equilibrium constant for this reaction would be the inverse of the formation constant. So Kd = 1/Kf = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's assume that x is the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. Then, [Ca²+] = x and [Y^4−] = x because each mole of CaY²− that dissociates produces one mole of each. The concentration of CaY²− would then be 0.02 - x. But since Kd is so small (2e-11), x will be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So we can approximate [CaY²−] ≈ 0.02.

Plugging into Kd:

Kd ≈ x^2 / 0.02 = 2e-11.

So x^2 = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.

Taking square root: x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, but 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, so sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5 ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7. Hmm, that's close to option C which is 6.3e-7. That would be the concentration of Ca²+.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The dissociation gives x of Ca²+ and x of Y^4−. So the expression is Kd = x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02 = 2e-11. So x^2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, 2e-6.5 is same as 2 * 1e-6.5. 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 1e-6.5 is sqrt(1e-13), which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7 M. So that's approximately 6.3e-7, which matches option C.

Wait, but wait. Another possible mistake: The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. Yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another approach. Since the complex is 0.02 M, and the Kf is 5e10, the concentration of free Ca²+ would be [Ca²+] = [Y^4−] = x, and [CaY²−] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−}) = 0.02/(x^2) =5e10.

So 0.02/(x^2)=5e10 → x^2=0.02/(5e10) → x^2=4e-13 → x= 2e-6.5 → same as before, 6.3e-7. So that's correct.

So the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻), we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{Y}^{4-} \) at equilibrium. Since the dissociation produces equal amounts of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{Y}^{4-} \), their concentrations are both \( x \). The concentration of the complex \( \text{CaY}^{2-} \) is approximately \( 0.02 - x \), but because \( K_d \) is very small, \( x \) is negligible compared to 0.02. Thus, \( [\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \).

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

\[
x = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
