Okay, so I have this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) times the commutator of gamma matrices, [γ_mu, γ_nu]. I remember that σ matrices are related to the generators of Lorentz transformations or something like that, but maybe not too important right now.

The question is asking about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. The options are A to D, each with a dimension and a yes/no for renormalizable.

Wait, I remember that in quantum field theory, the renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constants. The idea is that if the coupling has a positive mass dimension, the theory is renormalizable. Because the dimension tells us about the scaling behavior, which affects whether the interactions are relevant or irrelevant in the RG sense.

So first, I need to find the mass dimension of each field in the Lagrangian, then the dimension of the coupling κ.

Let me recall the mass dimensions for the fields. In four dimensions, the scalar field φ has dimension 1. For fermions, like ψ, the dimension is 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is first order in derivatives, so the action is integral of L, which must have dimension 4. So L is [mass]^4. If the field term is ψ̄ i gamma^mu D_mu ψ, each ψ has dimension 3/2, and D_mu includes derivatives (dimension 1) and gauge fields (dimension 1 for gauge boson fields).

Wait, but here the Lagrangian is L_int, which is an interaction term. So I should think about each term in the Lagrangian. The whole Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because when you integrate it over four-dimensional spacetime, the action is dimensionless (in units where ħ=1, c=1, but dimensions are about mass).

So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

The given term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let's break down each part:

- ψ̄ is the Dirac adjoint of ψ. So [ψ̄] = [ψ] = 3/2.

- σ_{μν} is built from [γ_mu, γ_nu], which are dimensionless (gamma matrices are just matrices, their dimensions are zero). So σ_{μν} has dimension 0.

- F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. F is like ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ + ... Well, for electromagnetism, A has dimension 1. So each derivative ∂μ has dimension 1, so F has dimension [∂ A] = 1 + 1 = 2. Wait, no. Let me think again. For a gauge field A_mu, which is a vector potential, its dimension in four
