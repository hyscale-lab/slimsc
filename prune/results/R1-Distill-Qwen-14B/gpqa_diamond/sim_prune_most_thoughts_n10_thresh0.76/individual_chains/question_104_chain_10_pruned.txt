Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull.

So, the setup is that there are two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations.

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method relates the Doppler shift to the velocity of the star. Because the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum speed the star moves towards or away from us. So K is proportional to the Doppler shift divided by the wavelength, right? But I'm not sure about the exact formula.

I remember that the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is given by the formula K = (v) where v is the star's velocity. But how does that relate to the orbital period?

Oh, right, the RV method gives us the mass of the planet (well, actually, the minimum mass since we don't know the inclination) and the period of the orbit. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is something like K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression.

Wait, let me think about the formula for the RV semi-amplitude. The formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (2π P) )^(1/3) ) ), but since both planets have circular orbits, e=0, so that term is 1. Also, since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, which is the same for both stars because they have the same mass as the Sun.

So, simplifying, K is proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), because G is a constant, and M_star is the same for both.

Wait, no. Let me get the exact formula for K. The formula is:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (2π) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so:

K ≈ [ (G * M_p) / M_star ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2π))^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But in this case, both planets have the same mass, M_p is same for both. So, K is inversely proportional to (P^(1/3)).

Wait, so K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K1 is the velocity semi-amplitude for planet 1, and K2 for planet 2, then:

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) )

Alternatively, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio.
