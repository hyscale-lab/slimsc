Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

So, the scenario is about a study on white lupine plants looking for genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knockout mutants for each and also some double mutants. The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, I'm thinking that a transcription factor usually activates other genes, maybe as part of a signaling pathway.

The experiment tested how resistant these mutants are compared to the wild-type. The resistance levels are given as percentages of the control (wild-type), which is 100%. The data is:

- g1: 75% resistance
- g2: 0% resistance
- g3: 50% resistance
- g1g3: 10% resistance
- g2g3: 0% resistance
- g1g2: 0% resistance

The question is about figuring out the interactions between these genes. The options given are A to D, each suggesting different relationships like transcription factors, pleiotropy, gene redundancy, and epistasis.

Hmm. I remember that in genetics, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. If gene A is epistatic over gene B, then the phenotype of B depends on A. So, if a double mutant in A and B shows the same phenotype as a single mutant in A, it suggests that A is epistatic to B. Because in that case, even when B is non-functional, the phenotype is determined by A.

Alternatively, if the double mutant has a more severe phenotype than either single, that might suggest both contribute to the same pathway but aren't redundant.

So looking at the data: 

g2 alone has 0% resistance, which is the same as the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3. That suggests that when g2 is knocked out, the resistance is completely lost. But what about the other genes?

g1 has 75% resistance. So the plant is still somewhat resistant when only g1 is knocked out. g3 has 50% resistance. 

Now looking at the double mutants:

- g1g3: 10% resistance. That's less than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So combining the two single mutants makes the resistance even worse. That might suggest that G1 and G3 are working in the same pathway, but their combined loss has a more severe effect than each alone.

Wait, but how does this tie into the concept of gene redundancy? If two genes are redundant, meaning they can compensate for each other, then knocking out both would have a more severe effect than either alone. Because each can do the job, but together they can't. So in that case, the double mutant would have a more severe phenotype than either single.

So G1 and G3 might be redundant. Let me think about that. If G1 is knocked out, the plant is still 75% resistant. If G3 is knocked out, 50% resistance. But when both are knocked out, it's 10% which is worse than either alone. That suggests they are part of the same pathway, possibly redundant. Because when you lose both, the pathway is more severely affected.

But wait, let's think about the other double mutants. For g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance goes down to 0%. Which is the same as when g2 alone is knocked out. So this suggests that when g2 is non-functional, whether or not the other gene is working doesn't matter. So the resistance is all gone.

So what does that mean about g2? Since the presence of g2's knockout masks the effect of the other gene, it's likely that g
