Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

Alright, the setup is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is transiting its star, which has a radius 1.5 times the Sun. The orbital period of this planet is 3 days. Now, the question is about the maximum orbital period a second planet can have such that it also exhibits both transit and occultation events. The second planet is 2.5 Earth radii in size.

Wait, so both transit and occultation events—what does that mean? Oh right, a transit occurs when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet's light is blocked, causing a slight increase in brightness (since we lose the planet's light). So for both events to happen, the planet's orbital plane must be aligned so that when it's in front, we see the transit, and when it's behind, we see the occultation. That probably means the two planets are in the same orbital plane, so their orbits are aligned edge-on relative to us.

The problem says the second planet shares the same orbital plane, so it's also edge-on. So now we need to find the maximum period it can have and still have both events.

Hmm. What factors determine whether a planet transits or occults? For a transit, the planet must pass directly in front of the star, which depends on the orbital inclination. But since both planets are in the same plane, they both transit. Wait, no, wait. Only the first planet is mentioned to have a transit. Wait, the question says that the second planet must also exhibit both transit and occultation events. So for the second planet, we need it to transit (so it's in front of the star) and also to be eclipsed by the star (so when it's behind, it's occulted, but wait, no—occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so from our view, the planet's light is blocked. So the star would block the planet. So for that to happen, the planet must also pass behind the star, meaning its orbit is aligned in such a way. So both events require that the planet's orbit is edge-on, which they already have because they share the same orbital plane as the first planet.

Wait, but that's a given. So the question is about the orbital period of the second planet. So what's the limit on the period so that we can observe both events?

I remember that for a planet to transit, its orbital plane must be edge-on. So if the second planet is in the same plane, that's already met. So the transit is possible. But for the occultation, the planet must pass behind the star. So the planet's orbit must be such that, from our perspective, it sometimes goes behind the star. So the time between transits and occultations depends on the relative orbital periods.

Wait, but the star is much larger than the planet. So how does the occultation event happen? Oh, when the planet is on the other side of the star from us, so we can't see its reflected light or its own light
