Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again. Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at relativistic speeds, 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is about finding the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. There's the relativistic velocity addition formula to consider. Right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, wait, but wait—u and v are the speeds of the two objects as seen from the same frame. But here, both are moving in the same direction.

Wait, so the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. But if I want to find the relative speed of one from the other's frame, which one is which? Oh, right. Let me clarify: The relative speed of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame. Or is it the other way around? Or does it even matter because they're moving in the same direction?

Wait, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) but that's negative, which doesn't make sense since speed can't be negative. Oh, right, because in relativity, the formula isn't just subtraction. So I should apply the velocity addition formula properly.

Wait, let me think. The formula is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, no, that's when you switch frames. If frame S has an object moving at speed u, and frame S' is moving at speed v relative to S, then the speed in S' is u' as given by the formula.

But in this case, astronaut 1 is in frame S, and astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c in S. So the relative speed of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame is (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait
