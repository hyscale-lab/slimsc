Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which particle isn't associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. Hmm, the options are phonon, skyrmion, magnon, and pion. I remember that when a symmetry is spontaneously broken, it leads to the appearance of new particles, called Goldstone bosons. Right, Goldstone's theorem says that for every broken continuous symmetry, there's a corresponding massless boson. But wait, in many cases, these bosons might not be exactly massless due to other effects, but that's the basic idea.

Let me think about each option. 

Phonon: Phonons are the quantized vibrations in a crystal lattice. They arise from the vibrations of atoms in a crystal structure. I think they come from the breaking of translational symmetry in the crystal. When a crystal forms, the translational symmetry of the liquid or gas phase is broken. So the phonon is a Goldstone boson here. So phonon is associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. So it's not the answer we're looking for.

Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological defects in certain materials, like neutron stars or some magnetic systems. They're solutions to the equations of motion in a theory with pionic fields. Wait, I think they arise due to the breaking of certain symmetries, maybe chiral symmetry in the context of nuclear physics. Skyrmions are associated with broken symmetries, so they are linked to a spontaneously broken symmetry. So this isn't the correct answer either.

Magnon: Magnons are the quasiparticles representing spin waves in a magnetically ordered material. So when a material has a magnetic ordering (like ferromagnetism), the continuous symmetry of the spin space is broken. The magnon arises as the Goldstone boson for this broken symmetry. So magnon is connected to a spontaneously broken symmetry. So not the answer.

Pion: Pions are the lightest hadrons and are mesons composed of up and down quarks. I remember that pions arise from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics). Chiral symmetry is broken at low energies, leading to the appearance of pions as the Goldstone bosons. But wait, in reality, pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons because the symmetry is approximate and the pions have a small mass. So pions are associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry too. So why is pion an option here?

Wait, wait, the question is which particle is NOT associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. So all of A, B, C, D are linked to broken symmetries except one. Did I miss something?

Wait, let's think again.

Phonon: Broken translational symmetry in solids.

Magnon: Broken spin rotational symmetry in magnetic systems.

Skyrmion: Arises from broken symmetry, perhaps in the context of chiral symmetry or another.

Pion: Broken chiral symmetry in QCD.

So all are linked to broken symmetries. Hmm, but that can't be right because the question states that one is not.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think about each particle again.

Pion is a Goldstone boson of chiral symmetry breaking. So yes, associated.

Magnon: When a magnet orders, the continuous symmetry (like O(3
