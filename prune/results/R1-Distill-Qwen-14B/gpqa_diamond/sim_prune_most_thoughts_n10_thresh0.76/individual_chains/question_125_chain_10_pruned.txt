Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that the potential is V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². So this is like a 3D version of the simple harmonic oscillator, right?

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that same energy. I think I need to figure out the energy levels and then the degeneracy for each level.

Wait, in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. I recall that the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers. Oh right, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total quantum number. But wait, no, I think it's more accurate to say that the energy levels are E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are the quantum numbers for each direction. But since it's isotropic, these can be treated as three separate 1D oscillators in x, y, z.

Alternatively, the energy can be written in terms of the principal quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z
