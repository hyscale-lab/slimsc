Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, it's about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So, Y is some element that forms multiple compounds with F.

The problem mentions several substances: A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. They're all binary compounds of F and Y, I think. Let's break down the clues one by one.

First clue: A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. So the reaction might be something like A1 â†’ A2 + F2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so if A1 is oxidizing it, maybe A1 is a strong oxidizing agent.

Wait, what compounds of fluorine are bright red? I remember that some fluorides are colored. Like, I think AgF is white, but maybe something else. Oh wait, maybe it's not a metal fluoride. Fluorine is F, so the compound would be YF_n. Oh, wait, could Y be chlorine? No, because Cl doesn't form binary compounds with F. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is oxygen? No, because O and F form O-F bonds but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a halogen. Let me think about the decomposition. If A1 decomposes into A2 and F2, maybe A1 is a diatomic molecule that breaks down. Or perhaps it's a higher
