Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that modifies the Standard Model with higher-dimensional operators, but the question is about which symmetries these operators must respect.

The question gives four options: Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The options are combinations of these. I need to figure out which of these symmetries are necessary for all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, what do I know about these symmetries? Lorentz symmetry is a big one. Effective theories like SMEFT should respect the same symmetries as the theories they're effective from, right? The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT must too. So operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. That means at least option 1 is correct.

What about Poincare symmetry? Hmm, I think Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh wait, Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz transformations and translations. But in an effective theory, the operators can have higher-dimensional terms. Do these terms necessarily respect Poincare symmetry?

Wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because if the operators aren't Lorentz-invariant, the theory wouldn't make sense. But do they have to respect Poincare? I'm a bit confused. Because Poincare is more about the full spacetime symmetry, including translations. But for effective operators, like dimension six or higher, do they have to be Poincare-invariant? Or can they violate it somehow?

Wait, I think all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant. Because the SMEFT is constructed to maintain the same symmetries as the Standard Model, which includes Lorentz invariance. So for the theory to make sense, the operators must be Lorentz scalars. But Poincare symmetry is more about the overall spacetime symmetry. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, it would also respect Poincare symmetry because any Poincare symmetry implies Lorentz and translation symmetry. But wait, translation symmetry isn't really an issue in the terms themselves; the effective operators are just a way to parameterize beyond the SM effects, but the terms themselves are local, so they should respect
