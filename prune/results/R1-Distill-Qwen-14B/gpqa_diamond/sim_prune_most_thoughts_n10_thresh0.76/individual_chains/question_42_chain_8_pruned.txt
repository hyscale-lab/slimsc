Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem involves three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not too sure about that; maybe I don't need to know the specifics right now.

The given data points are:
- Ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4.
- Temperature ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3, so T2/T3 = 2.3.
- Mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.15, so M1/M2 = 1.15.
- Mass ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 1.35, so M2/M3 = 1.35.
- Albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth.

The question is asking by what factor Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's. So, I need to find P3/P1.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. Right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since all three planets have the same albedo (a=0.3), the luminosity (L) of the host star is the same for all, so the temperature ratio depends on the square root of the inverse of the distance ratio.

So, T ∝ D^(-1/2). Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Because T1 is the temperature of Planet1 and T2 is that of Planet2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The formula is T = [L(1-a)/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4), which can be rewritten as T ∝ sqrt(1/D²)^(1/4) → T ∝ 1/D^(1/2). So, T is inversely proportional to the square root of D.

So, for any two planets, T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(D).

So, given T1/T2 = 1.4, that would mean sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4 → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 is about 1.96 times D1. So, Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1.

Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3. So sqrt(D3/D2) = 2.3 → D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. So, D3 is about 5.29 times D2.

Wait, let me double-check that. T2 is the equilibrium temperature of Planet2, which is hotter than Planet3? Because T2 is higher than T3, that means Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet3, right? Because if you're closer, you're hotter.

Wait no, wait. Since T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D), if Planet2 is hotter (T2 > T3), then D2 < D3. So yes, D3 is larger than D2. So D3 = 5.29 * D2.

But earlier, D2 = 1.96 * D1. So D3 = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1.

Let me compute that: 5.29 * 1.96. Let's see, 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29*1.96 is about 0.5684. So total is approximately 10.3684. So D3 ≈ 10.37 * D1.

So the distance of Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.

Now, the orbital period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law. The formula is P² ∝ D³ / M, where M is the mass of the star, assuming M >> planet masses.

Wait, but wait, in the problem, the masses given are the planet masses. But Kepler's third law for planets around a star is usually written as P² = (4π²/G(M)) * D³, where M is the mass of the central star. But in this scenario, the planets are orbiting the same star, so their periods depend on their distances and the star's mass.

But wait, if the star's mass is the same for all three
