Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle and an electron's energy. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question says that an electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed of 2*10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. The options are from around 10^-18 J up to 10^-16 J.

Wait, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainties in position and momentum. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh right, and since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I'll take the equality as Δx * Δp = ħ/2. 

So first, I should find Δp. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So Δp would be ħ/(2Δx). Let me write that out: Δp = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 0.1e-9). Wait, 0.1 nm is 0.1e-9 meters. 

Calculating the denominator: 2 * 0.1e-9 = 0.2e-9 meters. So Δp = (1.05e-34) / (0.2e-9) = (1.05 / 0.2) * 1e-25. Oh, 1.05 / 0.2 is 5.25, so Δp ≈ 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, I need to relate momentum to energy. The kinetic energy of an electron is given by KE = p²/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So I can write ΔE as approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). Let me plug in the values.

Mass of the electron is about 9.109e-31 kg. So ΔE = (5.25e-25)^2 / (2 * 9.109e-31). Let's compute the numerator first: (5.25e-25)^2. 5.25 squared is about 27.56. So 27.56e-50. Wait, actually, 5.25e-25 squared is (5.25)^2 * (1e-25)^2 = 27.56 * 1e-50 = 2.756e-49.

Then the denominator is 2*9.109e-31 ≈ 1.8218e-30. So ΔE ≈ (2.756e-49) / (1.8218e-30) = (2.756 / 1.8218) * 1e-19. Let me calculate 2.756 / 1.8218. Well, 1.8218 * 1.5 is about 2.7327, which is close to 2.756. So approximately 1.505. So ΔE ≈ 1.505e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option C is ~10^-19 J. So that's the closest. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with exponents.

Wait, the denominator is 1.8218e-30, and the numerator is 2.756e-49. So 2.756e-49 divided by 1.8218e-30 equals (2.756 / 1.8218) * 1e-19. Yes, that's correct. So yeah, about 1.5e-19 J, which is 1.5 *10^-19 J. So the minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 10^-19 J, so option C.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) as:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m and the reduced Planck's constant ħ ≈ 1.0545718 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s, the minimum uncertainty in momentum is:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \cdot 0.1 \times 10^{-9}} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{0.2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Next, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is related to the uncertainty in momentum by the kinetic energy formula:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m},
\]

where \( m \) is the mass of the electron, approximately \( 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \). Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(5.272859 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \cdot 9.109 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(5.272859 \times 10^{-25})^2 = (5.272859)^2 \cdot (10^{-25})^2 = 27.8 \times 10^{-50} = 2.78 \times 10^{-49}.
\]

Then, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 \cdot 9.109 \times 10^{-31} = 1.8218 \times 10^{-30}.
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{2.78 \times 10^{-49}}{1.8218 \times 10^{-30}} = \frac{2.78}{1.8218} \cdot 10^{-19} \approx 1.525 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Thus, the minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately \( 1.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option C.
