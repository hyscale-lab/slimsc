Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The problem is asking about the minimum resolution needed in the detector to observe at least 30% of these decays. The setup also mentions that the energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I remember that when particles decay, the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime due to time dilation. So the formula I think I need is τ = γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. γ is given by the total energy divided by the rest mass energy, right? So γ = E / (m c²). Since E and m are given in GeV, and c is a constant, but the units should work out because they're both in energy units.

Let me calculate γ first. The energy is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3 is 9, so 3.41 is a bit more than 3. So 27/3.41 is approximately 7.91. Let's say about 7.91. But I should get a more precise number. Let me do the division properly: 27 ÷ 3.41.

3.41 × 7 is 23.87. 27 - 23.87 = 3.13. Now, 3.13 ÷ 3.41 is about 0.918. So total γ is 7.918. Approximately 7.92, maybe 7.918.

So γ is 7.918. Therefore, the lifetime in the lab frame τ is γ τ₀. So τ = 7.918 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that. 7.918 * 8 is 63.344, so τ is 63.344e-16 seconds. Or 6.3344e-15 s.

Now, the next part is about the minimum resolution needed. I think this refers to the detector's ability to measure the position where the decay occurs. The decay products will travel some distance before being detected, so the detector's spatial resolution must be good enough to distinguish the decay point from the point where the X⁰ was created.

Wait, but how does that directly relate to the lifetime? Oh right, because of time dilation, the particles (Y⁺ and Z⁻) will travel some distance before decaying, but wait, no, in this case, X⁰ is the one decaying. So the decay products are Y and Z. Wait, but X⁰ is the one moving, so the decay occurs while it's moving, and the decay products also move in the same direction, but that's a separate consideration. But in terms of the track, the X⁰ is moving, and the decay products fly off in some direction.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So the idea is that the decay products' paths must be sufficiently close so that the detector can see the vertex where the decay happened.

The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of X⁰. But from the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so the decay products will have moved further. So the length over which the decay can happen is the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, since the particle is moving at relativistic speeds, we can approximate the speed as the speed of light (since γ is around 8, so v ≈ c).

So the length L is c * τ, but wait, no, that's in the lab frame. Because in the lab frame, X⁰ is moving, so the decay products will have time to travel a considerable distance before they decay, but wait, no, the decay happens in a very short time, but if the lifetime is longer, the decay products can move further.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the length over which X⁰ can decay before leaving the detector volume. But wait, the question is about the detector's resolution. So the detector must be able to resolve the decay point so that we can see that the decay happened, rather than being confused with other interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the decay length. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. So the decay length is L = c * τ * β, where β is v/c. But wait, since X⁰ is moving at a speed close to c, β ≈ 1, and γ is large, but τ is already in the lab frame.

Wait, no, τ is the dilated lifetime. So the lifetime in the lab is τ = γ τ₀. So the average distance the X⁰ travels before decaying is L = c * τ.

Wait, but X⁰ is being tracked, so the decay products are emitted in all directions, but the primary track would show a kink or a vertex where the decay occurs. The detector's resolution must be able to pinpoint the decay location with sufficient accuracy so that at least 30% of the decays are observed with a resolution better than some minimum.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the proper decay length. Or maybe it's the mean decay length, and the detector's resolution must be better than a certain fraction of that.

Hmm, another approach: the number of decays observed depends on the detector's ability to resolve the decay vertex. If the decay length is too large compared to the detector's resolution, the track from the parent particle would be longer, but the actual decay point is spread out, making it harder to observe. But wait, no, if the detector can't resolve the decay point accurately, it might not be able to pinpoint that the decay occurred, leading to a lower detection efficiency.

Wait, but the question is phrased as needing a minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps we're to calculate the minimum track length (or something else) so that the detector can capture the decay point in at least 30% of cases.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this from the wrong angle. Let's think about the decay path. The X⁰ has a certain lifetime, so in the lab frame, the average lifetime is longer, so the decay can happen after it's traveled a certain distance. If the detector's resolution is too poor, it might not be able to see the exact point where the decay occurred, leading to the decay products' tracks appearing to come from the original point, not the decay vertex. So the resolution needed is such that the decay's position can be determined with a precision that allows at least 30% of the decays to be observed.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution refers to the time resolution needed to measure the decay
