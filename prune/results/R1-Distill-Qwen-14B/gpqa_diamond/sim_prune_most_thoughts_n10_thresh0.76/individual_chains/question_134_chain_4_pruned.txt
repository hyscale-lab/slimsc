Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that we have three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. We're supposed to find the enthalpy when these are mixed. The options are given in kcal and kJ, so I need to calculate which one it is.

Wait, neutralization reactions usually involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. So I should figure out how much acid and base there is and see which is in excess.

First, let's break down each solution. I think I need to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base.

Starting with HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. So moles of HCl = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. So that's 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid and it's diprotic, meaning each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So for each mole of H2SO4, we get 2 moles H+. The volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M. So moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Therefore, H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from the acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base, Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions because it's Ba(OH)2. The volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but when acids and bases react, the H+ and OH- combine in a 1:1 ratio. So I need to see which is in excess. Let's compare the moles of H+ and OH-.

Total H+ is 0.28 moles. Total OH- is 0.2 moles. So OH- is less. That means all the OH- will react, and some H+ will be left over. So the reaction will proceed until the OH- is all used up.

So the limiting reagent here is the OH-.

The reaction between H+ and OH- is: H+ + OH- → H2O, and the enthalpy change for this is typically around -57.3 kJ per mole (since that's the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases). Wait, but I heard sometimes it's expressed per mole of H+ or per mole of OH-.

Wait, each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH- to make water, releasing 57.3 kJ. So for each mole, that's the heat released.

So since we have 0.2 moles of OH-, the reaction will produce 0.2 moles of H2O, releasing 0.2 * 57.3 kJ.

Wait, but wait. Do I have enough H+? Because the H+ is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So yes, the OH- is the limiting factor.

So the total enthalpy change would be - (0.2 * 57.3) kJ. Because it's exothermic, so negative.

0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ. But wait, looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Oh wait, no, because the options have different units. Wait, option B is in kcal, and option D is in kJ.

Wait, wait, the options are: A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

So my calculation is in kJ. So 0.2 *57.3 is 11.46 kJ, but that's the magnitude. Since the reaction is exothermic, the enthalpy change is negative, so -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. That's not matching. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the moles correctly. Let me recheck.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 M
