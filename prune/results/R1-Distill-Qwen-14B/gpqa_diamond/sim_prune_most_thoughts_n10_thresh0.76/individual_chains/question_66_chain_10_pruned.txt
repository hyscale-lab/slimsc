Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT, and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations, so I need to figure out which ones are required.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, so it's built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model. These operators have to maintain certain symmetries. What are those symmetries?

I think about Lorentz symmetry. In the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so I guess the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry as well. Otherwise, you'd be adding terms that don't fit the framework. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But in effective field theories, you can have operators that break translation symmetry because they're non-renormalizable. Wait, but waitâ€”SMEFT is formulated in a way that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry. So do the SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare? Or maybe not, because the effective theory includes higher-dimension terms which might not respect all the same symmetries? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, I think SMEFT is usually constructed to respect the same gauge symmetries as the Standard Model, but what about Poincare? I believe that in SMEFT, the operators are constructed in a way that respects gauge invariance and Lorentz symmetry. But Poincare symmetry includes not just Lorentz but also translation. Do the SMEFT operators respect translation symmetry? Hmm. Maybe. Because the operators are built from the SM fields, which are Poincare invariant, so perhaps the operators do respect Poincare symmetry. But I'm not entirely sure here.

Then there's CP symmetry. The Standard Model has CP violation in the CKM matrix, but the operators in SMEFT can include terms that violate CP. For example, the Weinberg operator is CP-conserving, but I think there are operators that are not. So, if some operators in SME
