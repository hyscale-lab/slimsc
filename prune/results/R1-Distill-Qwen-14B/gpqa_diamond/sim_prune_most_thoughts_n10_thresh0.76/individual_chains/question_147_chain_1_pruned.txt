Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about finding the velocity of particle A when a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other. The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The mass of A is given as 300 MeV/c². The antiproton is moving slowly, so I guess its velocity is much less than the speed of light. Hmm, or wait, maybe not. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, but it's the antiproton, so perhaps it's just moving at a non-relativistic speed. Or does it mean that the system is such that the velocities are manageable with some approximation?

Wait, the initial setup: proton and antiproton collide. Normally, in annihilation, particles and antiparticles annihilate into other particles, often like pions, but here it's producing these A particles. So the products are two A+ and two A-.

I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are all in terms of c, so we're definitely dealing with relativistic speeds here.

So, considering conservation laws. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum can be treated in a certain way. Wait, the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe its speed is much less than c, meaning that relativistic effects for its momentum aren't too significant.
