Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. It radiates at a wavelength λ. They're asking about the radiated power per unit solid angle, which depends on a function f of λ and θ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees. Also, we have to pick the correct form of the function f from the options given.

Wait, so I remember that when a charge distribution oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the source. Since it's spheroidal and symmetric along z, maybe the radiation has a particular angular dependence.

I think dipole radiation comes into play here. For a dipole, the radiation pattern is not isotropic. The power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle. The formula for the radiated power per unit solid angle (like the intensity) for a dipole is something like proportional to sin²θ or something similar. Wait, no, wait. For a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field (which is the radiation zone) is given by the dipole radiation formula. The intensity or power per unit solid angle is proportional to (sinθ)^2, if I remember correctly. So that would mean that at θ=90 degrees, the power is maximum, and at θ=0 or 180, it's zero. But wait, wait, no, that's the radiation from a dipole. Because a dipole's radiation is in the transverse direction. So yes, maximum at θ=90.

But wait, the question says the maximum power is A. So if the function f has a maximum at θ=90, then what is the value at θ=30?

Wait, but the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So the total power A is the integral of f over all solid angles. Or wait, no, A is the maximum power, so perhaps f has a maximum at some angle, and the question is asking what fraction of A is at θ=30.

So if the function f is such that the
