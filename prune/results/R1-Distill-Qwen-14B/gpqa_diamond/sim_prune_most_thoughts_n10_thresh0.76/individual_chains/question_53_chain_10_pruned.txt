Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to understand what's being asked.

The question says that someone prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, that means the aromatic ring has two substituents attached to it. The FTIR spectrum shows ester group absorption peaks. Ester groups have specific peaks, like the carbonyl (C=O) which is usually around 1740 cm⁻¹. So that's a big clue about the functional group present.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let me break that down. The signals are categorized as two aromatic-H signals, two vinyl-H signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two –CH3 groups. Also, no –CH2 groups are present. So, the molecule must have methyl groups but no methylene groups. Hmm.

Let me think about the structure. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents could be in any positions—ortho, meta, or para. But the NMR data might give clues about their positions.

The presence of an ester group suggests that one substituent is an ester. Esters have the structure R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, more accurately, it's RCOOR'. So, in the aromatic ring, one substituent is an ester group, like OCOOR or something similar.

Wait, but the other substituent? Let me think. The NMR has two –CH3 signals. So, maybe the other substituent is a methyl group attached to something else. Or perhaps there are two methyl groups from the ester? Wait, no, an ester group has one R group (like CH3) and another R' (like another CH3 or maybe a larger group). Hmm.

Wait, the ester group's structure is RCOOR', where R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups. So, if the substituent on the benzene is an ester, it's probably something like –OOCR, where R is an alkyl group. Alternatively, sometimes esters are directly attached as –COOR.

Wait, another possibility: maybe one substituent is an ester group (like –COOR) and the other is a methyl group attached directly to the ring. But wait, the NMR shows two –CH3 signals. So perhaps the ester has two methyl groups? Or maybe the ring has two substituents each with a methyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group. Wait, the NMR also shows vinyl-H signals. So, maybe one substituent is an ester group and the other is a vinyl group (like a CH2=CH– group attached to the ring). But that would mean a substituent like –CH2CH2COO–, but maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, the vinyl protons are split into a doublet and a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically deshielded and appear as doublets if they are part of a substituent like –CH2CH2– or –CH=CH–. Wait, if there's a substituent like
