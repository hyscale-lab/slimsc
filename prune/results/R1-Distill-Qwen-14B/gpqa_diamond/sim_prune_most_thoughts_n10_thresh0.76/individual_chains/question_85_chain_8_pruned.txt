Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about determining the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets orbiting a star. Both planets are detected using transit and radial velocity methods. 

First, let me note down the given data:

Star:
- Mass (M_s) = 1.5 * M_sun
- Radius (R_s) = 1.2 * R_sun
- Effective Temperature (Teff) = 6300 K

Planet1:
- Mass (M1) = 7 Earth masses
- Radius (R1) = 1.7 Earth radii

Planet2:
- Mass (M2) = 5 Earth masses
- Radius (R2) = 1.3 Earth radii

They both have the same albedo, which is important because albedo affects the planet's reflectivity and thus its equilibrium temperature. 

The information about the Doppler shift is given, but I'm not sure how that factors into the equilibrium temperature. Wait, equilibrium temperature usually depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh, but the Doppler shift might relate to the planet's orbital period or velocity, which in turn relates to their distance from the star.

Wait, the Doppler shift data might help us find the planets' orbital distances. The RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. But since both planets are causing shifts, perhaps we can find the ratio of their velocities or something else that relates to their orbital radii.

Alternatively, wait, the transit method gives the radius of the planet relative to the star's radius, but since we have the star's radius, we can get the orbital distance if we know the period. Hmm, but we don't directly have the periods. Alternatively, maybe the Doppler shift measurements can give us the velocity, which when combined with the star's mass can give the orbital radius.

I remember that the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( ( (1 + M_p/M_s) )^(2/3) )) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²))) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the equation simplifies.

Wait, but perhaps a simpler approach is to recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_s^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_s)^(1/3)) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ), but since e=0, and M_p << M_s (since M_s is 1.5 solar masses, and M_p is 5-7 Earth masses; Earth's mass is about 3e-6 solar masses, so M_p are negligible compared to M_s), we can approximate
