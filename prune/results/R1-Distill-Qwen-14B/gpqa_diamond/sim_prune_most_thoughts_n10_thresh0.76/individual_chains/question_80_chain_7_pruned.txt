Okay, so I've come across this question where I need to figure out the value of the DNA sequence ACAGTGACC based on the given examples. Let's try to break it down step by step.

First, the question provides two examples: AGG gives 115 and TGCTGA gives 176. My task is to find out what the algorithm does to the input sequences to produce these numbers. Once I understand the pattern, I can apply it to the new sequence.

Let me write down the given examples:

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

Hmm, maybe each nucleotide is converted into a number, and then summed or something. Let me think about the possible ways to convert A, T, C, G into numbers.

The four nucleotides are A, T, C, G. One common way is to assign each a number: A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Alternatively, sometimes they use 0-based indexing, like A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3. But let's see which fits.

Let's take the first example: AGG.

If I assign A=1, G=4, another G=4. So the numbers would be 1,4,4. Now, summing them: 1+4+4=9. But the output is 115, which is way higher than 9. So that doesn't fit. Maybe multiplication instead?

Wait, maybe each base contributes its position in the sequence multiplied by some value. Or perhaps each base corresponds to a digit in a different base?

Another idea: Maybe each base is converted to a number, and then the entire sequence is treated as a base-10 number. Let's see.

For AGG: A=1, G=4, G=4. So the number would be 144. But 144 is much larger than 115. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps each base is converted to a single digit and then the entire sequence is read as a base-10 number, but that seems unlikely because the examples are much smaller.

Wait, maybe it's the sum of each base's numerical value multiplied by its position. Let me check that.

Take AGG:

Positions are 1,2,3.

A is 1, position 1: 1 *1 =1
G is 4, position 2:4*2=8
G is4, position 3:4*3=12
Sum: 1+8+12=21. Not 115.

Hmm, not matching. Maybe the position is zero-based? Let's try.

Positions 0,1
