Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. It's about nuclear fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. Hmm, I remember that in nuclear reactions, mass can be converted into energy according to Einstein's equation E=mc². But wait, the problem involves both relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) approximations. That's a bit tricky.

The problem states that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest-masses. Also, the sum of their rest-masses is 99% of M. Oh, so the initial nucleus has a rest mass M, which is 300 GeV/c², but the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99M. That must mean some mass is lost, converted into kinetic energy, right?

Let me break it down. Let's denote the two fragments as m1 and m2. Given that m1 is twice m2. So m1 = 2 m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. So substituting, 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = 0.33 M and m1 = 0.66 M. Wait no, wait. 0.99 M is the sum of the two fragments' rest masses. So m1 = 2 m2, so m1 = 2m2. m1 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M. So each is 33% and 66% of M? Or wait, 0.33 M plus 0.66 M is 0.99 M, correct.

But M is the initial mass, which is 300 GeV/c². So the initial rest energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the rest energies of the fragments are m1 c² and m2 c², which are 0.66 * 300 GeV and 0.33 * 300 GeV. So 198 GeV and 99 GeV respectively. So the total rest energy after is 198 + 99 = 297 GeV. The initial was 300 GeV, so the mass difference is 3 GeV. So that energy must have gone into kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait. The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero since momentum is conserved. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momentum. So their kinetic energies can be calculated using relativistic equations because the velocities might be significant fractions of the speed of light.

But the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 (the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) and the value calculated using the classical approximation.

So first, I think I need to calculate T1 correctly using relativistic mechanics, then calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approach, and then find the difference between the two.

Wait, but how do I approach this? Let's think about energy conservation. The initial energy is just the rest energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the energy is the sum of rest energies plus kinetic energies. So:

Initial energy: E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.

Final energy: E_final = (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2) 

But since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum is zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Therefore, m1 v1 = m2 v2, but wait, relativistic momentum is gamma m v. So:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Wait, but since they are moving in opposite directions, the vector sum is zero. So, yes, their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But it's getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, since the nucleus is at rest, the total energy after fission should be equal to the initial rest energy. So:

E_initial = E1 + E2,

where E1 is the total energy of fragment 1 (rest energy + kinetic), E2 similarly for fragment 2.

So,

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

But E1 = m1 c² + T1,

E2 = m2 c² + T2.

So,

(m1 + m2) c² + (T1 + T2) = 300 GeV.

But (m1 + m2) c² = 0.99 M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So,

297 + (T1 + T2) = 300 → T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Wait, that's interesting. The total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 GeV.

Now, since the system was at rest, the total momentum is zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since the fragments are moving in opposite directions, it's better to write their momenta as equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, |p1| = |p2|.

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1,

p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But because fragment 1 is more massive (m1 = 2 m2), and assuming both have the same speed (but I'm not sure if that's correct), but wait, in reality, the more massive fragment would likely have a lower speed. Hmm, but in the case of fission, the lighter fragment is often more energetic, but I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, since the system is symmetric in terms of momentum, let's express the velocities in terms of their momenta.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use energy and momentum conservation.

Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2. Since they are moving in opposite directions, let's say v2 is negative with respect to v1. But perhaps it's better to model their magnitudes.

Hmm, perhaps using the fact that E1 = gamma1 m1 c²,

E2 = gamma2 m2 c².

And their momenta are equal:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Wait, but I should be careful with signs. Let me assume fragment 1 is moving in the positive direction, so fragment 2 is moving in the negative direction. So their velocities are v1 and -v2, but perhaps it's better to just use magnitudes and note that the momenta are equal and opposite.

Hmm, maybe a better approach: since the total momentum is zero,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2,

but since the direction is opposite, perhaps for the vectors, p1 = -p2. So, magnitude-wise: gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Wait, but the direction isn't important for the magnitude of the kinetic energy.

Another approach: using the invariant mass. The total energy squared minus (momentum c)^2 is invariant.

But maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, since T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, maybe I can find T1 in terms of T2.

Wait, but I also know that the kinetic energies relate to the velocities, which are linked via momentum.

Alternatively, to find the velocities, perhaps I can write the momentum equations.

Wait, maybe I should consider that in the center-of-momentum frame, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the fragments move in opposite directions.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between energy and momentum for each fragment.

The energy of each fragment is E1 = m1 c² + T1,

and E1² = (pc)² + (m1 c²)².

Similarly, E2² = (pc)² + (m2 c²)².

Wait, because the magnitudes of the momenta are equal (p1 = p2 = p), since the total momentum is zero.

So, for fragment 1: (E1)² = p² c² + (m1 c²)^2,

and for fragment 2: (E2)² = p² c² + (m2 c²)^2.

Subtracting these two equations:

E1² - E2² = (m1² - m2²) c^4.

But E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, as we have from earlier.

Let me write E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, and E1² - E2² = (m1² c^4 - m2^2 c^4) = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

Wait, let me compute m1 and m2 in terms of M.

m1 = 0.66 M,

m2 = 0.33 M.

So,

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV,

E1² - E2² = ( (0.66 M)^2 - (0.33 M)^2 ) c^4.

Factor that:

(0.66^2 - 0.33^2) M^2 c^4 = (0.4356 - 0.1089) M^2 c^4 = 0.3267 M^2 c^4.

But M is 300 GeV/c². So M c² is 300 GeV.

So,

E1² - E2² = 0.3267 (300 GeV)^2.

So,

(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = 0.3267 (300)^2.

We know E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So,

(E1 - E2) * 300 = 0.3267 * 300^2.

Divide both sides by 300:

E1 - E2 = 0.3267 * 300 = 98.01 GeV.

But E1 + E2 = 300 GeV,

So,

Adding the two equations:

E1 + E2 = 300,

E1 - E2 = 98.01,

Adding gives 2 E1 = 398.01 → E1 = 199.005 GeV.

Subtracting the equations:

2 E2 = 300 - 98.01 → 201.99 → E2 ≈ 100.995 GeV.

So E1 ≈ 199.005 GeV,

E2 ≈ 100.995 GeV.

But E1 is the total energy of fragment 1, which is m1 c² + T1. m1 c² is 0.66 * 300 = 198 GeV. So,

T1 = E1 - m1 c² = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV → 1.005 * 1000 MeV = 1005 MeV.

Similarly, E2 is 100.995 GeV, and m2 c² is 99 GeV. So T2 = 100.995 -99 = 1.995 GeV → 1995 MeV.

But wait, the sum T1 + T2 is 1.005 + 1.995 = 3 GeV, which matches our earlier calculation.

So T1 is about 1.005 GeV, which is 1005 MeV.

But wait, the problem asks for the kinetic energy using the classical approximation. So what's the classical approach?

In the classical (non-relativistic) approximation, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². And since momentum is conserved, and the initial momentum is zero, the momenta must be equal and opposite. So m1 v1 = m2 v2.

But let's see. Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2. So,

m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = (m1/m2) v1.

But m1 is twice m2, so v2 = (2) v1.

Now, the kinetic energies are:

T1_classical = (1/2) m1 v1²,

T2_classical = (1/2) m2 v2² = (1/2) m2 (2 v1)^2 = (1/2) m2 *4 v1² = 2 m2 v1².

But m1 = 2 m2,

so m2 = m1/2.

So,

T2_classical = 2 * (m1/2) v1² = m1 v1².

But T1_classical = (1/2) m1 v1^2.

So,

T1_classical = (1/2) m1 v1²,

T2_classical = m1 v1².

So,

T1_classical + T2_classical = (3/2) m1 v1².

But the total kinetic energy in the classical case would be 3 GeV, same as relativistic.

So,

(3/2) m1 v1² = 3 GeV.

But in the classical case, the rest masses are considered, but perhaps the calculation is different. Alternatively, perhaps the velocities are found using classical momentum conservation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute T1_classical and T1_relativistic.

Wait, let's compute T1_classical.

From the classical approach, the initial momentum is zero, so m1 v1 = m2 v2.

But since m1 = 2 m2, then v2 = 2 v1.

So the velocities are v1 and 2 v1.

The kinetic energies are:

T1_class = 0.5 m1 v1²,

T2_class = 0.5 m2 (v2)^2 = 0.5 m2 (2 v1)^2 = 0.5 m2 *4 v1² = 2 m2 v1².

But m1 = 2 m2 → m2 = m1 / 2.

So,

T2_class = 2 * (m1/2) v1² = m1 v1².

So,

T1_class = 0.5 m1 v1²,

T2_class = m1 v1².

Adding them: 1.5 m1 v1² = 3 GeV.

So,

m1 v1² = 2 GeV.

But T1_class is 0.5 m1 v1^2 = 1 GeV.

So in the classical approximation, T1 is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV.

But in the relativistic calculation, T1 is 1.005 GeV, which is 1005 MeV.

So the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1 is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Wait, wait a minute. So the correct T1 is 1005 MeV, classical is 1000 MeV. So the difference is 5 MeV. So the correct answer is option B) 5 MeV.


To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process using both relativistic and classical mechanics. The initial nucleus has a rest mass \( M \) with rest-mass energy \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \). After fission, it splits into two fragments with rest masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), where \( m_1 = 2m_2 \) and \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \). Solving for \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), we find \( m_1 = 0.66M \) and \( m_2 = 0.33M \). The rest-mass energies of the fragments are \( m_1c^2 = 198 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_2c^2 = 99 \, \text{GeV} \), so the total rest-mass energy after fission is \( 297 \, \text{GeV} \). The remaining energy, \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments, \( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Relativistic Calculation
Using relativistic energy and momentum conservation, the total energy of each fragment is \( E_1 = m_1c^2 + T_1 \) and \( E_2 = m_2c^2 + T_2 \). Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum is zero, so the magnitudes of the momenta of the two fragments are equal: \( \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2 \). Solving the equations, we find \( T_1 \approx 1.005 \, \text{GeV} \) (or \( 1005 \, \text{MeV} \)).

### Classical Approximation
In the classical (non-relativistic) approximation, kinetic energy is given by \( T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). Using momentum conservation, \( m_1v_1 = m_2v_2 \), and solving for \( T_1 \), we find \( T_1 \approx 1.000 \, \text{GeV} \) (or \( 1000 \, \text{MeV} \)).

### Difference Between Relativistic and Classical Results
The difference between the correct relativistic \( T_1 \) and the classical \( T_1 \) is:

\[
\Delta T_1 = T_1^{\text{relativistic}} - T_1^{\text{classical}} = 1005 \, \text{MeV} - 1000 \, \text{MeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the difference is **5 MeV**.
