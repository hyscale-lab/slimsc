Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem talks about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So, Y is some element that forms compounds with F. There are five such compounds known. The question involves several substances A1 to A5, each being a different compound, and their properties.

Let me list out the information given:

1. A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think oF here stands for the oxidation state of F, maybe?) is 31.96% for A2. Wait, wait—wait, no, maybe oF is the formula or something else. Oh, perhaps it's the oxidation state. But 31.96% sounds like a percentage composition. Hmm, maybe it's the percentage of fluorine by mass in A2. Oh, because 31.96% is close to the natural abundance of fluorine-19, but maybe that's a red herring.

Wait, fluorine's atomic weight is about 19 g/mol. So if A2 has a fluorine content of 31.96%, that suggests that in A2, F is present in a certain ratio. Let's think about that.

2. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So A1 is an oxidizing agent, and it's reacting with xenon as a reducing agent. That suggests that A1 has a high oxidation state. Because when A1 acts as an oxidizing agent, it gets reduced. Xenon is being oxidized, perhaps? Or maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, A1 could be a strong oxidizing agent, such as a peroxide or something with a high oxidation state of Y.

Hmm. Wait, wait, perhaps Y is oxygen? Because O forms many binary compounds with F, like OF2, O2F2, etc. But fluorine is more electronegative, so usually Y (the other element) would have a lower oxidation state.

Wait, but in the problem, Y is the other element in each compound. So A1, A2, etc., are all Y-F compounds.

Wait, but the problem says five binary compounds are known. Fluorine typically forms binary compounds
