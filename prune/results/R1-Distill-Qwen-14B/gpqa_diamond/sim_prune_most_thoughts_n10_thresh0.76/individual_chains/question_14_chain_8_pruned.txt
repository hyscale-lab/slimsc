Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments, and I need to figure out where the peaks would disappear when using PFA+DSG fixation instead of just PFA. Hmm, let me think.

First, I remember that ChIP-seq is used to find where transcription factors bind on the DNA. The process involves crosslinking proteins to DNA, fragmenting the DNA, using an antibody to pull down the protein of interest along with the attached DNA, and then sequencing those fragments.

The question says the sample was fixed with PFA (paraformaldehyde), which I think is a common fixative that crosslinks proteins to DNA. Then, they used an antibody for IKAROS, a transcription factor found in B cells. After all the sequencing steps, they saw peaks (binding sites) but when they used PFA+DSG, those peaks disappeared. I need to find out where these peaks were.

Wait, DSG is dithiothreitol. Oh right, I remember that DSG is a reducing agent. In the context of crosslinking, I think that PFA typically forms strong crosslinks between proteins and DNA, but doesn't crosslink proteins to other proteins. However, when you have something that crosslinks proteins to proteins, like formaldehyde, you might get longer crosslinks, including between proteins in a complex. DSG probably helps in breaking some crosslinks or maybe reversing them.

Wait no, wait. Wait, PFA is a fixative that crosslinks proteins to DNA. But sometimes other methods like using formaldehyde (which can crosslink proteins to each other as well) are used. So if you have PFA alone, perhaps it's more efficient in crosslinking DNA-protein, but DSG is a reducing agent. Oh wait, I think DSG is used in some fixation protocols to disrupt disulfide bonds. So when you use PFA+DSG, perhaps it affects the crosslinking process.

Wait, another angle. I've heard that when using formaldehyde-based fixation, sometimes proteins that are in close proximity can be crosslinked. But in some cases, especially with PFA, which is a stronger crosslinker, maybe you get more crosslinking. Wait, no, I think PFA is a milder fixative than formaldehyde. Wait, no, PFA is actually a different fixative; it's a vapor-phase fixative, commonly used for electron microscopy because it's less harsh. But in the context of ChIP, perhaps it's
