Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Hmm, I remember that nucleophilicity can depend on the solvent, right? The question specifies aqueous solution, so it's a polar protic solvent. Polar aprotic is different, but I don't think that's the case here.

The nucleophiles given are: 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, hydroxide, propionate, methanol, and ethanethiolate. I need to arrange them from most reactive to least reactive.

Wait, nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents is often about how well the nucleophile can shed its solvent molecules and attack. Strong bases are better nucleophiles. Also, the size of the ion might matter because larger ions are less tightly solvated, making them more nucleophilic.

Let me list each nucleophile and think about their strength.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: This is an alkoxide ion. Alkoxides are strong bases, but their nucleophilicity can vary. The 4-methyl group might make the cyclohexanolate less bulky, but wait, cyclohexanolate is a strong nucleophile. But wait, is it more or less than hydroxide?

2. Hydroxide ion (OH⁻): Hydroxide is a strong base, but in polar protic solvents like water, it's less nucleophilic than some other ions because it's tightly solvated. But compared to others, maybe not.

3. Propionate ion (CH2CH2COO⁻): This is the conjugate base of propionic acid. Its nucleophilicity might be lower because it's a weaker base compared to something like hydroxide or the cyclohexanolate. Wait, but in polar protic solvents, larger anions are less solvated, so maybe propionate is a better nucleophile than something else.

4. Methanol (CH3OH): This is a neutral molecule. In a polar protic solvent, neutral nucleophiles are generally less reactive than their deprotonated counterparts. So methanol is probably a poor nucleophile here.

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻): Thiols are weaker bases than alcohols, but their conjugate bases (like ethanethiolate) are stronger nucleophiles. Because S is larger than O, the HS⁻ ion is less solvated in polar protic solvents, making it more nucleophilic. So ethanethiolate should be a good nucleophile here.

Wait, so let's order them.

Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) is a strong nucleophile in aqueous solution. Then, hydroxide (OH⁻) is next. But wait, the cyclohexanolate is an alkoxide, which is a strong base. But compared to hydroxide, which is smaller, I think hydroxide is a better nucleophile in polar protic solvents because it's a stronger base, but wait, maybe not.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: in polar aprotic solvents, nucleophilicity order follows basicity, but in polar protic, it's the opposite because the solvent stabilizes the ions. Hmm, no, wait, in polar protic solvents, the ability to shed the solvent molecules matters. So, larger ions (like iodide) are less solvated and more nucleophilic. For example, in water, the order of nucleophilicity for halides is I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻, despite F⁻ being a stronger base.

So, looking at the given nucleophiles:

HS⁻ (ethanethiolate) is a good nucleophile in water because it's a weakly solvated, larger ion. Then comes the hydroxide ion (OH⁻), but wait, does OH⁻ have better nucleophilicity than the cyclohexanolate?

Wait, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a strong base, but compared to hydroxide, how does it compare? I think cyclohexoxide is a stronger base than OH⁻. Wait no, hydroxide is stronger than alkoxide? Wait, the pKa of cyclohexanol is around 19-20, while water's pKa is about 15.7. So, the conjugate base of cyclohexanol (cyclohexanolate) is weaker base than OH⁻. Wait, no: the conjugate base strength depends on the acid. Wait, if the acid is stronger, its conjugate base is weaker. Water is a stronger acid than cyclohexanol, so OH⁻ is a weaker base than cyclohexanolate.

Wait, no. Wait, wait, the pKa of water is lower (15.7) than cyclohexanol (around 19-20), so that makes water a stronger acid. So, the conjugate base of water is OH⁻, and the conjugate base of cyclohexanol is cyclohexanolate. Since water is a stronger acid, its conjugate base (OH⁻) is weaker. So cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻.

So, in terms of basicity: cyclohexanolate > hydroxide > propionate? Wait, what's the pKa of propionic acid? I think around 4.88. So propionate is the conjugate base of a weaker acid (pKa ~5) than water, but stronger than cyclohexanol. Wait, propionic acid's pKa is about 4.88, so the propionate ion (CH2CH2COO⁻) is a weaker base than OH⁻ but stronger than, say, methoxide in some cases.

Wait, so propionate is a weaker base than OH⁻. So, in order of base strength: cyclohexanolate (strongest), then ethanethiolate? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pKa of H2S is around 7, so H2S is a weaker acid than water. So the conjugate base HS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻. So wait, the strength order is: cyclohexanolate > ethanethiolate (HS⁻) > hydroxide (OH⁻) > propionate (CH2CH2COO⁻) ?

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to list each conjugate acid's pKa to determine the strength.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: conjugate acid is 4-methylcyclohexanol. Its pKa is around 19. So, its conjugate base (cyclohexanolate) is strong, since the acid is weak.

2. Hydroxide: conjugate acid is water, pKa ~15.7. So OH⁻ is a weaker base than cyclohexanolate.

3. Propionate: conjugate acid is propionic acid, pKa ~4.88. So propionate is a weaker base than hydroxide because its conjugate acid is stronger.

4. Methanol: it's a neutral molecule. Its pKa is around 19.7, I think. So CH3OH is a weaker acid than cyclohexanol, so its conjugate base (methoxide) is stronger. Wait, but methanol is a solvent here, so in aqueous solution, it's not deprotonated. So methanol is a neutral molecule, so its nucleophilicity is lower than the anions.

5. Ethanethiolate: HS⁻, its conjugate acid is H2S, pKa ~7. So HS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻ because H2S is a weaker acid than water. So HS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻.

So, the strength order of the conjugate bases (from strongest to weakest) is:

4-methylcyclohexanolate (pKa ~19) < HS⁻ (pKa ~7) < OH⁻ (pKa ~15.7) < propionate (pKa ~4.88) ? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the higher the pKa of the conjugate acid, the stronger the base. Because a higher pKa means the acid is weaker, so the conjugate base is stronger.

Let me correct:

Conjugate acid pKa:

1. 4-methylcyclohexanol: ~19 → conjugate base (cyclohexanolate) is strong.

5. H2S: pKa ~7 → HS⁻ is a strong base.

2. H2O: pKa ~15.7 → OH⁻ is a weaker base than HS⁻.

3. CH3CH2COOH: pKa ~4.88 → propionate is weaker base than OH⁻.

So, the order of base strength is: cyclohexanolate > HS⁻ > OH⁻ > propionate.

Wait, but wait, cyclohexanolate has a higher pKa (19) than H2S (7), so cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than HS⁻.

Wait, no. Wait, if
