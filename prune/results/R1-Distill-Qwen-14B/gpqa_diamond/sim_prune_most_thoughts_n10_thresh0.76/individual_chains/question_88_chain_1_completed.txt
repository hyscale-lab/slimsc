Okay, so I'm looking at this question about rotavirus and some experiments involving GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my immunology, but let's try to break this down step by step.

The setup is that they tagged inner capsid proteins with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then they did in vivo imaging and saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They identified Peyer patches and isolated proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, they saw high variability.

Wait, so what's happening here. I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're specialized for sampling antigens in the gut, right? So when you introduce something into the gut, like via oral gavage, the antigens would be taken up by these patches.

The proteins are tagged with GFP, which is probably to track where they go. Stomach acid can break down proteins, but some made it through and got entangled in mucus. But some did reach the Peyer patches. Once there, the immune system would react to these antigens.

When they isolated the proliferating cells, I think those would be B cells that are activated. Because B cells are the ones that make antibodies, and when they're activated, they proliferate. So the cells they're looking at are B cells, perhaps.

The sequencing showed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes. High variability in the variable regions... wait, isn't that a sign of some kind of diversification process?

So what processes create variability in the variable regions of antibodies? I remember that during B cell development, there are a few key processes. First, VDJ recombination happens in the bone marrow during the development of B cells. This process assembles the variable, diversity, and joining segments of the heavy chain, creating a diverse array of specificities even before any antigen exposure.

But after the B cells are activated by an antigen, they undergo somatic hypermutation. This process introduces point mutations in the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes, increasing the diversity of the antibodies produced. This is a way to fine-tune the response to the specific antigen.

So in this case, the rotavirus protein is acting as an antigen. After being taken up by Peyer patches, which are part of the immune system, the B cells would recognize the antigen. Once activated, these B cells start proliferating and undergo somatic hypermutation to increase the diversity of their antibodies.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests that each B cell has a slightly different sequence in the variable region, which is exactly what happens during somatic hypermutation. This process allows the immune system to generate a broader and more specific response to the antigen.

Let me look at the options again. The choices are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching, D) VDJ recombination.

So VDJ recombination (D) happens early in B cell development, in the bone marrow, and is a one-time event that creates the initial diversity. I don't think that's what's happening here because the question implies that this is after the B cells have already been activated by the antigen.

Class switching (C) is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), which doesn't directly affect the variability of the heavy chain variable regions. It's more about the type of antibody produced rather than the diversity.

Complement activation (B) is part of the immune response, but it's more about marking pathogens for destruction and doesn't directly cause changes in the B cell receptors.

So the correct process here must be somatic hypermutation (A), which is the process that increases the diversity of the variable regions after antigen exposure.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is lost due to stomach acid and mucus, but the tagged proteins reach the Peyer patches, where they are taken up by the immune system. The isolated proliferating cells from these patches show high variability in their variable heavy chain genes after sequencing.

Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are specialized for sampling antigens in the gut. The GFP-tagged proteins act as antigens, activating B cells in the Peyer patches. Activated B cells proliferate and undergo processes that diversify their antibody repertoires. The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes is a hallmark of **somatic hypermutation**, a process that introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes after antigen exposure. This fine-tunes the immune response and increases specificity.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This is the correct process, as it explains the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes after antigen activation.
- **B) Complement activation**: This process marks pathogens for destruction but does not directly affect the variability of B cell receptors.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody produced but does not increase the variability of the variable regions.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow and creates initial diversity, not the observed variability after antigen exposure.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs after antigen activation and fine-tunes the immune response.

Answer: A
