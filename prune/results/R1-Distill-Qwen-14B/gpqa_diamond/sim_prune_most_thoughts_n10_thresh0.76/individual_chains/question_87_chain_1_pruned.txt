Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the given options.

Alright, let's break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Benzene has six carbons, so the substituents must add up to the remaining two carbons, because the total is eight. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is six, so substituents have two more carbons? No, wait, because substituents can be more complex. Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, the ring is benzene (6 carbons) but with two substituent groups attached. The total number of carbons in the compound is 8, so each substituent must contribute some carbons. Let me see: benzene has 6 carbons, so substituents add 2 more. Wait, or maybe each substituent is one carbon each, making two substituents (since di-sub
