Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage structure. 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure. So when it's heated with excess KOH, that's probably an elimination reaction. Wait, no, KOH is a strong base, but when it's heated, maybe it's an E2 elimination. But wait, bromides would react with KOH in an SN2, but adamantane is a very rigid structure. Alternatively, maybe it's dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid, and the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So probably, the reaction forms a ketone. How?

Oh, wait, I think when two vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihaloalkanes) react with a strong base like KOH, they can eliminate two molecules of HX (like HBr) to form an alkene, but if the base is in a specific condition or if the structure allows, maybe it forms a carbonyl group. Alternatively, wait, maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane is undergoing a double elimination, but how?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbocation, which then loses Br⁻ to form a carbonyl. But in adamantane's structure, the carbons are very highly substituted, so maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a ketone via a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is eliminated with a base, leading to formation of two carbonyl groups, but wait, the product is 1, so maybe it's forming a diketone? Or perhaps one of the Br is eliminated, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the NMR of product 1: 4.7
