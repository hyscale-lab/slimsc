Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm. So, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So plx in arcseconds is 1 over distance in parsecs. So, if plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

The problem states that the number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. So, let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Since plx is 1/d, substituting that into the equation gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Because plx is 1/d, so 1/(plx) is d. So 1/(plx^5) would be d^5? Wait, let me compute that: 1/( (1/d)^5 ) equals d^5. Oh right, because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, and taking reciprocal gives d^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. Wait, the question is a bit tricky. It says, how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit range of distance r. Hmm. So, I think it's asking for the number of stars as a function of distance, but perhaps it's looking for how the count depends on distance when you move a certain range, like the change in number when you increase the distance by a unit.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential. Like, how does N change when you move a small distance dr. Because the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r would be proportional to the surface area of that shell (which is 4πr²) multiplied by the number density. But wait, the number density might depend on distance as well.

Wait, the problem says N varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So N is proportional to d
