Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And resonance has something to do with their unstable nature, which would mean they decay quickly. But I'm not exactly sure, so I'll have to think this through.

The question gives me some specific numbers: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, which I think is the average distance the meson travels before decaying.

Wait, I remember something about the mean lifetime being related to the particle's width. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle! The uncertainty in energy (which is related to the width Γ) and the uncertainty in time (which is the lifetime τ) are inversely related. The formula is something like ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So maybe τ is proportional to ħ/(Γ).

But wait, I think the exact relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that makes sense. So the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the width Γ. 

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the decay distance by multiplying the velocity of the particle by the lifetime. Decay distance d = v * τ. But what's the velocity here?

The meson is produced with energy E_X of 8 GeV. Its rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So I can find its velocity using relativistic equations. The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So first, let's compute gamma. E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. So E = γ m c². Dividing both sides by m c² gives γ = E/(m c²). But since both E and m are in GeV, and c² is in (GeV^2)/(mass unit squared), but I think the units might simplify. Let me think: E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c², perhaps? Or wait, actually, the mass is given as 1.2 GeV, but in terms of energy, it's m c² which is 1.2 GeV. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

So, E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So gamma would be E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.666666667.

But wait, wait a second. The meson is produced with energy E_X, which is its total energy. So the total energy E = gamma m c². So gamma is E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is 6.6667.

Now, using gamma, I can find the velocity v. The relation is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), where beta is v/c. Let's solve for beta.

Let me compute beta. Let gamma = 6.6667, so gamma squared is approximately (6.6667)^2 = 44.4444. So 1/gamma² is 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225. Then 1 - beta² = 1/(gamma²) = 0.0225. So beta² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking square root, beta ≈ sqrt(0.9775). Let's compute that. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, which is 0.9887c.

So the velocity v is approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light, c. Now, the speed of light is about 3e8 meters per second.

Next, I need to calculate the mean lifetime τ. As I thought earlier, τ = ħ / Γ. But I have to make sure the units match. The width Γ is given in MeV, which is 320 MeV. Let's convert that to GeV for consistency. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

Wait, but ħ is in units of GeV·s. I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Let me confirm that. Oh yeah, ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s when using natural units where c=1.

So Γ is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s. Let me compute that.

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s. That's 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is equal to (6.582 / 0.32) x 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875.
