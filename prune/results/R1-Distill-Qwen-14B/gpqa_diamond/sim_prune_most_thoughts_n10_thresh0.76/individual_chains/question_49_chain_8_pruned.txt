Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond along with a sigma bond. The classic examples are the Cope and Claisen rearrangements. The question gives three different reactions, and I need to determine the products A, B, and C from the options given.

Let me tackle each part one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol with H+ and heat gives A.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like (CH3O)2CHNH2. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CHOH. Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is (CH2)2CHOH with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So it's CH2CH(OH)CH2. Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the OH on carbon 2 and the double bond between 3 and 4? Wait no, but the butenol... Hmm, buten-2-ol would have four carbons. Let me think. But-3-en-2-ol is HOCH2CH2CH2CH2, but wait, maybe I'm getting confused. No, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but but is four carbons. So positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between 3 and 4, and the OH is on 2. So it's CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, maybe it's CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3, but with a double bond between 3 and 4. So structure is CH2CH(OH)-CH2-CH2? No, but the double bond is between 3 and 4, so maybe it's CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2=CHCH2OH? Because but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3. Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, maybe but-3-en-2-ol is HOCH2CH2CH=CH2. No, that's 1-pentene. Wait, but but has four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2? No, the double bond is between 3 and 4, but but has only four carbons, so the double bond is between 3 and 4 which is impossible. Wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong.

Ah, I see. For but-3-en-2-ol, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3. No, that's pent-3-en-2-ol. Wait, maybe it's CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3, but with a double bond between 2 and 3? No, that can't be. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2 but with a double bond elsewhere. Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OH, which would be but-2-en-1-ol, but the question says but-3-en-2-ol. So I'm getting a bit stuck here, but maybe I should proceed.

The reaction is with H+ and heat. So perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed reaction, like a Claisen or Cope rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement, but that involves 1,2-diols.

Wait, but 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is CH3OCH2CH2NH2? No, wait, it's (CH
