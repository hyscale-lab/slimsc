Okay, so I have this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, but I need to figure it out step by step.

Alright, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2mL²), right? Oh wait, and the problem defines E as E = π² ħ² / (2mL²), so each E_n is just n² times E. So E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E, E_4 is 16E, and so on.

Now, the particles are spin-1/2, which means each can have spin up or spin down. But wait, wait—since we're dealing with identical fermions (like electrons), they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers in the same system.

Hmm, but in a 1D well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin. So each particle's state is specified by (n, s), where s is either up or down. But wait, in a 1D well, the spin doesn't affect the spatial part of the wavefunction, right? So each spatial level can hold two fermions, one with spin up and one with spin down.

So for four particles, we need to arrange them in the lowest possible energy states without violating the Pauli exclusion. Let's think about filling the states.

The ground state would be the lowest energy configuration. How do the particles fill up the available states?

The lowest energy states are n=1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Since each n can hold up to two particles (spin up and down), let's see:

n=1 can hold 2 particles.
n=2 can hold 2 particles.
n=3 can hold 2, but we don't need that for four particles.

Wait, but no—if each state with a particular n can hold two particles, then for four particles
