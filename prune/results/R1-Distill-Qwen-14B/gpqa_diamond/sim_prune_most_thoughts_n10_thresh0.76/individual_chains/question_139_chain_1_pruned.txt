Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that two compounds, A and B, are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This leads to the production of two different diketones. I need to find out what A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and HCl are usually involved in diazotization reactions. Diazonium salts are formed, especially from aromatic amines. But wait, the products here are diketones... that's a bit confusing. Oh, wait, maybe it's not an aromatic amine. Or perhaps it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, another thought: when an alcohol is treated with HCl, NaNO2, and water, could that lead to the formation of a ketone? Or maybe a di-ketone. Oh! I think I remember something about the Stephen reduction or maybe the production of ketones from nitro compounds, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's related to the oxidation of certain groups.

Wait, let me think. I remember that when a primary amine is treated with nitrous acid (from NaNO2 and HCl) under certain conditions, it can form a diazonium salt. But if that's then hydrolyzed, maybe under acidic or basic conditions, it can form different products. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions like substitution, but I'm not sure how that leads to diketones.

Wait, another possibility
