Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Their masses are negligible, which probably means we don't have to consider kinetic energy or anything like that—just focusing on potential energy. 

So, out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. And the question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places. The options are given in various units.

Hmm. Since we're dealing with charges and electric potential, I think this is an electrostatics problem involving electric potential energy. Remember, the potential energy between two charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the potential energy of the entire system. So I need to calculate the total potential energy between all pairs of charges. Since all charges are identical, each pair will contribute the same amount to the total energy.

But wait, the setup is a bit specific. There are 12 charges at 2 meters from point P, and one charge at P. So the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the 12 others are each 2 meters away from it.

Wait, so each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge (which is at P). But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at the same distance from each other?

Hmm, that's a bit unclear. But since the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, perhaps their positions form a sphere around P. But the problem doesn't specify how they are arranged relative to each other. But since the distance from P is fixed, maybe the distance between any two charges among the 12 can vary, but the problem might assume that all of them are at the same distance from each other as from P
