Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, various reagents are added in sequence to form products 1, 2, 3, and finally 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in product 4. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to track each reaction and see what structures are formed, then determine the number of distinct H's in the final product.

First, let me break down each step.

Step 1: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

I remember that when you have dienes and dienophiles, Diels-Alder reactions come into play. Also, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, maybe involved in some substitution? Wait, but the starting material has a t-butoxy groupâ€”tert-butoxy is an electron-donating group, so maybe it's involved in some kind of ring-opening or facilitating a reaction.

Wait, looking at the starting diene: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene is norbornene. The substituent is at position 7, which is the bridgehead. So the structure would have a bridge, and the t-butoxy is at that bridgehead.

The other reactant is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. That's a diene with two substituents: each at positions 5 and 6 is a dibromomethyl group. So each substituent is CH2Br2, I think. So the molecule is cyclohexadiene with two CH2Br2 groups attached at adjacent positions.

So when this reacts with the norbornene derivative, perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction occurs. Norbornene is a diene, and the other molecule is a dienophile? Or vice versa?

Wait, Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene and a dienophile (like a dienophile with electron-withdrawing groups). The cyclohexadiene is a conjugated diene, but the substituents are Br, which are EWG. So maybe the cyclohexadiene is acting as the dienophile? Or perhaps the norbornene is the diene and the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is another diene, so maybe a Diels-Alder isn't happening here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the two dienes. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the reagent is a dienophile and is undergoing a Di
