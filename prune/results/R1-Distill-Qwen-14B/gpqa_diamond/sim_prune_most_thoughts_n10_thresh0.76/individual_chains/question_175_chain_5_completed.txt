Okay, so I'm trying to answer this physics question about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they can radiate electromagnetic waves. The question says it's spheroidal and the symmetry is along the z-axis, so I think that's like an oscillating dipole, maybe?

The problem talks about the radiated power per unit solid angle being a function f of lambda and theta. And we're supposed to find the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and also figure out the form of f.

Wait, I remember that for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern isn't isotropic. The intensity or power radiated varies with the angle. The formula for the radiation pattern of a dipole is something like sin(theta), right? So the intensity is maximum at theta = 90 degrees, which would be the equator of the dipole. That makes sense because the dipole's field is strongest in the transverse direction.

So the maximum power A would be when sin(theta) is maximum. Since sin(90) is 1, that's the peak. Now, when theta is 30 degrees, sin(theta) is 0.5. So the power at 30 degrees would be (0.5)^2 times the maximum because I think the power is proportional to sin^2(theta). Wait, let me think. The radiated power per unit solid angle, I think, is proportional to sin^2(theta). So at theta=30, it's (0.5)^2 = 0.25, so 1/4 of A. So the fraction is 1/4.

So the options, let's check. The first part is the fraction. The options where the fraction is 1/4 are B and C.

Now, the other part is the form of f, which is the function of lambda and theta. The question says f is the power per unit solid angle, so I think that's the radiation intensity. For a dipole, the radiation intensity (like the power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (omega^4) and also (dipole moment)^2, but I think in terms of lambda, omega is 2pi c / lambda. So omega^4 is (1/lambda^4). So the intensity should go as 1/lambda^4.

Looking at the options, for the form of f, option C says lambda^-4, and option B says lambda^-3. So the function f is lambda^(-4).

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The power (Poynting vector) for dipole radiation is known to fall as (1/lambda^4) because the power is proportional to (omega^4) and omega is 2pi c /lambda. So omega^4 is (1/lambda^4)^2? Wait no. Wait, omega = 2pi c / lambda, so omega^4 is (c^4 * 16 pi^4) / lambda^4. So yeah, proportional to 1/lambda^4.

So the function f should have a dependence on lambda^-4.

So looking back at the options, when fraction is 1/4 and function is lambda^-4, that's option C.

So the answer would be option C: 1/4 and lambda^-4.


The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution shaped as a spheroid with symmetry along the z-axis, radiating at a wavelength \(\lambda\). The radiated power per unit solid angle is a function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\), and the goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the form of \(f\).

For a dipole radiator, the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to \(\sin^2(\theta)\). At \(\theta = 30^\circ\), \(\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5\), so the power radiated at this angle is \((0.5)^2 = 0.25\) of the maximum power \(A\). Thus, the fraction of \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\).

The function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\), which represents the radiated power per unit solid angle, is proportional to \(\omega^4\), where \(\omega = 2\pi c / \lambda\). Substituting \(\omega\), the dependence on \(\lambda\) becomes \(\lambda^{-4}\). Therefore, the form of \(f\) is \(\lambda^{-4}\).

Among the options, the one that matches both the fraction \(1/4\) and the form \(\lambda^{-4}\) is option C.

Answer: C
