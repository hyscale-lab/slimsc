Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars—right, they orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about finding out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The options are A to D, so I need to figure this out step by step.

Wait, the problem gives me the periods of eclipses for each system. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has 1 year. Oh, but wait, the period is the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. So the orbital period is the same as the eclipse period in this case, I think. Because eclipsing binaries eclipse each other when they pass in front from our point of view, so their orbital period is the same as the eclipse period.

Then, they've done spectroscopic observations—radial velocity (RV) measurements. Radial velocity variations occur because the stars are moving towards and away from us. The amplitudes of these variations are given. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 and 10 km/s.

I remember that in a binary system, the stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, right? Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive object. So the velocity amplitude (how much they move back and forth) depends on their mass. I think the formula involves the mass ratio.

Wait, the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitudes. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is something like K = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_p + M_s)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ) ), but wait, that's when you have a planet around a star. But here, both stars are contributing, so maybe a different approach.

Alternatively, I remember that for a binary star system, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses. So if star A has a velocity K1 and star B has K2, then K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because the more massive star moves slower. So in system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. So K1=10, K2=5. So K1/K2 = 2. So M2/M1 = 2 → M1 = M2/2. So M1 is half the mass of M2? Wait, no, that depends on which star is which. Because K1 is for star 1, and K2 is for star 2. So K1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * V, where V is the orbital speed, but maybe that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, considering that in a binary system, the two stars orbit each other with a period P. The velocity amplitudes are related to their masses. The more massive star has a smaller velocity. So the ratio of their velocities is equal to the inverse ratio of their masses.

So, for system_1: the velocities are 10 and 5. So the mass ratio, M1/M
