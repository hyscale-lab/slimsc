Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read through it again and try to understand what it's asking. 

So, the setup is that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The problem says that because of these spots, when the star rotates, its brightness changes because the spots come into and out of view. This makes the light curve look like it has periodic variations. The interesting part is that this situation can be mistaken for an exoplanet causing similar brightness dips.

The question is, if the star wasn't spotted, what radius would a hypothetical exoplanet have to be to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve? So I need to find Rpl/Rstar, the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to the variation that would be caused by a planet. 

First, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the dip is approximately (R_planet / R_star)^2, assuming the planet is a perfect sphere and the transit is edge-on.

But wait, in this problem, it's the star's spots that are causing a variation. So when the spotted hemisphere rotates into view, the star's brightness decreases because the spots are cooler. But the effect here is a bit different because only part of the star is covered.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, the star's total brightness without any spots. The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But since we're dealing with flux in the context of a star's surface, each square meter emits σT^4.

Now, the star has a hemisphere covered in spots. The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of that hemisphere is spots. Each spot is cooler by 1000 K. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, so the spots are at 5000 K.

Wait, no, wait. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So each spot has a temperature of 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

The filling factor is 0.2, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots. So for the hemisphere, the fraction of area with spots is 0.2. But since it's one hemisphere, the total area covered is 0.2 * (2πR² / 2) )? Wait, no. The surface area of a sphere is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR². So the total area of one hemisphere is 2πR², and 20% of that is
