Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. Let's see: the main chain is ethan-1-one, meaning a two-carbon chain with a ketone group. So, the ketone is on the first carbon, and the second carbon is connected to the benzene ring. So, the benzene is attached to the ethanone at the 1-position. And on the benzene ring, there are two substituents: a bromo at position 3 and a nitro at position 5.

Wait, benzene rings are numbered in such a way that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5, but that might be relative. Alternatively, perhaps the ring has nitro and bromo in para positions? Wait, no, 3 and 5 are meta positions with respect to each other, but in a benzene ring, 3 and 5 are actually meta if the numbering starts at the ethanone?

Wait, maybe I should draw this. So, the ethanone is connected to the benzene in position 1. Then, the benzene has substituents in positions 3 and 5. So, if position 1 is where the ethanone is attached, then positions 2, 3, 4, etc., are around the ring. So substituents in 3 and 5 would be at meta positions relative to each other as well. No, wait, on a benzene ring, the positions 1, 3, and 5 are all adjacent? No, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. When you have a substituent at position 1, the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. The positions opposite 1 is 4. So positions 3 and 5 would be meta to each other relative to the 1 substituent. So, the substituents are at positions 3 (meta to 1) and 5 (which is also meta to 1, but on the other side). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to each other, but that would mean they are para positions. Hmm, maybe I should focus more on the synthesis steps rather than the exact numbering.

The target molecule is a phenyl ketone with bromine and nitro groups. So, the synthesis steps likely involve introducing these substituents in a specific order, considering the directing effects of each group.

Benzene is the starting material. Let me think about the possible reactions. The options involve various reagents like CH3COCl with AlCl3 (which is acetylation), Br2 with FeBr3 (bromination), HNO3 with H2SO4 (nitration), Fe and HCl (probably a reduction step, maybe for nitro groups
