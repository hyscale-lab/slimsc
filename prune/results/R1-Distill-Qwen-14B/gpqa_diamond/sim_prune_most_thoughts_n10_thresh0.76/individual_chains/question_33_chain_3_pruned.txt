Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about a cycloaddition reaction. The question is asking about the exo product formed when 2,5-dimethylthiophene reacts with furan-2,5-dione under heat. Hmm, I remember that cycloadditions, especially [4+2] ones, are Diels-Alder reactions. Oh right, the Diels-Alder is a [4π + 2π] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile, forming a six-membered ring.

Wait, so what's the diene here? Furan-2,5-dione... Let me think. Furan has two double bonds. Furan-2,5-dione is also known as dioxolone, right? But in this case, the dienophile is usually the electron-deficient component. So furan-2,5-dione would be the dienophile because of the two ketone groups which make it electron-deficient. 

The diene is 2,5-dimethylthiophene. Thiophene is a five-membered aromatic ring with one sulfur. The 2 and 5 positions have methyl groups. Since thiophene is an aromatic heterocycle, when it acts as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction, the conjugated double bonds would be in positions 2 and 3 (maybe?), but wait, wait. Wait, 2,5-dimethylthiophene. So the structure is a thiophene ring with methyl groups at positions 2 and 5. So the structure is like: positions 2 and 5 are CH3, and the double bonds are between 1-2, 3-4, and 4-5? No, wait, thiophene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, right? So the structure is a ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making the ring conjugated. So the diene would be the 2,5-dimethylthiophene acting as a diene for the Diels-Alder?

Wait, no. Wait, the diene in Diels-Alder is a conjugated diene, but 2,5-dimethylthiophene is an aromatic compound. Oh wait, can aromatic compounds undergo Diels-Alder? Because
