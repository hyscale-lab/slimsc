Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. The question is to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. The options are A to D, and each is a different organic compound.

Let me first jot down what I know. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get a sense of what functional groups I might be dealing with. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The degree of unsaturation is (2n + 2 - m - x - y)/2. So here, n=9, m=11, x=2, y=1. Plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20 -14)/2 = 6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That could mean three double bonds, or maybe a ring and some double bonds, or an aromatic ring (which accounts for 4 degrees, but wait no—benzene is three, right? Because each double bond is a degree. So benzene has three double bonds, so that's three degrees. So if the compound has a benzene ring, that accounts for all three. So the rest of the molecule would be substituents without any additional unsaturation. So the molecule must have a benzene ring.

Looking at the IR data: medium to strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely N-H stretches. Strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, amide, or something like that.

The 1H NMR data: Let's see. The peaks are at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H), which is probably a CH3 group attached to something electronegative, like an oxygen or maybe a nitrogen. The triplet suggests it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Then 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, maybe an NH2 group or something with exchange, but considering the IR has N-H, perhaps it's an amide or something where the protons are exchanging. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom. Wait, but the IR shows strong N-H, which suggests an amide or amine. The next peak is at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). A quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Maybe this is a CH2 group next to another CH2. Quartet would be from coupling with two protons on either side, but wait, if it's a CH2 adjacent to another CH2, each would have two protons, so each would split into a quartet. Alternatively, maybe an OCH2 group.

Then in the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). This looks like a para-substituted benzene. Because each doublet integrates for two protons, and the coupling between them would lead to a doublet.

Putting this together: the molecule likely has a benzene ring with a substituent in the para position. The substituent could be something like a carbonyl group attached to an oxygen or nitrogen.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide is a CONH2 group. Wait, but the formula for 3-ethoxybenzamide would be C9H11NO2? Let's check. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would make C9H11NO2. That fits. Now, the NMR. The ethoxy group would be split into a triplet for the CH3 and a quartet for the OCH2. Wait, in the NMR, the triplet is at 1.20 (3H), so that's the CH3 of ethoxy. The quartet at 4.5 ppm would be the OCH2. Then, what about the amide? The amide would have an NH group. But wait, amide protons are usually broad and may exchange, so the 4.0 ppm peak could be the NH of the amide. But wait, benzamide has a structure like Ar-CO-NH2. So the NH2 would be expected as a broad peak, but in this case, it's a singlet at 4.0 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's a different group.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONR2. So the structure would be HCO-NR2 where R is a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. Wait, no: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be HCON-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the structure is HCO-N-Ph-OCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Because formamide is HCONH2, replacing one H with a 4-ethoxyphenyl would give HCON(Ph-OCH2CH3)H. So the formula: 4-ethoxyphenyl is C8H9O2, plus HCONH would add another (CO has one O, but wait... Maybe I should recount.

Alternatively, perhaps it's HCO-N-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's see: 4-ethoxyphenyl is C8H9O2 (since benzene is C6H5, but with OCH2CH3, so C6H5-O-CH2CH3 is C8H9O2?), wait no. Benzene is C6H5-, OCH2CH3 is C2H5O. So 4-ethoxyphenyl is C8H9O? Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the molecular formula for each option.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph-4. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4-4. The formula would be C9H13N O2. Wait, our compound is C9H11NO2. So that would have more hydrogens. So perhaps option C is out
