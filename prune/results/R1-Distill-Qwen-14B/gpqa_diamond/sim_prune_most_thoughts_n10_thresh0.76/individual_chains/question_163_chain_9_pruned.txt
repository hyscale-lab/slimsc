Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about dissolving a certain amount of Fe(OH)3 using a strong acid and figuring out the minimum volume needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, which is a weak base. So dissolving it in a strong acid should cause a neutralization reaction. The acid will donate protons, and the base will accept them, producing water and some kind of salt. Oh right, when a metal hydroxide reacts with a strong acid, it forms the corresponding salt and water. So Fe(OH)3 reacting with an acid like HCl would give FeCl3 and water.

Wait, but Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so it's insoluble in water. That's why we need an acid to dissolve it. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So the H+ ions from the acid will react with the OH- ions from Fe(OH)3.

So the first step is to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass given is 0.1 grams. Let me calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH is 17.01 g/mol, and there are three of them. So 55.85 + 3*(17.01) = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol.

Molar mass = 106.88 g/mol. So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol. Let me compute that. 0.1 / 106.88 is approximately 0.0009357 mol. Wait, that's about 9.357e-4 moles.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ because of the neutralization equation I wrote earlier. So for 1 mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of H+. So for 9.357e-4 mol, H+ needed is 3 * 9.357e-4 = 0.002807 mol.

The acid provided is 0.1 M, which means 0.1 moles per liter. Since we need 0.002807 moles of H+, the volume required is moles divided by concentration. So volume V = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 liters, which is 28.07 cm³. Wait, but wait—the solution's total volume is 100 cm³. Hmm, does that affect the calculation?

Wait, let me think again. The
