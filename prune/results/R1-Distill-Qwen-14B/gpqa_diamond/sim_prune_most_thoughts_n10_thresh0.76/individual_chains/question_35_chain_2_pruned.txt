Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. It's represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay which satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So let me write that out.

So S matrix is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

And c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

Wait, the eigenvalues of Ay are the same as c times the eigenvalues of S, right? Because if you have an operator that's a scalar multiple of another operator, their eigenvalues are scaled by that scalar.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of S. How do I find the eigenvalues of a matrix? Oh right, by solving the characteristic equation det(S - λI) = 0.

So the matrix S minus λI would be:

[ -λ   -i ]
[ i    -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i)(i) = λ² - (i²). Since i² is -1, it becomes λ² - (-1) = λ² +1. So the equation is λ² + 1 = 0.

Solving that, λ² = -1. So λ can be i or -i. Wait, that's the eigenvalues for S. So the eigenvalues for Ay would be c times these, so (h/(4π)) * i and (h/(4π)) * (-i).

Wait, but the eigenvalues of Ay would be purely imaginary? So their real parts are zero, and the imaginary parts are ± h/(4π). So looking at the options, let's see.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and the real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the imaginary parts here would be h/(4π) and the real parts are zero
