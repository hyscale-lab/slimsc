Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is correct. Let's see.

The question says that the state |3,0,0> decays to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. So it's a two-step process. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions happen between energy levels, and each transition is governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules again? Oh right, for dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh, but wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>. So l is 0 for the initial state. Because the notation is |n, l, m>, so l is 0 here. That means when it undergoes a transition, it can only go to l=1 or l=-1, but since l can't be negative, the first transition must be to l=1.

So the first transition from l=0 to l=1. So the possible m values for the transition would be from m=0 to m=0, ±1. So the intermediate state would be |something, 1, m>, where m can be -1, 0, or +1.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>. So when it transitions, n must change as well. But for the first transition, n goes from 3 to something lower. Let's think, since it's a dipole transition, Δn can be ±1. Wait, no, wait: for hydrogen, the selection rules are more about the change in l, but for n, I think Δn can be any as long as the other rules are satisfied. Wait, no, for dipole transitions, the selection rule is Δl = ±1, and Δn is generally not restricted, but in practice, transitions are allowed as long as l changes by ±1. But wait, in hydrogen, the energy levels are determined by n, so the transitions will go from a higher n to a lower n, but what about the exact change?

Wait, the initial state is 3,0,0. To go to 1,0,0, but via two steps. So the first step must take it to a state with n=2 or n=1. But since it's a dip
