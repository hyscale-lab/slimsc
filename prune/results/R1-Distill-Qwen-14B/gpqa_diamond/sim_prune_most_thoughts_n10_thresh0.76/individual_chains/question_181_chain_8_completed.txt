Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. I remember that the Sun's energy production is mainly through the proton-proton (pp) chain, and there are different branches. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Oh wait, the pp-III branch is one of the branches in the pp chain. So, if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino production?

Hmm, neutrinos are produced in certain steps of the pp chain. I think the main neutrinos come from the decay of boron-8, which is a key product in the pp chain. Let me recall: The pp chain starts with two protons (hydrogen nuclei) fusing. They form a deuterium, then another proton adds to make tritium, which is unstable, so it emits a positron and a neutrino to become helium-3. Then, these helium-3 nuclei can fuse in different ways. One of the branches is the pp-III, which I think involves the fusion of two helium-3 into helium-4, releasing two protons.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing this up. The pp-I branch might involve two helium-3 fusing to make helium-4, emitting two protons. The pp-II is when a helium-3 captures a helium-4 to make helium-7, but that's unstable, so it captures another helium-4 to form helium-8, which then splits into two helium-4 nuclei. But I'm a bit confused about the details. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is when a helium-3 captures a proton to form boron-8, which then decays into a helium-4 and emits a positron and a neutrino. Oh, right, the boron-8 decay is a big source of neutrinos.

So, the pp-III branch is probably the one where you have a proton adding to helium-3 to make boron-8. When that happens, boron-8 has a half-life (I think about 17 seconds) and decays into helium-4, a positron, and a neutrino. So, the neutrinos from boron-8 decay are called B-8 neutrinos, and I believe they're the most abundant solar neutrinos.

Now, the question is about the flux ratio of two neutrino bands. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So the ratio is F1/F2.

If the pp-III branch stops, that means the production of B-8 neutrinos would stop. But wait, the question says the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. So, I need to think about the flux in each of these bands. 

Wait, neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, so the time it takes for a neutrino to reach Earth from the Sun is about 8 minutes. So, if the pp-III process stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would have just barely arrived on Earth. But wait, no, because neutrinos are produced continuously. If the process stops, the production of new neutrinos would stop, but the existing ones in transit would still arrive. Hmm, but the question is about the flux now. So, the flux is the number per cm² per second arriving now.

So, if the pp-III stops 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos emitted in the last 8.5 minutes are still on their way. But neutrino emission is a continuous process, so the flux would depend on whether the production has stopped or not.

Wait, but neutrinos are being produced continuously. If the pp-III branch was producing neutrinos, and suddenly stops, the flux would drop. But the question is about the ratio of two bands. So, perhaps the ratio is determined by the energy spectra of the neutrinos.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the flux from B-8 neutrinos. The B-8 neutrinos have a certain energy spectrum. I remember that the B-8 neutrinos have energies around 4 MeV, but their energies are spread out. The neutrinos from other processes, like the pep (proton-electron-proton) reaction, have lower energies, around 1-2 MeV, but I think that's less relevant here because the question is about the pp-III branch stopping.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio between two specific energy bands. So, if the pp-III branch contributes more to certain energy bands than others, then stopping it would change the flux in those bands.

Wait, so B-8 neutrinos have a spectrum peaking at about 4 MeV. So, their energies are higher than 4 MeV, but the question's bands are 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. Wait, wait a second. 700 keV is 0.7 MeV. That's way lower than the typical B-8 neutrino energies. B-8 neutrinos are in the MeV range, so 0.7 MeV is lower than that. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the neutrino types. Oh wait, perhaps the question isn't about the B-8 neutrinos. Alternatively, perhaps the other neutrinos are from different sources. Wait, the main solar neutrinos are from B-8, but the others are from the pep reaction and CNO cycle, which is less significant in the Sun.

Wait, but the Sun's main source is the pp chain, which produces B-8 neutrinos. So, the neutrinos from the pp chain. So, if the pp-III branch stops, which of these neutrinos are affected?

Wait, the pp-III branch produces B-8, which decays into a neutrino. So, if the pp-III stops, then B-8 production stops, meaning that the B-8 neutrinos will no longer be produced. So, the flux of B-8 neutrinos would drop to zero (assuming the process stops completely, which is the scenario here). But wait, the flux isn't zero because the neutrinos that were already emitted are still traveling towards us. But the question is about the flux now, which is the rate. So, if the production stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the rate (flux) of B-8 neutrinos would have stopped. So the neutrinos from pp-III are no longer being produced, so their flux would drop.

But wait, the other neutrino sources in the Sun would still be active. So, for example, the CNO cycle produces neutrinos as well. But the CNO cycle is a minor contributor in the Sun because the Sun is not massive enough for that to be the dominant process. So, the majority of neutrinos are from the B-8 decay.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the B-8 neutrino flux would stop, but the other neutrinos (like from the CNO cycle or the pep reaction) would continue. But the question is about the ratio between two bands in the neutrino flux.

Wait, but the question's bands are 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. These are in the lower energy range. B-8 neutrinos are in higher energy, so perhaps the main source of neutrinos in these lower bands is the pep reaction.

Wait, the pep reaction produces lower energy neutrinos. So, the pep neutrinos have energies around 1.4 MeV, I think. The B-8 neutrinos have higher energies, around 4 MeV on average. So, if the pp-III branch stops, then the B-8 neutrinos stop, but the pep neutrinos continue.

But the question is about the flux in two specific bands: 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV). So, these are lower than the typical B-8 neutrino energies. The pep neutrinos are about 1.4 MeV, which is higher than 0.9 MeV. So, how about the lower energy neutrinos?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Are there any other neutrino sources contributing to these bands? I'm starting to get a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the neutrinos from the decay of other isotopes. Wait, but B-8 decays into He-4, a positron, and a neutrino. So, the neutrinos from the B-8 decay are the main ones in the Sun. Oh, but the question is about the flux of neutrinos, so it's the number of neutrinos, regardless of their flavor. Also, note the note says that flavor changes don't play a role here, so we don't have to consider oscillations affecting the flux.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch stops, the production of B-8 stops. So, the flux of B-8 neutrinos would drop. But these have higher energy. The lower energy neutrinos, like from the pep reaction, would continue.

Wait, but the pep reaction is part of the pp chain as well, isn't it? So, if the pp-III branch stops, does that affect the overall pp chain? Because the pp chain is a series of reactions. Hmm, no, I think the different branches are somewhat separate. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III are different pathways. So, stopping the pp-III branch would only stop the B-8 production, but the other branches (like pp-I and pp-II) would continue, producing other isotopes, but not B-8.

Wait, but the main neutrino source is B-8. So, if the pp-III stops, the B-8 production stops. So, the flux of B-8 neutrinos would drop. So, the neutrinos in the 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV bands would be less affected, assuming that the B-8 neutrinos are not in these energy ranges. But wait, I thought B-8 neutrinos are around 4 MeV, so 0.7 MeV is much lower.

But wait, let me think about the neutrino energy spectrum. The B-8 decay emits a neutrino with an energy around 4 MeV, but the neutrino's energy can vary from zero up to about 4.2 MeV because the neutrino is emitted in the decay of B-8 (which has a mass of about 8.01 MeV) into He-4 (about 4.00 MeV). So, the maximum energy is around 4.2 MeV, but the average is around 4 MeV. So, the B-8 neutrinos have higher energies than the bands given in the question.

The pep reaction, on the other hand, produces neutrinos with lower energies. The pep reaction is another branch of the pp chain. In the pep reaction, a proton captures a positron and a neutrino is emitted. Wait, no, the reaction is p + e+ → p + e+? No, I think the pep reaction is two protons and an electron, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, the pep reaction is the process where a proton captures an electron, turning into a neutron, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the reaction is p + p + e− → 2p + e− + ν̄_e? Wait, maybe I should look into the specifics, but since I can't access information, I'll have to go from memory.

The pep reaction is a part of the pp chain and emits a neutrino. The neutrino energy from the pep reaction is lower than the B-8 neutrinos. I think the average energy is around 1.4 MeV. So, the B-8 neutrinos are higher energy, and the pep neutrinos are lower.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, then the B-8 neutrinos stop, but the pep neutrinos continue. So, the question's bands are 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV, which is 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV.

Wait, 0.7 MeV is lower than the pep neutrino energy. So, perhaps the neutrinos in these bands are from the pep reaction. But wait, the pep neutrinos are about 1.4 MeV. So, 0.7 MeV is much lower. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the B-8 neutrinos or the pep neutrinos, but about some other process that emits lower-energy neutrinos. But I don't recall other significant sources in the Sun. The CNO cycle produces neutrinos, but their energies are higher, I think.

Wait, another possibility: the neutrinos in those lower energy bands could be from the decay of heavier isotopes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the neutrino energy spectrum from the B-8 decay. The B-8 neutrinos have a spectrum that extends down to lower energies, but the majority are around 4 MeV. So, the fraction of B-8 neutrinos with energy less than 1 MeV is probably very small. So, if the pp-III branch stops, the number of neutrinos in those lower energy bands would drop, but the pep neutrinos might not contribute much to those bands either, as they are higher.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the problem again. The question is about the flux ratio between two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, it's the number of neutrinos per cm² per second in each band.

If the pp-III branch stops, which neutrinos are affected? The B-8 neutrinos, which have higher energies. So, the lower energy bands (like 0.7-0.9 MeV) would be affected less if the B-8 neutrinos are not part of that.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch is stopped, the production of B-8 stops, so the flux of B-8 neutrinos would drop. But the other neutrino sources (like the pep reaction and CNO cycle) would continue. So, the neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range would be coming from the remaining sources.

But I'm not sure if the pep neutrinos contribute to those lower energy bands. Let me think: pep neutrinos have energies around 1.4 MeV, so the 0.7-0.9 MeV band is lower than that. So, perhaps the majority of neutrinos in those bands are from the B-8 decay. But wait, if the B-8 neutrinos are mostly around 4 MeV, then their contribution to the 0.7-0.9 MeV band would be very small. So, the flux in those bands would be dominated by other sources.

Wait, but maybe the B-8 neutrinos have a small tail at lower energies. So, if the B-8 neutrinos stop, the flux in those lower bands would drop, but not to zero. But since the B-8 neutrinos are the main source, perhaps the flux in the lower bands is mainly from B-8, but their contribution is minimal because their energies are higher.

So, if the B-8 neutrinos stop, then the flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands would decrease, but not as much as the higher energy bands. But the question is about the ratio between the two bands. So, what's the ratio before and after the pp-III stops?

Wait, the question says that the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago. So, the neutrinos from the pp-III are no longer being produced, but the remaining sources (pep, CNO) are still active. So, the neutrino flux in the lower energy bands would be from the remaining sources, which are less in number.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to visualize the neutrino spectra.

- B-8 neutrinos: peak around 4 MeV, with a tail going down to 0 MeV, but most are around 4 MeV. The number of B-8 neutrinos with energies below 1 MeV is a small fraction.

- pep neutrinos: around 1.4 MeV, so their flux is in the 1-2 MeV range.

So, for the bands 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV, the main source would be the B-8 neutrinos with low energy, but they're a small fraction. So, if pp-III stops, that small fraction drops to zero. So, the flux in those bands would be significantly reduced.

But what about the higher band, 0.8-0.9 MeV? Are there any sources contributing there?

Wait, perhaps the CNO cycle neutrinos might contribute at higher energies, but I think they are higher than 1 MeV. So, the CNO neutrinos might be in the 1-10 MeV range.

So, in the scenario where the pp-III stops, the B-8 neutrinos stop. So, the flux in the lower bands (like 0.7-0.8 MeV) would have no contribution from B-8 or pep or CNO, but wait, no. Wait, the pep neutrinos contribute around 1.4 MeV, which is higher than 0.9 MeV. So, after the pp-III stops, the only neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range would be from the CNO cycle, but I'm not sure if that's a significant amount.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in both bands would decrease, but the lower band (0.7-0.8) is more affected because it's even lower than the pep neutrino energies.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the ratio. Before the pp-III stops, the flux in both bands is dominated by B-8 neutrinos. So, the flux ratio would depend on how many B-8 neutrinos are in each band. But if the B-8 neutrinos have a higher flux in higher energy bands, then their contribution to band 1 (700-800 keV) would be less than band 2 (800-900 keV).

Wait, but B-8 neutrinos' flux peaks at higher energies. So, in band 2 (800-900 keV), the B-8 neutrinos are just starting to contribute more, while in band 1, they are less. Hmm, but wait, 900 keV is 0.9 MeV, which is still way below the B-8 peak. So, maybe the B-8 neutrinos contribute a negligible amount to both bands. So, if the pp-III stops, the flux from B-8 stops, but the other neutrino sources (like pep and CNO) might contribute to these bands, but perhaps their contribution is minimal or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrino flux in these bands comes mainly from the B-8 decay, which is stopped, so the flux drops. But if the B-8 neutrinos are the main contributors to both bands, then the ratio would be determined by the B-8 distribution.

But wait, the B-8 neutrinos are at higher energies. If the question's bands are both below B-8's average energy, then the B-8 contribution to those bands would be small, but not zero. So, if the B-8 neutrinos stop, the flux in both bands would decrease, but the fraction in each band would depend on their energy distribution.

But without knowing the exact energy spectrum, it's challenging. Alternatively, perhaps the question is based on the fact that the pp-III branch produces neutrinos with a certain energy distribution, and stopping it would stop a significant part of the neutrino flux in certain bands.

Wait, another approach: the number of neutrinos produced by the pp-III branch. Since the pp-III is a branch in the pp chain, if it stops, the overall rate of B-8 production stops. The B-8 neutrinos are the most numerous, about 90% of all solar neutrinos. So, if the pp-III stops, the B-8 neutrinos stop, so the flux from B-8 would drop, but the other neutrinos (like from the CNO cycle) would remain.

But the CNO neutrinos are a small fraction of the total, so their contribution to the flux in these bands would be minimal. So, if the pp-III stops, the total neutrino flux from the Sun would drop by about 90%, but the flux in each band would depend on which neutrino sources contribute to them.

But in this case, the bands in question are 0.7-0.9 MeV. Since B-8 neutrinos are around 4 MeV, the CNO neutrinos are higher, and the pep neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV. So, the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands are in between the pep and B-8. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the majority of the neutrinos in these bands come from the B-8 decay, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps these bands are in a region where B-8 neutrinos contribute more, so stopping them would reduce the flux in both bands, but perhaps the lower band (0.7-0.8) is less affected than the higher band (0.8-0.9), because the B-8 neutrinos have a higher flux at higher energies.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the neutrino energy spectrum from B-8 is such that the flux increases with energy up to about 4 MeV. So, the 0.8-0.9 MeV band would have more B-8 neutrinos than the 0.7-0.8 band.

But in reality, the B-8 neutrino flux peaks around 4 MeV, so at 0.8 MeV, the flux would be much lower than at 4 MeV. So, perhaps the B-8 neutrinos contribute more to the higher band (800-900 keV) than to the lower (700-800 keV). Therefore, when the pp-III stops, the flux in the higher band (band 2) drops more than the lower band (band 1), leading to a higher ratio of flux1/flux2.

Wait, no, because if the B-8 neutrinos contribute more to band 2 than band 1, then stopping the pp-III would cause a larger decrease in band 2's flux than band 1's. So, the ratio F1/F2 would increase.

But I'm getting a bit tangled. Let's think in terms of the energy spectrum. The B-8 neutrinos have a distribution where higher energies are more common. So, in band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV), the number of B-8 neutrinos is higher than in band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV), but both are much lower than the peak around 4 MeV.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, both bands' fluxes decrease, but band 2's flux decreases more than band 1's because B-8 neutrinos contribute more to band 2. Therefore, F1/F2 would be greater than 1. So, the ratio would be higher than 1.

But looking at the options, option C is 1, D is 0.1, A is 10.

Wait, but if B-8 neutrinos are the main contributors to both bands, the ratio F1/F2 would be determined by the relative contributions of B-8 neutrinos in each band. Since the B-8 distribution peaks at 4 MeV, the number of neutrinos in band 2 (higher within the low MeV range) is higher than in band 1. So, F2 is higher than F1. So, F1/F2 would be less than 1.

Wait, but that depends on the exact shape of the spectrum. Let's imagine a simple case where the spectrum is flat, but that's not the case. The B-8 spectrum falls off exponentially as energy increases, I believe. So, higher energies have lower flux.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the B-8 neutrinos have a distribution where the flux decreases with increasing energy because the maximum energy is about 4.2 MeV, and the average is around 4 MeV. So, the flux (number of neutrinos per energy interval) would be higher at lower energies within the B-8 spectrum than at higher energies.

Wait, that's not correct. The flux per unit energy is higher at lower energies because the number of neutrinos with energy just below 4 MeV is higher than those just above.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the number of neutrinos emitted with energy E is given by the B-8 decay spectrum, which is a function f(E) = something like (dN/dE) proportional to E^2 * exponential(-E/E0), with E0 around 4 MeV.

So, the number of neutrinos in each band depends on the integral of f(E) over the band. So, higher E bands would have fewer neutrinos, assuming E0 is around 4 MeV.

So, for band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV): very low E, so the neutrino count is proportional to the integral over that range.

Similarly, band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV): the next higher E, so the integral would be a bit higher than band 1 but much lower than the peak.

Wait, but in reality, since 0.7-0.9 MeV is much lower than the peak at 4 MeV, the flux in both bands is dominated by the B-8 neutrinos at those low energies. So, the contribution from B-8 to band 1 is less than to band 2, but both are much less than the peak.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the B-8 neutrinos contribute very little to both bands, and the main source is the pep reaction, which produces neutrinos around 1.4 MeV. But then, the pep neutrinos are higher than the given bands, so they don't contribute much.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range is primarily from the B-8 neutrinos, but the exact contribution needs to be considered.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the flux from B-8 neutrinos would stop, so the flux in both bands would drop, but the ratio depends on whether band 1 or band 2 had a higher dependence on B-8.

But without exact data, it's hard. However, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped, so the B-8 neutrinos are no longer produced. The B-8 neutrinos are the main source of solar neutrinos, so their absence would cause a significant drop in the overall flux.

But the bands in the question are in the lower energy range, so perhaps the B-8 neutrinos contribute more to higher energies, so their absence would cause the flux in higher energy bands (like 0.8-0.9 MeV) to drop more than the lower ones (0.7-0.8 MeV). So, F1 (lower band) would have a higher flux relative to F2 (higher band) after the B-8 neutrinos stop. So, the ratio F1/F2 would be greater than 1.

For example, if F1 is 10 and F2 is 1, the ratio is 10. So, option A is 10.

But wait, another thought: if the B-8 neutrinos are the main source of flux in all bands, including these, then stopping them would reduce the flux in all bands. So, the ratio of F1 to F2 would depend on the relative contributions of B-8 to each band.

If the B-8 neutrinos have a higher flux in band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) than in band 1, then when they stop, F2 drops more, making F1/F2 larger.

But without knowing exactly, I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the flux in these bands is dominated by other sources, so the ratio doesn't change much. But the question says that the pp-III stopped, which produces B-8 neutrinos. So, if the B-8 neutrinos are the main contributors, then their removal would significantly affect the flux.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio. If the B-8 neutrinos contribute more to band 2 than band 1, then after stopping, F2 drops more, leading to F1/F2 being higher than 1. If the ratio was 1 before, now it's higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the B-8 neutrinos contribute a similar amount to both bands, so the ratio remains about the same. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let's think about the spectrum of B-8 neutrinos. The energy spectrum of B-8 neutrinos is such that the number of neutrinos decreases with increasing energy. So, the number in 0.7-0.8 MeV is higher than in 0.8-0.9 MeV. Because as you go to higher energies, the distribution drops.

Wait, but wait: the distribution might peak at lower energies? No, the B-8 neutrinos have a peak at around 4 MeV, so the lower energies (0.7-0.9 MeV) are on the far left of the distribution. So, the number of neutrinos in 0.7-0.8 MeV would be less than those in 0.8-0.9 MeV? Or the other way around?

No, wait, as E increases from 0 to 4 MeV, the number of neutrinos decreases. So, the number in 0.7-0.8 is higher than in 0.8-0.9.

Wait, no, think about it more carefully. Let's model the B-8 neutrino spectrum as a function f(E) which decreases with E. So, the number in a band is proportional to the integral of f(E) over that band.

If f(E) is higher at lower E within the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, then the integral for band 1 (0.7-0.8) would be higher than for band 2 (0.8-0.9). So, F1 > F2, so F1/F2 >1.

But I'm not certain about the shape of f(E). The B-8 neutrino spectrum is a beta spectrum, which is a continuous spectrum with a peak near the maximum energy. Wait, no, the maximum energy is 4.2 MeV, but the average is around 4 MeV. The number of neutrinos at lower energies is actually higher because the beta spectrum for B-8 decay has a shape where the number of neutrinos decreases with energy. So, more neutrinos have lower energies than higher ones.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The beta spectrum for B-8 decay has a shape where the number of neutrinos peaks at lower energies and then drops off. Wait, no, actually, the beta spectrum for a decay with Q-value Q has a shape where the number of neutrinos with energy E is proportional to E^2 * exp(-E/(Q-E)), where Q is the maximum energy. So, the number of neutrinos increases with E up to a point and then decreases.

Wait, but for B-8, the maximum neutrino energy is about 4.2 MeV. So, the spectrum rises from E=0 to a maximum, then falls off. The exact shape depends on the details, but generally, the number of neutrinos increases as E approaches the maximum.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think: the number of neutrinos with energy E is given by the beta distribution function. For the decay B-8 → He-4 + e+ + νe, the neutrino energy Eν is given by Eν = (Q - Eβ), where Q is the Q-value of the decay (about 4.22 MeV), and Eβ is the energy of the beta particle.

The number of neutrinos with energy Eν is proportional to the square of the beta particle's energy (Eβ)^2, times the density of states.

So, the number of neutrinos dN/dEν is proportional to (Eν)^2 * exp(- (Q - Eν)/Δ), where Δ is a small energy width (due to the uncertainty principle).

So, the function increases with Eν, reaches a maximum, then decreases. The maximum is around Eν ≈ (2/3) Q, which for Q=4.2 MeV would be around 2.8 MeV. So, the neutrino flux peaks around that energy.

So, at Eν=0.7 MeV, the function is rising. At Eν=0.8, it's still rising. At Eν=0.9, maybe the function is still rising but perhaps starting to flatten.

Wait, but 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 MeV are all well below the peak at ~2.8 MeV. So, the function is still increasing in this range.

So, the number of neutrinos in band 1 (0.7-0.8) would be less than in band 2 (0.8-0.9), because the function is increasing. So, F2 > F1. Therefore, F1/F2 < 1.

But if the pp-III branch stops, the B-8 neutrinos stop, so the flux in both bands would drop. But the question is about the ratio now.

Wait, but the B-8 neutrinos contribute to both bands. So, if the B-8 neutrinos are the main source, and their flux in band 2 is higher than in band 1, then stopping them would cause F2 to drop more than F1. So, the ratio F1/F2 would increase.

For example, if F1 and F2 were both 100 before the stop, and after the stop, F1 is 10 and F2 is 10, the ratio remains 1. But if F1 was 50 and F2 was 100 (so F1/F2 = 0.5), then after the B-8 stops, F1 becomes 5 and F2 becomes 10 (if other sources contribute 10% each), then F1/F2 is 0.5 again. Hmm, that doesn't change.

But in reality, other sources (like pep and CNO) contribute to these bands as well, but their contributions are much smaller. So, the B-8 neutrinos are the main contributors.

So, the ratio before stopping would be F1/F2 = (number in 0.7-0.8 from B-8) / (number in 0.8-0.9 from B-8). Since the function is increasing, the number in 0.8-0.9 is higher, so F1/F2 < 1.

After the B-8 stops, the flux from B-8 is zero, but the other sources (pep, CNO) might contribute a small amount. However, the pep neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV, so their contribution to these bands is minimal. The same for CNO.

Therefore, after the stop, the flux in both bands is almost zero, but perhaps dominated by other sources. But since the question is about the ratio, the ratio would change based on the relative contributions of these other sources.

But without knowing the exact contributions, perhaps the ratio remains roughly the same, leading to option C (1). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the neutrino flux in these bands is mainly from the B-8 decay. So, if the B-8 stops, the flux in both bands drops. But the ratio of the two bands would depend on their relative contributions from B-8. Since B-8's contribution to band 2 is higher, the flux in band 2 would drop more than in band 1. So, F1/F2 increases.

But I'm not sure by how much. The question asks for the approximate ratio. The options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

If the B-8 contribution to band 2 is about twice that of band 1, then F1/F2 would be about 0.5. But that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the B-8 contribution to band 2 is negligible compared to band 1, but that's not the case since the function is increasing.

Alternatively, perhaps the B-8 neutrinos don't contribute significantly to these lower energy bands, so the ratio remains roughly the same.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about what happens when the pp-III stops. Since B-8 is a major source, the overall neutrino flux drops, but the question is about the ratio.

Wait, another angle: the pp-III branch is responsible for a certain fraction of the total neutrino flux. If it stops, that fraction is lost. The question is about how this affects the two bands.

If the B-8 neutrinos are the only ones contributing to the flux in these bands, and their distribution in band 2 is higher than band 1, then the flux in band 2 would drop more. So, the ratio F1/F2 would increase. Let's say if before the stop, F1 was 10 and F2 was 20 (so F1/F2=0.5), after the stop, F1 is 1 and F2 is 2 (assuming other sources contribute 10% each), then the ratio is still 0.5. Hmm, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is suggesting that the pp-III branch contributes more to the lower energy band (700-800 keV) than to the higher (800-900 keV), so when it stops, the flux in band 1 drops more, leading to a lower ratio.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. If the pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos and stops, the lower energy bands (like 700-800) would be less affected, while the higher energy bands (like 800-900) would have a higher flux drop. But wait, 800-900 is still lower than 4 MeV, the B-8 peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in the 700-800 keV band is dominated by the B-8 neutrinos, while the 800-900 is as well. So, stopping them would cause both fluxes to drop by the same proportion, keeping the ratio the same.

But if the B-8 neutrinos contribute more to band 2, the ratio would be lower than 1. If the pp-III stops, band 2's flux drops more, leading to a higher ratio.

But without knowing the exact contributions, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio remains about the same, so the answer is C) 1.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: the neutrino flux from the Sun is dominated by the B-8 neutrinos, which have a higher energy (around 4 MeV), so their contribution to the lower energy bands (0.7-0.9 MeV) is minimal. Therefore, the flux in these bands is not significantly affected by the stopping of the pp-III branch. So, the flux ratio remains approximately the same, leading to option C) 1.

But that doesn't quite make sense because B-8 neutrinos do have a small contribution to these lower bands.

Alternatively, maybe the flux in these bands is dominated by other sources, so the ratio doesn't change much. So, the answer is C) 1.

But I'm not certain. Another thought: if the pp-III branch is stopped, but the other branches (I and II) continue, perhaps they contribute to the same neutrino flux, but not as much. So, the overall flux would decrease, but the ratio would depend on the energy distribution of the remaining neutrinos.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is the only source of neutrinos in these bands, so stopping it would cause the flux to drop to zero for both bands. But that would make the ratio undefined or zero, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in band 1 is higher because the neutrinos have lower energy, and the B-8 neutrinos contribute more at lower energies than I thought. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the approximate energy spectrum of solar neutrinos. From what I remember, the B-8 neutrinos have a peak around 4 MeV, but there's a significant tail down to lower energies. The flux per unit energy is higher at the peak, but the total number below a certain energy depends on the integral.

So, the number of B-8 neutrinos with E < 1 MeV is a small fraction, but perhaps the ratio between the two bands is about the same. So, the flux ratio remains approximately the same after the pp-III stops, making the answer C) 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in band 2 is higher than band 1, so the ratio is less than 1.

But I'm not certain. Since I'm a bit stuck, perhaps the intended answer is C) 1, meaning the ratio doesn't change much because the B-8 neutrinos contribute similarly to both bands, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrino energies from the B-8 decay are higher than both bands, so the flux in both bands is negligible, making the ratio irrelevant. But that's not the case since the B-8 neutrinos do have a distribution extending down to lower energies.

Hmm. I think I'll have to make an educated guess here. Since the B-8 neutrinos contribute more to higher energies within their spectrum, the flux in band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) is higher than in band 1 (0.7-0.8). So, when the pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 drops more, leading to F1/F2 being greater than 1.

Looking at the options, option A is 10. So, perhaps the ratio increases to about 10.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the flux in both bands is dominated by the same source, so the ratio remains about the same, making option C correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the B-8 neutrinos contribute equally to both bands, so their stop doesn't change the ratio, leading to option C.

But without exact data, it's hard to say. I'll go with option D) 0.1, but I'm really not sure.

Wait, another approach. The number of neutrinos in each band is proportional to the integral of the B-8 spectrum over that band. The B-8 spectrum f(E) is higher at higher E within the lower MeV range. So, band 2 (0.8-0.9) has more B-8 neutrinos than band 1. So, the flux F2 is higher than F1. So, before stopping, F1/F2 < 1. After stopping, both F1 and F2 drop, but F2 drops more. So, the new F1/F2 would be higher than before.

If before stopping, F1/F2 was 0.5, and after stopping, F1 is 1 and F2 is 5 (assuming other sources contribute 1 each), the ratio becomes 0.2. So, F1/F2 is 0.2, which is 0.1 if the other sources contribute nothing. But that's not an exact option. The option B is 0.01, which is too low.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio is about 10, option A. So, I'll go with that.


The question involves analyzing the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) under the hypothetical scenario where the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing boron-8 (B-8), which decays into helium-4, a positron, and a neutrino. These B-8 neutrinos are the primary source of solar neutrinos, with energies typically around 4 MeV, but their energy spectrum extends down to much lower energies.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Sources and Energy Bands**:
   - The B-8 neutrinos have a spectrum peaking around 4 MeV, but they also contribute to lower energy bands, including the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV ranges. The flux in these bands is proportional to the integral of the B-8 neutrino spectrum over the respective energy intervals.
   - The B-8 neutrino spectrum increases with energy up to the peak around 4 MeV. Therefore, the flux in the 800-900 keV band (higher energy) is expected to be greater than that in the 700-800 keV band (lower energy).

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - If the pp-III branch stops, the production of B-8 neutrinos ceases, leading to a significant reduction in the flux of neutrinos across all energy bands, including the two bands in question.
   - The flux in the higher energy band (800-900 keV) is more affected because B-8 neutrinos contribute a larger fraction to this band compared to the lower energy band (700-800 keV). This results in a relative decrease in flux for the higher band, increasing the ratio of flux in the lower band to flux in the higher band.

3. **Flux Ratio Before and After the Stop**:
   - Before the pp-III branch stops, the flux ratio \( F_1 / F_2 \) (where \( F_1 \) is the flux in the 700-800 keV band and \( F_2 \) is the flux in the 800-900 keV band) is determined by the relative contributions of B-8 neutrinos to these bands. Since the B-8 spectrum increases with energy, \( F_2 > F_1 \), so \( F_1 / F_2 < 1 \).
   - After the pp-III branch stops, the flux from B-8 neutrinos drops to zero, and the remaining flux (from other sources like the pep reaction or CNO cycle) is negligible in these bands. The relative decrease in flux for the higher band (800-900 keV) leads to an increase in the ratio \( F_1 / F_2 \).

4. **Approximation of the Flux Ratio**:
   - Given the increase in the ratio \( F_1 / F_2 \) after the pp-III branch stops, and considering the significant contribution of B-8 neutrinos to both bands, the ratio is expected to increase to approximately 10. This aligns with the scenario where the flux in the higher band decreases more significantly than the flux in the lower band.

### Conclusion:
The approximate ratio of the flux between the two bands after the pp-III branch stops is **10**.
