Okay, I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about determining the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 to Planet1. Hmm, let's see what information I have.

The problem states that there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here; maybe it's just context.

The given data includes the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. Specifically, the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. Similarly, between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So, T1/T2 ≈ 1.4 and T2/T3 ≈ 2.3. Wait, actually, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula I remember is that equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L/(16πσd²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance. But since all planets orbit the same star, L and σ are the same for all, so T is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. So T ∝ 1/sqrt(d). 

Alternatively, the formula for equilibrium temperature can be written as Te = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d^2) ) ]^(1/4), where a is the albedo. Since the albedo is given as 0.3 for all planets, that term is constant for all, so it doesn't affect the ratios. So, T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d). Thus, the ratio of temperatures can help us find the ratio of the distances.

Wait, so for Planet1 and Planet2: T1/T2 = 1.4. Since T is inversely proportional to sqrt(d), T1 / T2 = sqrt(d2/d1). Wait, let me double-check that. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(d), so T1 = k / sqrt(d1), T2 = k / sqrt(d2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1). So yes, T1/T2 = sqrt
