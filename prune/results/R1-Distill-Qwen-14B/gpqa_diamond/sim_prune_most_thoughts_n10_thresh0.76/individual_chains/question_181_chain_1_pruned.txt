Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratios after a certain reaction stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino production, but let's try to think this through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for sunlight to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So the effect of stopping the pp-III branch would only be felt here on Earth after that time. But since the question is about the flux now, we're considering the situation after that time has passed.

So, neutrinos are produced in the Sun's core, right? And the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, which is the main source of solar energy. I remember that the pp-III branch involves the fusion of protons into helium-3, which then combines with other helium-3 nuclei to make helium-4. Wait, no, maybe I got that mixed up. Let me think. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, then in pp-II, two deuterons combine to form helium-3, and in pp-III, two helium-3 nuclei combine into helium-4, releasing two protons in the process. So the pp-III branch is a step in the proton-proton cycle.

Neutrinos are produced when a boron-8 nucleus decays into carbon-8, emitting a positron and a neutrino. I think that's part of the process. Oh wait, wait. So the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, called 7Be neutrinos, right? Or maybe not. Let me get this straight. The main neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos produced in the proton-proton chain, specifically in the step where boron-8 decays. Alternatively, there are other neutrinos from other processes, like the pep branch, but those are less significant.

So if the pp-III branch stops, then the production of certain neutrinos would stop. But wait, in the pp-III branch, the main neutrinos are from the decay of 7Be into 7Li plus a positron and a neutrino. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The 7Be is produced in the pp-II reactions,
