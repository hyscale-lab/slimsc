Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. Let me think about how to approach this.

The problem gives me the lifetime of X⁰ as τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The decay is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are different resolutions in meters.

Wait, so I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime due to time dilation. The formula for the lab frame lifetime τ is γ * τ₀, right? And γ is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²), since for a relativistic particle, energy E ≈ γ m c². 

So first, I should calculate the Lorentz factor γ. The mass m is given as 3.41 GeV. Wait, but I need to make sure about the units. Oh, right, since E is given in GeV and mass is also in GeV/c², when I write γ = E/(m c²), but wait, the units might complicate things. Let me think. Actually, in natural units where c=1, E (in GeV) equals γ m (in GeV) because m c² would be in GeV when m is in GeV/c². So actually, E = γ m, so γ = E/m. 

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The mass is 3.41 GeV/c². The energy is 27 GeV. So γ is E/mc², but with m in GeV/c². So E in GeV, m c² in GeV (because (GeV/c²) * c² = GeV). So E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²) → but since m is in GeV/c², m c² is in GeV. So yeah, γ = E/(m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV) ≈ 7.918. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41 is about 7.918, so γ ≈ 8.

So now, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀ = 8 * 8e-16 s = 64e-16 s. Because τ₀ is 8e-16 s.

Wait, no wait. τ₀ is 8e-16 s. So τ = γ * τ₀ = 8 * 8e-16 s = 6.4e-15 s? Wait, 8e-16 * 8 is 64e-16, which is 6.4e-15 s. Hmm.

But wait, how does this relate to the decay length? The decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. It's given
