Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the index of hydrogen deficiency for a certain product. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question says: What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?

Oh wait, red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus is used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, but wait, no, that's for halogenating alkynes. Alternatively, maybe it's about the reaction of alkenes with HI. Oh right, when alkenes react with HI, it's an addition reaction, typically via the acid-catalyzed mechanism, leading to the formation of a diiodide. But wait, the compound here has multiple double bonds, so maybe more than one reaction happens.

Wait, the compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to draw its structure mentally. So it's a cyclohexene ring. The substituents are at positions 2, 3, and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), position 3 is part of a double bond (since it's cyclohex-3-ene), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? No, wait. Wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH- attached. So 5-vinyl is a substituent on the cyclohexene ring at position 5, and that's a vinyl group (so another double bond).

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with double bonds at position 3 (cyclohex-3-ene) and a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂ with a double bond) at position 5. Also, the position 2 has a formyl group (CHO) and position 5 has the vinyl.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to sketch it out mentally. The cyclohexene ring has double bond between C3 and C4. Then, at C2, there's a formyl (CHO) group attached. At C5, there's a vinyl group. Vinyl is CH₂=CH–
