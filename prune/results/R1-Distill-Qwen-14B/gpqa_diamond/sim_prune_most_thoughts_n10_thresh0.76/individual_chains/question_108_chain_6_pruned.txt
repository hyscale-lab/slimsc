Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it step by step.

The question says we have a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis here. The value of B is 1 Tesla, which is a pretty strong magnetic field, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet. The problem mentions m, the orbital magnetic quantum number, with small values. So m is probably 0, 1, or something like that. 

Wait, the orbitals—so m is for the orbital angular momentum. The orbital magnetic quantum number can be from -l to +l in integer steps, where l is the azimuthal quantum number. But if m is small, maybe it's like m=0 or m=1. Not sure how that plays into the problem yet.

The main thing is to compare two terms: the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The paramagnetic term is presumably the energy due to the interaction between the magnetic field and some magnetic dipole moment. The transition energy is the energy difference between two atomic energy levels, which corresponds to a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh wait, that's the wavelength of the Balmer series in hydrogen, right? The Balmer-alpha line is about 0.486 micrometers. So that transition energy is the energy difference between the n=2 and n=3 levels, or wait no, no, Balmer series is transitions to n=2. Wait, Balmer-alpha is n=3 to n=2, which emits light in the visible range. So the wavelength given is 0.4861 μm, which is about 486 nm, which matches that.

So the transition energy ΔE is the energy of that photon. Let me calculate that first. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Let me plug in the numbers. h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is the speed of light, about 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861e-6 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) = let's compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divided by 0.4861e-6: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.088e-19 J. Wait, but wait, I think I should convert that into electron volts because energy levels in atoms are often discussed in eV. 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 4.088e-19 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV is approximately 2.55 eV. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit high because the Balmer-alpha transition is about 1.89 eV. Maybe I did a calculation mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm. Let me compute hc/lambda. hc is 1240 eV·nm (since 1240 eV·nm is approximately hc in eV and nanometers). So 1240 / 486.1 ≈ about 2.548 eV. Oh, wait, but I thought Balmer-alpha is about 1.89 eV. Hmm, maybe I got the wavelength wrong. Oh wait, the Balmer-alpha is 656 nm (red light), but Balmer-beta is 486 nm (blue-green). Oh right, so the 486 nm line is from n=4 to n=2. So the energy difference would be higher than the Balmer-alpha. Let me compute the exact energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should leave the exact value for now and just know that ΔE is about 2.5 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism arises from the interaction between the magnetic moments of electrons and an external magnetic field. The energy of this interaction is given by the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * (e/(2m)) * l, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, but for electrons, I think the formula is μ = -g_s * (μ_B) * m_s, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, for an electron, the magnetic moment due to spin is μ = -g_s μ_B m_s, and for orbital angular momentum, it's μ = g_l μ_B m_l, where g_l is the orbital g-factor, approximately 1. So in this problem, since it's about the paramagnetic coupling, perhaps we're considering the orbital contribution. So the energy term would be H = μ · B, so it's proportional to m times B, times some constants.

The Bohr magneton μ_B is about 9.274e-24 J/T. So the energy from the Zeeman effect is E = μ·B = μ_B * m * B. Wait, no, wait. The magnetic dipole moment μ is proportional to m, the magnetic quantum number. So for orbital angular momentum, μ = g_l μ_B m_l. Since the field is along Oz, the direction is along z, so the energy is E = -μ·B = -g_l μ_B m B.

But wait, in this problem, what exactly is the paramagnetic coupling term? Paramagnetism arises from the spin magnetic moments, but sometimes in atoms, the orbital contribution can also be considered. But for hydrogen, the ground state has l=0, so m=0. But higher states have l>0. Wait, the question says small m, so perhaps m is 0 or 1.

Wait, the paramagnetic term for the hydrogen atom would be due to both spin and orbital contributions. However, in the ground state (n=1), l=0, so the orbital contribution is zero. So the paramagnetic coupling would come from the spin. The spin magnetic quantum number s is 1/2, so m_s can be ±1/2.

Wait, but the question is about orbital m, not spin. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "for a magnetic field B parallel to Oz, with small values of m (orbital magnetic quantum number) and B=1T, compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE of Hydrogen atom..."

Ah, so m is the orbital magnetic quantum number m_l. So the paramagnetic term arises from the orbital magnetic moment. So in this case, the energy is given by the orbital Zeeman effect. H = - μ_l · B, where μ_l is the orbital magnetic moment.

μ_l = g_l μ_B m_l. The orbital g-factor g_l is approximately 1 for electrons. So H = - g_l μ
