Okay, so I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, so that shouldn't complicate things too much. Let me think about what I know about equilibrium temperature.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. The formula, if I recall correctly, is something like T = T_star * ( (L_star / (16πσ d²) )^0.25 ), but wait, maybe there's a simpler way to express the ratio when L and albedo are the same.

Oh right, the equilibrium temperature should scale with ( (L) / (16πσ d²) )^0.25. Since the albedo is the same for both planets, and assuming the star's luminosity is the same, the ratio of their temperatures will depend on the inverse square root of the square root of the ratio of their distances. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that mixed up.

Wait, let's write it down. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d²) ]^0.25. So when albedo a is the same, the ratio T4/T2 = [ (d2²) / (d4²) ]^0.25. Because L and a are same, so they cancel out.

So I just need the ratio of their distances squared, then take the square root again. So the ratio is (d2/d4)^0.5.

Wait wait, no. Wait, I think I got that right. Let's see. Let me write T4 = T2 * (d2/d4)^0.5. Because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d), because T is proportional to (1/d)^(1/2), since d squared in the denominator and then the 0.25 power. Let me clarify:

The formula is T = T_star * (L / (16πσ d²))^0.25. So T is proportional to (1/d²)^0.25 = 1/d^0.5. So T is inversely proportional to sqrt(d). So the ratio T4/T2 = (d2/d4)^0.5.

Right, so I need to find the ratio of the orbital periods, then find their distances based on Kepler's third law, which says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star). So P² ∝ d³.

But the planets are in orbital resonance, which means their orbital periods have a specific ratio. The given ratio is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 P2=2*P1, Planet_3 P3=2.5 P1, Planet_4 P4=3.5 P1, Planet_5 P5=5 P1.

Wait, no, the ratios are 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 5. So P1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 :5.

So P2 is 2 * P1, P4 is 3.5 * P1.

Using Kepler's law, P² ∝ d³. So d is proportional to P^(2/3).

So d2 = (P2)^(2/3) * some constant. Similarly, d4 = (P4)^(2/3) * same constant. Since the same star, the constant is the same.

So d2/d4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3).

Wait, so the ratio of the distances is (P2/P4)^(2/3).

So let me compute that. P2 = 2, P4 =3.5.

So P2/P4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4/7? Wait 2 divided by 3.5 is the same as 2/(7/2) = 4/7. So P2/P4 = 4/7.

So d2/d4 = (4/7)^(2/3).

Wait, but wait, the ratio d2/d4 is (P2/P4)^(2/3), because d ∝ P^(2/3). So yes.

So d2/d4 = (4/7)^(2/3).

Then T4/T2 = sqrt( d2/d4 ) = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) )

Hmm, wait. Because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d), so T4 = T2 * (d2/d4)^0.5.

Wait no, because T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(d4), T2 proportional to 1/sqrt(d2). So T4/T2 = (T2 * sqrt(d4) ) / (T2 * sqrt(d2) )) ? No, wait, T4 = k / sqrt(d4), T2 = k / sqrt(d2). So T4 / T2 = sqrt(d2) / sqrt(d4) = sqrt( d2/d4 ) .

So yes, the ratio T4/T2 is sqrt( d2/d4 ) = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) )

Wait, let me compute (4/7)^(2/3) first.

Alternatively, let's write it as (4/7)^(2/3) = ( (4/7)^(1/3) )^2.

So (4/7)^(1/3) is the cube root of 4/7. Let me approximate that. 4 is about 1.587 when cube-rooted (since 1.587^3 ≈ 4). 7 is about 1.913 when cube-rooted (1.913^3 ≈7). So 4/7's cube root is roughly 1.587 / 1.913 ≈ 0.829.

Then square that: (0.829)^2 ≈ 0.687.

So d2/d4 ≈ 0.687.

Then T4/T2 = sqrt(0.687) ≈ sqrt(0.687) ≈ 0.829.

Wait, but wait, let me check the math again.

Wait, I have T4/T2 = sqrt( d2/d4 )

d2/d4 is (P2/P4)^(2/3) → (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3).

Wait, let me compute 4/7 first. 4 divided by 7 is approximately 0.5714.

So (0.5714)^(2/3).

Hmm, what's 0.5714^(1/3) ?

I know that 0.7^3 is 0.343, 0.8^3 is 0.512. 0.82^3 ≈ 0.82 * 0.82 = 0.6724, *0.82 ≈ 0.551. So 0.5714 is close to that. So cube root of 0.5714 is around 0.83.

Wait, 0.83^3 = 0.83 *0.83=0.6889; *0.83 ≈ 0.571761. Oh wait, that's almost exactly 0.57176, which is very close to 4/7 (≈0.5714). So the cube root of 4/7 is approximately 0.83.

So 4/7 is 0.5714, and cube root is 0.83. Then (4/7)^(2/3) = (0.83)^2 = 0.6889.

So d2/d4 is 0.6889.

So sqrt(d2/d4) is sqrt(0.6889) ≈ 0.83.

So T4 / T2 = 0.83.

Wait, but I'm looking for the ratio between Planet 4 and Planet 2, so it's T4 / T2 = approximately 0.83. So the options are:

A) ~0.57

B) ~0.69

C) ~0.83

D) ~0.75

So the correct answer would be option C, ~0.83.

Wait, but let me think again. Oh wait wait! Because I'm calculating d2/d4, but the planets are in resonance with their periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_2 has a period of 2, Planet_4 has 3.5. So the ratio P2/P4 is 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

But wait, when we compute d2/d4, it's (P2/P4)^(2/3) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3) ≈ 0.6889.

Then sqrt(0.6889) is about 0.83, so T4 is 0.83 times T2. So the ratio is ~0.83, which is option C.

Wait another thing: the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So if d2 is smaller than d4, then T2 is higher than T4. So T4/T2 should be less than 1, which matches option C (~0.83). That makes sense, as Planet_4 is farther from the star than Planet_2, so it should be cooler, so the ratio of their temperatures (T4/T2) is less than 1. So 0.83 seems correct.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that equilibrium temperature \( T \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}} \), where \( d \) is the distance from the star. Since the planets have the same albedo and orbit the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their distances from the star.

Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto d^3 \), the distance \( d \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \). The orbital periods of the planets are given in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). For Planet_2 and Planet_4, their periods are \( P_2 = 2P_1 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \), respectively. Thus, the ratio of their distances is:

\[
\frac{d_2}{d_4} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

Approximating \( \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \), we compute \( \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3} \). The cube root of \( 0.5714 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \), and squaring this gives \( 0.6889 \). Therefore:

\[
\frac{d_2}{d_4} \approx 0.6889.
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio \( \frac{T_4}{T_2} \) is proportional to \( \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_4}} \), so:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_4}} = \sqrt{0.6889} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \). This corresponds to option C.
