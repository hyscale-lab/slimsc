Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one is correct based on the given information.

First, let's go through each piece of data provided.

1. **FTIR Spectrum:**
   - A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait—the peak is around 3000. O-H in alcohols is a broad peak usually around 3300 or so. Hmm, maybe it's an -OH group but perhaps in a less acidic environment. Or maybe it's an alcohol or phenol? Alternatively, maybe it's an N-H stretch, but the options don't include nitrogen. So probably an O-H. Another peak at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are in the region for carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1700 is a strong peak, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring (like conjugated carbonyl, like in a conjugated ketone) or maybe an amide, but again, no N in options. Alternatively, 1650 could be an absorption from conjugated double bonds, like in an aromatic ring with substituents. Wait, but 1650 is also near where C=O in an ester would be, but maybe lower. Wait, another thought—what if there are two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else. Wait, but 1650 can also be C=C in conjugation. For example, in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So, maybe a compound with a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe a ketone and another group. Hmm.

2. **1H NMR Spectrum:**
   - Several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in CH₂=CH-. So the compound has a double bond. That means it's either an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring. But given the FTIR shows a broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol or phenol. Wait, but if the NMR shows vinyl protons, it's more likely an alkene, unless it's an aromatic ring. But the options don't have benzene rings (since the formula is C6H12O, etc.), but wait, C6H12O2 could be something like a cyclic ester, perhaps with an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol with a double bond.

3. **Mass Spectrometry:**
   - A fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about possible fragments. 45 is a common mass. Let me think about some common ions. For example, CH3CO+ is 43, but maybe CH3COCH3 would produce something else. Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a CH₂=CH-O- group. Or perhaps it's the loss of a larger fragment. Alternatively, maybe a ketene ion? Wait, another thought: m/z 45 could correspond to (CH3)2CO+ (which is 58, no), wait, maybe CH3CO-O-R? No, wait. Alternatively, think of what has a mass of 45. Let me calculate: 45 is the sum of protons and neutrons. So, the molecular formula of the fragment would have a molecular weight of 45. Let's see: 45 could be C3H7O, but wait, C3H7O is 3*12 +7 +16= 36+7+16=59. No, that's not right. Wait, another approach: 45 could be (
