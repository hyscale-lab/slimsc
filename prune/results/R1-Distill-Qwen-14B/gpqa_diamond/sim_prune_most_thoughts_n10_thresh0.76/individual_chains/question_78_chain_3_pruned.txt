Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember potentials are related to electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell's equations. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that a charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a point r at time t. The field is observed at r, and d is the vector from the charge's position at time tr (some earlier time) to r. Oh wait, tr is the time when the field was generated, and because t is later, the charge has moved since then.

So, potentials are scalar and vector quantities that help in determining the electric and magnetic fields via Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential V is related to the electric field E, and the vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B.

I recall that the scalar potential for a static charge (like in Coulomb's law) is V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge. But this is a moving charge, so I think relativistic effects might come into play. Oh right, because when charges move, they produce magnetic fields as well. So the potentials will probably involve the velocity of the charge.

Wait, the problem is about potentials at time t, so I have to consider retarded time effects. Retarded time is when the fields are based on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time. Because the electromagnetic effects travel at the speed of light, the fields at a later time depend on the state of the charge in the past.

The distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point r is d, so d = r - s(tr), right? So the vector d is from the charge's position at tr to r.

Wait, when the charge is moving, the potentials at a later time would depend on the charge's velocity at the retarded time. So the velocity v is the velocity at time tr.

So how do these potentials look? The scalar potential for a moving charge might not just be the same as the static case because the charge is moving. Or wait, no—does the scalar potential still just depend on the charge and the distance, without considering the velocity? Because the electric field is primarily what's due to the charge, and the magnetic field is due to the motion.

Wait,
