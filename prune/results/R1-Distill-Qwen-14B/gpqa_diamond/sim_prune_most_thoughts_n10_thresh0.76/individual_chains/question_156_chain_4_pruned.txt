Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, both treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are run on two types of HPLC columns. The question is about how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes typically forms an epoxide. So, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it adds across the double bond to form an epoxide. 

Wait, but I also remember something about the stereochemistry here. Oh right, mCPBA adds epoxide groups in a way that depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. For trans (E) alkenes, the epoxidation leads to a trans epoxide. For cis (Z) alkenes, it leads to a cis epoxide. Or is it the other way around? Maybe I should think about the mechanism.

Wait, the reaction is an epoxidation via a cyclic transition state. mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond. For an E-alkene, the substituents on either end are opposite. So during the reaction, the oxygen would add in a way that the new bonds form on opposite sides, leading to a trans epoxide. Wait, noâ€”epoxide formation has the oxygen adding such that the two new oxygen bonds are on the same face. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: the reaction of mCPBA with alkenes forms epoxides, and the configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's configuration.

Wait, no, more accurately, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene determines the stereochemistry of the epoxide. If the alkene is E, then the substituents are on opposite sides, and when the epoxide forms, the oxygen atoms will end up on opposite sides too, leading to a trans epoxide. Similarly, a Z-alkene would form a cis epoxide. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite. Let me visualize.

Take (E)-oct-4-ene:
