Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Okay, the problem is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, the star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Hmm, okay, so first, I should think about what affects the ratio of atoms in two energy levels. Oh, right! The Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor, which depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels.

But wait, the problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. That means when the temperature is lower, the ratio is lower. So I need to find the ratio when there are no spots (T=6000 K) and when there are spots (T=5500 K), and then find the factor by which it changes.

But wait, the spots are dark, which makes me think they are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. But in this problem, when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature of the photosphere drops to 5500 K. So the star's overall Teff is 5500 K when spots are present.

But wait, how does the presence of spots affect the overall Teff? Let me think. The spots are cooler, so they emit less radiation. The star's total luminosity is the sum of the luminosity from the spotted regions and the unspotted regions. But the problem gives us the overall effective Teff when 40% is spotted. So the star is being treated as having an average Teff of 5500 K when spots are present. So I can consider the photosphere's effective temperature as 5500 K in that case.

But wait, the problem says that when the surface isn't covered by dark spots, Teff is 6000 K. So when the star is without spots, T is 6000 K, and when it has spots, the overall T drops to 5500 K.

Now, the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels depends on the temperature. So the ratio when there are no spots (n1/n2) would be higher or lower compared to when spots are present?

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n2/n1) decreases. So when there are spots
