Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question describes a series of reactions starting with compound A. I'll start by analyzing the NMR data of compound A to figure out its structure.

Compound A has two signals in the proton NMR. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H. The second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm integrating for 4H. Hmm, what could this be? Let's think about common structures with such NMR signals.

The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests two sets of three equivalent protons each. Maybe two methyl groups. And the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H could be four equivalent protons. If it's a quartet, perhaps adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, maybe this is a di-substituted cyclohexane derivative.

Wait, another approach: the splitting could indicate neighboring protons. So, for the triplet: each of the 6H is split into a triplet. That usually means each of these protons is adjacent to two equivalent protons. Like, maybe each CH2CH3 group. But in what structure?

Wait, let's think about neopentyl groups or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane with two methyl groups and a central CH2 group. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2,2-dimethylpropane, but that's just a guess.

Wait, if I think about the signals: 6H as a triplet. That could be two sets of three methyl groups. Like, maybe two ethyl groups adjacent to something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring where two of the carbons have methyl groups, each with two neighboring protons.

Wait, another approach: the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H could be a -CH2CH2- group, because each CH2 is split into a quartet. Because each proton in CH2 is adjacent to two protons from the neighboring CH2. So CH2CH2 would have each CH2 as a quartet if they're next to each other. But wait, that's a butylene group, maybe part of a larger structure.

Wait, let me think about diethyl ether. The CH2CH3 groups in diethyl ether have triplet and quartet, but I don't think that's the case here because compound A is something that undergoes monobromination.

Wait, perhaps compound A is 2,2-dimethylcyclopropane? No, but the NMR doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe it's 2,2-dimethylcyclohexane?

Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted cyclohexane, where one of the substituents is a methyl group and another is a CH2CH3 group? Or perhaps, wait, wait, let me think about the splitting. The 6H triplet suggests they are each adjacent to two equivalent Hs. So, maybe each of the 6H is a CH3 group attached to a CH2. For example, (CH3)2CH2CH3? No, but that would be 2-pentane... Wait, perhaps it's 2,2-dimethylbutane? Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is neopentyl, like 2
