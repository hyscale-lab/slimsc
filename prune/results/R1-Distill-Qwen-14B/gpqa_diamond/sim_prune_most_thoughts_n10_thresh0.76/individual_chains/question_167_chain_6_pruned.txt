Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the state is given as |ψ> = [cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α>]/N. I remember that |α> and |-α> are coherent states, right? Coherent states are Gaussian states, so the superposition might make this state non-Gaussian.

The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) exp(-2α²)). Oh wait, so N depends on φ and α. Since we're given φ = -π/4 and α = 0.5, I should plug those in.

Let me calculate sin(2φ) first. φ is -π/4, so 2φ is -π/2. The sine of that is -1. So sin(2φ) is -1.

So N becomes sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2)). Let's compute that exponent: 0.5 squared is 0.25, multiplied by 2 is 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6274. Wait, but N is the normalization, so the state |ψ> is normalized because it's divided by N, right. So the density matrix rho would be |ψ><ψ|.

Now, the problem asks for the non-Gaussianity (nG) using relative entropy. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, relative entropy is usually S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But here, the formula is written as Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). So it's the opposite of the usual relative entropy. Or maybe they're using a different definition. Hmm, but regardless, I need to compute that.

But wait, calculating this would require knowing the density matrices rho and tau. But how do I find the reference Gaussian state tau? Because the state |ψ> is a superposition of coherent states, which are Gaussian. But is this state Gaussian itself? If it is, then the non-Gaussianity would be zero. Otherwise, it's non-zero.

Wait, I remember that the superposition of two coherent states can lead to a non-Gaussian state if they are not the same. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition isn't necessarily. For example, a coherent state is Gaussian, but a squeezed state is also Gaussian, but a superposition of two different coherent states can create a non-Gaussian state.

So the state |ψ> is a superposition of |α> and |-α> with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi). Let me think about phi. Phi is -pi/4, so cos(phi) is cos(-pi/4) which is sqrt(2)/2 (~0.707) and sin
