Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required for this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide. Strong acids will react with hydroxides. Since it's a monobasic strong acid, we're probably looking at something like HCl, HNO3, or H2SO4 as a monobasic? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, H2SO4 is dibasic. Oh right, monobasic means it donates one H+ per molecule. So, like HCl, HNO3, HBr. So the acid is something that will donate one H+.

The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid would be a neutralization reaction. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so it will react with the strong acid to form Fe^3+ ions and water.

Let me think about the stoichiometry. The reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O

Wait, yes, because Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups. Each OH- will react with a H+ to make H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 will neutralize three moles of H+.

So first, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The given mass is 0.1 grams.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1.

So Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.1 divided by 106.85.

Hmm, 106.85 goes into 0.1 how many times? Let me compute:

106.85 * 9.36e-4 = 0.1? Let's see: 106.85 * 0.000936 = 106.85 * 9.36e-4.

Wait, 106.85 * 9.36e-4 = (100 *9.36e-4) + (6.85 *9.36e-4) = 0.0936 + 0.0063956 = approx 0.0999956. Hmm, that's close to 0.1. So about 9.36e-4 mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 9.36e-4 moles.

Now, each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve. So moles of H+ needed = 3 * 9.36e-4 = 0.002808 moles.

The H+ will come from the strong monobasic acid. The acid is 0.1 M, so molarity is 0.1 mol/dm³ or 0.1 mol/L.

Since we're dealing with cm³, and 1 L = 1000 cm³, 0.1 M is 0.1 mol per 1000 cm³, so per liter.

We need to find the volume V (in cm³) of this acid that provides 0.002808 moles of H+.

Molarity is moles/volume(L). So, moles = M * V(L). We can write V(L) = moles / M.

But the moles needed are 0.002808, and M is 0.1 mol/L.

So V(L) = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³.

Wait, but the options don't have 28.08. Let me check the options again.

Option C is 28.05 cm³. That's very close. Option B is 30.0
