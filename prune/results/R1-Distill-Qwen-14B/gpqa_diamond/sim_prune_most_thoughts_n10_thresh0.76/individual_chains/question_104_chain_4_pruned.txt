Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

So, there are two stars with exactly the same masses, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet, both Neptune-mass. The planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected them by measuring shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1?

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the star's movement due to the planet's gravitational pull. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * (P) )^(1/3) ) ) * (some factors I might be mixing up...)

Wait, perhaps I should recall the precise formula. I think the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star^(2/3)) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )

But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (Neptune is much less than Sun), M_p/M_star is negligible, so we can approximate the denominator as M_star. So the formula simplifies to:

K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should write that more accurately. Let's think in terms of proportionality.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet M_p, the mass of the star M_star, and the orbital period P. Since the star's mass is the same for both stars (given in the problem), and the planet masses are similar (Neptune-like), so M_p is the same for both planets. So, the ratio of K between the two planets depends only on their periods.

Wait, the problem states that both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both. And the stars have the same mass, so M_star is the same. Therefore, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), because when you rearrange the formula:

K ∝ (M_p) * (M_star)^(-1/3) * P^(-1/3)

So, since M_p and M_star are the same, K ∝ P^(-1/3). Or, in other words, K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula I recall is K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so:

K ≈ ( ( G M_p / M_star )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / (P^(1/3) ) )

So, K is proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1/P^(1/3)) ). But since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, the (M_p / M_star) term is a constant. So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)) ), so P is proportional to (1/K)^(3).

So, if K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet 1, and K2 for planet 2, then:

K1 / K2 = (
