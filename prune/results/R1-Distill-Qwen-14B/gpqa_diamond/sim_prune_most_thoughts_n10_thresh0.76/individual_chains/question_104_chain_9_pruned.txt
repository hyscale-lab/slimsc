Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, let's see. The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The bigger the shift, the more the star is moving due to the planet's gravitational pull. So the shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period, I think.

Wait, but in this problem, both planets have similar masses, right? So if they have the same mass, then the Doppler shift should relate to their orbital periods or other factors like the distance from the star. 

The data given: Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by a formula. Let me recall. I think the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (P * (1 day))^(-1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star) ) ) )

Wait, maybe I should simplify this. Since both stars are like the Sun and the planets are Neptune-like, their masses are much smaller than the stars. So M_planet << M_star. So we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also, the eccentricity e is zero because the orbits are circular.

So the simplified formula becomes K ≈ ( (G * M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( P^(1/3) ) ) * some constants. Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Alternatively, I remember another version: K = ( (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )

But since M_planet << M_star, it's approximately K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) * M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, but the formula for the semi-amplitude K is often written as:

K = ( (v) ) = [ (27 * pi * G ) / (2 * c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But that's a bit complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to relate the shifts. Since both planets have the same mass and same star mass, maybe the shifts relate inversely with the cube root of the orbital period? Or something else.

Wait, the radial velocity method's semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because the formula for K involves P^(-1/3). So, K ∝ (M_planet / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3))) )

Wait, no, let me think again. K is proportional to (M_planet / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))). Because the formula I wrote earlier has M_star raised to -2/3 power and P to -1/3.

But since both stars are the same mass and both planets have same mass, M_planet is same for both, and M_star same. So K is proportional to P^(-1/3). So if K is larger, then P is smaller.

So, K1
