Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I remember that black holes have some properties related to thermodynamics, like entropy. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas. Let me think.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is measured to be θ = 10^-17 degrees, and it's at a distance d = 10^10 parsecs. We need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, all different powers of 10 multiplied by J/K.

First, I think I need to find the radius of the event horizon. The angular size θ is given, so maybe I can use the small angle approximation formula. The formula is θ (in radians) ≈ opposite/adjacent, so θ ≈ r / d. But wait, θ is given in degrees, so I'll need to convert that to radians first.

So θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180). Let me plug in the numbers. θ_deg is 1e-17 degrees. So θ_rad = 1e-17 * π / 180. Let me compute that. π is about 3.1416, so 3.1416/180 is roughly 0.01745. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Now using θ ≈ r / d, so r = θ * d. The distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Oh wait, parsecs to meters. I remember that 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 meters = 3.086e26 meters.

So r = 1.745e-19 radians * 3.086e26 meters. Let me calculate that. 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = 1.745 *3.086 = approx 5.37. Then 1e-19 * 1e26 is 1e7. So r ≈ 5.37e7 meters. Wait, is that right? Wait, 1e26 times 1e-19 is 1e7. So 5.37e7 meters is 5.37e4 kilometers. Wait, that seems a bit big for a supermassive black hole. Oh wait, no, supermassive black holes have radii up to millions of kilometers or more. So that's okay.

Wait, the Schwarzschild radius R_s is 2GM/c². But for a black hole, the event horizon radius is R = R_s, right? So R = 2GM/c². But in this case, I just calculated r as the size (event horizon radius) using θ and distance. So R = r ≈ 5.37e7 meters.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Let me get exact numbers:

θ_rad = (1e-17) * (π/180) ≈ 1.74533e-19 radians.

d = 10^10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

r = θ_rad * d = 1.74533e-19 * 3.086e26 = Let's compute 1.74533 *3.086 first. 1.74533 *3 is about 5.236, 0.086 *1.74533 is about 0.150. So total roughly 5.386. So 5.386e( -19 + 26 ) = 5.386e7 meters. So R ≈5.386e7 meters.

Now, the next step is to find the entropy of the black hole. I remember that the entropy S of a black hole is given by the formula S = (Ac³)/(4ħGk_B), where A is the area of the event horizon, which is a sphere with radius R.

So the area A = 4π R².

So substituting, S = (4π R² c³) / (4ħGk_B). The 4s cancel out, so S = (π R² c³) / (ħ G k_B).

Wait, also, another version I've heard is S = (k_B c^3 A
