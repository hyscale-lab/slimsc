Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that a cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator, and synchrocyclotron is a special kind. The question is about how many revolutions a proton makes while being accelerated.

Alright, the problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

Wait, I think I need to figure out how the number of revolutions relates to the kinetic energy gained. Let me try to recall what I know about synchrocyclotrons.

In a cyclotron, particles are accelerated by an electric field that's applied in an alternating manner, and the magnetic field keeps them moving in a circular path. The key thing is that the frequency of the electric field must match the natural cyclotron frequency of the particle. But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field changes with time to keep the resonance condition as the particle's mass and charge cause its cyclotron frequency to change with energy.

Wait, no, wait. Maybe that's for a different type of accelerator. Synchrocyclotron... I think that in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field decreases as the particle's velocity increases so that the cyclotron frequency remains in tune with the radiofrequency (RF) electric field. This allows the particle to be accelerated each half-cycle of the electric field as it orbits.

But for the number of revolutions, perhaps I need to find how many times the proton goes around the synchrocyclotron before it reaches the desired energy.

The key formula I remember is that the number of revolutions N is related to the change in the kinetic energy. Because each revolution, the particle gains some energy from the electric field.

Wait, the kinetic energy gained per revolution would be related to the voltage applied. Because each time the proton goes through the gap between the dees (the D-shaped electrodes), it gains energy equal to the voltage multiplied by the charge. Since the proton has charge e, each acceleration step gives it e times U0.

Wait, but wait. The voltage is given as U(t), which is alternating. So each time the
