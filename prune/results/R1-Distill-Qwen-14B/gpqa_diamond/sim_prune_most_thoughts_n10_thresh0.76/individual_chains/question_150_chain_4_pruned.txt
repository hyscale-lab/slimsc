Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can be a bit tricky for me. But I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and I need to figure out what the structure is, then determine what happens when it's reacted with certain reagents. The final product is one of the four options given.

Let me start by looking at the NMR data. The peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). Hmm. I remember that aromatic protons usually show up in the 6.5-8.5 ppm range. The triplet at 9.72 is probably an aldehyde proton since those are around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility for that peak is an aromatic ring that's electron-deficient, like a nitro group attached. But the formula includes a NO, which could be a nitro group. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. Let's think.

Looking at the integration, the triplet is 1H, so maybe an aldehyde proton. So the structure might have an aldehyde group. Let me think about the other peaks.

The aromatic region: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Each pair of doublets with 2H each suggests a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions. Wait, but each is a doublet, so perhaps each is next to one substituent. Wait, if it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent would cause a doublet. Or maybe it's a meta or ortho substitution, but I'm not so sure.

Wait, another possibility: maybe each pair is from two different aromatic systems. Like, the compound has two aromatic rings attached to a central structure. So perhaps two benzene rings, each with substituents in the para positions.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation formula: (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-10)/2=4. So 4 degrees: maybe one ring and three double bonds, but that can't be right. Alternatively, one ring (counts as one), one double bond (another), and two more rings or double bonds? Wait, 4 degrees could be a benzene ring (3 double bonds and 1 ring?), but wait, benzene is three double bonds in a ring, which counts as 4 degrees of unsaturation (each double bond is one, each ring is one). So a benzene ring gives 4 degrees by itself. So the rest of the molecule must be a saturated chain.

Hmm. So perhaps the compound is a diphenyl compound, with a functional group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Benzene is C6H6. If I have two benzene rings, that would be C12H12, which is way too much. So maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents that include the other parts. Alternatively, the compound is a benzene ring connected via a side chain that includes the other atoms.

Wait, let's think about the structure. If the NMR has an aldehyde proton, then perhaps the molecule has an aldehyde group attached to a benzene ring. Let's imagine a benzaldehyde with substituents.

Wait
