Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is to identify a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's see.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of N-H or O-H groups. But wait, N-H usually has a peak around 3300-3500, maybe a medium intensity. O-H would be broader, but these are two separate peaks. Could they be from an amide group? Because amides typically have N-H stretches around 3300-3500. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ probably indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or an ester or amide. Since the molecular formula has O2 and N, maybe an amide or ester.

Now looking at the 1H NMR. Let's list the signals:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is likely a triplet, which is typical for a CH3 group attached to CH2. Like an ethyl group. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl amide.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Could be adjacent to an electronegative group. Maybe an OCH2 group, but the broadness might suggest something else. Or maybe it's an NH group, but that's usually downfield. Wait, in the IR, we saw N-H, so maybe this is part of an amide or amine. Hmm, but amines can exchange protons and sometimes appear as broad signals. But in this case, the integration is 2H, so maybe it's part of an ethyl group attached to something else, like OCH2CH2 (but that would be more like a triplet). Alternatively, this could be an N-substituted group, but I'm not sure yet.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet with 2H. Quadruplet usually comes from a CH2 next to another CH2, like -OCH2CH3. Wait, if it's a quartet, it's probably a splitting from adjacent CH2. So maybe an ethyl ester group. Typically, the OCH2 would be around 4.1-4.3, but if it's next to an electronegative group like carbonyl, it could shift up. The quartet suggests coupling with another CH2 group. Like in an ethyl ester: O-C-O-CH2CH3, the OCH2 would split into a quartet if adjacent to another CH2.
- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The downfield shift (8.0 ppm) might indicate electron-withdrawing groups like nitro, carbonyl, or possibly an amide. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) could be the other ortho positions. So maybe the aromatic ring has two substituents at the para positions, one being an electron-withdrawing group.

Putting this together: The aromatic ring has two substituents in para positions. One substituent could be a carbonyl group (like an amide or ester), and the other could be an oxygen-containing group (like ethoxy). Let's think about the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Breaking it down: 9 carbons. If the aromatic ring is benzene (6 carbons), then the substituents contribute 3 more carbons. Let's see: substituents could be an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3, which is 2 carbons) and a carbonyl group connected to something else (like an amide or ester). Wait, but the substituents on benzene could be, say, an amide and an ethoxy group. Alternatively, maybe an ester and an ethoxy group.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. But benzamide is O=C-NH2 attached to benzene. If the ethoxy is at position 3, the substituents would be meta, not para. But the NMR shows two doublets, suggesting para substituents. So maybe this isn't correct.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH2. So the structure would be formamide attached to a benzene ring that has an ethoxy at the para position. So substituents are at para positions: ethoxy and formamide. The formamide would have a carbonyl group, which fits the IR. The ethoxy would be OCH2CH3. In the NMR, the ethyl group would be triplet at ~1.2 ppm (which matches the 1.20 ppm, t, 3H). The OCH2 of ethoxy would be around 4.0-4.3, perhaps as a quartet or triplet. Wait, but in the NMR data, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q, 2H), which might be the OCH2 attached to carbonyl. Wait, maybe not. Let's think: formamide is RCONH2. So the NMR would have NH2 protons, but those are usually broad. However, the IR shows N-H (amide), so that fits. The ethoxy's CH3 would be triplet at 1.2 ppm, the OCH2 in ethoxy would be a quartet around 4.0-4.3 ppm? Or maybe the OCH2 in the ester is elsewhere. Hmm, perhaps the formamide's structure might not align with the NMR.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, wait: propionate would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. So the structure is benzene with NH2 and a propionoate group at para position. The propionate would have an ethyl group attached via an ester: O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-, so if it's an ester, it would be O-CO-O-R, where R is ethyl. Alternatively, maybe the structure is benzene with an amino group and a propionoate group in para positions. Let's think about the NMR: the ethyl group would be at 1.2 ppm as triplet. The OCH2 would be around 4.1-4.3 as quartet, but in the NMR data, there's a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). That's higher than usual for OCH2. Also, the amino group would be in the aromatic ring, but amines can show up as broad signals. The NMR has a signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H), which might be the NH2 (but that's usually downfield, maybe around 2-3 ppm? Or maybe it's an amide). Hmm, I'm not sure about this option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So the benzene has an amino group and a COOEt group in para positions. Let's see: the amino group would be NH2 attached to the ring. The ester group is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the ethyl group would have triplet at 1.2 ppm (3H), and the OCH2CH3 would have a quartet at around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which is a bit higher. So maybe that's an issue. Alternatively, maybe the OCH2 is split into a quartet elsewhere.

Wait, let's think about the NMR data again. The 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) suggests that these two hydrogens are next to another two, and their splitting is quartet. That's typical for a CH2 next to another CH2, like in an ethyl group. Wait, but the ethyl group's CH3 is already at 1.20 ppm as a triplet. So perhaps the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the OCH2 of an ester group. So that would fit with ethyl ester groups. So in option D, the benzoate ester would have the OCH2CH3 group. The OCH2 would be split by the adjacent CH3 into a quartet. So the OCH2 would appear around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. But the NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is higher. Hmm, maybe in this case, the deshielding from the adjacent carbonyl group shifts it upfield? Or is this the other way around?

Alternatively, looking at the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): broad singlet. Maybe that's the NH2 group, but amines are usually broad. Wait, but in option D, the amino group is on the benzene. If it's 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is attached directly to the ring. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, which is more like being attached to something else. Alternatively, could it be another group, like an amide?

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR to determine the structure.

The 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) is likely the CH3 of an ethyl group, probably an ethoxy or ethyl ester. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) is probably the OCH2 of an ethyl ester group. So, the ethyl ester would have the OCH2 at around 4.0-4.3, but if it's attached to a carbonyl, could it be shifted up? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the OCH2 in an amide structure.

Wait, the 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) could be the OCH2 of an ester. But let me think about the splitting. The quartet would be from the two neighboring protons. So if the OCH2 is next to a CH2 group, but in an ethyl ester, it's OCH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be next to CH3. The OCH2 would split into a quartet if the adjacent group has two protons. Wait, no, the adjacent group is CH3 with three protons. So the splitting would be a triplet. Wait, that's conflicting. So perhaps the OCH2 would be a triplet if next to a CH3, but in the data, it's a quartet. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the quartet is from another group. The 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) could be a methylene adjacent to another methylene. Like in a propyl group or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the NHCH2 group, but that's less common. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a carbonyl-adjacent CH2.

Wait, another thought: The quartet at 4.5 ppm could be the CH2 attached to the carbonyl group. Like in an amide structure, perhaps. For example, in formamide, the CH2 would be attached to the carbonyl. Wait, formamide is HCONH2, which doesn't have a CH2. Alternatively, a structure where the carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure would be:

Ph-OCH2CH3 (ethoxy at para) and Ph-NH-CO-CH3? No, wait formamide is HCONH2. So N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be Ph-OCH2CH3 and Ph-NH-CO-H. Hmm, but then the carbonyl would be attached to the benzene via the N. The aromatic ring would have substituents at para positions: ethoxy and formamide (NH-C=O).

In that case, the NMR would have:

- Ethoxy CH3 as triplet at ~1.2 ppm. That's present.

- Ethoxy OCH2 as quartet around 4.0 ppm. But the NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm, so perhaps that's not matching.

Alternatively, the OCH2 from the ester (if any) might be at 4.5 ppm.

Wait, perhaps another approach: looking at the IR and NMR for each option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure: benzene ring with NH2 and COOEt groups in para positions.

IR: The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ would correspond to the ester carbonyl. The N-H in the amine would have a peak around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹, which matches the IR data.

NMR:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (3H): CH3 from ethyl ester. Correct.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H): possibly the NH2 protons. But amines are usually broad, but I thought they appear around 1-5 ppm. Alternatively, the OCH2 from the ester might be at 4.1-4.3, but the NMR shows 4.0 (bs,2H). That could be adjacent to something else. Or maybe it's the NH2, which is broad, but integration is 2H, which would fit an NH2. Wait, but amines are usually broad, but splitting? Or perhaps it's the OCH2.

Wait, the OCH2 in the ester would be connected to the carbonyl, and in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be as a quartet if next to a CH3. So the OCH2 would be around 4.1 ppm as a quartet. But the NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's the NH2 group, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the NH2? No, NH2 is usually in a different region and broader. Hmm, getting a bit confused here.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure: benzene with 4-ethoxy and formamide substituents. The formamide is HCONH- attached to the benzene. So the carbonyl is in the formamide group.

IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ is for the amide carbonyl. The N-H in amide would have peaks around 3300-3500, matching the IR.

NMR:

- 1.20 ppm triplet: ethoxy CH3. Correct.

- 4.0 ppm: OCH2 of ethoxy as quartet? But the data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm. Hmm.

Wait, the ethoxy's OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.3 as a quartet. But the NMR data has a quartet at 4.5, which is higher. So perhaps that doesn't fit. Unless I'm missing something.

Looking back at the NMR:

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Maybe this is the -NHCH2CO- group? No, formamide is HCONH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the formamide's NH2 is split into a quartet, but that's unlikely. Hmm.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: benzamide (CONH2) with ethoxy at position 3. So substituents are meta, which would lead to different NMR signals, perhaps a triplet and doublet for aromatic protons. But the NMR shows two doublets, suggesting para substitution. So maybe A is incorrect.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure: benzene with NH2 and propionate (CH2CH2COO-) in para positions. Wait, but the propionate would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. So the structure would be something like O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 (but that would make it a propionate ester). Wait, no, the propionate is the carboxylic acid part. So the ester would be O-CO-O-R, where R is ethyl (if it's a propionate ester, the R would be CH2CH2CH3?), wait no. Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So propionate ester would be CH2CH2COO-O-R. So for ethyl propionate, it's CH2CH2COO-OCH2CH3. So substituents on benzene are NH2 and O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would have the propionate as the substituent on the benzene. So the structure would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene, along with NH2 in para.

Wait, but the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's count the carbons:

Benzene (6 C) + substituents: NH2 (0 C) and O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (4 C: 3 from propionate and 1 from O). Wait, no. Wait, O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 is 3 carbons (CH2CH2CH3) plus the COO- group. Wait, the propionate substituent would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that would be a propionyl group. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the propionate would be CH2CH2COO- attached via oxygen. Hmm, perhaps the structure is Ph-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, but that would be a propionyl ester, making the substituent a larger group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the molecular formula for each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Benzamide is C7H7NO. Ethoxy adds O and C2H5. So total would be C9H10NO2? Because benzamide is C7H7NO, adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would make C9H12O2N? Wait, not exactly. Let me think: benzamide is C6H5CONH2. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would be C6H5OCH2CH3. So the total structure is C9H11NO2. Yes, because:

C6 (benzene) + C2 (ethoxy) + C (amide) + N: 6+2+1 +1 =10? Wait, the amide is CONH2, so that's one more C. Wait, no, the benzamide is C7H7NO. Adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would make C9H12O2N. Hmm, but the formula given is C9H11NO2. So perhaps Option A is C9H10NO2? Not sure, perhaps I should calculate.

Alternatively, maybe each option's molecular formula should match C9H11NO2.

Let me check each option:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Benzamide is C7H7NO. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3): which has formula C2H5O. So benzamide is C7H7NO, adding C2H5O would make C9H12O2N. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So number of H: 12 vs 11. So A is C9H12NO2, which is more H than given. So A might not be correct.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Formamide is HCONH2. So when attached to benzene, it's C6H5-OCONH2? No, wait, it's N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, which would be:

Ph-OCH2CH3 and Ph-NH-CO-H. So the structure is C6H4(OCH2CH3)(NHCOH). Wait, no, formamide is HCONH2. So the substituent is NHCO-H attached to benzene.

Wait, the molecular formula would be:

Ph (C6H5) + OCH2CH3 (C2H5O) + NHCOH (which is HCONH2: C=O-NH2). So the formula is C6H5-CO-NH2 + OCH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate each option:

Option A: C9H11NO2.

3-ethoxybenzamide: Benzamide is C7H7NO. Adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would give C9H12O2N. So formula is C9H12O2N, which is more H than given. So not matching.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure: C6H4(OCH2CH3)(NHCOH). So the formula would be C9H11NO2.

Wait, let's count:

Ph (C6H5) + OCH2CH3 (C2H5O) + NHCOH (HCONH2 is C2H3NO2? Wait, HCONH2 is formamide: it's H-C(=O)-NH2. So molecular formula is CH2NO. So for the entire molecule:

Ph (C6H5) + OCH2CH3 (C2H5O) + formamide (HCONH2: C=O-NH2, so C2H3NO2).

Wait, adding those up:

C6 + C2 + C (from HCONH2) = C9? Hmm, 6 + 2 +1 =9? No, wait, HCONH2 is C=O-NH2. So the formamide part contributes C=O and NH2. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the entire structure: 4-ethoxyphenyl group plus formamide. So phenyl group (C6H5) + OCH2CH3 (C2H5O) + HCONH2 (C=O-NH2: which is 2 carbons, O, and 2 N). Wait, but the formula is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, which would be C6H4(OCH2CH3)(NHCOH). So:

C6 (Ph) + 2 (OCH2CH3) + 2 (NHCOH) = C10? No, wait, the formamide is a substituent on the benzene, so it's C6H4(OCH2CH3)(NHCOH). So each substituent adds to the benzene. So the molecular formula would be C6 + 2 (from OCH2CH3) + 2 (from NHCOH) = C10? No, wait, NHCOH is part of the formamide, which is HCONH2. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to count each atom:

Ph: 6 C, 5 H (as substituents take two H away because of the two substituents at para positions). So Ph would have 4 H (since two substituents, each taking one H each, so 6-2=4 H). Then OCH2CH3: 2 C, 5 H (OCH2CH3 is C2H5O). HCONH2: 2 C (H-C-O and N), but actually HCONH2 is H-C(=O)-NH2, which is 2 C (C from CO and another from NH2? Wait, no, the CO is one C, and the NH2 is attached to the same C as CO. So HCONH2 is 2 C (the CO and the NH2 is on the same C). So the formamide part contributes 2 C (H-C-O and another C? No, wait, HCONH2 is H-C(=O)-NH2. So that's two C: one for the CO, and the H is attached to that C. So the formamide substituent is H-C(=O)-NH2, which is 2 C, 3 H (since H is attached to C, which is double-bonded to O, and NH2 has two H). So putting it all together:

Ph: 6 C, 4 H.

OCH2CH3: 2 C, 5 H.

HCONH2: 2 C, 3 H (H from H-C=O, and NH2 has two H).

Wait, but the benzene has two substituents, so the total H would be 4 (from Ph) +5 (OCH2CH3) +3 (HCONH2) = 12 H. But the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's 11 H. So this suggests that option B would have 12 H, which doesn't match. So perhaps option B is not the correct one.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach.

Looking at the 1H NMR data again:

The 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) might be an ethyl group attached to something that deshields it, like an oxygen or a carbonyl. So perhaps it's an OCH2CH3 group. Wait, but the quartet would come from the coupling with adjacent CH2. So if it's OCH2CH3, the OCH2 would be a quartet because it's next to a CH3 with three protons. Wait, no, the CH3 would give a triplet to the OCH2. So the OCH2 would be a triplet. But the data shows a quartet. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe it's an NHCH2 group. But I'm not sure. Another possibility is that the quartet is from an ester's CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Wait, but in an ester, it's OCH2CH3, so the OCH2 would be a quartet because it's next to the CH3. So perhaps in the NMR, the OCH2 is at 4.1-4.3 as a quartet, but the data shows 4.5. So maybe this is higher than usual due to the substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from another group.

Wait, let's think about the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet. Maybe it's an NH2 group, but as I thought earlier, amines are usually broad but can appear at different ppm. Alternatively, it could be an OCH2 that's coupled to another OCH2, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: The 1H NMR shows two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each integrating to 2H. This is characteristic of a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. So the substituents are in para positions, each causing the protons adjacent to them to split into doublets.

So the substituents are probably electron-withdrawing groups, which would deshield the adjacent protons, causing them to appear downfield. One substituent is likely a carbonyl group (amide or ester), and the other could be an ethoxy group or another group.

Looking back at the IR, the 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl. So the substituent could be an ester, amide, or ketone. Since the options include amides and esters, let's focus on those.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure: benzene with NH2 and COOEt groups in para positions.

IR: 1720 would be the ester carbonyl. The N-H in the amine would show up in IR as a medium to strong band, which matches.

NMR:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (3H): CH3 from ester. Correct.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H): Maybe the NH2 group, but amines are usually broad. Alternatively, this could be the OCH2 from the ester, but in ethyl ester, OCH2 would be a quartet. Hmm.

Wait, in ethyl ester, the OCH2 is connected to the CH3, so the OCH2 would be a quartet because it's next to a CH3 with three H. So the OCH2 would appear around 4.1-4.3 ppm as a quartet. But the data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is higher. So maybe D isn't correct.

Alternatively, the 4.0 ppm could be the NH2 group. If the amino group is on the benzene, and the molecule is in a deprotonated state, but in DMSO-d6, which is a common solvent, amines are usually broad. But the quartet at 4.5 ppm is still unexplained.

Let me think about another option. Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: benzene with NH2 and propionic acid (as ester) in para positions. So the substituents are NH2 and O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3?

Wait, no, propionate would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. So the structure would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 attached to benzene, and NH2 in para.

Wait, but the molecular formula for this would be C10H13NO3? Because the propionate ester would contribute more carbons. Hmm, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. So perhaps this isn't correct.

Wait, maybe it's 4-aminophenyl propionate without the ester. No, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so if it's the acid, it would have more H. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Let me reevaluate the options with the molecular formula.

The correct molecular formula is C9H11NO2.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Benzamide is C7H7NO. Adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would give C9H12O2N. So formula is C9H12O2N, which is more H than given (12 vs 11). So incorrect.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Formamide is HCONH2. So substituent is OCH2CH3 and HCONH2 on benzene.

The formula would be C6H5 (Ph) + OCH2CH3 (C2H5O) + HCONH2 (C2H3NO2). Wait, but HCONH2 is formamide, which is H-C(=O)-NH2. So the formula would be C (from HCO) + O + N + H. So the substituent adds 2 C (from HCONH2) to the benzene. So total C: 6 (Ph) + 2 (OCH2CH3) + 2 (HCONH2) = 10 C. But the formula given is C9, so this can't be right. So option B's formula would be C10H11NO3? Because O from OCH2CH3 and O from HCONH2. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me recount.

Ph: C6.

OCH2CH3: C2.

HCONH2: C2 (the HCO and the NH2 are both on the same C). So total C: 6 +2 +2 =10. So formula would be C10H11NO3. Doesn't match C9H11NO2. So B is incorrect.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (if it's an ester). So Ph-O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 and NH2 at para. The formula would be:

Ph: C6.

O-CO-O: adds 2 O.

CH2CH2CH3: 3 C.

NH2: adds N.

So: C6 +3 (propionate ester) + 1 (COO) + N.

Wait, perhaps:

Ph (C6H5) + O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (C3H5O2) + NH2.

So total C: 6 +3 (from OCH2CH2CH3) + 1 (from COO) =10 C. But given formula is C9. So this doesn't fit. So not option C.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: benzene with NH2 and COOEt in para.

Benzoate ester: Ph-COOEt.

COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3.

So formula:

Ph (C6H5) + COOEt (C3H5O2) + NH2.

So C: 6 +3 =9. H: 5 (Ph) +5 (COOEt: OCH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H) + 2 (NH2) =12 H. O: 3 (from COOEt and the benzoate). N:1.

Wait, the formula would be C9H11NO2? Let me count again:

Ph: C6H5.

COOEt: C2H3O2 (since Et is C2H5).

Wait, wait, COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So it's O-CO-O-CH2CH3.

So the COOEt contributes 2 O, and the CH2CH3 contributes 2 C and 7 H (OCH2CH3 has 7 H? OCH2CH3: CH3 has 3 H, CH2 has 2 H, so total 5 H. Wait, no: OCH2CH3 is -O-CH2-CH3. So the CH2 has 2 H, and the CH3 has 3 H. So total 5 H from OCH2CH3.

So for the benzoate ester, the substituent is COOEt, which contributes:

COOEt: 2 O, 2 C (COO), and the Et (2 C, 5 H).

The benzene has 4 H (since two substituents, NH2 and COOEt at para positions, each taking a H).

So total H:

Ph: 4.

COOEt: 5 (from OCH2CH3).

NH2: 2 H.

Total: 4+5+2=11 H.

O: 3 (from COOEt and the ester linkage).

N:1.

So molecular formula: C (6 + 2 + 2 [from COOEt? Wait, no. Benzoate ester is Ph-COOEt. Ph is C6, COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which is 2 C (the COO) + 2 C (Et) =4 C. So total C: 6 +4=10. But given formula is C9. Hmm, so option D's formula would be C10H11NO3? Because:

Ph:6 C.

COOEt: 4 C.

N:1.

O:3.

So C10H11NO3. But the given is C9H11NO2. So option D doesn't fit the molecular formula either.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should recount the molecular formula for each option.

Given formula: C9H11NO2.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: benzoate ester (PhCOOEt) with NH2 in para.

PhCOOEt is C6H5COOCH2CH3.

So C6 (Ph) + 2 (COO) + 2 (Et) = 10 C. But the given formula is C9. So perhaps D isn't correct.

Hmm, none of the options seem to fit, but that can't be right. Maybe I'm making a mistake in one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option B. Let me recalculate.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure: benzene with OCH2CH3 and formamide (HCONH2) substituents.

Formamide is HCONH2, which is attached to the benzene. So the substituents are OCH2CH3 and HCONH2.

So the molecular formula would be:

Ph (C6H5) + OCH2CH3 (C2H5O) + HCONH2 (C2H3NO2).

So C: 6 + 2 + 2 =10, which is more than given. So formula would be C10H12O3N. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the formamide is part of the same substituent. Let me think: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be Ph-OCH2CH3 and Ph-NH-CO-H. So the substituent is OCH2CH3 and NHCOH.

Wait, so the substituents are OCH2CH3 and NHCOH. So the molecular formula would be:

Ph (C6H5) + OCH2CH3 (C2H5O) + NHCOH (which is HCONH2: C=O-NH2).

Wait, the formamide group is HCONH2, which is C2H3NO2.

So the total formula would be:

C6 (Ph) + C2 (OCH2CH3) + C2 (HCONH2) = 10 C.

H: 5 (Ph) +5 (OCH2CH3) +3 (HCONH2) = 13 H. But the given is 11 H. So that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the substituent is something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D, but I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recount D's formula.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: Ph-COOEt with NH2 in para.

Ph is C6H5.

COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3.

So COOEt is C3H5O2 (2 O from COO and 1 from OCH2CH3).

Wait, no, COOEt is O=C-O-OCH2CH3? No, correct structure is O=C-OCH2CH3. So the COOEt group is C3H5O2? No, the COOEt is:

COO- is O=C-O-.

Et is CH2CH3.

So COOEt is C3H5O2.

So the benzoate would be C6H5COOEt: C6 + 3 =9 C. O is 2 (from COO) + O from Et? Wait, no, COOEt is O=C-O-OCH2CH3? No, it's O=C-O-CH2CH3. So the COOEt group is C3H5O2.

So the entire molecule is C6H5-COO-CH2CH3, plus an NH2 group in para.

Wait, wait, that can't be. Benzoate ester is PhCOOEt, which is C6H5COOCH2CH3.

So the formula is:

C6 (Ph) + 2 (COO) + 2 (Et) = 6+4=10 C. But given formula is C9H11NO2.

Ah, wait, perhaps the NH2 is part of the COO group? No, because in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure is Ph-COOEt with NH2 in the para position.

Wait, the correct formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO2.

Let me recount:

Ph: C6H5.

COOEt: COOCH2CH3 is C3H5O2.

NH2: adds N and 2 H.

So total C:6 (Ph) +3 (COOEt) =9 C.

H:5 (Ph) +5 (COOEt) +2 (NH2) =12 H. But the given formula has 11 H. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the NH2 is part of the benzoate. Let me think again. The structure is Ph-COOEt with NH2 in para. So the formula is C6H5COOCH2CH3 with NH2 on the benzene. That would make:

C:6 (Ph) + 3 (COOEt) =9.

H:5 (Ph) +5 (COOEt) +2 (NH2) =12. But formula is C9H11NO2, which has 11 H. So discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps another way: the benzoate is PhCOOEt, which is C6H5COOCH2CH3. The NH2 is on the benzene ring. So the formula would be:

C:6 (Ph) + 2 (COO) + 2 (Et) + 1 (NH2) =11? No, wait, NH2 is part of the benzene, so C is 6 + 3 (from COOEt)=9.

H: Ph (5 H) + COOEt (5 H from Et) + NH2 (2 H) =12 H. But given is 11. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps the benzoate ester's structure is PhCOOEt, which is C6H5COOCH2CH3. So the molecular formula is C9H10O2. Then adding NH2 as a substituent would add N and 1 H (since benzene already has 5 H in this case). Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should move on.

Looking at the 1H NMR data again, the 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) must be an OCH2 group. So maybe it's an ethyl ester's OCH2, which is at 4.5 as quartet. But the ethyl ester's OCH2 is typically around 4.1-4.3 as quartet. So the upfield shift to 4.5 might suggest it's attached to a carbonyl group, which deshields it. So perhaps the OCH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl.

So in option D, the ethyl ester's OCH2 would be next to the carbonyl, so it's shifting up to 4.5 ppm. If that's the case, then the 4.5 ppm quartet is the OCH2.

Then the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2 group, but amines are usually broad. Alternatively, it's the ethoxy's OCH2, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from an amide's NH group. But the IR shows N-H, which would fit with an amide.

Wait, looking back at the IR, the strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ could be an ester carbonyl, which would fit with option D.

So putting it all together, the NMR data suggests:

- Ethyl ester group: triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH3), quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2).

- Para-substituted benzene with two substituents: one ester (COOEt) and one NH2.

- The aromatic protons at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm as doublets, which makes sense for para substituents.

The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) could be the NH2 group, but amines are usually more downfield. Alternatively, perhaps it's another group, but I'm not sure. Given the options, perhaps D is the best fit, even though the H count seems off.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula for D is correct. Let me recalculate:

PhCOOEt is C6H5COOCH2CH3. Formula is C9H10O2. Then adding an NH2 substituent would make it C9H11NO2. Because:

C: 9.

H:10 (from PhCOOEt) +1 (NH2) =11.

O:2.

N:1.

Yes, that matches the given formula C9H11NO2.

So option D's formula is correct.

Therefore, based on the NMR and IR data, and the matching molecular formula, the correct answer is D.


The compound to identify is C9H11NO2, and the analysis is based on the provided IR and 1H NMR data.

### IR Analysis:
- **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: Medium to strong intensity bands, consistent with N-H stretching, suggesting the presence of an amide or amine group.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong band, indicative of a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, characteristic of a CH3 group in an ethyl group (e.g., -CH2CH3).
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, possibly from an NH2 group or an OCH2 group.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet, indicative of a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group, likely part of an ethyl ester (-OCH2CH3).
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Key Observations:
- The aromatic protons at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm suggest a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents, one of which is likely an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., carbonyl).
- The ethyl group signals (1.20 ppm triplet and 4.5 ppm quartet) indicate the presence of an ethyl ester or ethoxy group.
- The IR and NMR data together suggest the presence of both an amide or amine group and a carbonyl group.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
   - Benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3.  
   - The substituents would be meta, not para, which does not match the NMR data showing two doublets for para-substituted aromatic protons.  
   - **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
   - Formamide (HCONH2) with an ethoxy group at the para position.  
   - The ethoxy group would produce a quartet at ~4.1 ppm, but the NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is inconsistent.  
   - **Eliminated.**

3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  
   - Amino group (NH2) and propionate (CH2CH2COO-) at the para position.  
   - The molecular formula does not match (C10H13NO3 vs. C9H11NO2).  
   - **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  
   - Amino group (NH2) and ethyl ester (COOEt) at the para position.  
   - The IR data matches the ester carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹.  
   - The NMR data aligns:  
     - 1.20 ppm triplet corresponds to the CH3 of the ethyl ester.  
     - 4.5 ppm quartet corresponds to the OCH2 of the ethyl ester.  
     - 4.0 ppm broad singlet corresponds to the NH2 group.  
     - The aromatic protons at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm match the para-substituted benzene.  
   - The molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula.  
   - **Correct.**

### Conclusion:
The compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

**Answer: D**
