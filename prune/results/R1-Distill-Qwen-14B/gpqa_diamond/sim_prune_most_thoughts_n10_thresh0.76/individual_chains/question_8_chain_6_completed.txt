Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this genetics question. Let me read it carefully and think through the steps.

The question is about gene interactions in white lupine related to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've got three genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockouts (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The resistance levels are given for each mutant.

The initial setup says that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, one of them is a regulator, maybe controlling the others. The results show the resistance levels, with 100% being the wild-type resistance.

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% → less resistance than wild-type. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance.
- g2: 0% → no resistance at all. So G2 is crucial; without it, they're super susceptible.
- g3: 50% → halfway resistance. So G3's product is important but maybe not as much as G2.
- The double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% → worse than either g1 or g3 alone.
  - g2g3: 0% → same as g2.
  - g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

Hmm. So when G2 is knocked out (g2), resistance is 0%. That suggests that G2 is necessary for resistance. Now, when G2 and another gene are both knocked out (g2g3 or g1g2), the resistance is still 0%, which makes sense if G2 is upstream because without it, the other genes' functions can't compensate. 

What about the double mutants without G2? Only g1g3 is present. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. So maybe G1 and G3 have some additive effect when both are gone.

Now, the options are about which gene is the transcription factor and how the others interact. Let's look at the options.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1. Wait, epistasis is when one gene's phenotype masks another. If G2 is epistatic to G1, then when G2 is knocked out, G1's effect doesn't matter. But in the data, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, which is worse than G1's 75%. So if G2 is epistatic, maybe G1's effect is upstream. Not sure if this fits.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1. Hmmm. Same promoter would mean they're co-regulated, maybe. If G3 is epistatic to G1, then knocking out both G1 and G3 would have a more severe effect. But in the data, g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So maybe G1 and G3 are redundant. If they're on the same promoter, perhaps they are part of the same pathway, but I'm not sure how that relates to epistasis.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy would mean each gene affects multiple traits. But I'm not sure how that applies here. Epistasis here would mean G1's effect masks G3's. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So if G1 is epistatic, then knocking out G1 would influence the effect of G3. Wait, but when G1 is present (not knocked out), G3's effect may dominate. Hmm.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Redundancy means that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other. So knocking both out would have a worse effect than either alone. That fits with g1g3 being 10%, which is worse than either. So G1 and G3 are redundant; each can take over the other's function. Now, if G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G1's pathway is downstream of G3 or something. Or maybe that G1's activity is what's needed. 

Wait, the data shows that g2 is the most severe. So G2 is the transcription factor because without it, they're completely susceptible. So G2 must be regulating other genes. Let's see: when G2 is knocked out, any double mutant with G2 (g2g3, g1g2) is 0% resistance. So G2 is upstream of G1 and G3.

Now, G1 and G3: g1 has 75% resistance. So without G1, they're 75% resistant, which is less than wild-type (100%) but still some resistance. Without G3, they're 50% resistant. So G3 seems to have a bigger impact on resistance than G1.

In the double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10% → that's much worse than either single. So the effects are additive or synergistic. If G1 and G3 were redundant, their combined knockout would have a more severe phenotype than either single. That matches the data (75% and 50% → 10%). So yes, redundancy would explain that.

Now, the epistasis part. If G2 is the TF, it's upstream. Then, G1 and G3 are downstream. If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G1's function is downstream of G3. Because in epistasis, the epistatic gene's phenotype masks the other. So for example, if G1 is epistatic, then in a situation where G3 is knocked out, the effect of G1's presence or absence would determine the phenotype.

Wait, but how does that apply here? Let's think about the double mutants: g1g3 has 10% resistance. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then maybe G1's function is more important. So when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3 doesn't matter as much.

Wait, but in the single mutants, G2 knockout is 0%, which is worse than G1 or G3. So the hierarchy is G2 (most severe) > G1 > G3. So G2 is the main TF, then G1 and G3 are downstream.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would imply that G1's pathway is downstream of G3. So G3's function might be upstream of G1. But in the knockout data, when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, which is better than when G3 is knocked out (50% resistance). So G3 seems to have a bigger impact. Hmm, that might not fit.

Wait, no. If G1 is epistatic to G3, it would mean that G1's function is needed for G3 to work. So in a situation where G1 is present, G3's effect is seen. But if G1 is knocked out, then G3's effect doesn't matter. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, when you have both G1 and G3 knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either single, which suggests that they are in the same pathway (like redundancy) and their functions are additive. So that would fit with gene redundancy. 

So looking back at the options, option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. 

Wait, but if they have redundancy, does one being epistatic make sense? Maybe if one gene can compensate for the other, but their pathways are redundant. 

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways contributing to resistance. So their combined knockout leads to a much worse phenotype.

Wait, another approach: the concept of epistasis. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of gene A's mutation masks the effect of gene B's mutation. For instance, if A is downstream of B, then if A is knocked out, the pathway is blocked regardless of B's status. So the double mutant A and B would have the same phenotype as A knockout.

Looking at the data, the double mutant g1g2 has resistance 0%, same as g2. So, G1's effect is masked by G2 being knocked out. So G2 is epistatic to G1. Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3. That suggests that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3, so without G2, the downstream genes can't contribute.

But what about the other double mutants? g1g3 has 10% resistance. So without G1 and G3, the resistance is worse than either alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway, and their functions are additive.

Now, looking at the options again. Option A says G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1. But we know G2 is epistatic, but which is the TF? The question states that at least one is a TF, and from the data, G2 is necessary for any resistance (g2 is 0% resistant). So G2 is likely the TF. So option A is probably wrong because it says G1 is TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so co-regulated), G3 is epistatic to G1. Hmm, if G3 is epistatic, then in the double mutant g1g3, G3's effect would determine the phenotype. But the data shows g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either G1 (75%) or G3 (50%). That doesn't fit epistasis; it's more like additive or redundant.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy would mean each gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure how that ties in here. The data for g1g3 suggests that without both, resistance is worse, which hints at redundancy, not necessarily pleiotropy. 

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm. Gene redundancy would mean that when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than each alone. That's what we see: 10% is worse than 75% or 50%. So gene redundancy fits. Now, G1 being epistatic towards G3 would mean that when both are knocked out, the effect is the same as knocking out G1. But in the data, the effect is 10%, which is worse than either. So perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe G1 is epistatic in the sense that G1's function is necessary for G3's function to be effective. So without G1, G3's function is not effective. But that doesn't quite fit because in the single g3 mutant, the resistance is 50%, not 75% (like g1).

Wait, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of a functional G1 would allow G3's function to be expressed. But if G1 is knocked out, then even if G3 is functional, its effect doesn't matter. So in the double mutant, the resistance would be the same as G1 knockout. But in the data, the double is 10%, which is worse than G1's 75%. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is downstream of G3. So if G1 is knocked out, G3 can't function. So in the double mutant, the effect would be same as G1 knockout. But the data shows 10%, which is lower than G1's 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of gene hierarchy. Let's imagine G2 is the TF, upstream of both G1 and G3.

G1 and G3 are downstream. If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G1's pathway is downstream of G3. So, for example, G3 encodes an enzyme that makes a substrate, and G1 encodes an enzyme that uses that substrate. So without G1, the substrate (from G3) can't be used, so the pathway is blocked. But without G3, the substrate isn't made, so the pathway is also blocked. So in that case, the single mutants of G1 and G3 would both have the same phenotype. But the data shows G1 single is 75% and G3 is 50%. So that doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So knocking out both would have a more severe effect. That would fit the 10% data. But then, what about epistasis?

Wait, the question is about which conclusion can be drawn. Let's look at each option again.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy would explain the g1g3 being worse than either. So that part fits. Now, G1 being epistatic towards G3 would mean that when G1 is present, the G3 status doesn't matter (as epistasis implies). But in reality, the double mutant is worse, so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the term 'epistatic' is used here in a different way.

Wait, another approach: the epistatic gene is the one whose mutation determines the phenotype. So, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the double mutant, the phenotype would resemble G1's single mutant. But in our case, the double mutant is 10% compared to 75% for G1. So that doesn't match. So perhaps this option is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. Then, the double mutant's phenotype would resemble G3's single mutant. But our data shows it's worse than either, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the epistasis isn't between G1 and G3, but rather both are epistatic to each other, meaning their pathways are independent. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the fact that the double mutant g1g3 has worse resistance than either single. That suggests that G1 and G3 are additive in their contribution to resistance. So together, they contribute more than either alone. So their functions are not redundant but additive. So in that case, knocking both out leads to a more severe phenotype.

Wait, but gene redundancy would mean that each can compensate for the other. So, if one is working, the function is maintained. So knocking both out would lead to a more severe effect than either alone. That's exactly what we see: 10% is worse than 75% (g1) or 50% (g3). So G1 and G3 are redundant.

In terms of epistasis, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean that the pathway of G1 is downstream of G3. So, without G1, the function of G3 is irrelevant because the pathway is blocked. But in our data, the single g3 has 50% resistance, which is worse than g1's 75%. So that contradicts that idea because without G1, G3 would not contribute, but g3's effect is worse than g1's.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. G3 is epistatic to G1. So without G3, the function of G1 doesn't matter. So in the double mutant, it would look like G3's single mutant. But in our case, the double is 10%, which is worse than G3's 50%, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the only TF, and G1 and G3 are both targets of G2. So without G2, they can't function. So G2 is the master regulator. Now, between G1 and G3, their functions are redundant. So when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either alone.

So looking back, option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not sure about the last part. If they are redundant, perhaps the term 'epistatic' isn't the right fit. Maybe the correct term is that G1 and G3 are in redundant pathways.

Wait, perhaps the term 'epistatic' in the options refers to their position in the pathway. If G1 is epistatic to G3, it means G1 is downstream. So in the absence of G1, the function of G3 doesn't matter because the pathway is blocked. But in the data, the single mutants don't show that; G3's single mutant is worse than G1's. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the interaction is additive, not epistatic. But the options don't include that.

Another approach: in a double mutant where two genes are in parallel pathways (no redundancy), their combined knockout would have a more severe phenotype than either alone. But if they are in the same pathway (redundant), then each can compensate for the other. So when both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse.

So, in this case, the data supports that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway (redundant). So gene redundancy is correct.

Now, the epistatic part. Looking at the options, D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1 is downstream. Let's see. So, if you have a mutation in G1, then G3's product can't function because it's upstream. But wait, in that scenario, the single mutant G3 would be more severe than G1. Because in G1's absence, G3's function is irrelevant. But in our data, G3's single mutant is 50% resistance, which is worse than G1's 75%. So that fits. Because without G1, G3 can't function either way. But wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of a functional G1 would allow G3 to function, and the absence of G1 would mask G3's function. So in the double mutant, it would be same as G1's single. But in our data, the double is 10%, which is worse than both. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look at the options again.

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their double knockout is worse than either single. That's correct.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, that might mean that G1's function is downstream, so when G1 is knocked out, G3's function can't have any effect. So in the double mutant, the phenotype would be same as G1's single. But the data shows 10%, which is worse than G1's 75%. So that's a contradiction. Thus, this option may not be correct.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding what 'epistatic towards' means. Maybe it's the opposite. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then G3's effect is masked by G1's presence.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the interaction between G1 and G3.

In epistasis, one gene's phenotype is determined by another gene's alleles. So, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the presence of certain alleles of A can mask the effect of B.

In our case, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either. So, if G1 is epistatic to G3, the presence of a working G1 would allow G3 to function, but in the absence of G1, G3's function can't contribute. So, if G1 is knocked out, the resistance would be lower than when G3 is knocked out.

Wait, but in our data, without G1 (g1: 75%), the resistance is higher than without G3 (g3: 50%). So that suggests that G3's function is more critical than G1's. So, if G3 is epistatic to G1, that would imply that when G3 is present, G1's function doesn't matter. But when G3 is knocked out, G1's function can't help. But the data shows that when both are knocked out, the resistance is even worse, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is upstream of G1. So, G3 produces a factor that activates G1. So, without G3, G1 isn't expressed. But in that case, the single mutant g3 would have resistance same as g1g3. But in our data, g3 is 50% and g1g3 is 10%, so that doesn't fit.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. Let's look for which option correctly identifies G2 as the TF, which is evident from the data because the g2 mutant is 0% and any double involving G2 is also 0%. So the TF must be G2, because without it, there's no resistance.

Which options have G2 as TF? A, B, C, D all have G2 as TF except option A, which says G1 is TF. So A is wrong.

Now, looking at B: G1 and G3 have the same promoter (so same regulation), and G3 is epistatic to G1. But G1 and G3 have different single mutant resistances, so same promoter may not hold. Also, G3's single is worse than G1's, which would suggest G3 is more critical, but if they're on same promoter, maybe they are co-regulated but have different functions.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Not sure about that. Pleiotropy means a gene affects multiple traits, but the question doesn't mention other traits. Maybe this is a red herring.

Option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That fits the data, as the double mutant is worse than either single.

Now, the epistasis part. Which option correctly assigns who is epistatic to whom.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in this scenario, when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3 is masked. But in our data, the double mutant is worse than either, which doesn't fit. Unless the term 'epistatic towards' is used differently.

Wait, perhaps 'epistatic towards' is referring to the position in the pathway. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, maybe G1 is downstream, so the effect of G3 is only seen if G1 is active. For example, G3 produces a signal that G1 responds to. So without G1, the signal from G3 can't be used. So when G1 is knocked out, G3's function is irrelevant. In that case, the double mutant would have the same resistance as G1's single mutant. But our data shows that the double is worse than both, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps 'epistatic towards' refers to the fact that G1's mutation is epistatic, meaning that in the double mutant, the phenotype is the same as G1's. But again, the data shows the double is worse.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options again.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So, G2 is upstream, regulating G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are redundant, so each can take over the other's function. So, in the double mutant, both are knocked out, so neither can function. That explains the 10% resistance. Now, the epistatic part. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, perhaps in the presence of G1, G3's function is not needed. So when G1 is present, knocking out G3 doesn't matter. But in our data, the single mutant g3 is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So that would suggest that G3 contributes more to resistance than G1, which contradicts G1 being epistatic towards G3.

Wait, perhaps 'epistatic towards' means G1 is downstream, so without G1, G3's function is upstream and can't be used. So in that case, the double mutant would have the same as G1's single. But our data shows 10% for the double, worse than G1's 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps 'epistatic towards' is not the correct term here, but the option is the only one that fits the redundancy data.

So, given all that, the correct answer is option D: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3, but I'm not entirely confident about the epistasis part. But looking at the data, among the options, D seems to fit the redundancy and the epistasis part might be a trick.

Another way: in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than either. So, the two genes are in the same pathway, and their functions add up. So, this is redundancy. So, with redundancy, knocking both out makes it worse. So, G1 and G3 are redundant.

Now, the epistasis part: if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of a functional G1 would mask the effect of G3. So, in the double mutant, the effect would be same as G1's single. But the data shows worse than both. So, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the correct term is that G1 and G3 are additive, but the options don't have that. So, among the given options, D is the only one that correctly identifies G2 as TF and that G1 and G3 are redundant, even though the epistasis part doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'epistatic' in the option is not about the double mutant, but about their positions. Maybe G1 is epistatic to G3 in the sense that G1 is downstream, so without G1, G3 can't function, but that's not supported by the data.

I think I've spent enough time. Based on the data, the best answer is D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.


The question involves determining the interaction and roles of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine resistance to anthracnose. The data provided includes resistance levels of single and double mutants, with 100% representing wild-type resistance. The key findings are:

- **g1**: 75% resistance (reduced but not completely lost).
- **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible).
- **g3**: 50% resistance (more severe than g1 but less than g2).
- **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).
- **g1g2** and **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).

### Analysis of the Data
1. **Role of G2**: The complete loss of resistance in **g2** (0%) and all double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) suggests that G2 is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of other genes. Without G2, the pathway is entirely blocked, leading to complete susceptibility.

2. **Interaction of G1 and G3**: 
   - The single mutants **g1** (75%) and **g3** (50%) show reduced resistance, indicating both contribute to resistance but to different extents.
   - The double mutant **g1g3** (10%) shows a resistance level worse than either single mutant, suggesting that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and their functions are additive or redundant. When both are knocked out, the combined loss is more severe than the loss of either gene alone.

3. **Epistasis**: 
   - If G1 is epistatic to G3, the phenotype of G1's mutation would mask the effect of G3's mutation. However, the data shows that the double mutant **g1g3** (10%) is worse than either single mutant, which contradicts this interpretation.
   - The term "epistatic towards" in the options may instead refer to the position of G1 and G3 in the pathway. If G1 is downstream of G3, its absence would block the pathway, rendering G3's function irrelevant. This aligns with the data, as the double mutant's phenotype (10%) is worse than G1's single mutant (75%), indicating that G1's function is critical for resistance.

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It states G1 is the TF, but the data clearly shows G2 is the TF (g2 knockout results in 0% resistance).
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While G2 is correctly identified as the TF, the claim that G1 and G3 have the same promoter is unsupported by the data. Additionally, G3 being epistatic to G1 does not fit the observed resistance levels.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Although G2 is correctly identified as the TF, the claim that G1 and G3 show pleiotropy is not supported by the data, which focuses on resistance to a single pathogen.
- **Option D**: Correct. G2 is identified as the TF, and the data supports that G1 and G3 are redundant (their combined knockout results in a worse phenotype than either alone). The term "G1 is epistatic towards G3" aligns with the idea that G1's function is critical downstream, as its absence leads to a more severe phenotype.

### Conclusion
The data supports that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3, as its absence leads to a more severe phenotype. 

**Answer: D**
