Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. The goal is to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide and would react with an acid in a neutralization reaction.

So, the problem says we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. First, I think I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 that is. The formula mass for Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, and H is 1. So, Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + (3*(16 + 1)) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol. So, moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me write that as approximately 9.36 x 10^-4 moles.

The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid—like HCl, which is monobasic—would produce Fe^3+ ions, water, and Cl^- ions. The reaction equation should be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So, for each mole of Fe(OH)3, three moles of H+ are needed.

So, moles of H+ needed = 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3. That's 3 * 9.36e-4 ≈ 0.002808 moles of H+.

Now, the acid solution is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 moles per liter. To find the volume needed, I'll use the formula moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). Rearranging, Volume = moles / Molarity.

So, Volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L. Converting to cm³ (since 1 L = 1000 cm³), that's 28.08 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is close enough considering rounding. So the volume part points to option C.

Now for the pH part. After dissolving Fe(OH)3, the solution will contain Fe^3+ ions, which are the conjugate acid of the weak base Fe(OH)3. So Fe^3+ will hydrolyze in water:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, since we've added a strong acid, the solution may be acidic. Hmm, but after reacting Fe(OH)3 with H+, the solution's pH depends on the excess H+ ions. Or wait, maybe the Fe^3+ will hydrolyze, making the solution acidic.

But wait, let me think. When Fe(OH)3 reacts with HCl, it's a neutralization:

Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O.

So the solution formed is FeCl3. FeCl3 is a salt of a strong acid (HCl) and a weak base (Fe(OH)3). So the solution will be acidic because the Fe^3+ ions will hydrolyze.

So the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ ions.

The concentration of Fe^3+ in solution: The total volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L). So moles of Fe^3+ is the same as moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 9.36e-4 mol. So concentration is 9.36e-4 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

Wait, but wait, because the solution is 100 cm³. Wait, the initial 100 cm³ is the total volume after adding the acid. So FeCl3 is 0.00936 M.

Now, the hydrolysis reaction for Fe^3+ is:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The hydrolysis constant K can be found from the base dissociation of Fe(OH)3. Alternatively, since Fe(OH
