Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. And the question is asking how many possible organic products there are from this reaction. The options are A) 4, B) 1, C) 2, D) 3.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my aromatic substitution reactions, but I'll try to think through this. So, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, wait. Hmm, benzene with substituents. Let me imagine the structure. Benzene ring with a bromine on position 1 and a deuterium on position 2. Or wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene? So positions 1 and 2 are substituted.

Wait, but when numbering, the bromine is in position 1, and the deuterium is in position 2. So the molecule has Br and D attached to adjacent carbons on the benzene ring.

Now, the reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. That sounds familiar. I think NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. But wait, in the context of aromatic compounds, maybe it's about elimination to form a benzene ring with a double bond substituent, like a benzene ring with a substituted ethylene group.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 in ammonia is used for aromatic substitution, particularly elimination of halides to form rings with more unsaturation, like aromatic rings with triple bonds or rings that might undergo some rearrangement.

Wait, but more specifically, when you have a benzene ring with a halogen (like Br) and another substituent, and you treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, you might be looking at a elimination reaction forming a triple bond adjacent to the ring. Because in such conditions, the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to the elimination of Br- and formation of a triple bond.

So, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. Let me visualize that. So, the benzene ring has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So the structure is Br attached to C1 and D attached to C2, which is adjacent.

Wait, but before that, I should think about the possible elimination products. If the Br is at C1 and there's a D at C2, then when the base abstracts a Î²-hydrogen (but wait, in this case, it's a deutero group, so maybe it's a D), but wait, can D be deprotonated? Hmm, that's a tricky point.

Wait, D is deuterium, which is a heavier isotope of hydrogen. Deprotonation with a strong base like NaNH2 would be possible, but maybe it's less likely because D has a higher isotopic mass and lower proton availability? Not sure. Or perhaps the deuterium is just a substituent and doesn't affect the reaction directly.

Wait, but in the starting compound, the substituents are Br at C1 and D at C2. So the positions are adjacent. So in the benzene ring, the substituents are on adjacent carbons. When treated with a strong base like NaNH2, which is a strong base and a good nucleophile, but perhaps more importantly, it's a strong base for elimination.

So, the reaction would likely proceed by eliminating HBr. Wait, but in this case, the substituent is D, so maybe the hydrogen comes from another position.

Wait, perhaps the base (NH2^-) abstracts a hydrogen from a position adjacent to the Br. So, the Br is on C1, and the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6 (since benzene is a ring). But wait, in this case, C2 is already substituted with D.

So, if the Br is at C1, and the D is at C2, then the hydrogen that could be abstracted would have to be on C3 or C6, maybe? Because C2 is already substituted with D, so maybe the H is on C3 or C6.

Wait, let me draw this out
