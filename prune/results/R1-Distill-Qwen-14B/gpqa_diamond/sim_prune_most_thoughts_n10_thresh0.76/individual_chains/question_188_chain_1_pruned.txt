Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all its edges of equal length and all angles equal. Wait, but I think in this case, the angles are 30 degrees each. Oh right, the problem states that alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral structure with a=10 Angstroms, and angles 30 degrees each.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance depends on the Miller indices (hkl) and the lattice parameters.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar spacing d_{hkl} is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + ... something about the angles. Oh right, for a cubic system, it's more straightforward, but since this is rhombohedral, which isn't cubic, the formula must account for the angles between the lattice vectors.

I recall that the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is more complicated. Maybe I should look up the formula. Oh wait, the general formula for a rhombohedral lattice involves the unit cell parameters and the angles. Let me think. The formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2hk cos α)/(a²) - (2hl cos β)/(a²) - (2kl cos γ)/(a²)

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all equal. So in this case, since alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, the formula simplifies a bit.

So substituting into the formula for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So plugging in the values:

1/d² = (1 + 1 +1)/(a²) - [2*1*1 cos(30) ]/(a²) * 3 times?

Wait, no, wait the terms are for each pair. So the cross terms are (2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos gamma) all divided by a².

Wait, let's be precise. The formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos gamma)/(a²)

But since alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees, and a is 10 Angstroms.

So for (111):

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So:

1/d² = [ (1 +1 +1) ] / a² - [ 2*(1*1 cos30) + 2*(1*1 cos30) + 2*(1*1 cos30) ] / a².

Wait, because each of the cross terms is 2hk cos theta, with each angle. Since all angles are 30, all the cos terms are cos30.

So let's compute step
