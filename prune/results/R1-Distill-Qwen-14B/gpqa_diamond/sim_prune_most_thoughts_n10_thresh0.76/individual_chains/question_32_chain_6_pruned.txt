Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, so Lithium usually has 3 protons, right? If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

The problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy increases significantly due to relativistic effects. The formula for relativistic energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m0 * c².

But wait, the speed given is 0.96c, so I need to calculate gamma for that speed. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. Let's plug in v = 0.96c.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let me calculate 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that more accurately. Let's see, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right. So the square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, yes. So 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714? Let me double-check. 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28 *3.5 is 0.98, so 3.5 times 0.28 is 0.98. Hmm, wait, 0.28 * 3.5714 would be 0.28 *3 is 0.84, 0.28 *0.5 is 0.14, so 0.84 + 0.14 = 0.98, plus 0.28 *0.0714 is about 0.02, so total 1. So yes, 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using a calculator-like approach. Let me think. Let me compute 1 - (0.96)^2 again. 0.96^2 is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate it more precisely. Let's see. Let me compute 0.0784 as a decimal. The square root of 0.0784. Hmm. Let me think. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/(0.28) = 10/2.8 = 100/28 = 25/7 ≈3.5714.

So, gamma is 25/7. Let me compute that as a decimal for more precision. 25 divided by 7: 7*3=21, remainder 4, so 3.57142857... So approximately 3.57142857.

Now, the next part is finding the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So for a Li-6 nucleus, which has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), the total rest mass energy would be 6 * 938 MeV.

Wait, but wait, is the mass exactly 6 nucleon masses? Because when you combine protons and neutrons into a nucleus, there's a mass deficit due to binding energy, but I think in this problem, we're supposed to use
