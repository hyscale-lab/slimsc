Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, which I remember stands for quantitative polymerase chain reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The scientist is making a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran serially diluted samples in triplicate. The efficiency is 100%, which probably means the reaction is perfect, doubling the DNA every cycle. R² is 1, so the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope is -3.3. Hmm, I recall that the slope in a qPCR calibration curve relates to the efficiency. The formula for the slope is usually ln(1/Efficiency), but wait, sometimes it's negative because higher concentrations require fewer cycles (lower Ct). So with 100% efficiency, the efficiency is 1, so ln(1/1) is ln(1)=0? Wait, but wait, perhaps the slope is calculated as -log(Efficiency) or something else. Maybe I should think about the standard curve method.

The data shows that higher concentrations (like 100,000 copies) have higher Ct values. Because as there's more target, the PCR reaches the threshold sooner, meaning lower Ct. Wait, no, wait. No, higher starting quantity means the DNA reaches the threshold earlier, so lower Ct. So the Ct values should decrease as concentration increases. Looking at the data, when the concentration is 100,000, the Ct is around 34. That's higher than 20-something at 10 copies. Wait, that can't be right. Because higher concentrations should have lower Ct. So 100,000 copies would have a lower Ct than 10 copies? Wait, no, wait, no! Wait, no. Wait, actually, higher concentration means more DNA, so it would reach the threshold sooner, so lower Ct. So 100k would have a lower Ct than 10. But in the data, 100k has Ct around 34, while 10 has 20.7. So that's the opposite. So that would be odd.

Wait, but the question says that the efficiency is 100%, R²=1. So the data should fit perfectly. But the Ct values are
