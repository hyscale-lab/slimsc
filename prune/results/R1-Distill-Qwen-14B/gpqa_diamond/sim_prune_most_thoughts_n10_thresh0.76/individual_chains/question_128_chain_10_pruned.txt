Okay, so I've just started my new job at this structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. The given amino acid sequence is quite long, and I'm given four plasmid options to choose from. I need to figure out which plasmid is the correct one that will produce the P53 protein.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on plasmid construction, but I remember that plasmids used for protein expression usually have the coding sequence (CDS) for the protein of interest under a promoter. Since E. coli is being used, the plasmid likely has a bacterial promoter. Oh right, the plasmid should have the start codon (ATG) followed by the coding sequence and then the stop codon. Wait, but sometimes the stop codon is included or not? I think the plasmid might include the entire ORF with ATG start and the correct stop.

Looking at the options, each starts with ATGGA..., so they all start similarly. I need to identify which one correctly codes for the given amino acid sequence. But wait, the amino acid sequence provided starts with MEEPQ... So the first few amino acids are M, E, E, P, Q. Let me think about the DNA sequence that would code for that.

The start codon is ATG, which translates to Methionine (M). The next codon would be the three nucleotides following ATG. Let me look at the first few nucleotides after ATG in each option.

Option A's sequence after ATG is GAG GAG CC... So the first few amino acids would be D (GAG is D), D (GAG is D), etc. Wait, but the desired protein starts with MEEPQ. Let me think: M is from ATG, and the next codon would be E.

E corresponds to the nucleotide sequence GAA or GAG. So the first codon after ATG (which is M) should be GAA or GAG to make E.

Looking at each option:

Option A starts with ATG GAG GAG CC... So the first codon after ATG is GAG (E), then GAG (E) again. So the first three amino acids would be M, E, E. That matches the given sequence MEEPQ... So that's promising.

Option B starts similarly, I think. Let me see: Option B's sequence after ATG is GAG GAG CC... same as A. So for the first few amino acids, same as A. Then why would the options differ?

Wait, maybe I should check the rest of the sequence. Because the given amino acid sequence is longer, perhaps the plasmid sequences vary in the middle. Alternatively, perhaps one option lacks a stop codon, or has frame shifts.

Another thing to consider is that sometimes plasmids include a Kozak sequence or other regulatory elements, but I think in E. coli, it's more about the promoter and ribosome binding site (RBS). However, the focus here is on the coding sequence.

Wait, looking at the last parts of each plasmid. Each option seems to end with ...AGACTGA. That's the end of the coding sequence. Let me check if the last few codons match the given amino acid sequence.

The given amino acid sequence ends with ...YNYMCNSSCMGGMNRRPILTIITLEDSSGNLLGRNSFEVRVCACPGRDRRTEEENLRKKGEPHHELPPGSTKRALPNNTSSSPQPKKKPLDGEYFTLQIRGRERFEMFRELNEALELKDAQAGKEPGGSRAHSSHLKSKKGQSTSRHKKLMFKTEGPDSD.

So the last part of the protein sequence is that long stretch ending with PDSD. So the DNA sequence should code for that. Let me look at the end of the plasmid options.

Looking at option D, for example, the last few lines:

...GAAGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Wait, the last part is ACTGA, which is a stop codon (TGA is stop, but wait, the sequence ends with ...ACTGA. Hmm, how does that translate? Let me count.

Wait, the plasmid is a DNA sequence. The last few nucleotides are ...CAGACTGA. Let me check that. So the last codons would be GAC (Asp), then TGA (stop). So the last amino acid is Asp, then stop. Looking back at the given protein sequence, does it end with ...DSD?

Wait, the given protein ends with ...YNYMCNSSCMGGMNRRPILTIITLEDSSGNLLGRNSFEVRVCACPGRDRRTEEENLRKKGEPHHELPPGSTKRALPNNTSSSPQPKKKPLDGEYFTLQIRGRERFEMFRELNEALELKDAQAGKEPGGSRAHSSHLKSKKGQSTSRHKKLMFKTEGPDSD.

So the last part is ...DSD. Let me see: the last three amino acids are D, S, D. So the DNA sequence should have the codons for D, S, D.

Wait, but the plasmid options end with ACTGA. So let's build the last few codons. The last few nucleotides before the stop codon would be ...GAC TGA. So GAC is Asp (D), then TGA is stop. So the last amino acid would be D, then stop.

In the given protein sequence, the last amino acids are ...DSD. So that would require the DNA
