Okay, so I've got this question about large clouds of neutral hydrogen and quasars. Hmm, the question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift for these objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, I remember that when a quasar's light passes through a cloud of neutral hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs the light at specific wavelengths. The Lyman alpha line is one of those. Lyman alpha is the transition where an electron in hydrogen moves from the second energy level to the first, right? And the wavelength for that is about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range.

Wait, but ground-based optical telescopes can't observe in the ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs those wavelengths. So if the Lyman alpha line is being absorbed, but the telescope can't see that wavelength, how does it work?

Oh, right! Redshift. If the cloud is moving away from us (which it is, because the universe is expanding), the wavelength of the absorbed light shifts to a longer wavelength. So instead of 1216 Angstroms (which is 121.6 nm, ultraviolet), it gets redshifted into the optical range. That's why we can detect it from the ground.

The question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So we need the wavelength after redshift to be in the optical range that telescopes can observe. What's the optical range? I think optical is roughly 400 nm to about 700 nm. Wait, no, wait—visible light is about 400-700 nm, but optical telescopes can sometimes go a bit beyond that, but for this problem, maybe we can consider the limit as 700 nm or so.

Wait, but wait, the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. So when it's redshifted, the observed wavelength λ_obs is λ_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

So λ_obs must be less than or equal to about 700 nm, because beyond that, ground-based optical telescopes can't see it. Wait, no, actually, I'm a bit confused. Because the Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra as absorption lines in the optical part of the spectrum.

Wait, but the quasar's
