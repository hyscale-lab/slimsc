Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that potentials are related to the electromagnetic fields, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expressions when the charge is moving.

The question gives me a scenario where a point charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're considering the fields at a point r at time t. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated at time tr to the observation point r. Oh right, tr is an earlier time, so the fields are retarded, meaning they depend on the charge's position and velocity at that earlier time.

Wait, the problem is asking for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at time t. I think potentials are usually expressed in terms of the charge's position and velocity, but when the charge is moving, especially if it's moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, you have to consider the retarded time.

From what I recall, the scalar potential V for a static charge is q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, because of relativity and the finite speed of light, the potential might involve some terms related to the velocity. Oh right, the scalar potential for a moving charge can have a correction term due to the motion, but I'm not entirely sure how that factors in.

Wait, I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by something like V = (q)/(4πε₀) * [ (γ)/(r') ), where r' is the distance at the retarded time. But I'm not too confident. Alternatively, perhaps the scalar potential is similar to the static case but evaluated at the retarded position. Hmm, but the options don't seem to have gamma factors, so maybe this is a non-relativistic case, or perhaps we're considering potentials without the relativistic effects beyond the first-order terms.

Looking at the options, option A and B have V as q/(4πε₀ r), which is the static case. Options C and D have V as (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c ± d·v)). Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about how the vector potential is calculated.

The vector potential A is usually given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) times something involving velocity, perhaps. Oh wait, in the static case, A is zero for a charge at rest, but when moving, A is related to the current. But in this case, the charge is moving, so the vector potential should depend on its velocity.

Wait, the general expressions for the potentials in the context of retarded time are:

V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀) * [ 1/(r') ] * (1 - v²/c² + (v·r')/(r'²c²) ) ... Hmm, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, in the Lorentz gauge, the potentials satisfy certain wave equations, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, I think the correct expressions for scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge in the context of retarded potentials are:

V(r, t) = [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ (
