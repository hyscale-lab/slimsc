Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of interpreting these spectra. Let's see what the question is about.

The question gives me an unknown organic compound and its 1H NMR data. I need to figure out whether it's one of four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. The options are A, B, C, D respectively.

Hmm, let's start by recalling what these structures look like. All of them are esters since they're named [something] acetate. Acetate is OAc-, right? So the structure would be an ester group attached to a propenyl or butenyl group.

Propenyl is CH₂CH₂CH₂, but wait, propenyl is actually CH₂=CHCH₂-, but it depends on where the double bond is. Wait, propenyl would have a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. So propenyl would be CH₂=CHCH₂-. Similarly, butenyl would have four carbons with a double bond. Butenyl could be either 1,2 (but that's the same as propenyl with an extra CH₂) or 1,3, right? Wait, no. Wait, butenyl is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂- but depending on the position.

Wait, propenyl is CH₂=CHCH₂- as the substituent. But when it's an ester, the structure would be OAc-O-C-CH₂CH=CH₂? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the acetate is OAc-O- attached to the rest of the molecule. Wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-O-R? No, no, wait, the structure of an ester is R-O-CO-R'. So for propenyl acetate, it would be CH₂CH₂CH₂-O-CO-OCH3? Wait no, wait, acetate is OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structures. Let's think:

Propenyl acetate: The propenyl group is CH₂=CHCH₂- attached to the oxygen of the acetate. So
