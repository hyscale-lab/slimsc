Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid. I need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong monobasic acid required, and then determine the pH of the resulting solution. 

First, I'll try to write down what I know. Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble hydroxide. When it dissolves in a strong acid, the acid will react with the hydroxide. Since it's a monobasic strong acid, like HCl, it will donate a proton, and the hydroxide will accept it. So the reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with 3 H+ ions to produce Fe^3+ and 3 H2O. 

The formula for the reaction should be:
Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure about the stoichiometry. Let me think. Iron(III) hydroxide has three OH groups, so each would take a H+ from the acid. So yeah, each Fe(OH)3 needs 3 H+.

The next step is to calculate how much Fe(OH)3 is present. The mass given is 0.1 grams. I need the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 to find out the moles. 

Fe has a molar mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH is 17.01 g/mol (since O is 16 and H is 1). So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(17.01) = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol. 

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles, or 9.36 x 10^-4 moles.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+, the moles of H+ needed will be 3 * 9.36e-4 = 0.002808 moles.

Now, the acid solution is 0.1 M. So the volume (in liters) needed is moles / concentration. 

Volume (L) = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. But wait, since it's a strong acid, it should completely dissociate, so the actual H+ concentration is 0.1 M, so that part checks out.

Wait, but wait a second. Is there anything else involved? Like, after the reaction, the solution's pH depends on the concentration of Fe^3+ ions and any excess H+ from the acid.

So the total volume after adding the acid will be 100 cm³ plus the volume of the acid added. But since the acid volume is about 28 cm³, the total is 128 cm³? Or wait, the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, the question says: "in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution made is 100 cm³. Oh, right. So the acid is added to 100 cm³ of solution. So the total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³. But wait, the initial solution is 100 cm³, and the acid is added to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me re-read.

The problem states:
