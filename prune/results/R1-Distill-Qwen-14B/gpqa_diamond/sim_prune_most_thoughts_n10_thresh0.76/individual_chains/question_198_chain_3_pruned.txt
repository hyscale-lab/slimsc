Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. Let's see what I remember about this topic.

Alright, the problem states we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually tell us the tendency to form complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

So, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ or something like that. Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^(2-), but I'm not entirely sure about the charge.

But wait, the stability constants are given for each level of complexation. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So β1 is [Co(SCN)]^2+ / [Co^2+][SCN^-], I think. Wait, no, stability constant is for each step. So each β represents the formation from the previous complex.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the overall formation constants. So the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^2+ (complexed once), the second is [Co(SCN)2]^2- (wait, no, because each SCN- is -1, so two would be -2, but Co is 2+, so 2+ + 2*(-1) gives 0 charge. Hmm, maybe that's not right. Or perhaps the charge is different. Wait, no, wait. Co(II) is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So for n ligands, the charge would be +2 - n.

Wait, but the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^m+. For n=1, it's [CoSCN]^+; for n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (neutral?), n=3 is [
