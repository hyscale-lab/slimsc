Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the mean free path of gas molecules in an electron microscope. Let me see... I remember that mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Right, so in a vacuum, if the pressure is lower, the mean free path is longer because there are fewer molecules to collide with. 

The scenario here is that Mike has a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. But some gas particles are still there, and he measured the mean free path as λ1. So that's under the ultra-high vacuum conditions, without the electron beam.

But when he turned on the electron beam, he noticed the mean free path changed to λ2. The question is why this happened. Hmm. Wait, when the electron beam is on, electrons are moving through the system. Do these electrons interact with the gas molecules?

I think that when the electron beam is active, the electrons can cause the gas molecules to ionize or maybe even get excited. Oh right, the electrons can scatter off the gas molecules. So the gas molecules might start to move more, or perhaps become charged, which affects their behavior.

Wait, mean free path is also influenced by the pressure. But the pressure here is the same because the compartment's temperature is the same. So that's confusing. Or maybe the pressure isn't the only factor anymore.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, it might cause some gas molecules to be ionized or excited, making them more likely to interact with the beam or the chamber walls. Maybe that changes the effective mean free path.

Alternatively, the electron beam could cause gas molecules to be knocked out of the vacuum—like, the electrons hit the molecules, and the molecules either get ejected or perhaps their movement changes. So if there are more interactions, the mean free path would be shorter. Because the molecules are colliding more frequently.

Wait, but Mike's setup is already in a very high vacuum. So under normal conditions, λ1 is the mean free path without the beam. When the beam is on, perhaps the electrons cause the molecules to move more, increasing their speed or something. But how does that affect the mean free path?

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam might cause the gas particles to
