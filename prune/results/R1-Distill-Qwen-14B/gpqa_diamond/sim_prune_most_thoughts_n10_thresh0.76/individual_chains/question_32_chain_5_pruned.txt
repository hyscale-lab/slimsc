Okay, I have this problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and I'm supposed to find the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, let's see.

So the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, I think Li is Lithium. The standard Lithium isotope is Li-7, which has 3 neutrons because Li has 3 protons, right? So Li-7 has 7 nucleons (3 protons + 4 neutrons?), wait wait no, wait. No, wait, wait, wait. Wait, Li has atomic number 3. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that's a total of 3 + 3 = 6 nucleons. Oh wait, no, wait, wait. No, that's not right. Wait, no: protons plus neutrons equal the mass number. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would be 3 protons (since Li has Z=3) and 3 neutrons, so mass number A=6. So the nucleus is Li-6. Because Li-6 is a common isotope, I think.

So the nucleus is Li-6. So its mass is important for calculating energy.

The problem is about relativistic speeds, so I should probably use the relativistic energy equations. The speed is given as 0.96c. So I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus, which is gamma times the rest mass energy.

First, I need to find gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So with v=0.96c, let me compute that.

Let me compute v²: (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Then the square root is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Hmm, but wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, let me calculate 1 - 0.96^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, yes. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714286.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely. Actually, 0.0784 is 784/10000, so sqrt(784)=28, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

But wait, another approach: since beta (v/c) is 0.96, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). So beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216.

So 1 - beta squared = 0.0784. The square root of that is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857...

So gamma is approximately 3.5714. But I think I should carry more accurate calculations to ensure precision, as the problem says the answer needs to be precise to 1e-4.

So gamma is exactly 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)) = 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.9216)) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me think about this. The mass of a nucleus is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, minus the binding energy (which is accounted for in the mass deficit, but when calculating rest mass energy, we just sum the individual rest masses).

Wait, but for this purpose, maybe it's easier to use the mass of the nucleus directly. So let me find the mass of Li-6.

The standard atomic weight for Li is approximately 6.941 g/mol. Wait, but that's the average for natural lithium, which is a mix of Li-6 and Li-7. Hmm, but in this problem, it's specifically Li with 3 neutrons, so Li-6. So perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it using the masses of protons and neutrons. Let me think: the mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about
