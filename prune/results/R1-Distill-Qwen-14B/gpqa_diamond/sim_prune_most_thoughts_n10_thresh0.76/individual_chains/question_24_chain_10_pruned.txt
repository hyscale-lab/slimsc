Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

First, the problem involves a mixture X which decolorizes bromine water. I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually indicates the presence of alkenes or maybe something else that can react with bromine, like maybe an aromatic ring? But wait, alkenes are more common for that reaction. So mixture X probably contains alkenes.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction and forms mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hmm, platinum is a catalyst for various reactions. If X is an alkene, what would happen when it reacts with H2 (since hydrogenation is involved later)? Oh wait, in the next part, both X and Y are hydrogenated to give Z. So maybe when X is treated with Pt and heat, it's undergoing a different reaction besides hydrogenation.

Wait, the problem says that when X is treated with Pt when heated, it forms Y via disproportionation. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, maybe X contains a compound where the same element is in different oxidation states, leading to disproportionation.

But what's in X that upon heating with Pt would cause this? Oh, maybe X has alkenes and something else. Wait, but X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Oh, perhaps X is a mixture of alkenes and maybe something like an alkyne? Or maybe it's a di-substituted alkene and something else.

Wait, the substances in X don't have conjugated multiple bonds. That's an important point. So no conjugated double bonds. So maybe each molecule in X has a single double bond, not conjugated.

Let me think about the hydrogenation part. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, give Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Let me calculate that. So hydrogen is 14.28%, so the carbon must make up the rest. Let's see: 14.28% is approximately 1/7, because 1/7 is about 14.29%. So, if the mass fraction of H is 1/7, then the formula for Z can be determined.

Let me calculate the molecular formula of Z. Let's say the compound is CnHm. The mass fraction of H is (m * 1)/(12n + m) = 1/7. So, 7m = 12n + m → 6m = 12n → m=2n. So Z must be CnH2n. Which is an alkane? No, because alkanes have H2n+2. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, CnH2n is an alkene, but wait, if it's hydrogenated, so Z is the product after hydrogenation, which would mean that X and Y have double bonds.

Wait, but in X, the mixture has two liquids, each with no conjugated multiple bonds. So each has a single double bond, perhaps. Then, when hydrogenated, each would add H2 across each double bond
