Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay probabilities, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me see... The question is about an atom that hasn't decayed after 50 minutes and we want to find the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The decay constant λ is related to the half-life, right? But wait, here they give the probability of decay within 100 minutes as 32%. So maybe I can use that to find λ first.

The formula for the probability that a nucleus decays within a time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). Oh right! So in this case, P(100) is 32% or 0.32. So I can set up the equation 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). That would let me solve for λ.

Let me rearrange that equation. Subtract 1 from both sides: 0.32 - 1 = -e^(-100λ). So that's -0.68 = -e^(-100λ). Multiply both sides by -1: 0.68 = e^(-100λ). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(0.68) = -100λ. So λ would be -ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating ln(0.68) – wait, ln(0.68) is a negative number since it's less than 1. Let me think, 0.68 is about e^(-0.4), because e^(-0.4) is approximately 0.6703, which is close. So ln(0.68) is around -0.4005. So λ ≈ 0.4005 / 100 = 0.004005 per minute.

Now, the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes. So we're looking at the next 150 minutes. Wait, does that mean from now, 50 minutes after the start, we're considering the next 150? Or the total time is 50 +150=200 minutes? Hmm, no, the way the question is phrased, 50 minutes
