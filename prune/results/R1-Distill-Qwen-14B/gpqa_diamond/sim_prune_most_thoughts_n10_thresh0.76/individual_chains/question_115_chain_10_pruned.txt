Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, alright, the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce photons, typically gamma rays. But let's think carefully about the setup.

So, the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, both annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factors... right, the Lorentz factor gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²). So gamma tells us about the total energy relative to rest mass. For an electron, the rest mass is about 0.511 MeV/c². But since we're dealing with energy and momentum, maybe we need to consider their relativistic momenta and energies.

But when the electron and positron annihilate, the total energy and momentum before collision must equal the total after. So the system's center of momentum frame might be important here.

Let me try to break it down. First, the electron and positron are moving towards each other on the same axis. So their velocities are opposite in direction. Let's set up a coordinate system where the electron is moving along the positive x-direction, and the positron along the negative x-direction.

Wait, wait. The problem states the electron is moving from the left, so if our coordinate system has x to the right, then the electron is moving along positive x. The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is negative x direction.

So, Lorentz factors: gamma_e =4 for the electron, gamma_p=2 for the positron. But wait, a positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, so it has the same mass. So the same rest mass energy, 0.511 MeV each.

But wait, in terms of momentum, each particle's momentum is gamma*m*v. But since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta will be opposite in sign. So the total momentum before collision would be the sum of their individual momenta.

Hmm, but
