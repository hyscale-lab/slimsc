Okay, so I have this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term, and the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Hmm, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm trying to parse this. So X is the boson field, and the interaction term involves fermions ψ_f. So the interaction is between X and these fermions.

The boson X is probably a scalar since the Lagrangian doesn't show any derivatives, just X(y), which suggests it's a field with no kinetic term here. So X is a spin-0 particle.

The mass is 6 GeV. I remember that for a decay to be possible, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. Oh, but wait, that's only if the decay is into massive particles. If it's into massless particles (like photons), then the condition is different.

Wait, so the decay products here would be fermion-antifermion pairs. So, X can decay into a pair of fermions and their antiparticles. So X → f f̄.

So which fermions can X decay into? Well, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So for each fermion f, the mass of f must be less than 3 GeV because each f and f̄ would contribute to the total mass. Because 2m_f ≤ M_X. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but what are the masses of the known fermions? Let me think. The fermions are quarks and leptons.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But their masses are tricky because they're current masses. For example, up and down are around 2-5 MeV, so way below 3 GeV. Strange is about 100 MeV, charm is about 1.5 GeV, bottom is around 4.5 GeV, top is way heavier, like 173 GeV.

Leptons: electrons, muons, taus, and their neutrinos. Electrons are ~0.0005 GeV, mu about 0.1, tau is ~1.77 GeV, and neutrinos are almost massless, but I think we can ignore them here.

Wait, but in the Lagrangian, the interaction term is -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, no, actually, I think the term is more like a Yukawa coupling, similar to the Higgs interaction. So the term is like X ψ_f ψ_f, so the interaction is X coupling to a fermion-antifermion pair.

So for X to decay into f f̄, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of f. Because each fermion has mass m_f, so 2m_f ≤ M_X.

Wait, but the X is a boson, so it's a particle. For it to decay into two particles, their combined rest mass must be less than or equal to M_X. But in the case where the fermion is at rest, the minimum energy required is 2m_f. So if M_X ≥ 2m_f, then decay is possible.

So let's list all the fermions and their masses:

- Up quark: ~2 MeV → 2m_u = 4 MeV << 6 GeV → allowed.
- Down quark: ~5 MeV → 2m_d = 10 MeV << allowed.
- Strange quark: ~100 MeV → 2m_s = 200 MeV << allowed.
- Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV → 2
