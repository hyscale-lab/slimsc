Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question about a peptidic compound. Hmm, let me try to break this down. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the scenario is that someone's analyzing a small peptide that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar chemical shifts and equal integrals, adding up to one proton. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So what's going on here?

Let me think about each part. First, the NMR part. The alpha-proton is the one attached to the carbonyl group in an amino acid, right? In a pure sample, each alpha proton should show as a single peak unless something is splitting it. But here, there are two peaks for the same proton. Wait, but the integrals add to 1H. So maybe it's a case where the proton is coupled to another proton that's diastereotopic or something. Or perhaps there's some kind of symmetry or exchange happening.

The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So maybe it's not a simple J-coupling scenario. Hmm. Another possibility is that the compound exists in some kind of conformer that's rapidly interconverting. But then why would that cause two peaks? Or maybe it's a diastereomer?

Wait, let's think about what the LC-MS shows. Two peaks with the same mass, same spectrum. So the molecular weight is the same. That suggests that it's not a larger molecule but the same compound. So maybe it's a diastereomer? Because diastereomers have different physical properties but same molecular formula. Enantiomers would have same mass but would co-elute in some cases, but maybe here they're not, so why two peaks?

Wait, but the question says LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass. So if it's enantiomers, but the LC would separate them if the column is chiral. Oh, but if the LC is achiral, then enantiomers would elute together. Hmm. So the fact that two peaks are seen suggests that we have diastereomers, which would have different retention times. Because diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would run at different times on the LC. But both have the same mass, so same molecular formula.

Wait, but the NMR is showing two peaks for the same proton. Let me think about diastereomers. Diastereomers have different configurations, so maybe the alpha protons are in different environments. But if the molecule is symmetric, perhaps the alpha protons are in equivalent positions, but that seems unlikely for a peptide. Alternatively, maybe another kind of isomerism.

Another possibility is that the sample is racemic. If the sample is a racemic mixture, then the enantiomers would have the same NMR spectrum because they're mirror images. Wait, but in an achiral environment, they would have the same NMR peaks. So if the NMR shows two separate peaks, that might not fit. Unless... wait, but the question says the NMR is consistent except for these two peaks. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR has
