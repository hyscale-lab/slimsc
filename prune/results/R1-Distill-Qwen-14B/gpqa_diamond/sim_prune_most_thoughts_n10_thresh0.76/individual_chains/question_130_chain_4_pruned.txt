Okay, so I have this question about quasars and neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I remember that quasars emit a lot of light, including at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. That's in the ultraviolet range, right? But wait, when this light passes through a cloud of neutral hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs it, creating what's called the Lyman-alpha forest. 

The question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. So, I think the key here is figuring out at what redshift the Lyman-alpha emission (or absorption) moves into the optical range that telescopes can see.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. The Lyman-alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nanometers, so that's in the far ultraviolet. But if the quasar is at a high redshift, the light we receive from it is shifted into longer wavelengths. So, the absorbed light (from the hydrogen cloud in front) would shift into the optical range when the redshift is high enough.

But wait, ground-based optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs it. So, only light that's shifted into the visible spectrum (say, 400 nm and above) would be detectable. So the Lyman-alpha absorption line at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm) would need to be redshifted into the optical range, which is about
