Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully and then break it down.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K.

The main part of the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Titanium (Ti) in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is understanding how the ratio of populations of two energy levels in an atom is affected by temperature. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the population ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energy levels, and T is the temperature.

Wait, right. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1. Assuming that the energy difference is the same in both cases (with and without spots), the only variable here is T.

So when the star has spots, the effective temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K. Oh wait, but effective temperature is a measure of the total emitted radiation, so when part of the surface is cooler (spots), the overall Teff is lower. But for the photosphere, perhaps we're considering the temperature of the unspotted regions as higher? Or perhaps the effective temperature is the average, but the actual temperatures of the photosphere's emitting regions are different.

Wait, but the problem states that when the surface is not covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So I think that the spots are cooler regions, which when covering part of the surface, cause the overall emission to be lower. So when the spots are present, the effective temperature (as observed) is 5500 K.

But wait, does the photosphere's temperature change? Because the spots are on the surface, so the underlying photosphere's temperature might be the same as before? Or perhaps the spots are actually cooler regions within the photosphere. Hmm, the problem says that when the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So I think that the effective temperature of the entire photosphere (including spots) is 5500 K, meaning that the average temperature is lower.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The effective temperature is determined by the total luminosity and radius. The star
