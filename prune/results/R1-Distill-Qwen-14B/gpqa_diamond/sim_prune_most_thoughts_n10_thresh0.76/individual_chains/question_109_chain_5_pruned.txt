Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. The system is in a 1S0 state, which means it's a singlet state with orbital angular momentum L=0 and spin S=0. Wait, no, wait, the notation is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would mean 2S+1=1 → S=0, L=0? Wait, but no, S is the orbital angular momentum in spectroscopic notation... Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The term symbol is usually written as (2S+1)LJ, where S is the total spin, L is the orbital angular momentum, and J is the total angular momentum. So 1S0 would mean 2S+1=1 → S=0, L=0 (since S is the orbital, perhaps? Wait, no, wait, I think I'm mixing up letters. Let me think again. The term symbol is (2s+1)ΛJ, where Λ is the orbital angular momentum (like S, P, D... which are l=0,1,2...), and s is the spin. So 1S0 would have s=0, Λ=0 (since S is the first letter after 1), and J=0. So the initial state is S=0 (spin), L=0 (orbital), J=0.

The system emits a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. The Pauli statistics condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is the isospin of the NN system, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So T = S + L + 1 (all mod 2). 

The final NN state has T=0. So, substituting, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must be such that their sum is odd.

Now, the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options involve various transitions where the NN system goes from 1S
