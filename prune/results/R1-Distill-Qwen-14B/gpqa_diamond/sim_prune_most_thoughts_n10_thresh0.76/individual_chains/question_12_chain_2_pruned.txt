Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me read it again.

The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The Pi(+) is at rest, and I know its rest mass is 139.6 MeV, while the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. The options are given for the kinetic energies of each product.

Wait, I remember that in such decay processes, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum after the decay should be zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

But wait, neutrinos are a bit tricky. I think their rest mass is considered negligible, especially for particles like neutrinos which are very light, maybe even massless. So maybe we can treat the neutrino as a massless particle in this case.

Let me outline what I know:

- Pion (Pi+) is at rest, so initial momentum is zero.
- After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta: p_mu = p_nu.

But since the neutrino is massless, its energy E_nu is equal to its momentum magnitude times c (but since we're dealing in natural units where c=1, E_nu = p_nu). For the muon, its energy is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy: E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. But again, using MeV and natural units, E_mu = 105.7 MeV + K_mu.

Wait, but how do I proceed from here? Let's think about energy and momentum conservation.

The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion, since it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So:

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu

Which gives:

139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + E_nu.

And for momentum conservation, the magnitudes are equal: p_mu = p_nu = p
