Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question is about three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3) discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. They have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things a bit. The problem gives me ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and I need to find out by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

The given data:
- Temperature ratio Planet1 to Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So, T1/T2 = 1.4.
- Temperature ratio Planet2 to Planet3 is approximately 2.3. So, T2/T3 = 2.3.
- Mass ratio Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15. So, M1/M2 = 1.15.
- Mass ratio Planet2 to Planet3 is approximately 1.35. So, M2/M3 = 1.35.

Albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth. Hmm, albedo affects how much light a planet reflects. Since all are the same, maybe it cancels out in the equations.

The question is about the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. So, I need to find Period3 / Period1. 

I remember that for planets, Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, where M is the mass of the star. But wait, in this problem, we don't know anything about the star's mass, right? But all three planets are orbiting the same star, so the star's mass is the same for all. So when comparing the periods, the star's mass will cancel out.

But wait, Kepler's law in terms of the planet's period is P² proportional to a³/(M), where M is the mass of the star. So for all three planets, P² ∝ a³/(M). Since M is the same, the ratio of their periods squared is proportional to (a³) ratios.

So, first, I need to relate the equilibrium temperatures to the semi-major axes.

The equilibrium temperature formula is T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ a²)]^0.25, where L is the star's luminosity, a is the semi-major axis, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since all planets have the same albedo (a=0.3), and same star (so L is same for all), the temperature depends on the planet's distance a.

Wait, actually, the formula I remember is T = [ (L (1 - albedo) )/(16 π σ a²) ]^1/4. So, since albedo is the same for all, and L is same, T is inversely proportional to a^(1/2). Because if you solve for T, it's proportional to (L/(a²))^0.25. So T ∝ 1/(a^0.5).

So, T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). Which means a ∝ 1/T².

Wait, let me double-check. If T = k / sqrt(a), where k is some constant (since L and albedo are same for all), then a = (k / T)^2. So a is proportional to 1/T².

So, the semi-major axis a is proportional to 1/(T^2). So, for each planet, a1, a2, a3 can be written in terms of their temperatures.

Given the temperature ratios, we can find the ratios of their semi-major axes.

First, let's find the ratio a1/a2. From T1/T2 = 1.4, and since a ∝ 1/T², a1/a2 = (T2² / T1²) = (1/1.4²) = 1/(1.96) ≈ 0.5102. So a1 is about 0.51 times a2.

Similarly, the ratio a2/a3 comes from T2/T3 = 2.3. So a2/a3 = (T3² / T2²) = 1/(2.3²) ≈ 1/5.29 ≈ 0.189. So a2 ≈ 0.189 * a3. Alternatively, a3 is about a2 / 0.189 ≈ 5.29 a2.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me see. Since a is proportional to 1/T², so a1 = k/(T1)^2, a2 = k/(T2)^2, etc. So a1/a2 = (T2^2)/(T1^2) = (T2/T1)^2. So if T1 is 1.4 T2, T2 = T1 /1.4. So T2^2 is (T1^2)/(1.96), so a1/a2 = (1/1.96) ≈ 0.51.

Then the a2/a3 ratio from T2/T3 = 2.3. So T2=2.3 T3. So a2 = (k/(T2)^2) = k/( (2.3 T3)^2 ) = k/(5.29 T3^2). Similarly, a3 = k/(T3^2). So a2/a3 = (k/(5.29 T3^2)) / (k/(T3^2)) )= 1/5.29 ≈ 0.189. So a3 = a2 / 0.189 ≈ 5.29 a2.

Wait, but I'm trying to find a1 and a3 in terms of a2. a1 is 0.51 a2. a3 is 5.29 a2. So a3 is about 5.29 / 0.51 ≈ 10.37 times a1. So a3 ≈ 10.37 a1.

Wait, let me compute that. 5.29 / 0.51 is approximately 10.37. So a3 is about 10.37 times a1.

Now, the orbital period is given by Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³/(M_star). Since all are around the same star, M_star is same, so P² ∝ a³. So P ∝ a^(3/2).

So, the ratio P3/P1 is (a3/a1)^(3/2).

We've found a3/a1 ≈10.37, so (10.37)^(3/2).

What is 10.37^(3/2)? Let's calculate. The square root of 10.37 is about 3.22, and then cube that: 3.22^3 ≈ 3.22 *3.22 = 10.36, then 10.36 *3.22 ≈ 33.35. So P3/P1 ≈33.35. So approximately 33.4.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the a ratios.

Alternative approach: Let's compute the ratios step by step.

Given that T1/T2 = 1.4 → T2 = T1/1.4.

T2/T3=2.3 → T3 = T2/2.3 = (T1/1.4)/2.3 = T1/(1.4*2.3) = T1/(3.22).

So, T3 = T1 /3.22.

Since a ∝ 1/T^2, so a1 = k/T1^2, a2 =k/(T2)^2 =k/( (T1/1.4) )^2 = (1.4)^2 k/(T1)^2 = 1.96 a1.

Wait, wait no. Because a1 is proportional to 1/(T1^2). So a2 is proportional to 1/(T2^2) = 1/( (T1/1.4) )^2 = (1.4)^2 * (1/T1^2) = 1.96 a1. So a2 = 1.96 a1.

Similarly, a3 = 1/(T3)^2 *k = 1/( (T1/3.22) )^2 *k = (3.22)^2 * (1/T1^2)*k = 10.3684 a1. So a3 ≈10.3684 a1.

So the ratio a3/a1 is approximately 10.37.

Then, using Kepler's law: P² ∝ a³ → P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(3/2).

Compute 10.37^(1/2) = sqrt(10.37) ≈3.22. Then cube that: 3.22^3.

Compute 3.22 *3.22 = 10.3684. Then 10.3684 *3.22 ≈ 33.35.

So P3/P1 ≈33.35, which is about 33.4. So option D is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the problem, the masses were given. Oh wait, the problem gives the mass ratios between the planets. So M1/M2 =1.15, M2/M3=1.35. So M1 =1.15 M2, M3 = M2 /1.35 ≈0.7407 M2. So M3 = 0.7407 M2, but M1=1.15 M2.

But wait, Kepler's law is about the period depending on the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. The planet's mass doesn't come into Kepler's third law. So the planet's mass doesn't affect the period. Because the period is determined by the star's mass and the planet's distance. So I think the mass ratios given in the problem are a red herring. They don't affect the orbital period. So I can ignore them.

So the answer is D, ~33.4.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use Kepler's third law and the relationship between equilibrium temperature and semi-major axis.

### Key Information:
1. **Temperature Ratios**:
   - \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \)
   - \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \)
   From these, \( T_3 = T_1 / (1.4 \cdot 2.3) = T_1 / 3.22 \).

2. **Semi-Major Axis Relation**:
   The equilibrium temperature formula shows \( T \propto 1 / \sqrt{a} \), or equivalently \( a \propto 1 / T^2 \). Using the temperature ratios:
   - \( a_1 / a_2 = (T_2 / T_1)^2 = (1 / 1.4)^2 \approx 0.5102 \)
   - \( a_2 / a_3 = (T_3 / T_2)^2 = (1 / 2.3)^2 \approx 0.189 \)

   Combining these:
   \[
   a_3 / a_1 = (a_3 / a_2) \cdot (a_2 / a_1) = (1 / 0.189) \cdot (1 / 0.5102) \approx 10.37
   \]

3. **Orbital Period Relation**:
   Kepler's third law states \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), so:
   \[
   P_3 / P_1 = (a_3 / a_1)^{3/2}
   \]
   Substituting \( a_3 / a_1 \approx 10.37 \):
   \[
   P_3 / P_1 = (10.37)^{3/2}
   \]
   First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.37} \approx 3.22 \). Then:
   \[
   (10.37)^{3/2} = 3.22^3 \approx 33.35
   \]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.

### Final Answer:
The mass ratios provided do not affect the orbital period, as Kepler's law depends only on the semi-major axis and the star's mass (which is constant for all planets). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
