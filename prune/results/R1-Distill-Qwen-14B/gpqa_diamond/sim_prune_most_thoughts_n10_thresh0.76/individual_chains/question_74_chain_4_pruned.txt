Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question is about the probability that a particular atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for the first 50 minutes. 

Wait, right, radioactive decay is a random process. Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and the key thing is that the decay of an atom is independent of its age. So whether it's been sitting for 50 minutes or not, the probability in the next period should be based on the remaining time.

The problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, is that the probability for the entire 100 minutes, or is it the decay constant or something else? Oh, wait, I think it's the probability that the atom decays within the first 100 minutes. So after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it has decayed, which implies that the decay constant lambda is such that 1 - e^(-lambda * t) = 0.32 for t=100.

Wait, no, the decay probability over a time t is P = 1 - e^(-Î»t). So if P for t=100 is 32% (0.32), then we can solve for lambda.

But wait, the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. But since 50 minutes have already passed, the remaining time is
