Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I need to find the energy. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a particle in a collider is related to its velocity. Since the speed is given as a fraction of the speed of light, relativistic effects must be considered. So I should probably use the relativistic energy equations.

Wait, the nucleus is moving at 0.96c. I think the energy here refers to the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So I can compute gamma first.

Let me write that down: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's plug that in. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2, which is 0.9216. Then 1 minus that is 0.0784. Taking the square root of that gives sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that. Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 times 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is 1/0.28. Wait, 1 divided by 0.28. Let me compute that. 0.28 is 28/100, which simplifies to 7/25. So 1 divided by 7/25 is 25/7, which is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus X. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Li typically has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that's a total of 6 nucleons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the atomic number of Lithium is 3, which means 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6. So the mass of the nucleus is the mass of Li-6.

But wait, alternatively, the nucleus could be referring to the mass number. Wait, the problem says Li with 3 neutrons. So Li-6, because natural Li is mostly Li-7, but this is Li-6. So the mass would be approximately the mass of 6 nucleons.

Wait, each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a mass of about 938 MeV/c². So 6 nucleons would be 6 * 938 MeV. Let me compute that. 6 * 938 is 5628 MeV. Converting that to GeV, that
