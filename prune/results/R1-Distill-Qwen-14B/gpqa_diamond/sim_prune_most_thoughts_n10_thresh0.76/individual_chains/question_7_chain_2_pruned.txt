Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the CMB photons. Hmm, I need to find out the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime is limited by this process. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The process given is gamma gamma -> e+ e-. So high-energy gamma-rays (let's say from a source) are annihilating with the CMB photons. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. Wait, that's like a very small energy, which makes sense because the CMB is microwave radiation, so low energy photons.

I remember that the lifetime of a particle is limited by processes that can cause it to decay. In this case, the gamma-rays are annihilating with CMB photons. So the gamma-ray's lifetime would depend on the probability of this annihilation happening. If the probability is high enough, the gamma-ray will annihilate quickly, so its lifetime is limited by this process.

I think the key here is to find the energy where the mean free time (the average time between interactions) equals the age of the universe. But wait, the age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years, or roughly 4.3e17 seconds. But I'm not sure if that's directly needed here.

Alternatively, I might need to consider the photon density of the CMB. Since the CMB is everywhere, the gamma-ray is constantly interacting with these photons. The cross-section for the annihilation process would play a role here.

The cross-section for pair production (gamma + photon -> e+ e-) is something I might need. I recall that for such a process, the cross-section depends on the energy of the gamma photon and the target photon. Wait, but each photon has a certain energy, so perhaps we can model this using the photon density and the cross-section.

The formula for the mean free time tau is given by tau = 1/(n * sigma * v), where n is the number density of target photons, sigma is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity. But wait, photons are moving in all directions, so maybe the cross-section already accounts for the relative velocity?

Alternatively, I've heard of the formula for the interaction rate, which is Gamma = n * sigma * v. The mean free time would be the inverse of Gamma.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula here. Let's think about the process. For pair production, the cross-section has
