Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to how much energy a planet absorbs from its star and how much it radiates back. The formula I think is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσd²) )^0.5 )... Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh right, the basic formula is T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_eff is the star's effective temperature, R its radius, and a the planet's orbital distance. But maybe there's a simpler way when comparing planets around the same star.

Wait, the question says the planets are in orbital resonance and have periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So the periods are 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 5 units. I think the orbital period relates to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. The law states that (a^3) / (P^2) = constant (for same star). So a is proportional to P^(2/3). Oh, right, because for a planet, a³ is proportional to P². So the semi-major axis can be found by taking P^(2/3). 

But wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's albedo, and the distance. The formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), but I think when the star is the same for all planets, and albedo is the same (as given here), the ratio of their temperatures would depend only on their distances. So I can simplify it. 

Since all planets are around the same star, the effective temperature is the same for the star. So the equilibrium temperature of each planet is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. Because T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a). So the ratio of temperatures would be sqrt(a2/a1), wait, no, wait: T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). So if Planet A is at a larger a, it's colder, so lower T.

So what I need is the ratio T4 / T2. Since T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), the ratio is sqrt(a2 / a4). Because a2 is the semi-major axis of planet 2, a4 of planet4.

But first, I need to find the semi-major axes of planet2 and planet4. Since a is proportional to P^(2/3), as per Kepler's third law. So for each planet, a = k * P^(2/3), where k is a constant.

So for planet2, P2 is 2, and planet4, P4 is 3.5. So a2 = k*(2)^(2/3), a4 = k*(3.5)^(2/3).

The ratio a2/a4 is (2/3.5)^(2/3). Let me compute that.

Wait, 2 divided by 3.5 is 0.5714 (since 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714). So (0.5714)^(2/3). Let me calculate that.

But wait, 0.5714 is roughly 4/7. Let's compute (4/7)^(2/3). Hmm, I can think of this as the cube root of (4/7)^2. Alternatively, take natural logs. Let me think:

Let x = (4/7)^(2/3). Taking ln, ln x = (2/3)(ln(4) - ln(7)). 

Compute ln(4)=1.3863, ln(7)=1.9459. So ln x = (2/3)(1.3863 - 1.9459) = (2/3)*(-0.5596) ≈ -0.3731. Then exponentiate: x ≈ e^(-0.3731) ≈ 0.687. Wait, but wait, that's (4/7)^(2/3) which is a2/a4. So a2/a4 = (2/3.5)^(2/3) ≈ 0.687.

Wait that would make the ratio a2/a4 ≈ 0.687. So the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is sqrt(a2/a4). Because T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), T2 is 1/sqrt(a2). So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) / sqrt(a4/a2) ? Wait no, let me think again.

Wait, T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T2 = (1/sqrt(a2)) * constant, T4 = (1/sqrt(a4)) * same constant. So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4). Because if you take T4/T2 = [1/sqrt(a4)]/[1/sqrt(a2)] = sqrt(a2/a4).

So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(0.687) ≈ sqrt(0.687). What's sqrt of 0.687? Let me compute. 

0.8^2=0.64, 0.83^2=0.6889. Oh, wait, that's very close. 0.83 squared is 0.6889, which is about 0.687. So sqrt(0.687)≈0.83.

So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps. First, the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So P2 is 2 units, P4 is 3.5 units. 

Then a2 = (P2)^(2/3), a4 = (P4)^(2/3). So the ratio a2/a4 = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3). 4/7 is about 0.5714.

Wait, earlier calculation said (4/7)^(2/3) is approximately 0.687. So sqrt(0.687) is about 0.828, which is approximately 0.83. So the ratio is ~0.83, which is option C.

Wait another thing, because the period is proportional to a^(3/2), so a is proportional to P^(2/3). Correct.

So the approach seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be C, 0.83.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis \( a \), i.e., \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \). Since the planets are around the same star and have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on their orbital distances.

From Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( 2/3 \), i.e., \( a \propto P^{2/3} \). The orbital periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4 are given as 2 and 3.5 units, respectively. Thus, the ratio of their semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{2}{3.5} \), we get \( \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \). Therefore:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} = (0.5714)^{2/3}.
\]

To compute \( (0.5714)^{2/3} \), we take the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(0.5714^{2/3}\right) = \frac{2}{3} \ln(0.5714),
\]

where \( \ln(0.5714) \approx -0.5596 \). Thus:

\[
\ln\left(0.5714^{2/3}\right) = \frac{2}{3}(-0.5596) \approx -0.3731.
\]

Exponentiating this result gives:

\[
0.5714^{2/3} \approx e^{-0.3731} \approx 0.687.
\]

Now, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is given by:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{0.687}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{0.687} \), we find:

\[
\sqrt{0.687} \approx 0.828.
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \). Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) ~0.83**
