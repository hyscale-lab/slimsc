Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on some spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the given information. The compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.

Starting with the FTIR data: there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but if it's very broad, maybe it's an -OH group. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 peak suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak could be an aromatic ring (C=C stretching), or maybe another carbonyl like an amide, but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Hmm.

Looking at the NMR data: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond, perhaps conjugated with something else, like a carbonyl.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I'm trying to think what fragments give m/z 45. Common fragments include the methyl group (15), but that's not 45. Oh wait, maybe it's a (CH3)2O fragment, which is 45. Or perhaps a (CH3)3C·+ fragment? No, that's 57. Alternatively, maybe a COOCH3 group, but the mass of that is 60 (COO is 44, CH3 is 15; 44+15=59, but wait, the exact mass would be different, but perhaps the molecular ion could lose some parts. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH3COO·, which is 59. Or wait, maybe it's a (CH2)2O group? Let me think: CH2CH2O would be 45
