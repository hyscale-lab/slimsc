Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle annihilation. Hmm, let me think. The process is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two particles each of charge + and -. Interesting.

The question is about finding the velocity of particle A. Oh wait, the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I remember that in particle physics, masses are often given in energy units like MeV, and we can relate that to the rest mass energy.

Wait, but the setup is about a collision between a proton and an antiproton. Since they're annihilating, their energy must go into creating the A particles. I think conservation of energy and momentum will come into play here. But wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe we can approximate something here. Oh, right, when a particle is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So the kinetic energy is negligible compared to rest energy.

So, let's consider the initial and final states. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Their rest masses are the same, about 938 MeV/c² each. So combined, their rest energy is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. But wait, the problem gives m_A c² as 300 MeV. Each A particle has mass 300 MeV, so four of them (2 A+ and
