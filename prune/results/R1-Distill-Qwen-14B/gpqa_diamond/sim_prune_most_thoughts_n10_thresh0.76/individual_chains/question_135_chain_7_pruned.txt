Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. The question is about the allowed decay modes of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure how that plays into the decay options, so maybe I should focus more on the masses and what particles can be produced.

Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So when it decays, the combined mass of the particles it decays into must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, the rest mass of the parent must be at least equal to the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. That's a basic rule. So I need to check the masses of each fermion pair that X can decay into.

Looking at the options, each one lists possible fermion-antifermion pairs. Let's think about the masses of these particles. For example, bottom quarks (b) are really heavy, right? Their mass is around 4.5 GeV or so. If X is 6 GeV, then b and anti-b would sum to about 9 GeV. Oh wait, that's more than 6, so that's not allowed. So any decay option with b quarks would be kinematically forbidden. So options A and D can be eliminated because they include b\bar{b}.

Wait, no, wait a second. Because when a particle is at rest, the decay products have to have a combined rest mass less than or equal to the parent's. But actually, the kinetic energy comes into play. Wait, no, the threshold for decay is when the parent is at rest, and the decay products are at rest. So the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to the parent's mass. Because at threshold, the decay products have no kinetic energy. So if the parent's mass is exactly equal to the sum of the decay products, the decay is possible. If it's higher, then yes, but if lower, it's not allowed.

So, for each fermion pair in the options, I need to find their masses and see if 2m ≤ 6 GeV.

Let me list the fermion masses:

Electron (e): very light, about 0.0005 GeV. So 2m ≈ 0.001 GeV. That's way below 6 GeV. So e+ e- decay is allowed.

Same for muon (μ): about 0.1 GeV. 2*0.1=0.2 GeV. Also allowed.

Tau (τ): much heavier. Tau mass is about 1.78 GeV. So 2*1.78 ≈ 3.56 GeV. That's under 6 GeV. So tau+ tau- decay is allowed.

Quarks: let's see.

Up (u) and down (d) quarks:轻子轻，u约2.2 MeV，d约4.7 MeV，合起来远小于6 GeV，没问题。所以uū和dđ都是允许的。

Strange (s) quark: around
