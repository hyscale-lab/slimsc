Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The problem states that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π). Oh wait, S is another matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are similar. Oh right, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]] which is exactly S here. So S is the sigma y matrix.

Wait, wait, but the problem says Ay = c·S, so that's like Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. So substituting S, Ay would be:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Right, eigenvalues come from solving det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So let's write Ay - a I:

Ay - a I = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] - [[a, 0], [0, a]]

Which becomes:

[[-a, (h/(4π))*(-i)],
 [(h/(4π))*i, -a]]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero. So the determinant is:

[(-a)(-a) ] - [ (h/(4π))*(-i) * (h/(4π))*i ) ] = 0

Calculating each part:

First term: a².

Second term: (h/(4π))² * (-i)(i) = (h²/(16 π²)) * (-i²) because (-i)(i) is -i². Since i² is -1, this becomes (h²/(16 π²)) * (1) = h²/(16 π²).

So the equation is:

a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0

So, a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π)

Wait, because sqrt(h²/(16 π²)) is h/(4 π). So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4 π) and a = -h/(4 π).

Looking at the options, let's see the eigenvalue statements. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2π h, which doesn't make sense because our a is real. So A is out. Option B says imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1, but our eigenvalues are real and of the form h/(4π). So B's probably not right either.

Wait, but wait: the problem states the eigenvalue equation as Ay(φ) = a(φ), so a is an eigenvalue. So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4 π). So the options that say the eigenvalues are purely real and those values would be correct.

Looking at the options again. Option A has an imaginary part, which can't be right, because the matrix Ay is Hermitian. Wait, is Ay Hermitian? Because S is Hermitian. S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian because S† = S. And c is a real scalar, so Ay = c S is Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues should be real. So any option that says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is wrong. So A and B can be dismissed because they mention imaginary parts.

So that leaves options C and D.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Hmm. A^2 is the square of the angular momentum operator. For spin-1/2 particles, A² would be (ħ^2) times the identity matrix, because S^2 is (ħ²/4) I for spin-1/2. Wait, wait, let's think.

Wait, the spin angular momentum operators (like Sx, Sy, Sz) satisfy S² = (s(s+1)) ħ² I. For a muon, which has spin 1/2, s=½, so S² = (½)(½+1) ħ² I = (3/4) ħ² I.

But A is the Y-component, which is a scaled version of Sy. Wait, the intrinsic angular momentum operator is usually denoted as J, but here it's A. But the problem says A = c·S, so S is the matrix for the spin angular momentum, perhaps.

So A² would be (c·S)^2 = c² S². Since S² is (3/4) ħ² I, then A² would be c² (3/4) ħ² I. So any eigenfunction of Ay would also be an eigenfunction of A² because A² is a multiple of the identity matrix. So the eigenfunctions of Ay would also be eigenfunctions of A², because any vector is an eigenvector of the identity matrix.

But what about Az? Az is the Z-component of the angular momentum operator. The eigenfunctions of Ay and Az might not be the same, because they are different components. So, for example, if φ is an eigenvector of Ay, is it also an eigenvector of Az? Generally, no. Because they don't commute except when they share eigenstates. So if Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions won't be the same. So the eigenfunctions of Ay cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. So option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That sounds correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Wait, the eigenfunctions form a basis, but any operator's eigenvectors (if they are complete) can form a basis. But matrix operators in 2x2 would have two eigenvectors (assuming they are distinct eigenvalues) which form a basis for C². So if Ay has two distinct eigenvalues, its eigenvectors would form a basis. So D is correct, but I'm not sure if that's the point the option is making.

Wait, the option says "the eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors span the space, so they form a basis. So D's statement is correct.

Now, considering the options. I think I need to evaluate which statement is correct during the calculation.

We have to determine which statements are correct during the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Well, since the operator is 2x2, and assuming it has two eigenvalues (which it does because it's a 2x2 matrix with distinct eigenvalues), the eigenvectors will form a basis. So yes, option D is correct. So during the calculation, that statement would be considered correct.

But let's go back to option C. It says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. We already established that A² is a multiple of the identity, so any state is an eigenstate of A². So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A².

So option C is correct as well.

Wait, so both C and D are correct statements? But the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation, so perhaps only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the statements.

Wait, wait. Let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

I think that's correct because any function is an eigenfunction of A² (since it's a multiple of identity), but not of Az, since Az and Ay don't commute.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

I think that is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis. So which one is correct?

Wait, but the problem is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct?

Wait, but looking at the options, only one can be correct. So perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, the question says "which statement below will you consider to be correct?" So I have to choose the correct one from the options.

So between C and D.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That is, the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, and we have two eigenvectors, they indeed form a basis. So D is correct.

Option C is also correct as per our previous analysis.

Wait, but looking again at the eigenvalues: they are real,  ±h/(4π). So the options A and B are incorrect because A and B discuss imaginary parts.

So if options C and D are correct, but the problem only gives four options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering option C. Let me think again.

If a function is an eigenfunction of Ay, can it be an eigenfunction of Az? The angular momentum components don't commute, so typically, they cannot share eigenfunctions unless the state is a simultaneous eigenstate. But since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different.

Wait, wait, in quantum mechanics, for spin-1/2, the eigenstates of Sy are not the same as those of Sz. So if a state is an eigenstate of Sy (Ay), it's not an eigenstate of Sz (Az). So option C is correct.

So both C and D are correct statements. But wait, looking at the options, perhaps option D is a fact that is generally true, but the question is about what is correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking which statement is correct during the process of calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which would involve knowing that the eigenvectors form a basis, making D correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because during the calculation, the eigenvectors are found as the basis for the operator.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me think about each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

As I thought earlier, since A² is a multiple of I, any eigenfunction of Ay is an eigenfunction of A². So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That is, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space on which Ay acts. Since it's a 2x2 matrix and we have two eigenvalues, their eigenvectors (assuming they are linearly independent) form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but perhaps this is about whether the eigenfunctions form a basis for the matrix, not the space. The matrix is 2x2, so any pair of eigenvectors (which are 2D vectors) would form a basis. So D is correct.

So both C and D are correct? But the options are presented as four choices, and the problem states the correct option is one of them.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option C.

Wait, another thought: For a spin-1/2 system, the square of the angular momentum operator (A²) is ( (h/(4π))² ) * S². Since S² is (3/4)(h^2) I for spin-1/2 (because S² = s(s+1) ħ² I, and s=1/2, so 3/4 ħ² I). So A² would be (h²/(16 π²)) * (3/4 h²) I. Wait, no, wait: The S matrix in the problem is the Pauli matrix, which has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for spin-1/2. So S² would be ( (ħ/2)^2 ) I. Wait, S is the spin operator matrix, so S^2 would be ( (ħ/2)^2 ) times I, because for spin-1/2, S² = (s(s+1)) ħ² I = ( (1/2)(3/2) ) ħ² I = (3/4) ħ² I.

So A = c S, where c = h/(4π). So A^2 = c² S² = (h²/(16 π²)) * (3/4) ħ² I.

But wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again: For spin-1/2, the eigenvalues of S are ± ħ/2. So S² has eigenvalues (ħ/2)^2 = ħ²/4. So S² is (ħ²/4) I.

So A² = (h/(4π))² * (ħ²/4) I.

Wait, but I'm getting confused about the units. Maybe it's better to approach it in terms of matrices. Alternatively, perhaps the key point is that A² is a multiple of the identity matrix, so the eigenfunctions of any operator would also be eigenfunctions of A².

So for option C, the first part is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az.

So, option C is correct.

So the correct statements are C and D. But wait, in the given options, which one is correct?

Wait, the problem gives four options, and I need to choose the correct one.

Looking back, the problem says 'which statement will you consider to be correct' during the calculation.

So perhaps during the calculation, when you find the eigenvalues, you realize that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, making D correct.

Alternatively, when solving for the eigenvalues, you find that they are real, which would make certain options incorrect.

Wait, the problem is a multiple-choice, so let's think about the given options.

Option A: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts. Wrong, as we found real eigenvalues.

Option B: Same issue, eigenvalues are real, so B is wrong.

Option C: Correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Option D: Also correct, but perhaps it's a more general statement.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps D is a correct statement, because when you find the eigenvectors, they form a basis for the operator's matrix.

So, perhaps D is correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, I might have misread the options.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the eigenvectors.

The eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π).

For a = h/(4π), let's find the eigenvector.

Ay - a I = [ [ -a, (h/(4π))(-i) ], [ (h/(4π)) i, -a ] ]

Substituting a = h/(4π), we have:

[ [ -h/(4π), (-i) * (h^2/(16 π²)) ],
  [ i (h^2/(16 π²)), -h/(4π) ] ]

Wait, but for the eigenvector equation (Ay - a I) φ = 0.

Let me write the matrix:

Row 1: [ -a, (-i) c ] → since c = h/(4π), so (-i)c = (-i) h/(4π).

Row 2: [ i c, -a ]

So the matrix becomes:

[ -a, (-i c) ]
[ i c, -a ]

So substituting a = c, because a = c (since a = h/(4π) and c is the same), so a = c.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -c, (-i c) ]
[ i c, -c ]

Which can be factored as c multiplied by [ -1, -i; i, -1 ].

So the first row equation is: -c φ₁ - i c φ₂ = 0 → - φ₁ -i φ₂ =0 → φ₁ = -i φ₂.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly, for a = -c, the same approach would give eigenvectors [i, 1 ]^T.

So the eigenvectors are orthogonal, and they form a basis for the 2D space. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator, making option D correct.

Therefore, during the calculation, the correct statements would be that the eigenfunctions form a basis, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought option C was correct. Now I'm getting a bit torn.

Let me reevaluate the options.

Option C says the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Since A² is a multiple of I, any state is an eigenstate of A², so that part is correct. The second part, whether they can't be eigenfunctions of Az: correct, because Az and Ay don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different.

So, statement C is correct.

So, I'm a bit confused because both C and D seem correct.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps D is incorrect because the eigenvectors are specific functions, not the basis functions of the operator. Hmm, no, because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from the wording. The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space on which Ay acts.

So, both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, that's correct because any φ is an eigenfunction of A², and not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Yes, because they form a basis for the 2D space.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both are correct, but in the given options, only one can be chosen.

Wait, in the problem, which options are given?

Option A and B are about eigenvalues, which are incorrect. So the correct options are C and D.

Hmm, but the problem says to choose the correct statement during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps only statement D is correct. Because when solving for the eigenvectors, we use them as the basis.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is D.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, given that the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az and are eigenfunctions of A², which is correct, so statement C is correct.

Therefore, the correct option is C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that both C and D are correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the options again.

The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

So during the calculation, when you find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you would realize that the eigenfunctions form a basis (D is correct), and that they are eigenfunctions of A² (so C is correct). But the statements are separate.

So, looking at the options, the correct answer is C, because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Wait, I think I need to make a decision. Based on the analysis, the correct statements are C and D. But since only one option can be correct, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because the eigenfunctions form a basis, which is a correct statement.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, you realize that the eigenfunctions form a basis, making D correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the operator is 2x2, so its eigenvectors always form a basis. So D is correct, but the rest of the statements may not be.

But the other options are incorrect, so the only correct statement is D.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain. But given the options, I think the correct answer is D: the eigenfunctions form a basis.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed. Since the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², and since the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az, option C is correct.

So the correct statement is option C.


The problem involves analyzing the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator is represented as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix with the form:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix.
   - Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the matrix \( A_y - aI \) becomes:
     \[
     A_y - aI = c \cdot S - aI = \begin{bmatrix} -a & -ic \\ ic & -a \end{bmatrix}.
     \]
   - The determinant is:
     \[
     \det(A_y - aI) = (-a)^2 - (ic)(-ic) = a^2 - c^2 = 0.
     \]
   - Solving \( a^2 = c^2 \), the eigenvalues are \( a = \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real, as expected since \( A_y \) is Hermitian.

2. **Option A and B (Imaginary Parts of Eigenvalues):**
   - Both options A and B incorrectly claim that the eigenvalues have imaginary parts. Since \( A_y \) is Hermitian, its eigenvalues must be real. Thus, these options are incorrect.

3. **Option C (Eigenfunctions and Commutativity):**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) because \( A^2 \) is a multiple of the identity matrix (since \( S^2 \) for spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) is proportional to the identity matrix). Any state is an eigenstate of \( A^2 \).
   - However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, and their eigenfunctions are generally different. Thus, option C is correct.

4. **Option D (Basis Functions):**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2×2 matrix operator \( A_y \), as any set of linearly independent eigenvectors of a 2×2 matrix spans the space. Thus, option D is also correct.

### Final Decision:
Both options C and D are correct statements. However, the question asks for the statement that is "considered correct during the calculation." While option D is a general property of eigenvectors forming a basis, option C directly relates to the specific properties of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \). Therefore, the most relevant and correct answer is **C**.

ANSWER: C
