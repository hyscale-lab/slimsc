Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with something called reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with something like NaCN, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So the mechanism here would be the ketone undergoing addition of the cyanide nucleophile.

But wait, ketones typically undergo nucleophilic addition at the carbonyl carbon. So butan-2-one is a ketone, and adding CN- would add to the carbonyl. But the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So in the product, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The nitrile group is on the second carbon, and there's a hydroxyl group also on the second carbon, which is attached to two methyl groups.

Wait, so when NaCN is added to a ketone, it usually forms a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is an addition product where the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, and a proton from somewhere adds to the oxygen, which then becomes an -OH group. So that's exactly what's
