Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are given from A to D.

Wait, so for the relative speed, I remember that you can't just subtract velocities in special relativity. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, is that right? Or is it (u + v)/(1 + (uv/c²)) if they're moving in opposite directions? Hmm, wait no, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed would be u - v, but relativistically.

Wait, no, the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Let me write that down. So here, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, same direction. So the relative speed of A with respect to B would be u = 0.6c, v = 0.5c.

So plugging in, the numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator would be 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So denominator is 0.7.

So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. So approximately 0.143c, which is about 0.14c when rounded. So the relative speed is 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's our starting point.

Now, the total energy of the system. Wait, each astronaut is a relativistic mass, so their energies are their rest mass energy times gamma. So the total energy would be the sum of each astronaut's energy.

Let's calculate each gamma. For the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c:

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.36c²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy for astronaut 1: E1 = gamma * m_rest * c². Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says their masses are 2m and 3m. So m_rest is 2m and 3m respectively.

So for astronaut 1: E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c². Gamma1 is 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: speed 0.5c, so gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 * (3m) c². So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464m c².

So total energy E = E1 + E2 = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc². Option D says E=5 mc². So the total energy must be approximately 5.96 mc², which matches option C's E value. Since option C has both the correct relative speed and the correct energy, that's our answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative speed. The relative velocity as per the formula is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c²) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) → 0.1c / 0.7 → approximately 0.1428c, which rounds to 0.14c, so that's correct.

So the answer must be option C, which says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (speed of astronaut 1) and \( v = 0.5c \) (speed of astronaut 2). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

#### For astronaut 1 (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For astronaut 2 (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 = 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( E \approx 5.96m c^2 \). These values match option **C**.
