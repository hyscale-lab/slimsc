Okay, I need to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that compounds A and B are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. These treatments produce two different diketones. My task is to pick the correct starting materials A and B from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that the reactions involving hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water are typically related to diazotization, which is usually used with aromatic amines to form diazonium salts. But wait, then what happens when they are treated with water? Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions depending on conditions. For example, in the presence of water, especially with heating, they can hydrolyze to form carbocations, which can lead to different products based on the structure.

Wait a second, but the products here are diketones. Diketones are compounds with two ketone groups. How do we get that through such a reaction?

So maybe the starting materials are not aromatic amines. Alternatively, could they be aliphatic amines? Diazonium salts from aliphatic amines might undergo different reactions. For instance, I think that when a primary aliphatic amine is treated with HNO2 in HCl, it forms a diazonium salt, which is unstable and can decompose. In aqueous conditions, especially under acidic conditions, the diazonium salt might undergo hydrolysis. 

Wait, but for a primary aliphatic amine, the diazonium chloride might decompose into a carbocation. Because the
