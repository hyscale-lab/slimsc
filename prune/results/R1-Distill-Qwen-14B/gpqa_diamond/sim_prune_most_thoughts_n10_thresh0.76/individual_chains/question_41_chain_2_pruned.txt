Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass, and the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I need to find the speed of light in the glass as observed in the lab frame. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. So the glass is moving towards the observer, same as the light. Wait, no, the light is moving toward the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. Wait, the wording says the glass is moving toward the observer in the lab. Oh wait, noâ€”the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam, toward the observer. So the beam and the glass are both moving towards the observer, with the glass moving at speed v.

Wait, no, let me read the question again. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and toward the observer in the laboratory. Oh, so the beam itself is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving along with the beam, same direction. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, same as the beam.

Wait, no, wait. The beam is propagating through the glass. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So from the lab frame, if the glass is moving, then the speed of the light within the glass would be affected by the glass's motion, I think.

But
