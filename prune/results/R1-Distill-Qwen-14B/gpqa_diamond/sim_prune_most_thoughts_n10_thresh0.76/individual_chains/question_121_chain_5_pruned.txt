Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here involving epoxides and organocuprates. Hmm, I remember that epoxides are strained rings, and when they react, the ring opens. Organocuprates, like Me2CuLi, are nucleophilic reagents. So the question is about where the nucleophile attacks and the stereochemistry involved.

The compound given is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Wait, what's that structure look like? Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane... So it's a norbornane structure, right? Norbornane has a bridge, two rings. The substituents are at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6 (which is the oxygen in the epoxide).

So the molecule is a bicyclic epoxide. The reaction is with Me2CuLi, which is a strong nucleophile. I remember that with epoxides, the nucleophile tends to attack the less hindered carbon. But since this is a bicyclic system, I need to visualize the structure to see which carbons are more hindered.

In a norbornene oxide (like here), the epoxide is between two bridgehead carbons. So in this case, the epoxide is between carbons 6 (the oxygen) and maybe 7? Wait, the structure is bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. So the bridge is between carbons 1 and 5, maybe. Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is at a bridgehead. So when the organocuprate attacks, the nucleophile (which is the methyl group from Me2CuLi) will add to the less hindered carbon.

Wait, but also, the question mentions that in disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile is added. So it's an SN2-like mechanism, perhaps.

So the starting structure: (1R,3R,4R,6S). Let's break it down. The bridge is probably between carbons 1 and 5, making the structure a norbornane derivative. The substituents at 1R,
