Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says that a Pi(+) is stationary and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, and mu is 105.7 MeV. We need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A, B, C, D with different values.

Wait, so the pion is initially at rest. When it decays, the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since the pion's momentum is zero before decay, the total momentum after must also be zero. So, their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think in this case, the neutrino's mass can be considered negligible compared to the muon's mass. So, the neutrino's energy would be much lower or maybe negligible in some calculations. Or maybe it's treated as a massless particle? Wait, but in reality, neutrinos do have mass, but for high-energy physics problems, sometimes they're approximated as massless for simplicity. Not sure if that's the case here, but let's proceed.

First, let's think about conservation of energy and momentum. The initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion, since it's stationary. The final energy will be the sum of the rest mass energies of the muon and neutrino, plus their kinetic energies.

But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is almost zero, so its energy is just its kinetic energy. The muon's energy would be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy.

So, energy conservation equation: m_pi c^2 = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu) + (K_nu)

And momentum conservation: since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero. So, the magnitude of the muon's momentum (p_mu) must equal the neutrino's momentum (p_nu), but in opposite directions. So, p_mu = -p_nu. But since they're magnitudes, |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Hmm
