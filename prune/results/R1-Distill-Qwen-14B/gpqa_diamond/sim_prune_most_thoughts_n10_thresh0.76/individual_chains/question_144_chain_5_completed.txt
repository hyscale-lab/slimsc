Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data is: production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, so I'm supposed to calculate the mean decay length. I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, where Γ is the decay width. Once I have the lifetime, the mean decay distance (L) would be the velocity (v) multiplied by the lifetime (τ), so L = v * τ.

But wait, how do I get the velocity? Since the meson is a boson, but it's a resonance, so maybe it's moving relativistically. I think I can find the velocity using the relativistic energy-momentum relation and the given energy.

The production energy E_X is 8 GeV. So the total energy E is given as 8 GeV. The rest mass is 1.2 GeV, so the kinetic energy is E - m_X c². But wait, since we're working in units where c=1 (like in particle physics), maybe it's easier. So E = γ m_X c², but since c=1, E = γ m_X.

So γ = E / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV. Let me compute that. 8 divided by 1.2 is... 8 ÷ 1.2 is 6.666..., so γ is about 6.6667.

Then, γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), where β is v/c. So solving for β: β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Let's compute that.

γ is 6.6667, so γ squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444. So 1/γ² is 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So β is approximately 0.9887, which is about 0.9887c.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it more accurately. Let me do it step by step.

γ = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/(1.2) = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

So β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ^2)).

1/γ^2 is 1/( (20/3)^2 ) = 9/(400) = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) is... Let's calculate that. Hmm, 0.9775 is close to 0.98^2 which is 0.9604, and 0.988^2 is (0.98 +0.008)^2 = approx 0.9604 + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008² = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = ~0.97614. Hmm, but 0.988^2 is about 0.976144. But we have 0.9775, which is a bit higher, so perhaps 0.9885.

Wait, maybe I can compute it more accurately. Let me try. Let me think: 0.988 squared is 0.976144. 0.989 squared is (0.988 +0.001)^2 = 0.976144 + 2*0.988*0.001 + (0.001)^2 = 0.976144 + 0.001976 + 0.000001 = 0.978121. Oh, so 0.989^2 is 0.978121. But our target is 0.9775, which is between 0.988 and 0.989. Let me compute 0.9885^2.

0.9885^2: let's calculate that. 0.9885 * 0.9885.

Let me compute it as (0.988 + 0.0005)^2 = 0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2.

0.988^2 is 0.976144.

2*0.988*0.0005 = 0.000988.

(0.0005)^2=0.00000025.

So total is 0.976144 + 0.000988 = 0.977132, plus 0.00000025 is 0.97713225. Hmm, that's still lower than 0.9775. The difference is 0.9775 - 0.97713225 = 0.00036775.

Each increase in the tenth place by 0.0001 (so from 0.9885 to 0.9886) adds about 0.000002 * 0.9885 (approx) to the square. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use linear approximation.

The function f(x) = x², and we know f(0.9885) = 0.97713225.

We need to find x where f(x) = 0.9775. The target is 0.9775, which is 0.9775 - 0.97713225 = 0.00036775 above f(0.9885).

The derivative f'(x) is 2x. At x=0.9885, f'(x)= 2 *0.9885 =1.977.

So delta_x ≈ delta_f / f'(x) = 0.00036775 /1.977 ≈ 0.000186.

So x ≈ 0.9885 + 0.000186 = 0.988686. So β ≈ 0.988686 c. Let's take β ≈ 0.9887 c for approximation.

So velocity v is approximately 0.9887 c. Since c is approximately 3e8 m/s, v is about 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the next step is to find the mean lifetime τ. As I thought earlier, τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV. I need to make sure the units are compatible.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, and ħc is about 197.33 MeV·fm, but in this case, using ħ in GeV·s.

Wait, let me be precise. Let me convert ħ into units of GeV·s.

We know that ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV·s is 1e-18 J·s (since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so eV·s = 1.602e-19 J·s). So 6.582e-25 GeV·s is 6.582e-25 * 1e9 eV·s = 6.582e-16 eV·s. But I think I'm getting confused here; perhaps it's easier to use the known value.

So Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Then, τ = ħ / Γ. So τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV.

Calculating that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that more precisely.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v * τ. So L = v * τ.

v is approximately 2.966e8 m/s, τ is 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiplying them together: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = ?

Let me compute that.

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

2.966 * 2.056875: Let's compute that.

2.966 * 2 = 5.932.

2.966 * 0.056875 = let's compute 0.056875 is approximately 0.056875 = 11/200 (exactly 0.055 would be 11/200, but 0.056875 is 11/195? Wait, 0.056875= 56875/1e6 = 91/1600. Hmm, perhaps exact calculation is better.

Wait, 2.056875 = 2 + 0.056875.

So 2.966 * 0.056875:

Let me compute 2.966 * 0.05 = 0.1483.

2.966 * 0.006875 = 0.0203696 (since 0.006875 is 22/3200, but perhaps better to compute 0.006875 * 2.966).

Alternatively, 0.006875 = 11/1600.

So 2.966 * 11 = 32.626; 32.626 / 1600 = 0.02039125.

Adding 0.1483 and 0.02039125 gives 0.16869125.

So 2.966 * 2.056875 = 5.932 + 0.16869125 ≈ 6.10069125.

So 6.1007e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = (about 6.1) * 1e-16.

So approximately 6.1e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, none are that high. The options are about 4e-15, 5e-15, 4e-16, 5e-16. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the velocity? Let me recheck that.

Wait, the production energy is 8 GeV, and mass is 1.2 GeV. So E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

So, the energy is definitely much higher than the rest mass; so the meson is moving at relativistic speeds.

We found β ≈ 0.9887, so v is approximately 0.9887c.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the velocity. Let me think again.

Wait, another way: since E = γ m c², and since c=1 in these units, E = γ m. So γ is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666..., which is correct.

Then, β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) )= sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, which is what I had before.

So, that part seems correct.

Then, τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau is (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV.

Yes, that would be 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So that's correct.

Now, velocity is 0.9887 c, and c is approx 3e8 m/s.

So 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Which is 2.966 * 2.056875 = approx 6.1007, multiplied by 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So L ≈ 6.1007e-16 meters.

But wait, none of the options are 6e-16. Let's see the options:

A) 5.0223e-16 m
B)4.0655e-15 m
C)5.0223e-15 m
D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, so 6e-16 isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units when calculating ħ. Let me double-check the Planck constant's value.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Yes, that's correct. Because ħ is about 197.33 MeV·fm, which is a common way to express it in particle physics. Wait, but maybe I should check the exact value.

Wait, another approach: let's compute τ in seconds using Γ in GeV, and see if the calculation is correct.

Yes, Γ is 0.32 GeV. So ħ in GeV·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?

Calculating 6.582e-25 / 0.32:

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Yes. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate L with more precise numbers.

Let me recalculate 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

2.966e8 = 2.966 * 1e8 = 296,600,000 m/s.

2.056875e-24 s = 0.000000000000000000000002056875 seconds.

Multiplying them:

296,600,000 m/s * 0.000000000000000000000002056875 s.

But perhaps it's easier in exponents: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.966 * 2.056875 * 1e8 * 1e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Wait, 2.966 * 2.056875 = ?

Let me compute 3 * 2 =6, but let's get the exact number.

2.966 * 2 = 5.932.

2.966 *0.056875 = 0.16869125.

So total is 5.932 +0.16869125 = 6.10069125.

So 6.10069125e-16 m.

Hmm, about 6.1e-16 m. But the options A is 5.02e-16, D is 4e-16. Neither is close to 6e-16. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the meson is moving, but perhaps the decay length isn't just v * tau. Wait, no, the mean lifetime is correct, decay length is v multiplied by the lifetime.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider using the total energy correctly.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the decay width Γ is given in MeV, but when calculating τ, I should use the natural units where ħc is in appropriate units. Maybe I should compute using the expression involving ħc.

Wait, another approach: the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by τ = ħ / Γ.

But sometimes, when particle physicists work in natural units where ħ = c =1, but when converting to SI units, I need to handle the units correctly.

So, perhaps the correct formula is tau = hbar / (Gamma), but I need to make sure that the units are compatible.

Wait, let me compute hbar in J·s.

hbar is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But I need to convert everything into SI units.

Gamma (Γ) is 320 MeV. 1 MeV is 1.602e-13 J. So 320 MeV = 320 * 1.602e-13 J = 5.1264e-11 J.

So tau = hbar / Gamma = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) = (1.0545718e-34) / (5.1264e-11) s.

Calculating that: 1.0545718e-34 /5.1264e-11 = approx 2.0568e-24 s. Which matches what I got before. So that's correct.

Then, v is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

So L = v * tau = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s = 6.1007e-16 m.

Hmm, but none of the options match. So maybe I did something wrong in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me recheck.

Wait, gamma is 8 GeV/1.2 GeV = 6.666666667.

So gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444444.

So 1/(gamma^2) is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 -1/gamma^2 = 0.9775.

Beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887, correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given energy is not the total energy but the kinetic energy? No, wait, the problem says production energy is 8 GeV. I think production energy refers to the total energy of the meson.

Wait, let me think: if the meson is produced with energy 8 GeV, which is its total energy, then yes, that's correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, but the resonance has a width Γ, and the lifetime is tau = hbar / Gamma.

Wait, another formula: the width Gamma is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Gamma.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternative approach: perhaps I should compute the decay length using the formula L = (v * gamma) * (c * tau).

Wait, no, that's not right. Decay length is velocity times lifetime. So L = v * tau.

Wait, but if the meson is moving relativistically, maybe the lifetime is dilated? Oh wait, no, tau is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The observed lifetime is gamma * tau. So then, the decay length would be v * gamma * tau. Oh wait, no! Because tau is the proper lifetime, so the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau. So L = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, that's a different approach. Did I make a mistake in considering the proper time vs lab frame time?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused now. Let me think again. The particle's lifetime as measured in its rest frame is tau. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau. So the decay length is v multiplied by gamma * tau, because the particle is moving at velocity v for a longer time.

Wait, no, no. No, that's incorrect. Because the lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So the distance would be v multiplied by gamma * tau.

Wait, but I previously thought that the mean lifetime we were using was the proper lifetime (tau). So in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma, so the decay length would be v * gamma * tau.

Wait, that would change things. So perhaps I forgot to include the gamma factor in the decay length.

Wait, so when calculating L, the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau, so L = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I used tau as the proper time. So let me re-express this.

In the earlier calculation, I calculated tau = hbar / Gamma, which is the proper time. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau.

So L = v * (gamma * tau).

Yes, that's the correct approach.

Wait a second! Oh, I think that's where I went wrong. I used the proper time tau, but the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So the decay length is v multiplied by gamma multiplied by tau.

So I need to multiply my previous result by gamma, which is 6.6667.

Wait, let's recalculate. Previously, I had L = v * tau = 6.1007e-16 m.

But if I include gamma, it's L = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, no, let's think again. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

So decay length is v multiplied by lab frame lifetime: v * gamma * tau.

So L = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, but earlier, tau is the proper lifetime (hbar / Gamma), which is correct. So let's compute that.

So v is 0.9887c, which is 2.966e8 m/s.

Gamma is 6.6667.

Tau is 2.0568e-24 s.

So L = v * gamma * tau.

So 2.966e8 m/s * 6.6667 * 2.0568e-24 s.

Hmm, but let me compute 6.6667 * 2.0568e-24 = approx 1.3711e-23.

Then, 2.966e8 m/s * 1.3711e-23 s = (2.966 * 1.3711) * 1e8 * 1e-23.

2.966 *1.3711 ≈ 4.0655.

Because 3 * 1.3711 is about 4.1133, but 2.966 is a bit less than 3, so 4.0655.

So 4.0655e-15 meters.

Ah, that's option C: 5.0223e-15 or option B:4.0655e-15, which is option B.

Wait, wait. Let me compute 2.966 * 1.3711.

Compute 2.966 *1.3711:

2 times 1.3711 is 2.7422.

0.966 * 1.3711: let's compute.

0.9 *1.3711=1.23399.

0.066 *1.3711= 0.09045.

So total is 1.23399 + 0.09045 = 1.32444.

So 2.7422 + 1.32444 = 4.06664.

So approximately 4.0666e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

So that's our answer.

So the mistake was that I forgot to multiply by gamma (6.6667) in the decay length, which is the factor that comes from the time dilation. Hence, the correct decay length is approximately 4.0655e-15 meters, which is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we start by calculating the mean lifetime \( \tau \) using the relation \( \tau = \hbar / \Gamma \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant and \( \Gamma \) is the decay width. The decay width is given as \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \). Thus:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

Next, we calculate the velocity \( v \) of the meson. The total energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the rest mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) allow us to compute the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

The velocity \( v \) is then determined using the relativistic relation \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma^2} \), where \( \beta = v/c \). Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

Thus, the velocity is:

\[
v = \beta c \approx 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

The mean decay distance \( L \) in the lab frame is given by \( L = v \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau \), where \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime. Substituting \( v \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), and \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = v \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (6.6667) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, calculate \( 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \approx 13.711, \quad \text{so} \quad 13.711 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.3711 \times 10^{-23}.
\]

Then, calculate \( 2.966 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.3711 \times 10^{-23} \):

\[
L = (2.966 \cdot 1.3711) \times 10^{-15} \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

Thus, the mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
