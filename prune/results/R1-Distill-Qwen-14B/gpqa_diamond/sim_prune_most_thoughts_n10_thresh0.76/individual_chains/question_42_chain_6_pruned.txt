Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let me read through the question again to make sure I get all the details.

So, there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. I've heard that TTV can help detect planets by the changes in their transit times, but I'm not too sure about the specifics. Anyway, the question is about the orbital periods of these planets.

The given data includes the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. Also, the mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. We're told all three have an albedo of 0.3, similar to Earth. The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1.

Hmm, so the main goal is to find the ratio of the orbital periods, Period3/Period1. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = [(L*(1 - a))/(16 * π * σ * D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, and D is the distance. Since all albedos are the same here, the temperature ratio would depend on the square of the distance.

Wait, wait, equilibrium temperature also depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. But since we're comparing the planets, and the star is the same for all (I assume), the luminosity L would be a constant. So the temperature ratio would be inversely proportional to the square root of the distance ratio. Let me think. The equilibrium temperature equation is T = T_eff * (L/(16πσD²(1 - a)))^(1/4). Wait, no, I think the exact formula is T = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). So T is proportional to (L/(D²))^(1/4), but since L is the same for all planets, T is proportional to (1/D²)^(1/4), which is (1/D)^(1/2). So T is inversely proportional to the square root of D.

Wait, that means T ∝ 1/√D. So if Planet1's temperature is T1 and Planet2's is T2, then T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Because T1 = (1/√D1) * const, and T2 = (1/√D2) * const. So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Oh wait, no, wait. Let me rearrange the proportion.

Wait, T is proportional to (L/(D²(1 - a)))^(1/4). So the temperature ratio T1/T2 = [ (D2²) / (D1²) ]^(1/4) = (D2/D1)
