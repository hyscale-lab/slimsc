--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules in the vacuum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's think it through.

So the setup is that Mike is using a high-resolution TEM with an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. He's using vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr in the sample compartment. The idea is to get rid of as many gas molecules as possible because, in electron microscopy, gas can cause scattering of electrons, right? That would blur the image because the electrons don't just hit the sample but also get scattered by these gas particles.

Mike's mass spectrometer detected some gas molecules still present, so the vacuum isn't perfect. But then he measures the mean free path of these gas molecules in that vacuum state, and he gets λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Factors like the pressure, temperature, and compartment volume would affect this.

Now, when he turns on the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. Instead of being λ1, it's λ2. But the temperature is the same as before, so that's not the variable here. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1?

I remember that the mean free path (λ) depends on the pressure (P), temperature (T), and the mean collision diameter (σ) of the gas molecules. Oh wait, the formula is something like λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where d is the average diameter of the molecules. Or maybe it's λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * σ² * P), where σ is the collision cross-section. Either way, pressure and temperature are the main factors here.

Wait, but when the electron beam is on, what's happening? The beam is high-energy electrons, 1000 kV is a lot. I think the electrons can ionize the gas molecules. So when the beam is on, any gas molecules in the compartment might get ionized. Because when a high-energy electron hits a gas molecule, it can knock off an electron, making the molecule a charged ion.

If the gas molecules become ions, they'll be charged. Charged particles in a vacuum—do they behave the same? Well, in a vacuum, if they're charged, they might be accelerated by any electric fields present. But in the electron microscope, there are strong electric fields because of the electron beam. So these ions could be attracted to or repelled by certain parts of the microscope, like the beam's path or the sample.

Wait, but the mean free path is related to how often molecules collide. If the gas is in the compartment, the mean free path λ1 is based on neutral gas molecules. But when the electron beam is on, the gas is ionized. So now, the gas particles are ions with charge.

Hmm, how does ionization affect the mean free path? Well, in a vacuum, charged particles can experience different forces. But the main effect here is that ions can be more easily deflected or captured by the microscope's structure. Alternatively, perhaps they're more likely to stick to surfaces because of their charge. But wait, in the sample compartment, if they stick, that would effectively remove them from the gas phase, right?

Wait, but let's think about the mean free path. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. So if the gas is ionized, these ions might have different collision rates. But wait, in the electron beam's presence, are there other effects like more scattering?

Wait, another thought: when the gas is ionized, the ions might be more likely to interact with the electron beam, but how does that affect their own mean free path in the gas phase?

Alternatively, perhaps the ionization doesn't directly affect the collisions between gas molecules, but maybe the presence of the electron beam affects the overall pressure or the behavior of the gas in another way.

Wait, no. The pressure is already extremely low, so the mean free path λ1 is determined by the low pressure. But when the beam is on, perhaps the presence of the beam causes additional effects. Oh, like the electrons can cause gas molecules to become ions, which might then be more likely to stick to the walls of the compartment because they're charged. So, in the presence of the beam, more gas ions are produced, and these ions may have a higher sticking probability to the walls of the vacuum chamber.

If that's the case, then the effective pressure of the gas would drop because more of them are being removed from the gas phase. Because the sticking would effectively reduce the number of gas molecules in the compartment. So the pressure would decrease, and since mean free path λ is inversely proportional to pressure, λ would increase.

Wait, let's think about that. The mean free path λ is proportional to 1/P. So if P decreases, λ increases. So if the presence of the electron beam causes ions to stick to the walls, the pressure P effectively goes down, so λ would go up from λ1 to λ2, meaning λ2 > λ1.

But wait, Mike found that when the beam was on, the mean free path was λ2, which is different. So λ2 is the new mean free path under the influence of the beam. So if the pressure is lower, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. So this would mean that the new mean free path is at least 22% longer.

Option C: λ2 < λ1. So it's shorter, which would mean higher pressure. But that's the opposite of what I was thinking.

Hmm, why would the mean free path become shorter? Well, maybe if the beam causes some other effect, like more collisions between gas particles and the beam electrons. Wait, if the beam is causing more scattering of gas molecules, perhaps the mean free path would decrease. But wait, that's not about collisions between the gas molecules, but about electron scattering.

Wait, but the mean free path here is about the gas molecules colliding with each other, right? Or colliding with the walls.

Wait, no. The mean free path is the average distance a gas molecule travels between collisions with other gas molecules or the walls. So if the electron beam is causing the gas to ionize and stick to the walls, the number of gas molecules decreases, so their mean free path increases. But if the electron beam itself is causing more collisions between the gas molecules and the electrons, perhaps that's a different effect. But would that affect the mean free path for the gas molecules?

Wait, another approach: in a vacuum, when you have a gas, the mean free path depends on the pressure and the temperature. But if the gas is ionized, do the ions have a longer or shorter mean free path?

Ions in a vacuum can experience different forces. But in this case, the electron beam is high-energy, so the ions might be accelerated, perhaps leaving the compartment or being drawn to another part, or sticking to the walls.

Wait, but sticking to the walls would mean they are removed from the gas phase. So the effective pressure goes down, meaning λ increases.

So if λ2 is longer than λ1, that would make sense.

But wait, the options don't all have λ2 greater than λ1. Let me check the options again.

Option A: λ2 >= 1.22 λ1

Option C: λ2 < λ1

So if λ2 is larger, then options A or D (if D is a range). But the options given are A, B, C, D.

Wait, the question states that Mike's observation is that the mean free path is no longer λ1, but λ2. So the question is, is λ2 longer or shorter than λ1?

So if the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be more effectively removed (due to ionization and sticking), then the pressure would effectively be lower. That would make λ2 = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) π σ² P') where P' < P. So λ2 = λ1 * (P / P'). Since P' is lower, λ2 is larger than λ1.

Therefore, λ2 is larger than λ1, which would make options A or D (if D is a higher value) the possible choices.

But wait, looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1. So is there any reason why it would be more than 1.22 times?

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to be excited or ionized, and that could change the effective cross-section σ. Because when molecules are ionized, their cross-section for collisions might change. But that seems more complicated.

Wait, but the gas molecules in the vacuum would be in a high-energy state when the electron beam is on. The mean free path is calculated based on the thermal motion, but if the beam provides additional energy, perhaps the temperature increases. But the question says that the sample compartment temperature remains the same. So temperature is constant.

So maybe the key factor is the change in pressure due to the removal of gas ions.

So, the initial mean free path is λ1 under pressure P. When the beam is on, the pressure effectively drops because more gas molecules are removed (sticking to walls), so the new pressure P' is lower, so λ2 = λ1 * (P / P').

But wait, how much does the pressure drop? Well, the problem says that Mike accurately determined λ1 based on the initial conditions. Then when the beam is on, the pressure must have decreased, so λ2 is larger than λ1.

Therefore, the correct answer would be that λ2 is larger than λ1.

Now, looking at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22 λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

So either A or another option is correct. But is there any reason to think that λ2 would be more than 22% larger?

Alternatively, perhaps the change in the mean free path is not that significant because the pressure was already extremely low. Wait, but the initial pressure is <1e-9 Torr. When the beam is on, perhaps the number of gas particles decreases.

But Mike's initial calculation of λ1 was based on the same setup. So when the beam is on, the actual pressure is lower than when it's off. Therefore, λ2 should be larger than λ1.

So the options are whether λ2 is greater than or less than λ1.

If the options are A, C, the correct answer would be A (λ2 >= 1.22 λ1) if that's the case. But wait, the question says that Mike found that the mean free path was no longer λ1; he found λ2. So the question is about the comparison between λ2 and λ1.

Wait, but could there be another effect? For example, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to be ionized, which would make them stick to the walls more, hence reducing the number of gas molecules, thus increasing the mean free path.

So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But then looking at the options, the only option that says λ2 is larger is option A or D. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22 λ1

B) λ2 = λ1, discrepancy

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1

Wait, option D says λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22 λ1.

Hmm. So the question is, by how much could λ2 be larger than λ1? Well, depends on how much the pressure drops. If the pressure is reduced enough, λ2 could be much larger.

But perhaps in reality, the mean free path doesn't change that much because the initial pressure is already so low. Wait, but the initial λ1 is determined. So if the pressure becomes lower, λ2 = λ1 * (P_initial / P_beam_on). If P_beam_on is lower, then λ2 is higher.

So in the scenario, when the electron beam is on, more gas particles are removed, so P_beam_on is lower than P_initial? Or is the initial pressure already extremely low, and the beam doesn't cause a significant change?

Wait, the initial situation is that the vacuum is <1e-9 Torr. So the number of gas molecules is already very low. When the beam is on, a few more are ionized and stuck to the walls. So the change in pressure might be minimal. The mean free path would increase, but perhaps not by a factor of 1.22 or more.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam increases the effective pressure because it causes more collisions? No, I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, when the beam is on, the gas particles are more likely to be scattered by the electrons, which would increase the collision rate, thus decreasing the mean free path. But the mean free path is about the distance between collisions, so if the collision rate increases, λ decreases.

Wait, but the collisions are between gas particles. If the beam causes more scattering, that would affect the electron's path, not the gas molecules' mean free path. Or does it?

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to become ions, and the ions might have a different effective diameter for collisions. Or perhaps the ions are more likely to stick to the walls, which would effectively reduce pressure and increase λ.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The mean free path is determined by the gas's own pressure and temperature. When the beam is on, the gas is ionized. Does ionization affect the collision cross-section? I think ions have a larger cross-section because they have an electric charge, which might cause them to interact more strongly with each other or the walls.

Wait, if the collision cross-section increases, then the mean free path would decrease. Because λ is inversely proportional to σ². So if σ increases, λ decreases.

So if the gas is ionized, the collision cross-section might increase, leading to a shorter mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Hmm, that's a different conclusion. So in this case, when the gas is ionized, the collision cross-section σ increases. So λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) π σ² P).

If σ increases, λ decreases. So λ2 < λ1.

But earlier, I thought that the ions sticking to the walls would reduce the pressure, increasing λ. Now I'm considering another effect: the change in σ due to ionization.

Which effect is dominant? Does the change in σ matter more than the change in pressure?

Well, if the gas is ionized, the cross-section might change. Let me think about neutral gas versus ionized gas.

For example, neutral gas molecules have a certain cross-section based on their size. Ions, being charged, might have a larger effective cross-section because they attract each other more, so they might collide more easily. So σ_ion > σ_neutral. So with a larger σ, the mean free path would decrease.

So when the beam is on, the gas is ionized, so σ becomes larger, leading to a smaller λ. So λ2 < λ1.

But wait, that's conflicting with the earlier conclusion based on pressure. So which is more significant?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam affects the pressure. If the beam is causing ionization, which leads to sticking, the pressure drops. So λ increases. But the collision cross-section also increases, which would decrease λ. So which effect is stronger?

It depends on the relative changes. Let me model it.

Suppose the initial pressure is P1, and after beam on, the pressure is P2.

The initial mean free path is λ1 = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) π σ1² P1).

After beam on, the pressure is P2, and the collision cross-section is σ2.

So λ2 = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) π σ2² P2).

We can compare λ2 and λ1.

λ2/λ1 = (σ1² P1) / (σ2² P2).

If the beam causes σ2 > σ1 and P2 < P1, the ratio could go either way.

But without knowing the exact change in σ and P, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the effect on σ is more significant.

Wait, maybe the effect of ionization on σ is more substantial than the effect on pressure. Because sticking would require a significant number of ions to be removed, which depends on how much the beam affects the ionization rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the change in pressure is negligible because the initial pressure is so low. So if P doesn't change much, the main effect is the increase in σ, leading to a decrease in λ.

In that case, λ2 would be less than λ1, which would make option C correct.

But I'm not sure which effect dominates. Let me think about real-world scenarios. In electron microscopy, when you have a high-energy electron beam, it's known to cause gas molecules to be ionized and pumped out via the walls, leading to a lower pressure. This is sometimes referred to as "electron-induced desorption" or "ion gettering". So the presence of the beam effectively lowers the pressure, which increases the mean free path. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

Wait, that's the opposite of my earlier thought. So in that case, the pressure P decreases, so λ increases. So λ2 > λ1.

But why are options A and C conflicting? The options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22 λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

If the mean free path increases, then λ2 > λ1. So options A or D would be possible, but D says λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22 λ1.

Wait, but in reality, the decrease in pressure can be quite significant because the beam is actively removing ions. So the pressure P' could be much lower than P.

But I'm not certain about the exact factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the main effect is that the beam causes more scattering of electrons by the gas, but that's about the electron's mean free path. But the question is about the gas's mean free path.

So perhaps the main effect is that the gas's mean free path is longer because the pressure is lower. So λ2 > λ1.

So the correct answer would be option A or D.

But looking at the options, option A is λ2 >= 1.22*λ1, and D is λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1.

So why would λ2 be at least 1.22 times λ1?

Wait, I think I'm getting confused because the question is about the gas's mean free path but the electron's mean free path is a different concept. Or perhaps not.

Wait, the mean free path of the gas molecules is λ1 and λ2. The electron's mean free path is different.

When Mike observes that the mean free path is no longer λ1, he's talking about the gas molecules' mean free path. So if the beam is on, the gas's mean free path changes.

Wait, but how does the beam affect the gas's mean free path? The beam itself is moving through the gas. So the gas molecules could be moving in their own way, but the beam's presence might cause gas molecules to be ionized, which affects their own behavior.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam's presence doesn't directly affect the gas's mean free path much. But that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas to ionize, which might cause the ions to be accelerated, leading to a different effective pressure. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing more scattering of the gas molecules, thereby reducing their mean free path. But wait, the gas's mean free path is determined by their own collisions, not by their interaction with the beam. The beam's electrons would scatter off the gas molecules, but that's a different effect.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when the beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to be hit by electrons, causing them to be scattered. But the mean free path of the gas molecules is about their own collisions, not about the electrons' scattering.

So if the gas is ionized, the cross-section might change. But whether that changes the mean free path of the gas molecules or their own cross-section.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam increases the effective pressure because the gas is heated or something. But the question says the temperature remains the same.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the options again.

If the mean free path becomes shorter (λ2 < λ1), option C is correct.

If it becomes longer (λ2 > λ1), options A or D.

In the initial scenario, the vacuum is already ultra-high, so the pressure is really low. When the beam is on, perhaps the pressure drops even more, making λ2 larger.

But Mike's observation is that the mean free path isn't λ1. So perhaps λ2 is shorter because of a different reason, like increased scattering.

Wait, the question says that he detected gas particles with the mass spectrometer before turning on the beam. But when the beam is on, the presence of gas molecules would affect the electron beam more. But how does that affect the gas's mean free path?

Hmm, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas to become more ionized, which in turn increases the rate at which gas molecules collide with each other or the walls, thus decreasing the mean free path.

So if the collision rate increases, the mean free path decreases. So λ2 < λ1.

That would make option C correct.

But why would the collision rate increase when the gas is ionized?

Because, as ions, they are charged and might attract each other more, leading to more frequent collisions. Therefore, the mean free path would decrease.

Alternatively, perhaps the ions are more likely to stick to the walls, so the effective pressure drops, leading to a longer mean free path.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck between these two possibilities.

Wait, another angle: the mean free path is given by λ = 1/(n σ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section.

If the beam causes some of the gas to be removed (n decreases) and also increases σ (because ions have larger cross-sections), the effect on λ depends on which factor dominates.

Suppose the beam reduces n by a factor of x, and increases σ by a factor of y. Then λ would change by (x)/(y²).

If x is a small decrease and y is a moderate increase, then λ could either increase or decrease.

But without knowing the exact values, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of the beam, the gas is ionized, leading to more collisions because the ions are more reactive or have a larger cross-section. Therefore, the mean free path decreases.

But I'm not certain. Maybe the main effect is the removal of gas due to sticking, which lowers the pressure, increasing the mean free path.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the correct answer is that λ2 is less than λ1 because the electron beam causes more scattering of the gas molecules, leading to shorter mean free paths.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam leads to more gas being removed, so λ increases.

Wait, let's think about the physics. The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the pressure and the square of the collision cross-section.

In ultra-high vacuum, the pressure is already so low that λ1 is very large. If the beam causes the pressure to decrease further, λ2 would be even larger. So λ2 > λ1.

But why would the mean free path change when the beam is on? Because the beam is causing the gas to be ionized, which could either increase or decrease λ.

Another thought: when the gas is ionized, the effective pressure might actually increase because the ions can interact more with the walls, but that's not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam leads to a higher temperature locally, but the question says the sample compartment's temperature remains the same. So that's not a factor.

I think the key is that the mean free path λ depends on the pressure. If the presence of the beam reduces the pressure, λ increases. So λ2 is greater than λ1.

So the correct answer would be either A or D.

But the options don't have a clear indication. Let's think about the possible options.

If λ2 is greater than λ1, then options A or D.

Option A says λ2 is >= 1.22 λ1.

Option D says λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22 λ1.

But why would it be exactly that range?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial mean free path λ1 is determined without the beam, but when the beam is on, the effective pressure drops, so the new λ2 is longer.

But without knowing the exact change in pressure, we can't say by how much. So perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, and looking at the options, the only one that fits is option A, which states λ2 >= 1.22 λ1.

But wait, the problem says the pressure is already <1e-9 Torr. So the mean free path would already be very large. If the beam causes the pressure to drop further, λ2 would be even larger.

But is there any reason to think that λ2 would be more than 1.22 times λ1?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam doesn't significantly affect the pressure, so λ2 would be approximately equal to λ1. But the question states that Mike's observation was that the mean free path was no longer λ1. So that's not option B.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1 because the pressure is lower when the beam is on, leading to a longer mean free path. So options A or D.

But since the options don't offer a clear 'greater than' without a multiplier, I have to look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22 λ1

B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1

So the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So the options are A or D.

But why would it be A or D?

Well, perhaps the change in pressure is such that λ increases. If the pressure is reduced by a certain factor, λ increases by the inverse factor.

But without exact data, it's hard to know whether λ2 is greater than 1.22 λ1 or just a little higher.

If the initial pressure is say P1, and with the beam on, the pressure is P2 = P1 * (some factor), then λ2 = λ1 * (P1 / P2).

If the factor is 0.8, then λ2 would be 1.25 λ1, which is greater than 1.22, so option A would apply.

But if the factor is 0.9, then λ2 is 1.11 λ1, which falls into option D.

But the problem doesn't provide exact numbers. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, that λ2 < λ1, because the ionization leads to more frequent collisions.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. I think I need to refer to known physics here.

I recall that in electron microscopy, when you have a high-energy electron beam, it can cause gas molecules to be ionized and sputter off the walls or be pumped out. This effectively reduces the pressure in the chamber, leading to a longer mean free path for the gas molecules. So in that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Thus, the correct answer would be that λ2 is greater than λ1. So between options A and D.

But why would λ2 be in the range of λ1 to 1.22 λ1?

Alternatively, perhaps the change in mean free path is not that significant because the initial pressure is so low. So the change from P1 to P2 might not cause a big change in λ.

In that case, λ2 would be just a bit larger than λ1, making option D correct.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't significantly affect the gas's pressure. So λ2 is approximately λ1. But the question states that the mean free path was no longer λ1, so that's not option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas to be more active, leading to more frequent collisions, thus lowering the mean free path. So λ2 < λ1.

But I'm not certain.

I think I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. Since the initial vacuum is already ultra-high, the pressure is so low that the mean free path is very large. When the beam is on, it might not cause a drastic change in pressure, so the mean free path might not change much. Thus, λ2 would be approximately λ1, but the question states that it's different. Alternatively, the beam might cause a slight increase in the mean free path, but not by 22%. So perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is less than λ1.

Wait, that doesn't align with my earlier reasoning about the beam causing pressure to drop. I'm getting so confused.

Wait, perhaps the key is that when the beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to be scattered by the electrons, which are moving quickly. So the gas's mean free path is determined by how often they collide with each other or the walls, but if the beam's electrons are scattering them, that might not directly affect the gas's mean free path.

But the question is about the gas's mean free path. So the presence of the beam may not affect the gas's mean free path. But the problem states that Mike observed a change in λ, so the beam must be affecting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam causes the gas to heat up, but the temperature remains the same, so that's not it.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted my reasoning. I'll go with the conclusion that the presence of the beam leads to a lower pressure, so the mean free path increases, making λ2 > λ1. Therefore, the correct option is A: λ2 >= 1.22 λ1.


The question revolves around the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in the sample compartment of a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. Initially, Mike determines the mean free path as λ1 under ultra-high vacuum conditions (<10^-9 Torr). However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observes a change in the mean free path to λ2, which is different from λ1. The task is to determine the relationship between λ2 and λ1.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Formula**:  
   The mean free path is given by:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \pi \sigma^2 P}
   \]  
   where \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, \(T\) is temperature, \(\sigma\) is the collision cross-section, and \(P\) is pressure. Since the temperature remains constant, changes in \(\lambda\) are due to changes in \(P\) or \(\sigma\).

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam**:  
   When the electron beam is turned on, it ionizes the gas molecules. Ionized particles (ions) are charged, which can lead to two effects:  
   - **Increased Sticking Probability**: Charged ions are more likely to stick to the walls of the vacuum chamber, effectively reducing the number of gas molecules in the compartment. This decreases the pressure \(P\), which increases the mean free path (\(\lambda \propto 1/P\)).  
   - **Change in Collision Cross-Section (\(\sigma\))**: Ionized particles may have a larger effective collision cross-section due to their charge, which would decrease the mean free path (\(\lambda \propto 1/\sigma^2\)).

3. **Dominant Effect**:  
   The problem specifies that the vacuum is already ultra-high (<10^-9 Torr), meaning the initial pressure is extremely low. The ionization caused by the electron beam likely reduces the pressure further by removing gas molecules from the gas phase. This reduction in pressure dominates over any increase in the collision cross-section, leading to an overall increase in the mean free path. Thus, \(\lambda_2 > \lambda_1\).

4. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (\(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This suggests a significant increase in the mean free path. Given the ultra-high vacuum and the ionization effect, it is plausible that \(\lambda_2\) increases by this factor or more.  
   - **Option B (\(\lambda_2 = \lambda_1\))**: This implies no change in the mean free path, which contradicts the problem statement that Mike observed a change.  
   - **Option C (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\))**: This would require the mean free path to decrease, which is inconsistent with the ionization effect reducing pressure and increasing \(\lambda\).  
   - **Option D (\(\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This suggests a smaller increase in \(\lambda_2\). While possible, the problem does not provide specific data to confirm this range.

### Conclusion:
The ionization effect caused by the electron beam reduces the pressure, leading to an increase in the mean free path. Among the options, the most consistent conclusion is that \(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\). 

ANSWER: A
