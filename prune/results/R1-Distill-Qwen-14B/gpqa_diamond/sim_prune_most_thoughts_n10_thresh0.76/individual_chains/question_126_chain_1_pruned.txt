Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me take it step by step. Hmm, the question involves two reactions, and then analyzing the products using HPLC. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through.

So, Reaction I is treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is lithium aluminum hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. I remember that ketones are reduced by LAH to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone. The structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Let me draw that out. Hexan-3-one means a six-carbon chain with a ketone on carbon 3. So, positions are 1, 2, 3 (keto), 4, 5, 6. At position 5, there's a methoxy group. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me break it down. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. But with a methoxy on C5. So, the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I should number the carbons properly.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. So, the carbonyl is on C3. The substituents are: on C5 (which is the fifth carbon), a methoxy group. So, the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3. Wait, but that's only five carbons. Oh wait, no. Hexan-3
