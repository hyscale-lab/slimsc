Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution from my studies, which relates the energy levels of particles in a system to temperature. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I can use the Boltzmann equation here.

The Boltzmann factor equation is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Here, n_i and n_j are the number densities of the two energy levels, g_i and g_j are the statistical weights. Since the problem mentions a specific energy level, I think that the statistical weights might be the same for both stars, so g_i/g_j would be 1. Or wait, maybe not, but the problem doesn't specify anything about the statistical weights differing, so perhaps I can assume they're the same for both stars. So that part cancels out.

Let me set this up. Let's say for star 1, the ratio is n1_i / n1_j = exp( - (ΔE)/(k*T1) ), and for star 2, it's n2_i / n2_j = exp( - (ΔE)/(k*T2) ). But the question states that the excitation is twice as high in star_1, so n1_i is twice n2_i? Or wait, wait. The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So maybe the ratio is higher. Let me read that part again.

Ah, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So if we're considering the same energy level, the ratio n1_i / n_j1 is twice the ratio n2_i / n_j2, perhaps? Or wait, maybe I should think of the ratio of the number of excited atoms to the total. Alternatively, the excitation is higher, so perhaps the population of that level is higher.

Wait, the excitation energy refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy state relative to a lower one. So, the excitation is the ratio of the number in the excited state to the lower state. So for star_1, that ratio is twice that of star_2. Let me formalize that.

Let’s denote the ratio for each star as R1 and R2. So R1 = (n1_i) / (n1_j) and R2 = (n2_i)/(n2_j). The problem says R1 = 2 * R2. 

Since the energy difference is the same for both, ΔE = E_i - E_j is the same, so using the Boltzmann equation for each star:

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )
R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )
Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

But since R1 = 2 R2, R1/R2 = 2. So,

2 = exp( ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] )

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE)/(k) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) )

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me double-check the signs. Because in the Boltzmann factor, it's e^(-ΔE/(k T)). So if T increases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio R decreases. So if star_1 has higher excitation (R1 > R2), that would mean that T1 is higher than T2 because higher temperature makes the exponent less negative, so the ratio is higher.

So given that, R1 = 2 R2.

So R1/R2 = 2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ] )

Which is the same as exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Because I have R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), so R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) → exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) -1/(T1) ) )

So 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Take ln of both sides:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) )

We can factor this as:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Let me see, because:

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So, substituting that:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But wait, the question is about the temperatures T1 and T2. The options involve equations where ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2.

Hmm, looking at the options, I don't see any that have ΔE or k in them. So perhaps this equation can be simplified by considering the value of ΔE and k.

Wait, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute what's ΔE/(k). Because k is Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! So 1.38e-23 J is exactly k. So ΔE = k. So ΔE/(k) = 1.

So substituting that in:

ln(2) = [1] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which becomes:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ). So that's our equation.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up T1 and T2. Because in the equation, I have (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) which is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ). So if T1 is higher than T2, then (T1 - T2) is positive, making the entire expression positive. Since ln(2) is positive, that makes sense.

So the correct equation is ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ), which is option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the excitation levels of energy states to temperature. The Boltzmann factor equation is:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the number densities of atoms in two energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
R_1 = \frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that \(R_1 = 2R_2\). Taking the ratio \(R_1 / R_2\), we get:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right) = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since \(R_1 / R_2 = 2\), we have:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Substituting \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Given that \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we find \(\Delta E / k = 1\). Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
