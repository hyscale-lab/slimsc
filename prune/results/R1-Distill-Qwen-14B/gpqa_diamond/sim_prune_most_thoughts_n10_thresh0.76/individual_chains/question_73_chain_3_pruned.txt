Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The problem says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are traveling at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the velocities. Oh right, because velocities don't just add up normally when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I remember there's the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity is v_rel = (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/c²), where v and u are the velocities of the two objects as observed from some frame. But wait, I need to decide which way the relative speed is being calculated. Oh, right, because velocity is directional. So if they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (v - u) in the denominator, but we use the formula to find how one sees the other's speed.

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what speed is B moving at? Or is it the other way around?

Actually, the relative speed would be how fast B is moving relative to A. So using the velocity addition formula, I need to calculate (v' - u') where u' is the velocity of the other frame. But wait, maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the relative speed as the difference in their velocities divided by (1 minus the product of their velocities over c squared). Wait no, wait, the formula is v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of the second object and v is the velocity of the first. Or wait, no, let me make sure. Let me think, if I have frame S where object 1 is moving at u = 0.6c, and object 2 is moving at v = 0.5c. Then, from object 1's frame (S'), what's the speed of object 2.

Wait,
