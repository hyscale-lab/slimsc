Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question involves two electrons in p orbitals. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l=1. So each electron has l1 and l2 both equal to 1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Let me unpack that. The state is |l1, l2, L, M>, where L is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and M is its z-component.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ each. So, what's L1z and L2z? They are the z-components of the orbital angular momentum of the first and second electrons, respectively.

Hmm, each electron's orbital angular momentum can be in states with m1 and m2 values, which are -1, 0, +1 for l=1. The total M is given as -1. So the state is |1,1,2,-1>, which is the coupled state.

Wait, but how do you get from the coupled state to the individual m1 and m2 values? I think the coupled state is a combination of all possible product states |m1, m2> that add up to M=-1.

So for the coupled state |l1, l2, L, M> = |1,1,2,-1>, the possible m1 and m2 combinations are those where m1 + m2 = M = -1.

Let me list the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1:

m1 can be -1,0,1 and m2 can be -1,0,1.

Looking for m1 + m2 = -1:

- m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum is -1
- m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum is -1
- m1 = 1, m2 = -2 → wait, no, m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 must be -1,0,1. So that's not possible.

Wait, so only two possible combinations: (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of these two product states. But wait, actually, I think when you couple two angular momenta, you have to consider how the states combine. The state |L=2, M=-1> is a specific combination of the product states |m1, m2> that sum to M=-1.

So the expansion is something like |1,1,2,-1> = a*(-1,0) + b*(0,-1). The coefficients a and b are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, I remember that for two l=1 particles, the total L can be 0,1,2. So for L=2, the M values range from -2 to +2. The state |2,-1> would be a combination of m1 + m2 = -1
