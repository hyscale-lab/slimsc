Okay, I'm trying to solve this question about the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So, the metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a line element in two dimensions. I remember that pseudospheres are related to hyperbolic geometry, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Wait, pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature, right? They're like the hyperbolic equivalent of a sphere. But how does that relate to the metric given here?

Looking at the metric, it's in terms of x and y, so maybe this is a coordinate system on the pseudosphere. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which reminds me of the metric for a sphere, but with a different sign. Oh wait, for a sphere, the metric might have something like (1 - r²/R²)^(-1) or something similar in the denominator, depending on the coordinates.

Wait, another thought: when you have a metric like this, the line element is conformally flat, meaning it's just a flat metric scaled by a function. The function here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element would be the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy. But since it's conformally flat, the determinant is just the square of the scaling factor. Let me think, the metric tensor g in 2D would be diag(g_xx, g_yy) where g_xx = g_yy = 3
