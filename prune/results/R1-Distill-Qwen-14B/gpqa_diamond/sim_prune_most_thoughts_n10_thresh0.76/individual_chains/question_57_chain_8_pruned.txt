Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momentum states, right? The phase shifts are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁ = 67°, δ₂ = 55°, δ₃ = 30°, and δ₄ = 13°. Oh wait, and I'm supposed to ignore the rest, so I guess that means higher phase shifts beyond δ₄ don't contribute. The problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to these phase shifts. The formula for the scattering amplitude when you have partial waves is a sum over all l of (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l / (k r) times some spherical harmonics, but wait, I think when you're looking along the beam direction, θ is 0 degrees. So maybe the spherical harmonics simplify there.

Wait, when θ is 0, the Legendre polynomial P_l^0(0) is zero for l = 0? No, wait, P_l^0(0) is 1 for l=0, and zero for other l? Or wait, no: I think P_l^0(0) is 0 for even l and (-1)^{l/2} 2^{1/2} (2l-1)!!/(2l)!! )^{-1/2} } for odd l. But I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the expression for the scattering amplitude. The general form is f(θ) = Σ (2l + 1) [e^{2iδ_l} - 1] (sin δ_l) / k r * (something with the spherical harmonics... or maybe it's expressed in terms of Legendre polynomials? Or wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, the scattering amplitude in the partial wave expansion can be written as:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) [e^{2iδ_l} - 1] (sin δ_l) P_l(cosθ)

where the sum is over l from 0 to some maximum, and k is the wave number. Since we're evaluating this along the beam direction,
