Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The question is about how the star's brightness variations due to these spots compare to the brightness changes caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. They want to find the radius of such an exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

So I remember that when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. But in this case, the star has spots, which also affect the observed brightness as the star rotates.

Wait, the problem says that the situation can resemble an exoplanet. So the brightness variations from the spots are being mistaken for a planet. But the question is, what would be the radius of a planet that would cause the same change in brightness as the spots do.

Hmm, the key here is to find the fractional change in brightness (the amplitude) caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

First, let's think about the star's normal brightness. The star emits light based on its surface area and temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But since we're looking for relative changes, perhaps we don't need to compute the absolute luminosity, just the change when spots are present.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun.

The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the total area covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere. But a hemisphere is half the star's surface, so 20% of half is 10% of the total surface area.

Wait, no. Let me think. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that is spotted. So if the filling factor is 20%, that means 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots. Hemisphere is half the star, so the total area of spots is 0.2 * (π R² / 2) ) = 0.1 π R².

Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify: the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that is covered. So if it's 20%, then 0.2 of the hemisphere is spots. The hemisphere's area is (4π R²)/2 = 2π R². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: the total area of the star is 4π R². If the spots are on one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20%, then the area with spots is 0.2 * (2π
