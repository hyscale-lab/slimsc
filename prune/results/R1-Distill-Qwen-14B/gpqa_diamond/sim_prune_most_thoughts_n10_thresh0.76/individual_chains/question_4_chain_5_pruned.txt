Okay, so I've got this Maxwell's equations question here. Hmm, let me think. The question is about a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. In our universe, that's not possible because magnets always come in pairs. So, how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations... There are four of them. I remember them as:

1. Gauss's Law for electricity: divergence of E is rho over epsilon.
2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: divergence of B is zero.
3. Faraday's Law: curl of E is negative the time derivative of B.
4. Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition): curl of B is mu times (current + displacement current).

Oh right, in our universe, the divergence of B is zero. So that's equation two. Because magnetic monopoles don't exist, so there are no isolated poles. But in this other universe, they do have isolated poles. So that would change equation two, right?

Wait, so if there are magnetic monopoles, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero. Instead, it would be something like rho_m (magnetic charge density) over some constant. So equation two would change.

What about the other equations? Faraday's Law (equation three) and Ampère's Law (equation four) involve the time derivatives of B and E. Would they change? I don't think so. Because those deal with how fields change, not the sources. Unless... wait, Faraday's Law is about induced electric fields from changing magnetic fields, which is a different thing than sources.

Wait, but in the presence of magnetic monopoles, would that affect other equations? Let me think. Oh, right, if magnetic monopoles exist, you might also have a 'magnetization current' or something similar. But wait, in Maxwell's equations, the main effect would be on Gauss's Law for magnetism.

Wait, no. Oh wait, in the scenario where magnetic monopoles exist, the divergence of B would be non-zero. So equation two is modified. But what about Ampère's Law? Let me think. Ampère's Law (equation four) is about the curl of B. In our equations, that's related to the current and displacement current. But if magnetic monopoles exist, does that affect Ampère's Law? Or is it only equation two that changes?

Wait, maybe not. Because
