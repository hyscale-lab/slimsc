Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again carefully.

So, the question is about three exoplanets with circular orbits discovered using the TTV method. The equilibrium temperature ratios are given between Planet1 and Planet2 as approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 as about 2.3. Also, the mass ratios are provided: Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35. We need to find by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, assuming all have the same albedo of 0.3, similar to Earth.

Hmm. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on several factors, including the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = [(L (1 - a))/(16 π σ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the albedo, and D is the distance from the star. But wait, all three planets have the same albedo, so a is constant for all. So temperature ratios would depend on the inverse square of the distance and the square root of the luminosity of the star. Wait, but wait, the star's luminosity is the same for all three planets, right? Because they orbit the same star. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L^0.25) * ( (1 - a) / D² )^0.25. But since L and a are the same for all, T is proportional to (1/D² )^0.25, which is the same as (1/D^0.5). So T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So, T ∝ 1/√D.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. But according to the formula, T1/T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 ), because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So if T1 is higher than T2, that would mean D1 is less than D2. Because sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4. Let me write that down.

Wait, let me correct that. Let me think again. T is proportional to (1/D^0.5), so T1 = k/D1^0.5, T2 =k/D2^0.5. So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). So if T1/T2 is 1.4, then sqrt(D2/D1) =1.4. Squaring both sides, D2/D1= (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 is about 1.96 times D1. So D2 = 1.96 D1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 =2.3.
