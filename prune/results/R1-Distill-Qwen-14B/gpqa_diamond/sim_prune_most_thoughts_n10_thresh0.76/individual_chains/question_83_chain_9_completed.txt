Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to break it down. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they should form sodium acetate and water.

First, let me read the details again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³, right? Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized and the pH at the equivalence point.

Wait, 25% titration. Does that mean 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH? Or is it 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence? Hmm, probably the former. Because in titration, when they say 25% titration, it's the percentage of the acid that has been neutralized. So, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been converted to acetate ions.

Let me think about the initial setup. Before anything is added, the diluted solution's concentration can be found. The initial moles of acetic acid (let's call it CH3COOH) would be volume (in liters) multiplied by molarity. So, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Then, we add 20 cm³ of water, so total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the concentration after dilution is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, for the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid. So the equivalence volume is moles of acid divided by concentration of NaOH. Moles of acid is 0.001. NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration, which is when 25% of the required NaOH has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at that point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So moles of acetic acid neutralized are 0.00025. Initially, we had 0.001 moles. So remaining acetic acid is 0.00075 moles, and moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-) produced are 0.00025 moles.

Wait, but wait. The total volume at 25% titration is the initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So concentrations at 25% titration: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) ? Wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → log(Ka) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5). Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5)= 0.267 -5 =-4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) ). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 -0.477 =4.256. So around 4.26.

Wait, the options have 4.26 as an option in option A and D. Let me think again. Wait, in the problem statement, the initial solution is 20 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid diluted with 20 cm³ water. So the dilution factor is 2x, so the concentration is 0.025 M. That's correct.

At 25% titration, 25% of the moles have been neutralized. So moles reacted is 0.00025, so remaining acid is 0.00075, and acetate is 0.00025.

So the ratio is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is about -0.477, so pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256. So approximately 4.26. So that would be the first value. Now, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, D is 4.57 and 6.92. So I'm thinking the first pH is 4.26.

Wait, but wait another thing. Alternatively, perhaps we should consider that the total volume changes. Because when you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH to the 40 cm³, the volume becomes 42.5 cm³. So the concentrations would be (0.00075 / 0.0425) for acetic acid and (0.00025 / 0.0425) for acetate.

So 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. So the ratio is (0.005882)/(0.017647) = 1/3, same as before. So the Henderson equation still gives pH≈4.256.

So the first pH is about 4.26. Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So we'll have a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

So the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for this can be found using Kw/Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25 C. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate at equivalence point is moles divided by total volume. Moles of acetate: same as initial moles of acetic acid (0.001 moles). Total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ of NaOH (equivalence volume), so 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10. For a weak base, the hydrolysis reaction gives [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C), assuming that x is small. So let's compute x.

x^2 = Kb * C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6. So [OH^-] ≈3.288e-6 M. pOH is -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.484. So pH is 14 -5.484=8.516, approximately 8.52.

So at equivalence point, pH is around 8.52. So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. So the correct option would be A.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in considering the initial concentrations? Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. When diluted to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, so moles of NaOH are 0.001. So the volume is 10 cm³, so total volume is 50 cm³. So concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-calculate Kb.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb= Kw/Ka= (1e-14)/(1.85e-5)= approx 5.405e-10. Correct.

So the concentration of OH- is sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 3.288e-6. So pOH is -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.517, so 5.517 → pOH=5.4828. pH=14-5.4828=8.5172, so about 8.52.

So the equivalence pH is 8.52, and 25% titration pH is 4.26. So option A.

But wait, looking back at the options, option A is 4.26; 8.52. So that seems correct.

Wait, but I remember that sometimes when diluting and titrating, the initial dilution affects both the concentrations and the equivalence point. Did I account for that correctly?

Wait, the volume after dilution is 40 cm³, correct. So when we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 42.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, the concentrations are as I calculated. So the buffer calculation is correct.

Another check: when you have equal concentrations of acid and conjugate base, the pH=pKa, which is 4.73. In this case, the ratio is 1/3, so the pH should be lower than 4.73, which it is (4.26). Correct.

Therefore, the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of acetic acid with NaOH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

### Initial Setup:
- **Moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**  
  Initial volume of acetic acid = 20.00 cm³ = 0.02 L.  
  Molarity of acetic acid = 0.05 M.  
  Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.02 \, \text{L} \times 0.05 \, \text{M} = 0.001 \, \text{moles} \).

- **Dilution with water:**  
  After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L} \).  
  Diluted concentration of acetic acid = \( \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \).

### 25% Titration:
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.  
- **Moles of NaOH added:**  
  Volume of NaOH added = \( 25\% \times 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0025 \, \text{L} \).  
  Molarity of NaOH = 0.1 M.  
  Moles of NaOH = \( 0.0025 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{M} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles} \).

- **Remaining moles of CH₃COOH:**  
  Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001.  
  Moles neutralized = 0.00025.  
  Remaining moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles} \).

- **Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed:**  
  Each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of CH₃COOH, forming one mole of CH₃COO⁻.  
  Moles of CH₃COO⁻ = 0.00025.

- **Total volume at 25% titration:**  
  Initial volume of solution = 40.00 cm³.  
  Volume of NaOH added = 2.5 cm³.  
  Total volume = \( 40.00 + 2.5 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \).

- **Concentrations:**  
  \[
  [\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
  \]

- **pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:**  
  The \( K_a \) of acetic acid is \( 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \), so \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \).  
  \[
  \text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]}\right).
  \]  
  Substituting the concentrations:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \, (\text{or } 4.26).
  \]

### Equivalence Point:
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).  
- **Moles of CH₃COO⁻:**  
  Moles of CH₃COOH initially = 0.001.  
  At equivalence, moles of CH₃COO⁻ = 0.001.

- **Total volume at equivalence point:**  
  Initial volume of solution = 40.00 cm³.  
  Volume of NaOH added = 10.00 cm³.  
  Total volume = \( 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L} \).

- **Concentration of CH₃COO⁻:**  
  \[
  [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
  \]

- **pH at equivalence point:**  
  The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is the conjugate base of acetic acid. Its \( K_b \) is given by:  
  \[
  K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
  \]  
  Using the formula for the hydrolysis of CH₃COO⁻:  
  \[
  [\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH₃COO⁻}]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} \approx \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
  \]  
  \[
  \text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 5.484 = 8.516 \, (\text{or } 8.52).
  \]

### Final Answer:
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.
