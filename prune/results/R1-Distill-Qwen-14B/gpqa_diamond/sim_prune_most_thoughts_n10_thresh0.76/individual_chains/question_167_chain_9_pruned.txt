Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information. Gaussian states are things like coherent states, squeezed states, etc., and non-Gaussian states are more exotic, like cat states or Fock states. The non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is compared to a Gaussian reference state.

The question gives me a specific state |psi> which is a superposition of two coherent states: cos(phi)|alpha> and sin(phi)|-alpha>, all normalized by N. The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Oh, wait, because when you have a superposition of two coherent states, the normalization comes from the inner product of the state with itself. The inner product of |alpha> and |-alpha> is exp(-2|alpha|²) because <alpha| -alpha> = exp(-2|alpha|²) (since they are coherent states with opposite phases).

So the state is a cat state when it's a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. The non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy between the state's density matrix and a Gaussian reference state's density matrix.

The relative entropy measure given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is a Gaussian reference state. Wait, but I think I might have this mixed up. Relative entropy usually is S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). Oh wait, no, wait, the formula here is written as del_b equals trace(rho ln rho) minus trace(tau ln tau). Hmm, that's a bit different. I'm trying to remember... Oh wait, maybe I'm confusing this with the definition. Because the usual relative entropy is S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho (ln rho - ln tau)) ), which would be Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But here, it's Tr(rho ln rho) minus Tr(tau ln tau). That's the same as S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. But wait, von Neumann entropy is S(rho) = - Tr(rho ln rho). So in this case, del_b would be -(S(rho) - S(tau))? Or wait, no: because S(rho) is -Tr(rho ln rho). So if del_b is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), then it's equal to - S(rho) + S(tau). That doesn't seem right because usually, the relative entropy is a measure of how different rho is from tau. But wait, in this question, the del_b is defined as [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. So it's rho's entropy term minus tau's entropy term. But I'm getting confused because I remember that when comparing non-Gaussian states to Gaussian states, the relative entropy is used in a certain
