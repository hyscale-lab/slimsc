Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.

The problem says: There's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A through D.

Hmm, so I'm thinking this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Because when charges are placed in a system, their potential energy contributes to the total energy. Since the system is isolated, the potential energy is the main thing to consider here.

Wait, the setup is that 12 charges are fixed at 2m from point P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th is fixed, and the others are 2 meters away. But wait, the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m, so maybe they form some sort of structure around point P, but since their positions are fixed, I don't need to worry about their mutual interactions beyond their positions relative to each other and the central charge.

Wait no, wait. So the 12 charges are each at 2m from P. So P has the 13th charge, and each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P. So perhaps they form a regular dodecahedron or something around P, but that might complicate things. But maybe for the purpose of calculating potential energy, I can treat each of the 12 as a point charge at 2m from the 13th.

Wait no, but the problem is about the potential energy of the system. So I think I need to calculate the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges, and also the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, but wait. The potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So I have to calculate the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the 13th, and also the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but the problem says each charge is 2e. So each charge is +2e, assuming they are positive, but the sign doesn't matter
