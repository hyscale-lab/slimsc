Okay, so I've got this question here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors, like the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. But wait, the question also gives some data about the RV method and transit method. I think I need to figure out the distance of each planet from the star using the radial velocity data.

Wait, the problem states that both detection methods are used. The transit method gives the radius of the planet, I think, because when it passes in front of the star, we can measure how much light is blocked, which tells us the size. But here, both planets are given their radii. So maybe the transit data isn't directly needed for the temperature calculation, but the RV data is more important for that.

The radial velocity method gives information about the mass of the planet and the distance from the star. Oh right, because the Doppler shift depends on the mass and the orbital period. Wait, but the question gives the shift in the forbidden line. Oh, the RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's movement caused by the planet's gravity.

So each planet induces a certain shift. Planet1 causes up to 0.03 Å shift, Planet2 causes 0.04 Å. I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The formula for the Doppler shift is something like delta lambda over lambda equals velocity over c, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Wait, the formula is delta lambda = (v/c) * lambda. Or maybe it's (delta wavelength) = (v) * (wavelength) / c? I'm not sure, but I think v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us.

Wait, the given shifts are the periodic shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. So the wavelength is 6300 Å for both. So for Planet1: delta lambda is 0.03 Å, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 Å. Using the Doppler formula, delta lambda is approximately (v/c)*lambda. Wait, but I remember sometimes people use (v/c) for small velocities. So the velocity v would be (delta lambda / lambda) * c.

So for Planet1: v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c. I'm assuming c is the speed of light, but I can just calculate the ratio without needing the exact value.

So let's compute the velocities:

v1 = (0.03 /6300) * c ≈ (0.03/6300) * 3e5 km/s? Wait, wait, 3e5 km/s is 300,000 km/s. Wait, 6300 angstroms is 630 nm, which is in the visible range. But perhaps instead of getting into the numbers, I can find the ratio of v1 to v2.

v1 = (0.03 /6300) * c = (3e-2 /6.3e3) * c ≈ (4.76e-6) * c.

v2 = (0.04 /6300) * c ≈ (6.34e-6) * c.

So v2 is larger than v1 because 0.04 is bigger than 0.03. So Planet2 is causing a larger Doppler shift, implying a larger velocity of the star. But wait, the star's velocity is connected to the mass of the planet and the distance. Oh right, because the more massive the planet, the more it tugs on the star, causing a larger Doppler shift.

Wait, no, wait. The RV method depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period and the distance. The formula for the RV
