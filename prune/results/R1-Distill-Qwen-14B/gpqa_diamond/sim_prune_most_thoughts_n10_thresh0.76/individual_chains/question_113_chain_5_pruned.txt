Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that the compound was characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of data.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 wavenumbers. I remember that broad peaks in the IR around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but a very broad peak might be more like an O-H from something like a carbonyl or maybe a conjugated system. Oh wait, another possibility is an aromatic ring with O-H groups, but maybe it's an alcohol or a phenol.

Then, two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, so that could be conjugated carbonyl groups. For example, in a conjugated carbonyl like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, the carbonyl might be at around 1700, and the conjugated double bond (like in a vinyl group) would have another peak. Wait, but another thought: maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring with double bonds. Or maybe an ester and an alkene?

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, like CH2=CH. So the compound has a double bond, probably an alkene.

Then, the mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, m/z 45. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 is a common fragment. Wait, 45 could be CH3CO (which is 45: 12+16+16=44? Wait, C=12, H=1, O=16. Wait, CH3CO is (12*2)+(1*3)+(16) = 24+3+16=43. Wait, not quite. Oh wait, maybe it's another fragment. Alternatively, maybe it's the methyl group attached to something else. Or perhaps a ketene ion or something else.

Wait, another approach: possible molecular formulas are all C6H something O something. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let me think about the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here, so for each formula:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. (2*6+2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. Two rings, or ring + double bond, etc.

Option D: C6H12O. (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond.

Wait, but from the NMR, there are vinyl hydrogens. So that suggests a double bond. So the compound has at least one double bond. So the degree of unsaturation for each option:

Option A: 1. So either one double bond or one ring. But since there's a double bond (from NMR), that would fit.

Option B: 2. So two rings and/or double bonds. But since the NMR only shows vinyl (one double bond?), but maybe also a ring.

Wait, but the FTIR has peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a carbonyl. The 1650 is another peak. If the compound has a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone, that would lower the carbonyl peak. Wait, the carbonyl in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone is around 1700, and the conjugated double bond would have a peak around 1650. So maybe that's the case.

So the compound has a carbonyl group and a double bond, which would add two degrees of unsaturation. Let's check the options again.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation 1. So maybe a double bond and a ring? Or two rings but that's unlikely. Wait, but if there's only one degree, but from the data we have a double bond (from NMR) and a carbonyl (from IR), that's two degrees. So that would require the degree of unsaturation to be at least two. So options A and D have only one degree, which wouldn't be enough.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let's recalculate:

Wait, the formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. All options have no N or X, so it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

For option
