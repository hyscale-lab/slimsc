Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spins and the partition function. Hmm, let me think about how to approach it. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll try to piece it together.

The problem says we have three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. The options are given, so maybe I can work through the possible states and calculate their energies, then sum the Boltzmann factors.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Right. So each state contributes a term like exp(-βE).

First, I think I should figure out all the possible configurations of the three spins. Since each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states.

Let me list them:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Now, for each state, I need to compute the energy E.

Wait, the energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's compute that for each state.

Let me make a table:

State | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1S2 | S1S3 | S2S3 | Sum (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) | E = -J * Sum
-----|----|----|----|------|------|------|---------------------------|------------
1    | +1 | +1 | +1 | +1 | +1 | +1 | 3 | E = -J *3 = -3J
2    | +1 | +1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 | Sum = +1 -1 -1 = -1 → E = J
3    | +1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | Sum = -1 +1 -1 = -1 → E = J
4    | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 | -1 | +1 | Sum = -1 -1 +1 = -1 → E= J
5    | -1 | +1 | +1 | -1 | -1 | +1 | Sum = -1 -1 +1 = -1 → E= J
6    | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | Sum = -1 +1 -1= -1 → E= J
7    | -1 | -1 | +1 | +1 | -1 | -1 | Sum = +1 -1 -1 = -1 → E= J
8    | -1 | -1 | -1 | +1 | +1 | +1 | Sum =3 → E= -3J

Wait, let me check each calculation carefully. Because it's easy to make a mistake here.

Starting with state 1: all +1. Each product S1S2, etc., is +1. Sum is 3. So E = -3J.

State 2: S3 is -1. So S1S2 is +1. S1S3 is -1. S2S3 is -1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = J.

Wait, because E is -J times that sum. So for state 2, sum is -1 → E = -J*(-1)= J.

Similarly, let's check state 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1.

S1S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.

S2S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1.

Sum: -1 + (-1) +1 = -1. So E = J.

Similarly, state 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

S1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.

S1S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.

S2S3 = (+1)(+1) = +1.

Sum is -1-1+1 = -1 → E= J.

State 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.

S1S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1.

S2S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.

Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1 → E= J.

State 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2 = (+1) because (-1)(-1)=+1.

S1S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.

S2S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.

Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1 → E= J.

State 8: all -1.

Each product is +1. Sum is 3 → E = -3J.

Wait, so how many states have E = -3J and how many have E= J?

Looking back:

Only states 1 and 8 have E = -3J and E = -3J, respectively? Wait, no: state 1 has all spins +1, so E=-3J; state 8 has all spins -1, so each product is +1, sum is 3 → E = -3J.

Wait no, state 8's E is -3J because E = -J*(sum of 3) → -3J.

So E is -3J for state 1 and 8.

Other states (2-7) have E= J.

Wait, how many states have E=J? States 2,3,4,5,6,7 → that's 6 states.

So for each state, calculate exp(-β E), which is exp(β E) because E is negative.

Wait, no. The energy is E, so the Boltzmann factor is exp( - β E ).

So for states with E = -3J, the Boltzmann factor is exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3Jβ).

Similarly, for E = J, the factor is exp(-β*J).

So let's compute the contributions.

Number of states with E= -3J: 2 (states 1 and 8). Each contributes exp(3Jβ).

Number of states with E=J: 6. Each contributes exp(-Jβ).

So the partition function Z = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ).

Wait, does that match one of the options?

Looking at the options:

Option A) Z=2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ) → No, because our terms are 2 e^{3Jβ} and 6 e^{-Jβ}.

Option B) Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Yes, that's exactly what I have.

Option C) Z=2 e^{2Jβ} +6 e^{-2Jβ} → Doesn't match.

Option D) Z=6 e^{2Jβ} +2 e^{-2Jβ} → No.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \). The partition function is defined as \( Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E} \), where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \).

### Step 1: Enumerate all possible states
There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states for the three spins. Each state is characterized by the values of \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \). For simplicity, we list the states and compute their energies:

1. \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = +1 \):  
   \( S_1S_2 = +1, S_1S_3 = +1, S_2S_3 = +1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = 3 \),  
   \( E = -J(3) = -3J \).

2. \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = -1 \):  
   \( S_1S_2 = +1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

3. \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = +1 \):  
   \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = +1, S_2S_3 = -1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

4. \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = -1 \):  
   \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = +1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

5. \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = +1 \):  
   \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = +1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

6. \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = -1 \):  
   \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = +1, S_2S_3 = -1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

7. \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = +1 \):  
   \( S_1S_2 = +1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = -1 \),  
   \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

8. \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = -1 \):  
   \( S_1S_2 = +1, S_1S_3 = +1, S_2S_3 = +1 \),  
   \( \text{Sum} = 3 \),  
   \( E = -J(3) = -3J \).

### Step 2: Classify states by energy
From the above calculations:
- Two states (1 and 8) have \( E = -3J \).
- Six states (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) have \( E = J \).

### Step 3: Compute the partition function
The partition function is the sum of Boltzmann factors for all states:
\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E}.
\]
For the two states with \( E = -3J \), the Boltzmann factor is:
\[
e^{-\beta E} = e^{-\beta(-3J)} = e^{3J\beta}.
\]
For the six states with \( E = J \), the Boltzmann factor is:
\[
e^{-\beta E} = e^{-\beta J}.
\]
Thus, the partition function becomes:
\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
Comparing with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect, signs of exponents are reversed).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct, matches the derived expression).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, wrong exponents).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, wrong coefficients and exponents).

### Final Answer:
The correct partition function is \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
