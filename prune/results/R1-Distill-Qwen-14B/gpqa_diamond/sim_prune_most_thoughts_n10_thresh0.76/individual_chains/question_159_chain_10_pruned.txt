Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question talks about observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum, focusing on near infrared and optical. There's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. Hmm, I remember that the peak of emission in an object's spectrum can tell us something about its redshift. Oh right! It's related to the Lyman-alpha forest or maybe the Lyman-alpha emission line. Wait, quasars often show emission lines, and the Lyman-alpha line is a prominent one for hydrogen. The rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is about 121.6 nm in the ultraviolet. So if the observed wavelength is longer, that suggests redshift.

So the observed peak is at 790 nm. Let me calculate the redshift here. The formula for redshift (z) is z = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1. So z = 790 / 121.6 - 1. Let's compute that.

First, 790 divided by 121.6. Let me approximate that. 121.6 * 6 is 729.6, and 790 is a bit more than that. 121.6 * 6.5 is 786.4. Oh wait, wait. 121.6 * 6.5 is around 786. So 790 is about 3.6 nm longer. So 790/121.6 ≈ 6.5 or perhaps a bit higher. Let's compute it more accurately.

790 divided by 121.6: 121.6 * 6 = 729.6. 729.6 + (121.6 * 0.5) = 60.8, so 729.6 +60.8= 790.4. Oh wait! So 6.5 times 121.6 is 790.4 nm. So the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is just under 790.4. So z = 6.5 - 1? Wait no, wait. Let me clarify the formula. The observed wavelength λ_obs = (1 + z) * λ_rest. So z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1.

So λ_obs is 790 nm, λ_rest is 121.6 nm. So 790 / 121.6 is approximately 6.5. So z ≈ 6.5 - 1 = 5.5? Wait no, wait. 790 / 121.6 = 6.5 exactly? Because 121.6 * 6.5 is 790.4. So 790 is just a bit less than that. So perhaps z is about 6.48 or something, but for approximation, let's say z is ~6.48.

Wait, but wait. If the peak is at 7
