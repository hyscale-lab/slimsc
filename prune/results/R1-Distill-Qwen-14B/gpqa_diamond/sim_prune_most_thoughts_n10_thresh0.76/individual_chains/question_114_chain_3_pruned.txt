Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Let's see what the question says.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in the presence of H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose between the options A to D.

Hmm, let me start by understanding each reaction. 

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let me write down the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. The cyanide ion (CN-) would attack the carbonyl carbon. So the product would have a cyanide group attached where the carbonyl was. But the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure of that. It's CH2(CO2H)C(CN)(CH3) maybe? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be something like CH2C(OH)(CN)(CH2CH3)? Or wait, butanenitrile is four carbons. Let me get this right. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butane is four carbons. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, the nitrile is on the end. But 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)C(CN)H? Wait, but structure of butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN. Wait, but in the product, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, so position 2 has hydroxy and methyl groups, and nitrile is probably at position 1 or 4? Wait, butanenitrile is four carbons with nitrile on the first carbon. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butane is CH3CH2CH2CH2-, so butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, nitriles are R-CN. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, that's pentanenitrile. Wait, wait, let me think again. Butanenitrile would be four carbons in the chain. So it's CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, no, that's only three carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively
