Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electron scattering. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. Alright, the question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The phase shifts given are δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. The rest are ignored, so I guess they don't contribute.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ (2i l δ_l) * P_l(cosθ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh, right, along the beam direction θ=0°, so cosθ=1.

At θ=0°, the P_l(1) terms. Legendre polynomials... I think P_l(1) is 1 for all l because P_l(1) = 1. So all the terms would just be (2i l δ_l) multiplied by 1, then summed over l, and then multiplied by 1/k.

Wait, but the question asks for the imaginary part. So each term in the sum has an i, so the imaginary part would be the sum of 2 l δ_l, right? Because i times real number is imaginary, so the imaginary part of each term is 2 l δ_l, and then summed over all l. Then, multiply by 1/k.

But wait, another thing—what is k? Oh, right, k is the wave number. For electrons, the wave number k is related to the momentum p by k = p/ħ. The energy is given as 50 MeV. Hmm, but electrons are relativistic? At 50 MeV, their rest mass is about 0.511 MeV, so yes, they're definitely relativistic.

Wait, but the formula for the wave number for electrons in scattering is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but that's for non-relativistic. Oh wait, maybe the problem expects us to use the relativistic expression. Alternatively, perhaps they just want to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can approximate k using the relation E = (ħ² k²)/(2m), but wait, that's non-relativistic. But for a 50 MeV electron, the rest mass is about 0.511 MeV, so the kinetic energy is much higher. So relativistic effects are important, but maybe the problem simplifies the calculation by assuming E is much larger than m, so that E ≈ p c. Oh wait, that makes sense. Because for high energies, E ≈ pc, so p ≈ E/(c). Then, the wave number k is p/(ħ). So substituting p ≈ E/(c), k ≈ E/(ħ c).

Wait, but E is given in MeV. We need to convert it to Joules to compute k. Let's think about the units. ħ is Planck's constant over 2π, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.

Wait, but maybe the problem expects us to use a shortcut. Because in particle physics, sometimes they use units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm. Oh right! That's a common conversion factor. So 197.33 MeV·fm is approximately ħ c.

So if E is 50 MeV, then k ≈ E/(ħ c) ≈ 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV·fm) ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹. Wait, because k = p/ħ, and p = E/(c) for high energies. So k = (E/(c)) / ħ = E/(ħ c). With E in MeV, ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm, so k = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but k is in units of 1/fm because 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. So k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So going back to the formula for the imaginary part of f(θ=0). It's (1/k) * Σ (2 l δ_l ), because each term is (2i l δ_l) P_l(1) and P_l(1)=1, and the sum is over the given l's. So the imaginary part is Im f(0) = (2/(i k)) * sum (l δ_l) ? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the formula is f(θ) = (1/k
