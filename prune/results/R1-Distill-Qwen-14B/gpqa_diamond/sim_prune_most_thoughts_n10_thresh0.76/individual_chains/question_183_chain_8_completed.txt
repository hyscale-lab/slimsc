Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to find the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product after a reaction. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's try to visualize the structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring—so a six-membered ring with one double bond. The positions are numbered, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 because it's cyclohex-3-ene.

Then, the substituents: at position 2, there's a formyl group (which is a CHO). At position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-, right? So, the substituent is a vinyl group attached at carbon 5 of the cyclohexene ring. And then, there's a carboxylic acid group at position... wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Oh, wait, the -carboxylic acid is at position 1, I think. Because in the numbering, the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So the cyclohexene ring is numbered 1 through 6. So position 1: carboxylic acid (COOH), position 2: formyl (CHO), position 5: vinyl (CH2CH2?), but wait, the vinyl is CH2=CH-, so the structure at position 5 is a CH2 connected to a CH2=CH- group?

Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. The cyclohexene ring has double bond between C3 and C4. Carbon 1 has the COOH group. Carbon 2 has a formyl (CHO). Carbon 5 has a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH- attached as a substituent.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, right! That's the reaction that cleaves double bonds, especially in the presence of those reagents. I remember that when you have a diene or a conjugated diene and treat it with PPh3 (triphenylphosphine) and excess HI, it can lead to the cleavage of double bonds, adding iodides. But wait, red phosphorus and HI—I think that's a different reaction. Oh, right, the Fritsch-Buttenberg-Wiechell rearrangement? No, that's for different conditions.

Wait, another possibility: the presence of red phosphorus and HI is a condition that causes the cleavage of double bonds. For example, in the case of alkenes, they can undergo iodide addition. But wait, more accurately, red phosphorus reacts with iodine to generate a phosphorus triiodide (PI3), which is a good reagent for the cleavage of alkenes. So, in the presence of PI3, alkenes undergo cleavage, especially in conjugated dienes. 

But in this case, the starting molecule has two double bonds? Let me check. The cyclohexene has one double bond (C3-C4). Then, the vinyl group (at C5) is another double bond (CH2-CH2 with a double bond, so CH2=CH- as a substituent). So, the starting molecule has two double bonds—so it's a diene.

So, when we treat this with red phosphorus and excess HI, what happens? I think each double bond will be cleaved. Let me recall: when alkenes are treated with phosphorus and HI, each double bond is cleaved to form two carbocations, which then react with iodide ions. But in the case of conjugated dienes, this can lead to more extensive reactions.

Wait, the starting molecule's structure: the cyclohexene ring with substituents. So, the ring has a double bond at C3-C4, and the substituent at C5 is a vinyl group (another double bond). So, the molecule has two double bonds: one in the ring, and one in the substituent.

When treated with red phosphorus and excess HI, each of these double bonds could undergo cleavage.

Let me think about the reaction mechanism. Red phosphorus reacts with HI to form PH3 and I2. Wait, no, maybe it's a different pathway. Alternatively, the reaction could involve the formation of a ylide or some kind of ring-opening.

Wait, another approach: the cleavage of each double bond. So, the first double bond in the ring (cyclohexene) would be cleaved. Cleavage of cyclohexene would break the ring, perhaps leading to a diacid or something similar. Wait, but the initial compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, when the cyclohexene's double bond is cleaved, the ring would open, and each of the carbons involved in the double bond would get an iodide.

Wait, but the ring is part of the molecule; cleaving the double bond would break the ring into a chain. So, for example, if the cyclohexene is C3-C4 double bond, then cleavage would convert the six-membered ring into a four-carbon chain, with a COOH group, a formyl group, a vinyl group, and iodide groups added.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine each double bond being cleaved. Each double bond would add an iodide and break the bond. So for each double bond, two I atoms are added, one on each carbon.

So, the initial molecule has two double bonds: one in the ring and one in the vinyl group. So after cleavage, each of those would be broken, and each carbon in the double bonds would get an iodide.

But wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached at C5. Cleaving that would give two CH2I groups? Or not exactly. Let me think again. When a double bond is cleaved in the presence of HI (and the phosphorus), each carbon of the double bond would get an iodide. So, for the vinyl group (CH2=CH-), cleavage would produce CH2I and CHI. But since the vinyl group is attached to the cyclohexene, perhaps the cleavage would convert the vinyl group into a CH2I-CH2I structure, but that doesn't sound right.

Alternatively, perhaps each double bond is converted into a single bond with iodides on each end. For the cyclohexene's double bond (C3-C4), breaking would give each of those carbons an iodide. Similarly, the vinyl group's double bond would be broken, giving each of its carbons an iodide.

Wait, but the initial structure is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the formyl is at C2, the vinyl at C5, and the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4.

So, when reacting with red phosphorus and HI, both double bonds (in the ring and the vinyl group) undergo cleavage.

So, let's imagine the cyclohexene ring: when the C3-C4 double bond is cleaved, the ring opens up. The ring was six-membered, so opening it would result in a chain of four carbons. Let's imagine it becomes a four-carbon chain with substituents.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think about each double bond being cleaved independently. The ring's double bond is cleaved, and the vinyl group's double bond is also cleaved.

So, for the ring's double bond (C3-C4), cleavage would add I to both C3 and C4. The ring would open, so the six-membered ring becomes a four-membered chain, perhaps. Wait, but maybe that's not the correct approach. Alternatively, the ring opens into a diacid or something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about each double bond. The starting material has two double bonds:

1. The cyclohexene's C3-C4 double bond.

2. The vinyl group's double bond (between the two carbons of the substituent).

When both are cleaved, each double bond becomes two single bonds with iodides on each carbon.

So, the product would have iodides on C3 and C4 (from the ring) and on the two carbons of the vinyl group.

Wait, but the vinyl group is attached to C5 of the cyclohexene. So, the vinyl group is CH2-CH2 with a double bond, so CH2=CH- attached at C5.

So, when we cleave the vinyl group's double bond, each of the carbons (the one attached to C5 and the other) gets an iodide. So, the vinyl group becomes CH2I-CH2I after cleavage? No, wait, when you cleave a double bond, you add an iodide to each carbon. So, CH2=CH-R becomes CH2I-CH2I-R? Or is it CH2I-CH2I as a substituent?

Alternatively, perhaps each double bond is cleaved to form an iodide on each end. So, the ring's double bond would form two iodides, and the vinyl's would form two iodides as well.

But wait, the starting material is a cyclohexene ring, so when the ring's double bond is cleaved, the ring would open, leading to a chain structure. Let me try to model this.

The starting ring is cyclohexene. So, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The double bond is between C3 and C4. When this double bond is cleaved, the ring breaks between C3 and C4. So the ring opens, and the structure becomes a chain. The positions would be 1, 2, 3 (now connected to 4?), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the cleavage of the ring's double bond would lead to a diacid. Wait, the starting material has a carboxylic acid group at position 1. So when the ring is broken, perhaps the carboxylic acid group is at one end, and the formyl group is at another position.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Let me think about the overall reaction and the product. The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI, which is a condition for the cleavage of alkenes to form carbocations, which then get attacked by iodide.

Wait, but I'm a bit rusty on this. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a di-iodination of the double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-iodide, but that's not quite right.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a diiodide addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the index of hydrogen deficiency is the sum of the number of rings and double bonds (each ring or double bond contributes 1). So, the product's index would be based on its structure.

The starting molecule has two double bonds (cyclohexene and vinyl group), so it has an index of 2 (since a ring is like a double bond in terms of hydrogen deficiency). Wait, no, wait: the cyclohexene has a ring (which counts as a double bond in terms of hydrogen deficiency) plus another double bond in the vinyl group. Wait, no, the cyclohexene has a ring which is one double bond equivalent, and the vinyl group has another double bond. So total index is 2 (ring) + 1 (vinyl double bond) = 3. So the starting material has an index of 3. 

But the question is about the product. So, when the reaction is done, how does the product's structure change in terms of rings and double bonds?

Assuming that both double bonds (the ring and the vinyl) are cleaved, the product would have no rings and no double bonds. So its index would be zero.

Wait, but wait a second. The reaction is with excess HI, so perhaps the conditions are such that all double bonds are cleaved.

If both double bonds are cleaved, then the rings are opened, and all double bonds are converted into single bonds with iodide substituents. So, the product would be a fully saturated molecule (no rings, no double bonds), which would have an index of hydrogen deficiency of 0.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps only the cyclohexene's double bond is cleaved, and the vinyl group's double bond remains. No, the reaction uses excess HI, so it's likely both are cleaved.

So, the product would have no rings and no double bonds, so index is 0.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about what the product would look like. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, when the cyclohexene's double bond is cleaved, the ring opens, and the substituents are on the resulting chain.

The cleavage of the ring's double bond would break the ring into a straight chain. So, the carboxylic acid group is at one end, the formyl at position 2, and then the vinyl group at position 5 (if the chain is longer). Alternatively, perhaps after cleavage, the ring becomes a chain, and the two substituents (formyl and vinyl) are attached.

Wait, maybe the cleavage of the ring's double bond would add iodide groups on C3 and C4, breaking the ring into a chain. So, the structure would become something like a chain with the carboxylic acid at one end, the formyl group, then the vinyl group, and the iodides where the double bond was.

But then, the vinyl group's double bond would also be cleaved, adding more iodides.

Wait, perhaps the product would have multiple iodide substituents. Let me try to sketch it mentally.

After cleaving the cyclohexene's double bond (C3-C4), the ring becomes a chain. So, the chain would have the carboxylic acid at C1, formyl at C2, then what was C3 and C4 become single bonds, each with an iodide. Then, C5 has the vinyl group, which upon cleavage would add iodides to that group as well.

Wait, but perhaps the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to C5. Cleavage would break that into CH2I and CHI. So, each of those carbons would have an iodide.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group becomes a diiodide, like CH2I-CH2I.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure. But the key point is the index of hydrogen deficiency. If all double bonds and rings are cleaved, the product would have no double bonds and no rings. So, the index would be 0, which is option D.

Alternatively, if only one double bond is cleaved, maybe the other remains. But under excess HI and red phosphorus, both are likely cleaved.

So, the product would be a fully saturated molecule, so index 0.


The starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, contains two double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring (C3-C4) and another in the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached at position 5. The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI is known to cleave double bonds, converting them into single bonds and adding iodides to the carbons involved in the double bonds.

When the cyclohexene ring's double bond (C3-C4) is cleaved, the ring opens, forming a chain structure. The vinyl group's double bond is also cleaved, converting it into a single bond with iodides on each carbon. After the reaction, the product is fully saturated, with no remaining rings or double bonds. 

The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Since the product has neither rings nor double bonds, its index of hydrogen deficiency is **0**.

Answer: D
