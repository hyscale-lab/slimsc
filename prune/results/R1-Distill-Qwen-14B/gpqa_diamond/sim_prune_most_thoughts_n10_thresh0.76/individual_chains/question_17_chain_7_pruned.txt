Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. They also give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what the K value represents here. Oh right, K is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−, right? And the K is given as 5e10, which is a really large number, meaning the complex is very stable.

So the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. That's the concentration of CaEDTA^2−. I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. Oh, right, because EDTA forms a very stable complex with metal ions, the free ion concentration is usually very low.

In such cases, the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA^2-], is much larger than the concentrations of the individual ions. So the assumption is that the concentration of Ca²+ is much smaller than the concentration of the complex. But wait, how does that translate into the actual calculation?

I think I need to use
