Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions typically involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for such reactions is often measured in kilojoules per mole or kilocalories per mole.

The question gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Let's list what each is. HCl is hydrochloric acid, a strong acid. H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, which is also a strong acid, but I think it's diprotic, meaning it can donate two protons. Ba(OH)2 is barium hydroxide, a strong base. So when these are mixed, they'll react.

Wait, the problem says all three are mixed together. So I need to figure out all the possible reactions here. Oh, wait a second, HCl is a monoprotic acid. H2SO4 is diprotic, so each molecule can react with two hydroxide ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and since Ba is +2, each Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

Let me think about the neutralization reaction. The general reaction is acid(s) + base → salt + water. So each H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base.

First, I should calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Starting with HCl:
Volume is 500 mL (which is 0.5 L), molarity 0.2 M. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is monoprotic, that's 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4:
Volume is 300 mL (0.3 L), molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole contributes 2 H+. So total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Then, Ba(OH)2:
Volume is 200 mL (0.2 L), molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions, so moles of OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but when these react, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. The total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles. The OH- is 0.2 moles.

So, which one is in excess? Because the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the OH- will neutralize some of the H+, but maybe not all.

So moles of H+ available: 0.28
Moles of OH- available: 0.2

So OH- will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+. So the remaining H+ is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles. But wait, wait, that can't be right because the OH- is in limited supply. Alternatively, perhaps the OH- is the limiting reactant here.

Wait, but the OH- will react with H+ in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.2 moles OH- will neutralize 0.2 moles H+.

So the total H+ from the two acids is 0.28, and
