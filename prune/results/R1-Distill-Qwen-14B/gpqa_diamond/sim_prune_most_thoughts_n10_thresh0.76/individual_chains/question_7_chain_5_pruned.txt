Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

The question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The process is gamma-gamma annihilation producing electron-positron pairs, right? So the reaction is γγ → e+e-. The question is asking from what energy do these gamma-rays have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV.

Hmm. I think this has to do with photon-photon interaction and the mean free path of the gamma-rays. The idea is that high-energy gamma-rays will eventually annihilate with CMB photons, and this process determines how far they can travel (their lifetime). The energy threshold where this process becomes significant would depend on the cross-section and the density of the CMB photons.

Wait, I remember that the photon-photon cross-section for pair production isn't something that's just a fixed number. It depends on the energy of the photons involved. At higher energies, the cross-section increases, but I think it's proportional to some power of the energy. Or maybe it's inversely related? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

So the cross-section for γγ → e+e- is probably a function of the center-of-mass energy. The cross-section might increase as the energy increases because there's a higher chance for pair production when the energy is sufficient. The threshold energy for pair production is when the combined energy of the two photons is at least twice the electron mass, but since the CMB photons are low energy, the high-energy gamma-ray must have enough energy to reach that threshold.

But wait, the problem gives the average CMB photon energy as 1e-3 eV. So each CMB photon has that energy. The gamma-ray's energy is E, and the CMB photon's energy is ε = 1e-3 eV.

The center-of-mass energy squared s would be (E + ε)^2, but in the high-energy limit, where E >> ε, s ≈ (2E)^2. Wait, actually, in the center-of-mass frame, the energy is sqrt( (E + ε)^2 c^4 + (p - p')^2 c^2 ), but since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. For photons, energy E = pc, so their momenta are in opposite directions, so p = E/c. So in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is E + ε, and the momentum is zero. So the invariant s is (E + ε)^2 c^4.

But considering that ε is much smaller than E, the s can be approximated as (2E)^2 c^4. Wait, no. Because E is the gamma-ray energy, and ε is the CMB photon. So in the lab frame where the CMB is isotropic, a gamma photon with energy E would have a photon from the CMB with energy ε colliding. So the center-of-mass energy would be sqrt( (E + ε)^2 c^4 + (p_γ + p_ε c)^2 c^2 ), but since the momenta are in opposite directions, actually, the vector sum is p_γ - p_ε. But photons have p = E/(c), so their momenta are E/c and ε/c but in opposite directions. So p_γ - p_ε = (E - ε)/c. Hmm, but maybe in the high-energy limit, where E >> ε, this becomes E/c.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the relation for the center-of-mass energy squared, s, which is given by s = (E_γ + E_ε)^2 - (p_γ c - p_ε c)^2, because the photons are moving in opposite directions.

Because E_γ = p_γ c and E_ε = p_ε c, so substituting, s = (E_γ + E_ε)^2 - (p_γ c - (-p_ε c))^2. Wait, no, because if they are moving in opposite directions, the momenta are in
