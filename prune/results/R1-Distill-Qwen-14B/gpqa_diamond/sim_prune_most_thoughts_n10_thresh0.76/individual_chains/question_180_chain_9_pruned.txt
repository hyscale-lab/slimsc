Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their masses are negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just electric potential energy. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, and the answer should be correct to three decimal places.

Hmm, right. I remember that electric potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula. The formula for the potential energy U between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². 

But wait, this is a system with multiple charges. So I think I need to calculate the potential energy for each pair and sum them all up. Because each charge contributes to the total potential energy of the system. 

Wait, but the charges are all identical. Each has a charge of 2e. So e is the elementary charge, about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 * 1.602e-19 C, which is 3.204e-19 C.

Now, the system has 13 charges. One is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P. So the 13th charge is at P, and the others are at a distance of 2 m from P. But wait, are the 12 charges each at 2 meters, or are they arranged in some way around P? The problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So I think each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 m from P. 

But wait, the 12 charges are all at 2 m from P. So each of them is a point charge at 2 m, and the 13th is at P. So the question is about the potential energy of the entire system.

Now, when calculating the total potential energy of a system of multiple point charges, you
