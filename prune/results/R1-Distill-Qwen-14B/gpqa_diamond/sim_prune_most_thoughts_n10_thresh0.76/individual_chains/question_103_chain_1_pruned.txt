Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm, let me break that down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target. The ethan-1-one part means there's a ketone group (C=O) attached to a CH2 group. So, the benzene ring must have substituents at specific positions. The substituents are a bromo group and a nitro group. The numbering is a bit tricky, but for benzene, the substituents here are at positions 3 and 5. So, if the ketone is attached at position 1, then the bromo is at 3 and nitro at 5. Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me draw this mentally. The benzene ring with a ketone (O) in the 1 position, then bromo in 3 and nitro in 5. So that makes it 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl attached to a ketone.

To get to this structure from benzene, I think about electrophilic substitution reactions. Benzene can undergo substitution with various reagents. The problem is about the sequence of reactions, so I need to plan the order of substituting groups.

The substituents we're adding are a nitro group, a bromine, and an acetyl group (since ethan-1-one is an acetyl attached to the benzene). But wait, ethan-1-one is a ketone where the carbonyl is attached directly to the benzene. So, perhaps that comes from an acetylation of benzene, but I don't think benzene can directly acetylate. Oh wait, noâ€”benzene can undergo Friedel-Crafts acylation, which adds an acyl group. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. Benzene is deactivating, so you need a catalyst like AlCl3 and a good acylating agent, like acetyl chloride (CH3COCl).

But wait, when you add a substituent to benzene, the next substituent will depend on the directing effects of the existing group. So, if I first introduce a strong activating group, like a nitro group? No, nitro is a strong deactivating (meta-directing) group. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, the target has both nitro and bromo groups. Nitro is meta-directing, and bromine is ortho/para-directing but deactivating. So, the order in which I add these substituents will affect where the others go.

Let me think: The target has nitro at position 5 and bromo at 3. So, if the ketone is at position 1, then the nitro is at 5 (meta to the ketone?), but wait that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, the ketone is attached to the benzene ring. So, the benzene is substituted with an acetyl group (COCH3) at position 1. Then, the nitro group is at position 5, and bromine at
