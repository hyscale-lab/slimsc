Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds. The problem describes several substances (A1 to A5) and their reactions. I need to figure out the molecular weight range of A4.

First, let me list out the information given:

1. A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that stands for the degree of fluorination or oxidation state of fluorine?) is 31.96% in A2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.

2. A3 can interact with xenon and is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 is a binary compound of Y and F.

3. When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, A5 is obtained. Then, when A5 is in water, it decomposes into two substances.

So, the goal is to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Hmm, let me start by thinking about the elements involved. Fluorine is one, and Y is the other. The binary compounds are YF_x, where x varies. Since there are five such compounds, Y must have five possible oxidation states with F. 

Wait, fluorine usually has a -1 charge. So the oxidation states of Y would be from +1 to +5 perhaps? Or maybe other possibilities. Let me think: common elements with multiple oxidation states in binary fluorides. For example, elements like chlorine (but that's a halogen), sulfur, nitrogen, etc. Alternatively, metals like aluminum (but Al typically has +3), or maybe something else.

Wait, another thought: the bright red color might give a clue. I remember that lead(II,IV) fluoride is red, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe Y is chlorine? Because chlorine's compounds can be various colors, but I'm not sure about red. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a transition metal.

Wait, another point: A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is inert, but if A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, that makes sense. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, but perhaps A1 is a compound that is a strong oxidizing agent.

Wait, let's think about some known compounds. For example, consider the case where Y is chlorine. Chlorine trifluoride (ClF3) is a known compound. Wait, but I'm not sure about the colors. Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen? No, because O and F compounds are usually different. Alternatively, could Y be sulfur? Sulfur hexafluoride is a known gas, but that's colorless.

Wait, another approach: let's think about what A1 could be. A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 and fluorine. When it decomposes, fluorine is released. So A1 could be a higher fluoride of Y, breaking down into a lower one and F2.

Wait, for example, suppose Y is chlorine. Then, if A1 is ClF3, which is a yellowish gas, but that's not red. Wait, maybe ClF5. Chlorine pentafluoride is a yellow gas. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is lead. Lead has several fluorides. Lead(II) fluoride is PbF2, which is white. Lead(IV) fluoride is PbF4, which I think is also white. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. The decomposition reaction could be a reduction or oxidation. Let's say A1 is more oxidized than A2. So when A1 decomposes, it produces F2 and A2.

Wait, suppose A1 is YF5, which decomposes into YF3 and F2. Because 5 → 3 + 2. So YF5 → YF3 + F2. But I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, maybe YF3 decomposes into
