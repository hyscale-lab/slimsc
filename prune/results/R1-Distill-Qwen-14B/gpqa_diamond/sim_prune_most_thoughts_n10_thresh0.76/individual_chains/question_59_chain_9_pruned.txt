Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution that's made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I should calculate the moles of each acid and base involved and see what the overall reaction is. 

Let me jot down the given data:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each component.

Moles are calculated as Molarity × Volume (in liters). So let me do that for each.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity = 0.1 M
Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L
Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

For HCl:
Molarity = 0.2 M
Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L
Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

For Ba(OH)2:
Molarity = 0.3 M
Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L
Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit provides two OH- ions, right? So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

So the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, giving 0.08 moles of H+ ions. The CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely; its contribution is 0.05 moles of H+.

Wait, but I should consider which species are in the solution. So the total H+ from strong acids is 0.08 (from HCl) and 0.05 (from CH3COOH). But wait, no, the HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates. The CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it only partially dissociates. But when calculating moles, for the purpose of neutralization, perhaps I should treat all H+ as available from the strong acids and the weak acid as a source that can release some H+.

Wait, no, actually, when considering neutralization with a base, the strong acids will fully contribute H+ ions. The weak acid (acetic acid) will contribute some H+ but not all. But perhaps in the presence of a strong base, the acetic acid may not dissociate as much because the H+ from the strong acids and the OH- from the base will react first.

Alternatively, perhaps I should first calculate the total H+ and OH- in the solution, then see which is in excess.

Let me think: the total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. The HCl gives 0.08 moles of H+. The CH3COOH gives some H+; let me say 'a' moles of H+ from it. But since it's a weak acid, it's not straightforward. However, when mixing with a base, the strong acid's H+ will react with the base's OH- first, and any remaining will determine the pH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of all the H+ and all the OH-.

Total H+ available from HCl and CH3COOH:

HCl provides 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH, being a weak acid, doesn't completely dissociate. Let me calculate the initial H+ from CH3COOH. But wait, when you mix all these solutions, the total volume will change, affecting the concentration, which in turn affects the dissociation of acetic acid. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the net H+ or OH- after all reactions. Let me approach it this way:

First, calculate the moles of H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates. So HCl contributes 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate much. So the initial H+ from CH3COOH is negligible compared to HCl. So when you mix with a base, the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react first.

Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles of OH-.

So the reaction between H+ and OH- is: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

So OH- is in excess. The amount of excess OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Wait, but wait, because the acetic acid also provides some H+. But since the HCl provides strong H+, which reacts first with the OH-. So if we have:

HCl H+ (0.08) + Ba(OH)2 OH- (0.18) → 0.08 H2
