Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. It typically occurs in 1,5-dienes, right? The reaction forms a new six-membered ring. But wait, wait, wait. I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics. Let me think.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Oh, that's a bicyclic structure. Let me try to draw that mentally. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane means it has two rings: a bridge with two carbons and another bridge with two, then a single bridge? Or maybe I should break it down. So, the bicyclo notation [2.2.1] implies the bridgeheads are at positions 1, 4, and the other bridge is a single carbon. Wait, perhaps I should sketch it out.

So, the structure is a norbornene derivative. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene. The substituents here are: at position 2, there's a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), and an azabicyclo, so one of the bridgehead carbons is a nitrogen? Wait, no, wait. 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Oh, the nitrogen is at position 2. So, the structure has a bridge where one bridge is N in the ring.

Wait, maybe the structure is a norbornene with a bridge that includes a nitrogen. Let me see: bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So, positions 1, 4, and 7? Or perhaps 1, 2, etc. Maybe I should think of it as a bicyclo with two bridges: two carbons, two carbons, and one carbon. The nitrogen is at position
