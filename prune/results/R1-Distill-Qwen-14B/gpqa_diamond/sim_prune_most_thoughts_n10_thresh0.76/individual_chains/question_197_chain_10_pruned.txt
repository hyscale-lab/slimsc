Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me see what it's about. The question involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. Right, Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes by replacing the carbonyl group with a methylene group. But wait, I should make sure.

First, let's look at the data for Compound X. The IR shows peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, likely indicative of O-H or N-H stretches. But since the compound is reacting with red phosphorus and HI (which I think is a reagent for reducing carbonyl groups), maybe there's a carbonyl. The IR also has a peak at 1720 cm-1 which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 might be aromatic ring vibrations, like C=C stretching.

Looking at the 1H NMR now. The peaks are:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that's probably an aldehyde proton, since aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, but wait, in the case of a carboxylic acid, the -OH is broad and around 10-12 ppm. But the integration is 1H, which might match a carboxylic acid's -OH, but wait, isn't the -OH usually a broad peak, but sometimes it can be missing in DMSO or other solvents? Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton. But wait, 10.5 is a bit high for an aldehyde. Oh wait, aldehydes are in the 9-10 range, maybe 9.5-10.5. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenolic OH, but if the compound is a benzoic acid, the carboxylic acid proton would be broad and around 10-12. But in the NMR, the 10.5 is a broad singlet, maybe that's the -COOH proton.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) – that's probably two protons on aromatic ring, maybe para to substituents. 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – another set of aromatic protons, likely in a para-substituted benzene. So maybe the benzene has two substituents, perhaps on the 1 and 4 positions. Wait, because if it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, then each
