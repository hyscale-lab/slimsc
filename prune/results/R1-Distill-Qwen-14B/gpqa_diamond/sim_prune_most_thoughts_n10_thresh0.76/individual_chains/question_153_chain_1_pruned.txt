Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember involves enolates attacking a beta-carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Alright, the question presents three different reactions labeled A, B, and C, each with their own set of reactants and conditions, and I need to figure out the major products. Then, I have to match these products with the given options A, B, C, D.

Let's break down each part one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). The product is labeled (A).

I remember that Michael addition typically involves an enolate attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. Dimethyl malonate is a diethyl ester of malonic acid, which is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The other reactant is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, specifically methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, so when the enolate attacks, the acrylate's double bond is at the E configuration. But the regiochemistry in such additionsâ€”does it matter? I think the reaction would proceed via conjugate addition. The enolate would add to the beta carbon, the more substituted one, which is the one away from the substituent. Wait, the structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the E configuration, but wait, wait. Wait, the IUPAC name is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3, right? Because acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, but with a substituent on the middle carbon.

Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3
