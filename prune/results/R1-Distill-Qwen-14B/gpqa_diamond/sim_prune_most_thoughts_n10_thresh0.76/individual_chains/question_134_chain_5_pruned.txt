Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are A to D.

Hmm, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. The neutralization reaction typically produces water and a salt. Since the problem involves multiple acids and a base, I need to figure out which are the acids and which is the base here.

Looking at the substances: HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is another strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, the acids are HCl and H2SO4, the base is Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: HCl is monoprotic, meaning each molecule can donate one H+. H2SO4 is diprotic; in strong acid conditions, the first H+ dissociates completely, and the second might too, depending on the concentration. But when mixing with a base, each mole of H2SO4 would contribute two moles of H+ for neutralization.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH⁻. So each mole of the base provides two hydroxide ions for neutralizing the acid's H+.

So the first thing I need to do is calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base. Then, see if they're in stoichiometric proportions. Because the neutralization is between H+ and OH- to form water.

Wait, but wait again. Oh, but when mixing the solutions, the H+ from acids and OH- from the base will react. So the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change is per mole of this reaction.

But since HCl and H2SO4 contribute H+, their moles of H+ will add up. Then, the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 will be considered. Then, the limiting reagent will determine how much H+ and OH- actually react.

So let me calculate the moles of each.

First, calculate the moles of HCl. Molarity is moles per liter. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Moles HCl = 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is monoprotic, each mole gives one H+. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

Next, H2SO4. Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole of H2SO4 can release two H+ ions (since it's diprotic), so H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Total H+ from both acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2: volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives two OH-; so OH- moles = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So, H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. When they react, the reaction is 1:1. So the OH- will be the limiting reactant because 0.2 < 0.28. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+ to form water.

So the amount of H+ and OH- that react is 0.2 moles each. The remaining H+ is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

Wait, but wait. Since the reaction is neutralization, the excess H+ will remain, but the enthalpy change is calculated based on the neutralization of H+ and OH- into water. So the total neutralization is 0.2 moles.

Now, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ neutralized. For strong acids and strong bases, the enthalpy is approximately -57.3 kJ/mol (or sometimes in kcal, I think 1 cal is about 4.184 J, so 57.3 kJ is roughly 13.7 kcal). Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure.

Wait, standard enthalpy of neutralization is typically about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), assuming strong acid and strong base. So each mole of H+ neutralized releases about 57 kJ of heat. But wait, for H2SO4, the second H+ may not release as much because the second dissociation isn't as strong. Hmm, but in this problem, the calculation might be assuming that all H+ contribute the same, but wait—no, wait, the problem is actually about mixing these solutions, so perhaps the enthalpy comes from the net reaction.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the problem again.

Wait, the question is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. So it's the heat released when all the H+ from acids reacts with OH- from the base.

Wait, but in the calculations, the OH- is 0.2 moles, and H+ is 0.28. So 0.2 moles of H+ react with OH-.

So the heat released would be moles of H+ reacting (0.2) times the enthalpy per mole.

But wait, each mole of H+ neutralization releases about 57.
