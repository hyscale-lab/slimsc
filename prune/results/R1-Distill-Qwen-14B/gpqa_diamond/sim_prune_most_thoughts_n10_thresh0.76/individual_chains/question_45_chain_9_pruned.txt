Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me think through it step by step. Alright, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

First, I remember that in an infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy of each particle is given as E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), and in this problem, E is defined as π² ħ²/(2mL²). So each E_n is just n² times E. So E_1 would be E, E_2 is 4E, and so on.

But wait, the particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, so no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. In a one-dimensional well, each particle's state is characterized by the principal quantum number n and their spin. Since spin can be either up or down, each n can hold two particles.

So with four particles, each can be filled into the lowest available states without violating the exclusion principle. Let's figure out how the particles fill up the energy levels.

The ground state would be the lowest possible energy configuration. Let's think about how the four particles would be placed in the lowest energy states.

Each energy level n can hold 2 particles (because of the two spin states). So:

n=1: 2 particles
n=2: 2 particles

Wait, wait. Because we have four particles in total. So n=1 can take two (spin up and down), and n=2 can take another two. So the ground state would have all four particles filled into the first two energy levels. So the total energy would be 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2). Wait, no. Each particle in a state contributes to the total energy. So each of the two particles in n=1 contributes E, and each of the two in n=2 contributes 4E. So the total energy is (2*E) + (2*4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, no. Because each particle's energy is E_n, so the total would be the sum of each particle's energy. Since two are in n=1 (so each contributes E) and two are in n=2 (each contributes 4E), the total is 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

But wait, the options don't all start with 10E. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E
B)4E, 10E, 50E
C)4E, 10E,15E
D)10E,15E,18E

So the ground state is 10E. Let's look which options have 10E as the first value. Options B and C and D have 10E as the second or third. Wait, no, the first part is the ground state, then first excited, then second excited.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-clarify: the question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. So the three energies are in order.

So for the ground state, with four particles, the lowest energy arrangement is n=1 filled with 2 particles and n=2 filled with 2 particles. So the energy is 10E.

Then, the first excited state. That would be when one of the particles is promoted to the next available higher state. But wait, in the ground state, all the lower states are filled. So the next state after the ground state would be when one
