Okay, I'm trying to tackle this neutrino flux ratio problem. So, let's start by understanding the question. 

The question is about the Sun's neutrino production. Normally, the Sun produces a lot of neutrinos from different processes, and the pp-III branch is one of them. The setup is that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Hmm, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, that's the approximate time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So, if the pp-III reactions stopped, the neutrinos from that process wouldn't reach us anymore. But since it stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos produced before that would still be on their way. But wait, neutrinos have such a high speed that they don't really delay much, so the Earth would notice the absence of these neutrinos almost immediately after the process stops. But the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands now.

The question is asking about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, what determines the neutrino flux in these bands?

I remember that neutrino production in the Sun is mainly from the proton-proton chain. The pp-I, II, and III branches are different stages in this chain. The pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos compared to the earlier branches. 

Wait, the pp-III branch stops. So, any neutrinos produced by pp-III would no longer be produced after that time. But what neutrinos were already on their way? Since the time it takes for neutrinos to reach Earth is about 8.5 minutes, the neutrinos from the pp-III branch stop arriving after that. So, any neutrinos from the Sun's core would now be only from other branches, like pp-I and pp-II, and maybe other processes like the CNO cycle.

Wait, but the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So pp-I and II continue, as do other reactions like the CNO cycle. So, the neutrino flux reaching Earth would now be the sum of the neutrinos from the unaltered processes (like pp-I, II, and CNO) but without the pp-
