Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, formation constants. I remember that the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion from its constituent ions. So, for the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, the Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but in this problem, we have a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. When this complex dissociates, it should release Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. The question is asking for the concentration of Ca²+ ions in solution.

So, let's think about the dissociation. The complex dissociates as:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The K for this reaction would actually be the inverse of the formation constant. Because the formation constant is for the forward reaction (formation of the complex), the dissociation constant (Kd) would be 1/Kf. So Kd = 1/(5x10^10) = 2x10^-11.

Now, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the change in concentration. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. So:

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x will be very small compared to 0.02)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

So plugging into the dissociation expression:

Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-] = (x * x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02

We know Kd is 2e-11, so:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11
x² = 0.02 * 2e-11
x² = 4e-13
x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6. Wait, no. Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me calculate.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 times 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 10^-13 is 10^(-13/2) = 10^-6.5. Hmm, so 2e-6.5. But wait, 10^-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that's approximately 6.3e-7 M. Let me double-check the calculation.

Kd = 2e-11. So equation is x²/(0.02) = 2e-11 → x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. The square root is sqrt(4)=2 and sqrt(10^-13)=10^(-6.5). So 2 * 10^-6.5. Since 10^-6 is 1e-6, 10^-7 is 1e-7. 10^-6.5 is approx 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, but why are the other options not correct? Let's quickly look:

Option A: 2e-2. That's 0.02, which would be the concentration of the complex itself, not the calcium. So that can't be right.

Option B: 5e-3. That's larger than what I got, but why? Maybe if I had made a mistake in the K calculation. Let me see. Kf is 5e10, so Kd is 1/(5e10)=2e-11. So that's correct. So B is 5e-3, which is 0.005 M. That's way higher than what I got, so I think B is incorrect.

Option D: 1e-2 M. That's 0.01 M, which is also much higher than my result, so no.

So the only option matching my calculation is C: 6.3e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the reciprocal of the formation constant \( K_f \), so:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions that dissociate from the complex. At equilibrium:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x.
\]

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).

Analyzing the options:
- **A (2.0 × 10⁻² M):** This is the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, not \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \).
- **B (5.0 × 10⁻³ M):** This is much larger than the calculated value and incorrect.
- **C (6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M):** Matches the calculated value.
- **D (1.0 × 10⁻² M):** This is also much larger than the calculated value and incorrect.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
