Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. The question has three parts, each involving a different reaction that proceeds under certain conditions. My task is to figure out what the products A, B, and C are from the given options.

Let me start by breaking down each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to give product A.

Hmm. I think this is a Cope or Claisen rearrangement. Wait, but wait, Claisen is usually for allyl vinyl ethers. The Cope rearrangement is for 1,5-dienes. Let me think about this. Alternatively, maybe it's a different type of sigmatropic rearrangement. Wait, but the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. Oh wait, perhaps these are reacting in some way to form an oxaziridine or something else. Wait, but perhaps it's a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement.

Wait, but the first molecule is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Structure-wise, that's (CH3O)2CH-NH2? Wait, no, wait. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Or perhaps it's (CH2OCH3)2NH, but wait, no. Let me write it down. The structure is NH2-C(OCH3)2. So it's a secondary amine with two methoxy groups on the adjacent carbon.

But wait, when this reacts with but-3-en-2-ol. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. But-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait. Structure: but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH? Wait, no. Wait, the formula for but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, numbering from the other
