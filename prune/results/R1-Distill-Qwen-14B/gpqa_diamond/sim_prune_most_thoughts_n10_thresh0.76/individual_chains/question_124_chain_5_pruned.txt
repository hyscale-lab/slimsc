Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read the question again carefully.

So, the setup is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The options are A) 54, B) 68, C) 40, D) 28.

Hmm, okay. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma relates to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, their gamma factor is significant.

Wait, the problem mentions that the particles are fast-decaying. So their lifetime is very short. But from the lab frame, their lifetime would be longer due to time dilation. The particles' decay length depends on their speed and lifetime.

The key here is probably the decay length. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. If the detector has a radius of 30 meters, then the particles need to travel at least 30 meters to reach the inner walls.

So the decay length (L) is given by gamma * c * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime of the particle, c is the speed of light, and gamma is the Lorentz factor. So, particles with a larger gamma will have a longer decay length, meaning they can travel further before decaying.

In the first scenario, with gamma = 20, only one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So, the decay length must be such that a third of the particles make it to 30 meters. That suggests that the average decay length is about 30 meters for a third. Wait, maybe more precisely, the fraction of particles that decay beyond a certain distance is related to the ratio of their decay length to the distance.

Wait, I think the proper way to model this is using the decay probability. The probability that a particle decays after traveling a distance x is given by the exponential decay formula. The survival probability (i.e., not decaying) is exp(-x/(gamma c tau)). So, the fraction of particles that reach the detector walls is the integral from x=0 to x=R (30 meters) of the decay probability.

Wait,
