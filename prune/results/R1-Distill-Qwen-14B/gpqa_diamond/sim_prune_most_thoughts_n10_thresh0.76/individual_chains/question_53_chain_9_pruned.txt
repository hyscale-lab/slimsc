Okay, so I've got an organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, so I think that's a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which makes sense because esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an ester functional group. So the structure probably has an ester somewhere attached to the benzene.

Looking at the NMR data: there are six signals in total. Two of them are aromatic H's. Wait, wait, for a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons can have different splitting depending on the substituents. If the substituents are in certain positions, like para or ortho, the protons could be equivalent or not. But since there are two signals, maybe the substituents are in a position that causes the ring to have two sets of aromatic protons. For example, if it's para substitution, the ring would have two equivalent protons and two others, but wait, in a di-substituted benzene, if it's para, you'd have two sets of two equivalent H's each. So that would give two signals in the aromatic region. Hmm, that makes sense.

Then, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl groups are CH2=CH- or something like that. Wait, no, vinyl H can be the protons on a double bond. So maybe there's an ester group attached to a vinyl group. So perhaps like an aryl ester with a vinyl substituent?

Wait, but the signals are one doublet and one doublet of quartets. That's a bit tricky. Let me think. A vinyl group in an ester might be something like O-CO-O-R, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the benzene, and the ester is another group. Or perhaps the substituent is an ester group with a vinyl chain.

Wait, let me think about the ester structure. Esters are usually R-O-CO-O-R', no, wait, no. Esters are RCOOR'. So maybe the benzene has two substituents, one of which is an ester group, and the other is something else.

Wait, but the
