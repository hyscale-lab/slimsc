Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step.

The question is about some reactions involving mixtures of liquids and their products after certain treatments. My goal is to find out the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let me start by understanding the scenario.

We have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. This mixture decolorizes bromine water. Decolorizing bromine water usually means the mixture has something that can reduce bromine, like unsaturated bonds (like alkenes or alkynes) because they undergo addition reactions with bromine, which removes the color.

So, mixture X has two liquids, each with unsaturated bonds because they can decolorize bromine water. But wait, the problem also states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds in X. So, each compound in X probably has a single double bond but not conjugated, like isolated double bonds. So maybe each is an alkene but not conjugated.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum when heated, it undergoes a reaction and forms mixture Y, which is also equimolar of two liquids. Importantly, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y doesn't have any unsaturated bonds. Because bromine water would react with any double or triple bonds by adding across them, causing decolorization. So Y must have fully saturated bonds—like alkanes.

So, X has two unsaturated compounds (alkenes or maybe one alkyne?), but when they undergo a reaction with H2 and Pt (since it's hydrogenation, I think), they become alkanes. Wait, but the question says treatment with platinum when heated. Oh wait, the process is called "disproportionation" leading to Y. Wait, no, the treatment with Pt when heated causes a disproportionation reaction. Wait, no, let me re-read.

Wait, the problem says: when X is treated with platinum when heated, a disproportionation occurs, forming Y, which is a mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine. So Y doesn't have any unsaturated bonds, so they are alkanes. So X's components, when treated with Pt, undergo a reaction to become alkanes, but the product is a mixture Y, which is equimolar of two alkanes.

Wait, but the process is called "disproportionation," which usually involves a substance being both oxidized and reduced. So perhaps one of the components in X is doing that? Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids, each undergoing some change. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two components in X is undergoing a change that leads to different products, which are the two components of Y.

Wait, maybe the reaction is hydrogenation? Because Pt is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Oh, wait, wait. The problem says that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives the same product Z. So when X is hydrogenated, you get Z, and when Y is hydrogenated, you also get Z. Because Y is a mixture of alkanes, which are already saturated, their hydrogenation wouldn't do anything—so maybe I'm confused.

Wait, no, let's clarify. Mixture X is treated with
