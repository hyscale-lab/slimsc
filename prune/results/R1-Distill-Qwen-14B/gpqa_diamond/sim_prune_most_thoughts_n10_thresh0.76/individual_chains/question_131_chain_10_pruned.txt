Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's start by breaking down the question step by step.

The problem begins with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. So, first, the dicarboxylic acid. Dicarboxylic acids have two carboxylic acid groups. The presence of a cis-alkene suggests that the double bond has both substituents on the same side. So maybe something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond in the CH2-CH2 part, but in the cis configuration.

Then, this acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride by losing a water molecule. The structure would probably be something like the two carboxylic acid groups losing a water to form an anhydride bridge. The anhydride will have a structure where the two carbonyl groups are connected by an oxygen bridge.

Next, the anhydride has specific NMR spectra. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, so it might be an aromatic proton, but wait, the initial compound is an anhydride derived from a dicarboxylic acid. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to an electronegative group, but 7 ppm is more typical for aromatic or maybe an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but if the anhydride has an alpha, beta-unsaturated structure, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl might resonate around 7 ppm? Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton in a conjugated system. 

Wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak. So, maybe the anhydride is cyclic and has equivalent protons. For example, if it's a cyclic anhydride like a five-membered ring, the protons might all be equivalent, leading to a singlet. Like the anhydride being formed from a symmetrical diacid. So, if the diacid is something like HOOC-(CH2)2-COOH but with a double bond, then the anhydride might form a five-membered ring with two double bonds? Wait, no, the starting material has a cis-alkene, so dehydration would form the anhydride with a conjugated double bond perhaps.

Wait, the anhydride's 13C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Let's think about what those carbons could be. 165 is probably a carbonyl carbon (like a ketone or anhydride). 137 could be a carbon adjacent to a double bond, maybe a vinyl carbon. So, perhaps the anhydride has a structure like a cyclic anhydride (maybe a five-membered ring) with a double bond. So, maybe the structure is a bicy
