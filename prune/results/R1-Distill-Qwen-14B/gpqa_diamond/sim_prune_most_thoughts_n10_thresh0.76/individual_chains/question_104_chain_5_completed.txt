Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars with exactly the same masses, both similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The data given is about the periodic shifts in their spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift depends on several factors, like the mass of the planet, the orbital period, the distance between the star and the planet, and the inclination of the orbit. But since both planets are detected, their orbits must be inclined enough for us to notice the shift.

Wait, the formula I think relates the radial velocity semi-amplitude K with the other parameters. The formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) ?

Wait, no, maybe I should think of the simplified version. Since M_p is much less than M_star (like Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_p/M_star is negligible. So the formula simplifies.

I think the formula for the semi-amplitude K is K = (v_0) = ( (G * P) / (2π * (M_star)) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p / ( (M_star + M_p) )) ) * (sin i / (1 AU)) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π * (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (c * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune is about 1/3 the mass of Earth, and the star is like the Sun), M_p/M_star is negligible. So we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star and 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1. So the formula simplifies.

So K ≈ ( (G * P ) / (2π M_star) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / c

But since both stars have the same mass (similar to Sun) and the planets have masses similar to Neptune, and assuming the inclinations are the same (since they are both detected, maybe sin i is similar, but perhaps it's not given). Wait, but in the problem, the shifts are given for each planet, so maybe the actual velocity shifts are related to K.

Wait, the problem states that the shift is in the spectral lines. The RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star. The semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit.

So the shift in wavelength (Δλ) is proportional to the velocity (v) via the Doppler formula: Δλ/λ = v/c. So, since the same spectral line is used, the rest wavelength λ is the same for both stars. So, the velocity is v = c * (Δλ / λ). But since Δλ is given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms, and assuming λ is the same for both (because same spectral line), then the ratio of velocities is 5/7 m/s? Or wait, maybe I should compute the velocities based on the shifts.

Wait, but in the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. So for each planet, K is proportional to the shift. Wait, but the shift is given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So if Δλ1 = 5 and Δλ2 =7, then their velocities v1 and v2 are proportional to these shifts.

So v1 = (5/λ) * c, and v2 = (7/λ)*c. So the ratio v2/v1 is 7/5.

But since the velocities are proportional to the shifts because λ is the same for both.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the same spectral line is used, so same λ. Yes, the question says "the same spectral line at a given wavelength". So λ is the same for both stars, so Δλ is directly proportional to the velocity.

So K1 = 5, K2=7, so K2/K1 =7/5.

But wait, K is the semi-amplitude, which depends on the planetary mass, the orbital period, and the mass of the star.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )^(1/ (P^(1/3) * (2π)^(1/3) )) )

Hmm, that's complicated. Let me think if there's a simpler approach. Since both stars have the same mass and the planetary masses are similar (Neptune-like), and assuming circular orbits (e=0), so that term is 1.

Also, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so the denominator term becomes M_star^(2/3).

So K ≈ (G * M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) * (2 π)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps in terms of proportionality. Since both stars have same M_star, and the planetary masses are same (same as Neptune), and if sin i is same (which I think can be assumed because both are detected, so likely similar inclinations, but the problem doesn't specify that. However, since the shifts are given, perhaps it's already accounted for in K. So for this problem, perhaps sin i is same for both planets, so we can ignore it in the ratio.

So K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But since M_p and M_star are same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

Which implies that P^(1/3) ∝ 1 / K

So P ∝ (1/K)^3

So the ratio of P2 to P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

Because P2 / P1 = (1/K2 / 1/K1 )^3 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let me think again. Since K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so P is proportional to (1/K)^(3):

P ∝ (1/K)^3 → P = C * (1/K^3 )

Hence, P2/P1 = (K1^3) / (K2^3) → (5/7)^3.

Wait, no. Let me re-express.

Because K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), so P ∝ 1/(K)^3.

So P2 = (1/K2^3) * constant.

Similarly, P1 = (1/K1^3)* same constant.

So the ratio P2/P1 = (K1^3)/(K2^3) → (5/7)^3.

Wait no, because if P ∝ 1/K^3, then P2 = (constant) / K2^3, P1 = (same constant) / K1^3.

So P2/P1 = (K1^3)/(K2^3).

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, 5 cubed is 125, 7 cubed is 343. 125/343 is approximately 0.364.

So planet #2's orbital period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter. Wait, but the question is "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than planet #1."

So if P2 is 0.364 times P1, then it's shorter. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times P1. So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So that would be 0.36 times, which is actually shorter. Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. The question says 'longer than', so if P2 is shorter, then the factor is less than 1. So the answer would be 0.36 times longer, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me recheck the steps.

1. K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3) → So P is proportional to (1/K)^(3).

So if K2 is larger than K1 (7 >5), then 1/K2 is smaller than 1/K1.

So P2 = (constant) / (K2^3)

P1 = (constant) / (K1^3)

So P2/P1 = K1^3 / K2^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So yes, P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. But the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So the answer is approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.

Alternatively, if the question had asked how many times longer is planet #1's period than #2's, then it would be 1/0.364 ≈ 2.75 times longer.

But the question is about P2 being longer than P1. So since P2 is shorter, the factor is less than 1. So option A is the correct answer.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{K^3}
\]

Given that the shifts in the spectral lines for planet #1 and planet #2 are 5 milliangstroms and 7 milliangstroms, respectively, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5}
\]

Using the proportionality \( P \propto \frac{1}{K^3} \), the ratio of the orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36 times longer.
