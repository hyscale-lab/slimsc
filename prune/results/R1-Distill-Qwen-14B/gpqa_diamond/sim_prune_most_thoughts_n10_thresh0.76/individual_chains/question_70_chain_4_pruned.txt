Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a series of reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. The question is asking about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Hmm, okay. Let me break down the reactions given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, the reaction is A + 8B → C. I'm thinking maybe A is a metal because reacting with a gas (like maybe O2?) could form an oxide. But 8 equivalents is a lot. Wait, 8 equivalents might suggest that B is O2 because metals often form oxides with O in a certain ratio. Like iron forms Fe3O4 with O2, but that's 4 O for 3 Fe, so not exactly 8. Maybe another metal? Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 or another diatomic gas, but 8 equivalents would mean 4 molecules of B per A. Wait, let's think about alternatives.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Extrememly hazardous... hmm, maybe something like a nerve agent or a highly reactive compound. But not sure yet.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C reacting with water produces a metal (probably) and two acids. That suggests that C is likely a salt. Because when a salt reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into an acid and a base. Wait, but the products are two acids. So perhaps C is a metal oxide that on reacting with water forms a metal and two acids. Wait, but metal oxides usually form bases. Hmm, maybe C is a non-metal oxide. Like, for example, a metal sulfide? Or maybe a mixed oxide?

Wait, another possibility: If C is a nitride, like AlN, then reacting with water gives NH3 and a metal hydroxide. But that's a base plus an acid? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. Wait, but carbonates reacting with water don't change much. Hmm.

Alternatively, if C is a metal oxide, like
