Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that means the spinor is a two-component vector: χ = [3i, 4]^T. Right, because electrons are spin-1/2 particles, so their spin states are two-dimensional.

The question is about the expectation value of S_y, the spin in the y-direction. I remember that the expectation value is calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. But wait, what's S_y in terms of Pauli matrices? Oh right, the spin operator for a particle with spin 1/2 is given by S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ is the Pauli matrix. So S_y should be (ħ/2) times the Pauli y matrix.

Looking back, the Pauli y matrix σ_y is given in the note. It's a 2x2 matrix:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So S_y must be (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. Let me write that out:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Now, the spinor ψ is [3i, 4]^T. To find the expectation value, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ. Wait, no, I think it's ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ. But wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is the conjugate transpose, which would be a row vector [3i*, 4*], but since 3i is already imaginary, its conjugate is -3i, and 4 is real, so ψ† is [-3i, 4].

So the expectation value calculation would be:

⟨S_y⟩ = ψ† S_y ψ

Let me compute S_y first. S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when I multiply S_y by the spinor ψ, I get:

S_y ψ = (ħ/2) * [0*3i + (-i)*4, i*3i + 0*4]^T

Wait, let me compute each component. The first component is (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = -4i. The second component is (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i². Since i² is -1, that's 3*(-1) = -3. So S_y ψ is (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The multiplication is matrix times vector. So for the first component of S_y ψ:

(0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = (0) + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i² + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So S_y ψ is (ħ/2) times the vector [-4i, -3]^T.

Now, ψ† is the conjugate transpose, so it's [3i*, 4*]. 3i is 3i, so its conjugate is -3i. 4 is real, so 4 remains. So ψ† is [-3i, 4].

Now, the expectation value is ψ† multiplied by S_y ψ. So:

⟨S_y⟩ = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Wait, no, because S_y ψ is a vector, and ψ† is a row vector. So the multiplication is [-3i,4] multiplied by (S_y ψ), which is [ -4i, -3 ]^T multiplied by (ħ/2).

Wait, actually, the calculation is:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i, -3 ]^T

Wait, no. The matrix multiplication would be: [ψ† ] * [S_y ψ], but since S_y is (ħ/2)*σ_y, the actual expression is:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i ; -3 ]

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the steps. Let me think again.

Compute (ψ† S_y) ψ? Or (ψ† S_y) multiplied by ψ.

Wait, no, the expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ.

So S_y is a matrix. So ψ is a column vector. So S_y ψ is a column vector. Then, ψ† multiplied by that gives a scalar.

So ψ† S_y ψ = (ħ/2) * [ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i, -3 ].

Wait, no. Wait, the matrix S_y is 2x2, and ψ is 2x1, so S_y ψ is 2x1. Then, ψ† is 1x2, so when you multiply ψ† * (S_y ψ), you get a scalar.

So let me compute the matrix multiplication step by step.

Compute S_y ψ first.

S_y ψ = (ħ/2) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4) ]^T
= (ħ/2
