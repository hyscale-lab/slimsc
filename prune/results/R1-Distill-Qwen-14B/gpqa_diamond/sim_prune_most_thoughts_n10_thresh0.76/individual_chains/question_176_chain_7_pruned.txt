Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about the probability of measuring specific values for two observables, P and Q, in that order. The state of the system is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait—oh, that's a vector in 3D space, right? So the state vector is a column vector with components [-1, 2, 1]^T.

The operators for P and Q are given as 3x3 matrices. Let me write them down.

Operator P's matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Operator Q's matrix:
First row: 1, 0, 0.
Second row: 0, 0, 0.
Third row: 0, 0, -1.

So the task is to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P and then -1 when measuring Q. Wait, no, actually, the measurements are done in sequence: first P, then Q. So the order is important. But I think the way the question is phrased is that the measurements are done P first, then Q. So I need to find the probability that the first measurement (P) gives 0 and the second (Q) gives -1.

Wait, but actually, no. Because when you measure one observable, it affects the state. So if you measure P first, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, measuring Q would be on that new state.

But wait, the problem says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P". So the process is: measure P, then measure Q on the resulting state. But the question is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So I need to find the probability that P is 0, then, given that, Q is -1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the combined probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the question wants the probability that P is 0 and then Q is -1 in that order.

I think that's correct. So first, find the probability that measuring P gives 0, then, given that, find the probability that measuring Q gives -1. Multiply these probabilities to get the overall probability.

Wait, but how does the state change when you measure P? Because when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So after measuring P and getting 0, the state becomes the corresponding eigenstate. Then, measuring Q on that state.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the eigenvectors for P's eigenvalue 0 and see the overlap with the initial state, then find the overlap with Q's eigenvalue -1 in that subspace.

Wait, let me think. The initial state is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me normalize it, but wait, is it necessary? Because probabilities are based on squared norms, so perhaps I should normalize the state first. Wait, the state's norm is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 +
