Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it my best shot.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I remember that symmetry groups are part of molecular spectroscopy, particularly in vibrational analysis. The symmetry of a molecule determines its infrared activity and the types of vibrations it can have.

First, I'll try to map out the reactions given.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
   - Hmm, what's a reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in a 8:1 ratio? Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something else. Wait, sulfur is bright red when it's in certain forms. Oh, like when sulfur forms a compound with metals or other elements. Alternatively, maybe it's about the formation of a sulfide or something else.

Wait, another thought: nitric acid is a gas. Oh wait, but B is a gas. Let me think about other possibilities. Maybe B is a diatomic gas, like O2 or N2. Or perhaps it's chlorine gas. Let me hold that thought.

2. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.
   - Extremely hazardous makes me think of something like sarin gas, or maybe something else. Alternatively, E could be a highly toxic compound, perhaps a cyanide derivative or something with cyanide. Or perhaps it's a gas like phosgene or something else. Hmm, not sure yet.

3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
   - So C plus water gives back A, and two acids. Strong acid and weak acid. Let's think about possible acids. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc. Weak ones are like CH3COOH, HCN (though HCN is a weak acid but highly toxic), or maybe something else.

If C is a compound that upon hydrolysis gives two acids, maybe C is a sulfonic acid or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate ester? Hmm, or another possibility is that C is a sulfite or sulfate ester? Not sure.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it gives back A. So perhaps A is something that, when it reacts with B, forms C. Let's think about a classic reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in a certain ratio.

Wait, sulfur (solid) reacting with concentrated nitric acid (a gas? Well, nitric acid is a liquid, not a gas. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait another thought: perhaps A is sodium sulfide, and B is sulfur? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, let's think about the second part. C reacts with D in a 2:1 ratio to form E. D is a gas, and H is made from D and B in a 1:1 ratio. H is a solvent. What solvents are made from gases reacting in 1:1 ratio? For example, D might be Cl2, B is something else. If B and D react 1:1, perhaps it's something like B being NH3 and D being HCl? But that would form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B and D are H2O and another gas. Wait, but D is a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe D is CO2. Then B could be something else. I'm getting stuck here.

Let me try to think about C's reaction with water. It produces A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. Perhaps C is a nitrate salt. Let's say C is NaNO3? No, because when it reacts with water, would that produce acids? Not sure.

Wait, could C be something like sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7)? When it reacts with water, perhaps it doesn't change. Or maybe it's a different salt.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester or some kind of acid anhydride. Maybe C is something like sulfuryl chloride (SOCl2). When SOCl2 reacts with water, it produces HCl (a strong acid) and H2SO3 (which is sulfurous acid, a weak acid). Wait, that might fit. So in that case, F would be HCl (strong acid) and G would be H2SO3 (weak acid).

If that's the case, then C is sulfuryl chloride (SOCl2). So when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (gas D), it produces E. Let me think: what reacts with SOCl2 to form E. Maybe D is a gas like O2 or another chloride.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is SO2Cl2, but that might not fit. Let's think again.

Wait, if C is SOCl2, and it reacts with D (a gas) in a 2:1 ratio, what would that produce? Let's see, if D is O2, then 2 SOCl2 + O2 might form something. Alternatively, perhaps D is another halogen, like Cl2. But then, SOCl2 and Cl2 reacting? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is something like CH3COOH, but it's a liquid, so not a gas. Hmm.

Wait, let me backtrack. If C is SOCl2, then when it reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B, what would B be? Because the initial reaction is A (solid) + 8B → C.

Wait, if C is SOCl2, then A could be S (solid sulfur). But how does sulfur react with gas B in 8 equivalents? S + something → SOCl2.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 gas. Let's imagine: S (solid) reacts with Cl2 (gas) to form SOCl2. But the stoichiometry would be S + Cl2 → SOCl2. Let's write the balanced equation.

S + Cl2 → SOCl2.

Balancing: On the left, 2 Cl from Cl2. On the right, 2 Cl in SOCl2. So S + Cl2 → SOCl2.

But wait, S is in +4 oxidation state in SOCl2, so for each S atom, 4 Cl atoms are added. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, wait, sulfur's oxidation state in SOCl2 is +4. Each Cl is -1, and O is -2. So S +4 + 2(-2) + 2(-1) = 0 → S +4 = 4, so yes, S is +4.

Wait, the reaction between sulfur and Cl2 would produce SOCl2. But the stoichiometry is 1 S + 2 Cl2 → SOCl2 + energy? Let me check the reaction.

Yes, the reaction is: S (s) + Cl2 (g) → SOCl2 (l), but the stoichiometry would actually require 2 Cl2 molecules. Wait, let's balance it.

S + 2 Cl2 → SOCl2.

Yes, because on the left, there are 4 Cl atoms (2 Cl2), and on the right, 2 Cl in SOCl2. Wait, no. SOCl2 has two Cl atoms. So, S + 2 Cl2 → SOCl2. Let me count:

Left: 1 S, 4 Cl.
Right: 1 S, 2 Cl. So that's not balanced. So that's a problem. So perhaps the reaction doesn't fit that stoichiometry.

Hmm, maybe the initial assumption that C is SOCl2 is incorrect. Let me think again.

Another approach: the first reaction is A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red). Bright red product... could that be something like CuBr? No, CuBr is not bright red. Or maybe a nitro compound? Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: lead(II,IV) oxide is bright red, but I'm not sure if that's solid A reacting with gas B to form that.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, though. Hmm.

Wait, let me think of the color. Bright red. Could it be something like Fe(OH)3? No, that's more of a reddish-brown precipitate. Wait, but when Fe reacts with something, does it produce a bright red product?

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, As2S3 is bright yellow, not red. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate or nitride.

Alternatively, maybe C is a manganese compound. MnO2 is black. Not matching.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

So, if D is a gas, and it reacts with B (another gas) in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. What solvents are formed from gases reacting at 1:1? For example, NH3 (gas) and HCl (gas) reacting to form NH4Cl (solid), which is not
