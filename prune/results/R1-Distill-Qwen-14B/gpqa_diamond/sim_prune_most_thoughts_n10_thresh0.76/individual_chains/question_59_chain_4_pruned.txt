Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the pH of this solution. Hmm, the problem gives me three different solutions mixed together: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other, so I need to figure out if there's excess acid or base after they react.

First, I'll calculate the moles of each substance. Moles are moles = concentration (M) × volume (L). Let me convert the volumes to liters.

For CH3COOH: 500 mL is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.
HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.
Ba(OH)2: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, right? So moles of OH- would be 0.3 L * 0.3 M * 2 = 0.18 moles. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-. So for each mole of Ba(OH)2, we get 2 moles of OH-. So the moles of OH- are 0.3 * 0.3 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but considering that HCl is a strong acid, it will donate H+ ions. Similarly, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will donate OH- ions. Acetic acid is weak, so it won't dissociate completely.

So the reaction between H+ and OH- will be first. Let's see all the H+ sources and OH- sources.

H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. HCl is strong, so it will fully dissociate, giving 0.08 moles of H+. CH3COOH is a weak acid; it won't fully dissociate, but for now, maybe I can account for it later. Wait, but when we mix everything, the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react.

Let me calculate the total H+ and OH-.

HCl gives 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles OH-.

So H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will neutralize each other. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08. moles of OH-: 0.18.

So the H+ will be all consumed, and there will be leftover OH-. The OH- remaining is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

But wait, the acetic acid (CH3CO
