Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm, so I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The particle's spin precesses around the direction of the magnetic field. But wait, the magnetic field is switched from Z to Y. So initially, the particle was in a state aligned with the Z field, and then the field changes, so the spin will start precessing around Y.

I think the system's energy levels are determined by the magnetic field direction. The energy levels for spin 1/2 in a magnetic field B are given by E = -mu·B. Or wait, more accurately, E = -gamma B S_z. Oh wait, mu is gamma times Sz. So mu = gamma S_z, so the energy is -gamma B S_z. But when the field is in the Y direction, it's E = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, wait, let me clarify. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is E = -mu · B. So if B is along Z, E = -gamma B S_z. But when B is along Y, E = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of S_z. Because the field was along Z, so the spin-up or spin-down states. Then the field switches to Y. So the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y.

In the new situation, the eigenstates of S_y are different from those of S_z. So the state of the particle (which was an eigenstate of S_z) is now a superposition of eigenstates of S_y. This should cause the expectation value of S_z to oscillate over time.

I remember that when you have a two-level system with an off-diagonal Hamiltonian in the basis of the original eigenstates, the expectation value oscillates with a frequency determined by the energy splitting.

So let's think about the energy levels when the field is along Y.

The spin is 1/2, so S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Wait, actually, the spin matrices are in units of ħ, right? The spin operator S has components where S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, and same for S_x and S_y. So for the spin 1/2 particle, the possible eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2.

So the energies after the field change are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2), because E = -gamma B S_y. Wait, wait: when B is along Y, mu is along Y, so E = -mu · B. mu is gamma S, so E = -gamma B S_y
