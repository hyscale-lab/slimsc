Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it. The question is about a spin-1/2 particle and how its magnetic moment oscillates when the magnetic field changes direction.

Alright, let's start by reading the problem again. There's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu = gamma * S_z. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin precesses around the direction of the field. And in the absence of a magnetic field, maybe the spin would behave differently. Wait, but here the field isn't just turned off; it's immediately turned on in the Y direction.

I think I should model the situation using the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -μ·B, right? So when the field is along Z, H is proportional to S_z. But after the field is turned along Y, H becomes proportional to S_y.

Wait, the initial state is aligned with the magnetic field in Z. So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to Y, the Hamiltonian changes, and the state might no longer be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian.

So the system will evolve under the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution will cause the expectation values of observables to oscillate, perhaps leading to oscillations in the average z-component of the magnetic moment.

Let me think about the time evolution. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the z-component is gamma S_z. The average of mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of S_z.

The Hamiltonian after the switch is H = gamma B S_y. Because the magnetic moment is proportional to spin, and the field is along Y, so the Hamiltonian H = -mu · B, but I think I might have the sign wrong. Wait, no, more accurately, the energy is H = -μ·B. Since μ = gamma S, and B is along Y, then H = -gamma B S_y. Oh wait, but sometimes the Hamiltonian is written as H = -μ·B, which would be the same as -gamma B S_y. Or wait, perhaps I should check signs. Alternatively, perhaps the spin Hamiltonian is H = γ B S · n, where n is the direction unit vector. So if B is along Y, n is (0,1,0), so H = gamma B S_y. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused about the signs here.

Wait, magnetic moment μ is given by μ = gamma S. The energy of the dipole in a magnetic field is U = -μ·B. So the Hamiltonian would be H = -μ·B = -gamma B S · Bhat. Since B is along Y, Bhat is (0,1,0). So H = -gamma B S_y. Alternatively, I might have made a sign mistake, but perhaps the exact sign
