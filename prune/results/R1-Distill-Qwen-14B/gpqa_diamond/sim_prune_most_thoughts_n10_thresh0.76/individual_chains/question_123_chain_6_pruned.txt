Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a supernova occurred, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, wait a second. So the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center. But in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. That makes sense because in that frame, the ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards it.

I think this is a problem involving relative velocity and time dilation due to special relativity. Oh right, because when frames are moving relative to each other, time can pass at different rates.

So, let's break it down. In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at some velocity v. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but according to special relativity, the velocity observed from each frame should be the same magnitude but opposite direction, right? So if the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the Galaxy, then the Galaxy would appear to be moving at v towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame. So, v is 60,000 km/s? That's a very high speed, almost 20% the speed of light because the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. Oh wait, 60,000 is 6e4 km/s, which is 0.2 times the speed of light (since 3e5 km/s is c). So that's 20% the speed of light. So, relativistic effects would be noticeable.

Wait, but wait, the problem says both are inertial frames, so that's a good start. So, we can apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Or perhaps it's easier to think about time dilation and length contraction.

The problem is about finding the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame. So, the ejecta is moving at some speed v in the Galaxy's frame, and we need to find how far it goes in 50 seconds according to the ejecta's clock. Wait, no: the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, and we need the distance in the Galaxy's frame. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.

Wait, the ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. So, let's consider the two reference frames: Galaxy frame (S) and Ejecta frame (S'). In S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So, from the Galaxy's perspective (S), the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, no, wait. Because in S, the Galaxy is stationary, so the ejecta is moving at v towards the Galaxy. In S', the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy moves towards it at v. So, v is 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of one frame as observed from the other is the same. So, if S is the Galaxy frame and S' is the ejecta frame, then in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity v, and in S', the Galaxy is moving at velocity v towards the ejecta.

So, now, the problem is: how much time passes in S (Galaxy's frame) when 50 seconds pass in S' (ejecta's frame). Because the distance the ejecta travels in S is v multiplied by the time elapsed in S.

But wait, the time in S and S' are different due to time dilation. So, I need to find the time in S that corresponds to 50 seconds in S'.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Lorent
