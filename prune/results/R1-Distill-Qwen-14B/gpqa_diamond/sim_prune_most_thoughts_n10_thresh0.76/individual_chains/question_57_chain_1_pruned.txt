Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that phase shifts are important in scattering theory, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Let me try to think. I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) for electrons is given by some formula involving the phase shifts. Oh right, the general form for spin-½ particles is f(θ) = (1/(2k)) * Σ (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(2δ_l) / sinθ, where k is the wave number. Wait, but wait, that's for each partial wave l, right?

Wait, but wait, the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. So maybe they're only giving us a few, but perhaps l starts from 0. So in this case, the phase shifts given are δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°. So l goes from 0 to 4 here.

But the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Wait, along the beam direction means θ=0°, right? Because that's the direction of the incident particle. So I need to evaluate f(0) and find its imaginary part.

Wait, but the formula I mentioned earlier is for the general case. Let me think about the specific case when θ=0. Because for θ=0, sinθ is zero, which would make the denominator zero. Hmm, but wait, let me recall that there's a specific formula for the scattering amplitude at θ=0. Oh right! The optical theorem comes into play here. The optical theorem relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. The formula is σ_total = (4π/ k²) Im f(0), where k is the wave number.

Wait, but the question is asking for the imaginary part of f(0), which is Im f(0) = (k² σ_total) / (4π). But wait, do I know the total cross-section here? No, the problem doesn't give me that. Hmm, so maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l )/(k (1 - cosθ)) ), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the partial wave expansion involves terms like (1/2ik) sum (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(2δ_l) P_l(cosθ), where P_l are Legendre polynomials. But evaluating this for θ=0 would involve P_l(1), which is 1 for all l. Because P_l(1) =1 for any l.

Wait, if that's the case, then f(0) would be sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(2δ_l) ) / (2ik) ) * 1. Because P_l(
