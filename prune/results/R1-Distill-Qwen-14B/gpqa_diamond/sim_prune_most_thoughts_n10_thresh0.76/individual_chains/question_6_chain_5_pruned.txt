Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that potentials often lead to various types of equations, like harmonic oscillators or something else.

Wait, the setup is in two dimensions, so probably polar coordinates since r and θ are given. I think the potential can be separated into radial and angular parts. Let me look at V again. It's (1/2)k r² plus (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, (1/2)k r² plus (3/2)k r² cos²θ is the same as (1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ) k r². So the potential depends on r² and cos²θ. 

Wait, but in polar coordinates, when solving the Schrödinger equation, the potential should be separable into radial and angular parts. Wait, but here the potential doesn't look separable because it's a function of r² and cosθ squared. Hmm, maybe I can rewrite it in terms that can be separated.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can
