Okay, so I've got this physics problem about astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the other has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different values.

Hmm, relative speed in relativity isn't just simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. I remember that you have to use the velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, but wait: which way are they moving? Both are in the positive x-direction, so from the perspective of the first astronaut (2m), the second is moving at 0.5c relative to the stationary frame. So to find the relative speed of the second astronaut as seen from the first, I plug into the formula.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So if the first astronaut is in a frame S', then the velocity of the second as seen from S' would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²/c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c divided by 0.7 is (0.1/0.7)c ≈ 0.1428c. Oh wait, that's about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as their relative speed. So that narrows it down to C and D.

Next, the total energy of the system. Since each astronaut has relativistic speeds, their energies should be calculated using the relativistic energy formula: E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Let's compute gamma for this. v = 0.6c → v²/c² = 0.36. So sqrt(1 - 0.36) is sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. Gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

The second astronaut has mass 3m, speed 0.5c. So v²/c² is 0.25. So sqrt(1 - 0.25) is sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660. Gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate that. 3 * 1.1547 is about 3.464. So adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc^2 and v_rel=0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc^2. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but did I calculate gamma correctly for each case? Let me double-check.

First astronaut: v=0.6c. 1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2
