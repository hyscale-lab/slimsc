Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I've read some stuff, so let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. The system's state is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). The matrices for P and Q are provided. I need to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P and -1 when measuring Q right after.

Hmm. So, first, I remember that when you measure an observable, you're essentially projecting the state onto the eigenvectors of that operator. The probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state and the eigenvector.

But wait, because we're measuring P first and then Q, the state after the first measurement (of P) will collapse into the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue we measured. So the result of the first measurement affects the second measurement.

Let me break it down. 

First, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q. 

Wait, but maybe I can approach it differently. The state is |Ïˆ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. 

When measuring P, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. So I should find the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of matrix P. 

Matrix P is:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, that looks a bit symmetric. Let's think about its structure. It's a 3x3 matrix. The diagonal elements are 0, except in the middle? Oh wait, no: the diagonal is 0, 0, 0. The other elements are 1/sqrt(2) in certain positions. 

Wait, what's the structure of P? It looks like a tridiagonal matrix with 0s on the diagonal and 1/sqrt(2) on the super and subdiagonals. Oh wait, no. Maybe it's a specific kind of matrix. Alternatively, perhaps it's a permutation matrix scaled by 1/sqrt(2). But I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should compute its eigenvalues.

Alternatively,
