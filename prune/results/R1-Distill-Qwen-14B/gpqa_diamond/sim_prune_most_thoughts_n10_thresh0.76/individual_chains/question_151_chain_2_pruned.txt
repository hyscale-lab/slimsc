Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum, but let's try to work through it.

The question says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait a second, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. So the first thing I should check is whether this state is normalized. To normalize, the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component should be 1.

Let me calculate that. The components are -1, 2, and 1. So their squares are 1, 4, and 1. Adding them together gives 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the state isn't normalized. That's a problem because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to have a norm of 1. So maybe I need to normalize it before proceeding. 

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps the operator P is being measured, and the state is given as is. Hmm, but in any case, I think I should normalize the state. Because otherwise, the probabilities might not add up correctly. So the state vector is |Ïˆ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ]. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state would be [ -1/sqrt(6); 2/sqrt(6); 1/sqrt(6) ].

But wait, I just realized that the problem doesn't specify that the state is normalized. It's possible that the state is given as it is, but I'm not sure. However, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. So I think I should proceed by normalizing it.

Next, the observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P has first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Let me write this out as a matrix:

P = [ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
       [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
       [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]

I think this matrix represents an observable, so it should be Hermitian. Let me check if it's symmetric. The elements in the first row are 0, a, 0. The second row is a, 0, a. The third row is 0, a, 0. So it's symmetric across the diagonal. So yes, P is Hermitian, which makes sense because observables are Hermitian.

The problem is to find the probability that measuring P will yield 0. So I'm to compute the probability that the outcome of measuring P is 0.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which ones are zero, then compute the probability of measuring 0.

Alternatively, if 0 is an eigenvalue, then the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the given state.

Wait,
