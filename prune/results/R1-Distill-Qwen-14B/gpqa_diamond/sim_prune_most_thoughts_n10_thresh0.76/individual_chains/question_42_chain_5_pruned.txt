Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the orbital periods of three exoplanets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They've used the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But maybe that's not super important for the calculations here.

The problem states the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So Planet2 is hotter than Planet1 by that factor. Then between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is 2.3. So Planet3 is hotter than Planet2 by 2.3 times. Wait, wait—no, actually, the ratio is Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4, so T2 is higher. Then Planet2 to Planet3 is 2.3, so T3 is higher than T2 by that ratio. So T3 would be 2.3 times T2, which is already 1.4 times T1. So T3 is 1.4 * 2.3 times T1, which is 3.22 times T1. But maybe I don't need that directly, but it's good to get the relationships right.

Masses: The mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.15. So Planet2 is more massive than Planet1. Then the mass ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35. So Planet3 is 1.35 times more massive than Planet2. So Planet3's mass is 1.15 * 1.35 times Planet1's mass, which would be 1.5525 times Planet1's mass. Hmm, but I'm not sure if the mass directly affects the orbital period. Wait, orbital period depends on the mass of the star and the distance from the star, right? Because Kepler's third law is about the period being related to the semi-major axis and the sum of the masses of the star and planet, but if the planet's mass is much smaller than the star, which it usually is, the planet's mass doesn't matter much. So maybe the masses given here don't play a direct role in the orbital period. Hmm, but maybe they are given for another part of the problem. Let me think.

The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 being larger than Planet1 by what factor. So I need to find P3/P1.

They also mention the albedo for all three is 0.3, like Earth's. So albedo affects the equilibrium temperature, but since it's the same for all, it probably cancels out when taking ratios.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

Te = Tstar * ( (L / (16 * π * σ)) )^(1/4) ) * ( (1 - a) / ( (1 + e)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/4) ) * ( ( (1 + B) ) / (d) )^(-1/2) )

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Let me recall a simpler version. The equilibrium temperature is proportional to ( ( (1 - a) * L ) / (16 * π * sigma * d^2) ) )^(1/4). Since all planets are around the same star, L and sigma are the same for all. And albedo a is the same (0.3), so (1 - a) is the same. So the equilibrium temperature depends on 1/d^(1/2), because d is the distance from the star. Or wait, wait: actually, the formula is Te = T_eff * sqrt( R_star / (2 * d) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) ). So the equilibrium temperature is proportional to sqrt(Rstar/(2d)) times (1 - a)^(1/4). But since all planets are around the same star, Rstar is the same, and a is same, so Te is proportional to (1/d)^0.5. So Te ~ 1/sqrt(d). So d ~ 1/(Te)^2.

Wait, but wait. Let me get the exact relation right. The equilibrium temperature formula is often written as:

Te = T_star * ( ( (1 - a) ) / (1 + e) )^(1/4) ) * sqrt( (R_star) / (2d) )

Assuming circular orbits (e=0), this simplifies to:

Te = T_star * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) ) * sqrt( R_star / (2d) )

So for our purposes, since a, R_star, and T_star are the same for all three planets, the Te is proportional to sqrt(1/d). So Te is inversely proportional to sqrt(d). So d is proportional to 1/(Te)^2.

Wait, but we have ratios of temperatures. Let's denote the equilibrium temperature ratio between planet 1 and planet 2 as T2 / T1 ≈ 1.4. So T2 = 1.4 * T1.

Similarly, T3 / T2 ≈ 2.3, so T3 = 2.3 * T2 = 2.3 * 1.4 * T1 = 3.22 * T1.

So if Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(d), then T2 / T1 = (1/sqrt(d2)) / (1/sqrt(d1)) ) = sqrt( d1 / d2 ). So T2 / T1 = sqrt( d1/d2 ). Rearranging, d2 = d1 * (T1 / T2)^2.

Similarly, T3 / T2 = sqrt( d2 / d3 ), so square both sides: (T3/T2)^2 = d2/d3, so d3 = d2 * (T2 / T3)^2.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier just to express d in terms of Te. Since d ∝ 1/(Te)^2, so the ratio of d's can be found from the inverse square of the Te ratios.

So for Planet1 and Planet2:

d2 / d1 = (T1 / T2 )^2.

Given T2 / T1 = 1.4 → T1 / T2 = 1/1.4 ≈ 0.7143.

So d2/d1 = (1/1.4)^2 ≈ (0.7143)^2 ≈ 0.5102.

So d2 = d1 * 0.5102.

Similarly, Planet2 and Planet3:

T3 / T2 = 2.3 → T2 / T3 = 1/2.3 ≈ 0.4348.

So d3/d2 = (T2 / T3 )^2 ≈ (0.4348)^2 ≈ 0.189.

So d3 = d2 * 0.189.

But wait, d2 is already 0.5102*d1. So d3 = 0.5102 * d1 * 0.189 ≈ 0.5102 * 0.189 ≈ 0.0962 * d1.

Wait, that can't be right because if Planet3 is further away than Planet1, its distance should be larger than Planet1's, but according to this, it's smaller. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Did I get the proportionality right?

Wait, maybe I messed up the proportionality. Because Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(d), so d is proportional to 1/(Te)^2.

So, if planet2 has a higher Te than planet1, then d2 < d1, meaning it's closer in. So if planet3 has a higher Te than planet2, it's closer in than planet2. So d3 < d2 < d1? But that would make planet3 the closest to the star, which would have the shortest orbital period. But the question is about the period of planet3 being larger than planet1's. Hmm, that can't be right because if planet3 is closer, its period should be shorter, not longer. So maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula gives Te as proportional to 1/sqrt(d). So higher Te implies smaller d (closer to the star). So higher Te → closer orbit. So if Planet3 has the highest Te (3.22 * T1), it would be the closest to the star. That would imply that Planet3 has a smaller orbital period than Planet1, which contradicts the question. Because the question is asking by what factor Planet3's period is larger than Planet1's. So I must have done something wrong in my reasoning.

Wait a second, perhaps I got the proportionality wrong. Let me think: Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (d). So P^2 ∝ d^3.
