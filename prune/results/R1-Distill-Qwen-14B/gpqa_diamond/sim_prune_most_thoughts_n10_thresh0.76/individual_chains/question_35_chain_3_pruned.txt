Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me start by understanding what the problem is presenting.

The question says that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A of a muon, is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay. The equation given is Ay(φ) = aφ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. The matrix Ay is equal to c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a given 2x2 matrix.

Wait, the matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay is c*S, so let's compute that. c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. Let me write that out:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],
                [i, 0]]

Hmm. So the matrix Ay becomes:

Ay = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))],
      [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. I remember that for any matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So the matrix (Ay - λI) would be:

[[-λ, -i h/(4π)],
 [i h/(4π), -λ]]

The determinant of this matrix is (-λ)(-λ) - [(-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π))].
Calculating each term:

First term: λ².

Second term: (-i)(i) * (h/(4π))². Wait, (-i)(i) is equal to (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. Oh wait, no, wait. Let's compute (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = - (-1) = +1. Because i squared is -1, so (-i)(i) is (-1)(i^2) which is (-1)(-1) = 1.

So the second term is 1 * (h²)/(16 π²). So the determinant is λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

So the equation is λ² = (h²)/(16 π²).
Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, but wait a second. That's the same as c, because c was h/(4 π). So the eigenvalues for Ay are a = ± c. So a = ± h/(4 π).

But wait, looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh or something. Wait, but the eigenvalues I got are real numbers, right? Because the matrix Ay is Hermitian, I think. Oh wait, let me check if Ay is Hermitian.

The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The conjugate transpose of S is [[0, i], [-i,
