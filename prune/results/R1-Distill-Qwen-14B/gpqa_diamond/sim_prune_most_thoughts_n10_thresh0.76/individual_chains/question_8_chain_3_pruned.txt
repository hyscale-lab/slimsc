Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the setup: We're working with white lupine plants and looking at their resistance to anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They've done some experiments by knocking out three genes: G1, G2, G3. They also made double mutants like g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. The goal is to find out how these genes interact, especially since at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others.

The results they got from testing the mutants' resistance are as follows:

- g1: 75% resistance (so less than wild type, which is 100%)
- g2: 0% resistance (so no resistance at all)
- g3: 50% resistance
- g1g3: 10% resistance
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out the relationships between these genes. Let me think about what each of these results might mean.

First, let's understand what each mutant's resistance tells us. Wild type is 100%, so any mutant with lower than that is more susceptible. The more susceptible, the lower the resistance.

Looking at the single mutants:
- g1 has 75%: so it's partially resistant. So the plant can still resist the pathogen but not as well as wild type.
- g2 has 0%: no resistance. This suggests that G2 is critical for resistance. Without it, the plant can't resist the disease at all.
- g3 has 50%: so it's more susceptible, but not as bad as g2.

Hmm, so we know that G2 is important because knocking it out completely removes resistance. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes needed for resistance. Because they said one of them is a transcription factor.

Now, looking at the double mutants:
- g1g2: 0% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, it's as susceptible as when just G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G1 might not be upstream of G2 or that G2's function is independent of G1. Alternatively, maybe G2 is downstream of G1, but in this case, the double mutant is as bad as g2 alone. Wait, that might mean that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because in genetics, if the double mutant looks like one of the single mutants (the more severe one), the gene whose mutation is epistatic is the one that's downstream. So if g2g1 is like g2, maybe G2 is downstream. Or wait, epistasis is the situation where one gene's phenotype masks the presence of another. So if the double mutant resembles the more severe single mutant, it suggests that the other gene is epistatic.

Wait, but let me think again. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes.' So in this case, if you have a double mutant where both genes are knocked out, and the phenotype is the same as when G2 is knocked out alone, perhaps G2 is epistatic to G1.

Wait, but how does that work? Suppose G2 is epistatic to G1. That would mean that the pathway is such that G2 is downstream. So the presence or absence of G1's function is masked by the absence of G2. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it's activated by G1. Let's say G1 produces a transcription factor that activates G2. So if G2 is non-functional (mutated), then even if G1 is working, it can't help because G2 is already broken. So in the double mutant, the effect is the same as G2 being broken, because G2 is downstream.

So, in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So that suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. So G2 is downstream.

Wait, but if G1 is upstream, like a transcription factor activating G2, then knocking out G2 would lead to no resistance regardless of G1. Because without G2, the downstream gene is not active. So that's why the double mutant's resistance is the same as the g2 mutant. So that suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. So that would point towards G2 being the transcription factor, perhaps, because if G1 is upstream, activating G2, and G2 is a TF as well. Or maybe G2 is downstream.

Wait, but the question says that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So maybe G2 is the transcription factor, and it's upstream of other genes. Let's see.

Looking at the other double mutants: g1g3 is 10% resistance. That's lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, it's worse than either single. That might suggest that G1 and G3 have some additive or synergistic effects. But perhaps they're in the same pathway.

g2g3: 0% resistance. Again, same as g2. So when G2 and G3 are both knocked out, the resistance is same as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G3. So G2 is downstream of G3. Because if G3 is upstream, then knocking it out would prevent G2 from being
