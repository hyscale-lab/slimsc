Okay, so I have this physics problem about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

The question says that the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. We're supposed to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic coupling term) with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I remember is about the Balmer series in hydrogen, probably the H-alpha line. Oh wait, that's the transition from n=2 to n=1 or something else? Wait no, Balmer is from n=3 to n=2, which emits in the visible range. Wait, wait, the wavelength 0.4861 micrometers is about 486 nm, which is the H-alpha line, which is n=3 to n=2. Or wait, maybe I should double-check that. Oh, wait, the Balmer series starts at n=3 and goes to n=2, resulting in a wavelength around 656 nm (H-alpha is 656 nm?), but wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486 nm, which is blue-green, that's the H-beta line perhaps? Or maybe it's another transition. Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy transition instead.

Anyway, the main thing is that the question is comparing the paramagnetic term with the transition energy ΔE. So I need to find expressions for both and compare their magnitudes.

First, the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is typically given by H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor (approximately 2), μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but in the context of the Zeeman effect or paramagnetic coupling in atoms, the term is usually H
