Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities for two exoplanets, and I need to figure out which one is more likely to transit, given their setups. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question says that both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. That means their minimum masses and orbital periods are known. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 has a shorter period, meaning it's closer to its star since the orbital period is related to distance via Kepler's laws.

Also, both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii, but the star with Planet_1 is more massive—twice the mass of Planet_2's star. Oh, and the host star of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but still has the same radius as Planet_1's host.

The researchers want to observe the planet that has the highest probability of transiting. So, the transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. But I think the probability also depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance, which affects the chance that the planet passes directly in front of the star from our point of view.

Wait, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the formula P = R_p / a, where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis (orbital radius). But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Actually, the probability is proportional to (R_p + R_s) / a, but wait, I think the exact formula is more like (R_p / a) * (something else). Or maybe the transit probability is equal to the ratio of the planet's orbital plane being edge-on relative to our line of sight, which depends on the star's size and the planet's orbit.

Alternatively, I think the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet)² / (a²), but no, that can't be right because that would be area-related. Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our view) is roughly the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Because the planet's orbital plane has to be aligned within a certain angle for a transit
