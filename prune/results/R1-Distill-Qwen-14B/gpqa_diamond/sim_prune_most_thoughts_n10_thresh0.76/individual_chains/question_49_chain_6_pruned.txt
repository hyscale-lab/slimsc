Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answers for these three reactions. Hmm, let me read through the question again.

The problem involves sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction where a pi bond moves along a conjugated system, involving a shift of substituents. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples, and they're usually thermodynamically controlled, meaning they favor the more stable product.

There are three parts to the problem, each requiring the identification of the product A, B, or C. The options are given, and I need to match each product correctly.

Let's take them one by one.

First reaction:
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat â†’ A.

Wait, what's the structure of 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine? That's ethan-1-amine with two methoxy groups on carbon 1. So it's like (CH3O)2CHNH2? Or wait, ethan-1-amine is NH2CH2CH3. But 1,1-dimethoxy would be OCH3 groups on the same carbon as the amine. So structure is NH2C(OCH3)2CH3. Wait no, ethan-1-amine is CH2CH3 with the amine on the first carbon. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH2NH2CH3? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is NH2CH2CH3. Oh wait, wait. Ethan-1-amine has the NH2 on the first carbon of ethane. So structure is CH2CH3 with NH2 on the first carbon. But 1,1-dimethoxy would have two OMe groups on the same carbon as the amine? So structure is (NH2)(OCH3)2CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more like (CH3O)2CH-NH2. Yes, that makes sense. So the amine is on a carbon that has two methoxy groups attached. So that's the first reactant.

The second reactant is but-3-en-2-ol. That's an alcohol with a double bond between
