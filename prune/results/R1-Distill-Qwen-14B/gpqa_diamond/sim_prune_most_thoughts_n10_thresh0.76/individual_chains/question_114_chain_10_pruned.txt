Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned in class.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when ketones react with cyanide, I think that's a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, but the product here is a nitrile and a hydroxyl group. Wait, isn't that some kind of substitution or maybe a two-step process?

Wait, I remember that when a ketone reacts with HCN, it adds to the carbonyl group. The carbonyl becomes a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol and a nitrile group. The structure would be something like (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is the product given. So, in this case, the reagent A is probably something that helps in the addition of CN- to the ketone.

But wait, the reagent given is NaCN. Oh, because NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So maybe in the first step, the NaCN is providing the cyanide nucleophile. But what about the conditions? I think for the formation of cyanohydrins from ketones, you usually need an acid catalyst. Because the ketone is a carbonyl, and under acidic conditions, it can protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- can attack.

So, reagent A is probably H3O+ or something that can act as an acid. Looking at the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, H3O+ is a strong acid, so that makes sense for the first reaction. So for the first step, A would be H3O+.

Now, the second reaction is more complicated. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. That sounds like a compound with a benzyl group attached, a hydroxyl group, and a nitrile group. The reagent B is applied in the presence of water, and the product is 2-(4-b
