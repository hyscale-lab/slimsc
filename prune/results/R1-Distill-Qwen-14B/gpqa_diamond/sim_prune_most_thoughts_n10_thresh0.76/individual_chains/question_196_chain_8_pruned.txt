Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I've studied a bit about harmonic oscillators in my mechanics class, but relativistic effects are a bit trickier. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We're supposed to find the maximum speed, v_max.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so I can't just use that formula directly.

In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy. So the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential and kinetic energies oscillate. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential, and when it's at the equilibrium position, all the energy is kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv², because that would be non-relativistic. Instead, the relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the process would be: At maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point (x=0), all that potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA² + mc² (rest energy) at x=A, but wait, no. Wait, the potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², so at x=A, it's (1/2)kA². The total mechanical energy is this potential energy plus the kinetic energy at that point. But at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. So E = (1/2)kA².

Wait, no, because in relativistic cases, the total energy includes the rest mass energy. Oh wait, no, wait. In the non-relativ
