Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C to form product 1. The product is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), another between 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Hmm, so what's happening here? When dibromides react with KOH, especially a dihalide, it's likely an elimination reaction. Since it's heated with a strong base like KOH, it's probably a dehydrohalogenation, eliminating HBr and forming a double bond.

Wait, but if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination would form a diene? Or maybe an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening, but adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so maybe it's a bridge that's being opened.

Alternatively, considering the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe it's a ketone? How does that happen from a dibromide? Oh, wait, if KOH is a base, perhaps it's an elimination followed by some kind of ring formation or maybe a ketone is formed through some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkyne. Wait, but IR for alkyne C≡C is around 2200 cm⁻¹, which isn't here. So that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: the initial elimination forms an epoxide. No, because an epoxide would have different IR peaks, like around 1200-1300 cm⁻¹. Alternatively, maybe a ketone is formed. How? Wait, if two bromines are on adjacent carbons, like 1 and 3, perhaps when KOH is added, each Br is eliminated with H from adjacent to form a double bond. But if they are on 1 and 3 positions in the adamantane structure, maybe the elimination leads to a bridge structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the formation of a cycloalkane or a cyclohexene derivative. Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let me think about the NMR spectrum of product 1. The peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H) suggest something deshielded, maybe an oxygen-bearing group like an ether or an ester. But in the IR, the carbonyl is at 1720, which could be a ketone or an ester
