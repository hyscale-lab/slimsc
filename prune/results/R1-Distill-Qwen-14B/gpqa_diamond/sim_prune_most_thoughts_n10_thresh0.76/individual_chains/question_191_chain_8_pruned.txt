Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, I need to visualize that structure. So, the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (which is -CH2OH), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be like a CH2-C=CH2 group attached? Or wait, no. Let me get that right. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So the structure is CH2-C(CH2)-, but wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Oh wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is actually CH2CH2-CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH2=C(CH2R)-, but wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So if it's prop-1-en-2-yl, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C1 and C2, and the substituent at C2. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2-C(CH3)=? No, wait. Let me think again. The formula for prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2, so the group is CH2=C-CH2-? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH(CH2-something)=CH2? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the group being attached to the cyclohexane ring at the 5 position. So the prop-1-en-2-yl group is a substituent where the point of attachment is on the second carbon of a propene. So the structure would be CH
