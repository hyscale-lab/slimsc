Okay, so I need to find the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on quantum mechanics, but let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Oh wait, right, the variance of the operator gives the square of the uncertainty. So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The state vector given is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let's denote this state as |ψ⟩. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, this state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That's helpful because it means the components directly correspond to the eigenvalues of P_z.

Wait, no, actually, the state is in the eigenbasis of P_x. Wait, no, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state |ψ⟩ is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. So each component of the vector corresponds to the amplitude of each eigenstate of P_z.

Wait, let me get this straight. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state |ψ⟩ is written as a linear combination of these eigenvectors. So each component in the vector is the amplitude for a particular eigenvalue of P_z.

So, the state |ψ⟩ is given as ( -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 )^T. So the three components correspond to the eigenstates of P_z with eigenvalues probably something like +ħ, 0, -ħ? Because looking at P_z's matrix:

P_z is diagonal with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ). So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ, and the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. So if the state is |ψ⟩ = (a, b, c)^T, then the amplitudes for each eigenvalue are a, b, c.

So the probability of measuring each eigenvalue is |a|^2, |b|^2, |c|^2. Let me compute those. 

a = -1/2, so |a|^2 = 1/4. c = -1/2, same as a. |c|^2 is also 1/4. b is 1/sqrt(2), so |b|^2 is 1/2. Let me check: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1, which adds up correctly.

So the probabilities are 1/4 for +ħ, 1/2 for 0, and 1/4 for -ħ. Wait, no, wait: the order of the components in the vector. So the first component is the amplitude for the eigenvalue +ħ, the second for 0, third for -ħ.

So for |ψ⟩, the components are:
