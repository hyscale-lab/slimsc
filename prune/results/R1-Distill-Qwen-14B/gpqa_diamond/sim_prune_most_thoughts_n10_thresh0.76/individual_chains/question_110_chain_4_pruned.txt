Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the brightness of a star as seen from Earth, the apparent magnitude, determines whether a spectrograph can detect it. Each spectrograph has its own limit. The question says ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V mag. Wait, no, waitâ€”brighter means lower magnitude numbers. So, if a star's apparent V magnitude is less than (brighter than) 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can see stars that are brighter than 16, meaning apparent V mag less than 16.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. But wait, the way magnitudes work is that lower numbers are brighter. So if the apparent magnitude is, say, 17, that's fainter than 16. So, wait, if the limit is brighter than 17, that means the apparent magnitude has to be less than 17. Because, for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than one with V=17. So, the limit is V < 17 for ESPRESSO and V < 16 for HIRES. Because if a star is brighter (lower magnitude) than the limit, it can be seen.

So each star must have an apparent V magnitude less than 17 for ESPRESSO, and less than 16 for HIRES. Wait, but the question is asking which stars can be detected with both. So a star must be observable by both, meaning it's brighter than both limits. Wait, no, wait, no: ESPRESSO can detect stars up to V=17, and HIRES can detect up to V=16. So a star must be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO? No, wait no, because if a star is at V=16, it's brighter than 17. So, any star with V
