Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about finding the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but let's break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target molecule. Benzene has three substituents here: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, wait. Wait, benzene is a ring with six positions. So numbering them clockwise: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So positions 1, 2, 3 are substituted, and the others are hydrogen.

Now, I remember that when you have multiple substituents on benzene, the order in which you introduce them matters because of directing effects. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the substituents already present. So, substituents can be either activating (like -OCH2CH3, which is ethoxy) or deactivating (like NO2). Also, they can be meta or para directors, depending on their nature.

Let me list the substituents and their directing effects:

1. tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3): This is a bulky alkyl group. Alkyl groups are activating (since they donate electrons through sigma bonds) and are ortho/para directors.

2. Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3): This is an ether group, which is also activating (since the lone pairs on oxygen can donate electrons through resonance), and it's an ortho/para director.

3. Nitro group (-NO2): This is deactivating (it withdraws electrons through resonance and inductive effects) and is a meta director.

Wait, but in the target molecule, these three substituents are all present. So, how were they introduced? The starting material is benzene, so I need to add these one by one.

I need to plan the synthesis steps. Let's think about the order in which substituents should be introduced to get the correct positions.

The ethoxy group is an activating group. Nitro is deactivating. The tert-butyl is a bulky activating group.

If I introduce the nitro group first, since it's deactivating, the next substitution would be difficult because the ring would be less reactive. So maybe it's better to introduce activating groups first to direct subsequent reactions.

Wait, but the nitro group is meta-directing. So if we add nitro first, then the next substituent would go meta to it. But in the target, nitro is at position 3, and ethoxy is at position 1, which is adjacent (ortho) to position 2. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the substituents' positions relative to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced first. Let's say we first introduce the ethoxy group. Then, when adding the tert-butyl group, the ethoxy directs the incoming group to ortho or para positions. Then, the nitro group can be introduced in the correct place considering the existing substituents.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director, so the position where it goes depends on where the substituents are.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the substituents' order:

Let me consider each substituent's position relative to the others. Let's imagine the benzene ring as:

Positions:
1: ethoxy
2: tert-butyl
3: nitro

So, positions 1, 2, 3 are all substituted.

How to get them in the right spots.

Wait, let me think about the possible directing effects. When you add substituents, each new substituent is directed by the existing ones. So, for multiple substituents, more substituted positions can influence the next substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added last, because it's deactivating, making the ring less reactive for further substituents. But that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach is to plan the synthesis steps in a way that each substituent is added in an order that allows for correct regiochemistry. Let's think about each step.

Optionally, the steps could involve:

1. Introduce ethoxy group (since it's activating and a good director)
2. Introduce tert-butyl group (another activating group, but bulky)
3. Introduce nitro group (deactivating, which may be tricky, but maybe at a position directed by the previous groups)

Alternatively, perhaps introducing the tert-butyl group first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Or some other order.

Wait, the nitro group is meta to the ethoxy? Or para? Let me think of the target structure.

In the target, the ethoxy is at position 1. The nitro is at position 3. So, relative to ethoxy, which is at 1, nitro is at 3 (which is meta), because numbering is 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), 3 (nitro). So, the nitro is in the meta position relative to ethoxy.

Wait, but ethoxy is an ortho/para director. So when adding the nitro group, if the ethoxy is present, the nitro could be added in the ortho or para position relative to ethoxy. But in our target, nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy (position 1). So that can't be, because ethoxy would direct to ortho or para.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me draw it out:

Imagine benzene ring with positions 1, 2, 3 in a clockwise manner.

Position 1: Ethoxy.

Position 2: tert-Butyl.

Position 3: Nitro.

So, relative to the ethoxy (position 1), nitro is at position 3, which is two positions away (meta). But since ethoxy is an ortho/para director, if nitro is added after ethoxy, it would normally go either ortho (position 2) or para (position 4). So in this case, the nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy. That suggests that the nitro group was added before the ethoxy, but that doesn't seem right because nitro is deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added
