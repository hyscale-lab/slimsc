Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. So, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. And I need to find the partition function Z. 

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Right. So I need to find all possible states of the three spins and calculate E for each, then sum exp(-βE) for all.

But wait, each spin can be +1 or -1, so the total number of possible states is 2^3 =8. That's manageable. Let me list them all and compute E for each.

Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3) where each S is ±1.

Let me create a table:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now compute E for each.

The formula E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. So for each state, compute each product.

Let's compute S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 for each state.

1. State (+1, +1, +1):

S1S2 = (+1)(+1)=1.
S1S3 = 1.
S2S3=1.
Sum = 1+1+1=3.
E = -J *3 = -3J.

2. State (+1, +1, -1):

S1S2=1.
S1S3= (+1)(-1)= -1.
S2S3= (+1)(-1)= -1.
Sum=1 + (-1) + (-1)= -1.
E=-J*(-1) = J.

3. State (+1, -1, +1):

S1S2= (+1)(-1)= -1.
S1S3= (+1)(+1)=1.
S2S3= (-1)(+1)= -1.
Sum= (-1) +1 + (-1)= -1.
E=J again.

4. State (+1, -1, -1):

S1S2= -1.
S1S3= (+1)(-1)= -1.
S2S3= (-1)(-1)=1.
Sum= -1 + (-1) +1 = -1.
E= J.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check that.

Wait state 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S
