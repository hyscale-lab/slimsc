Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with multiple substituents. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on IUPAC nomenclature, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the question describes the structure of the molecule. Let me parse the information given. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is a formyl group), and a cyano group, all meta to one another. Wait, meta means each is separated by two carbons, right? So their positions are every third position around the ring.

Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Ortho is next to each other, so those two substituents are on the adjacent carbons to the carboxylic acid. Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Para is across the ring, so that's four positions away.

Another important point: the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile group. So the nitrile (cyano) has methoxy and hydroxyl as its ortho substituents.

Wait, let me try to visualize this. I'll imagine the benzene ring and number the positions 1 to 6. Let's say the carboxylic acid is in position 1. Then, the substituents meta to it would be positions 3 and 5, but wait, the problem says all three substituents (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano) are meta to one another. Hmm, that's a bit tricky because if the carboxylic acid is in position 1, then the other two would be in 3 and 5, but all three can't be meta to each other because 1,3,5 are each meta to each other in a benzene ring. Wait, that's correct because in benzene, each of 1,3,5 is meta to the others. So that makes sense.

So the substituents are at positions 1 (carboxylic acid), 3 (formyl), and 5 (cyano). Alternatively, maybe the positions could be different, but I'll stick with this for now.

Wait, the carboxylic acid is in position 1. Ortho to it are positions 2 and 6
