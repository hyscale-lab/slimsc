Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Structure of trans-cinnamaldehyde**: Trans-cinnamaldehyde has the structure (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal, which consists of a benzene ring (6 carbons), a double bond (CH=CH), and an aldehyde group (CHO). This gives it a total of **9 carbon atoms**.\n\n2. **Reaction with methylmagnesium bromide (Grignard reagent)**: The Grignard reagent adds to the aldehyde group (CHO), forming a secondary alcohol. The aldehyde group (CHO) is converted into a secondary alcohol (CH(OH)Me), adding one carbon from the methyl group. This results in product 1, which has **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n3. **Oxidation with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**: PCC oxidizes the secondary alcohol in product 1 to a ketone. The secondary alcohol (CH(OH)Me) is converted into a ketone (C(O)Me). This step does not change the number of carbon atoms, so product 2 also has **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n4. **Reaction with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO**: This reagent is part of the Arndt-Eistert homologation, which adds a methylene group (CH2) to the carbonyl group. The ketone (C(O)Me) in product 2 reacts to form a new ketone (C(O)CH2Me), adding one more carbon. This results in product 3 with **11 carbon atoms**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe number of carbon atoms in product 3 is **11**.\n\nAnswer: D"
