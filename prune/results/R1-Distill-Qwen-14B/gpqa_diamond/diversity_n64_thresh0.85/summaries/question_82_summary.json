The analysis proceeds as follows:\n\n1. **First Reaction (Cyclooctatetraene + Maleic Anhydride):**  \n   Cyclooctatetraene acts as the diene, and maleic anhydride as the dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction. The reaction forms a bicyclic structure with the substituents (from maleic anhydride) in a cis configuration due to the endo rule. This forms product 1.\n\n2. **Second Reaction (Product 1 + Methanol, H\u2082SO\u2084):**  \n   The anhydride group in product 1 undergoes acid-catalyzed ring-opening with methanol, forming a diester. The stereochemistry from the Diels-Alder reaction in product 1 is retained, resulting in product 2.\n\n3. **Third Reaction (Product 2 + Cyclopentadiene):**  \n   Product 2 contains an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester group, which acts as a dienophile. Cyclopentadiene, the diene, reacts with it in another Diels-Alder reaction. The endo rule applies, favoring a specific stereochemical outcome where the substituents are positioned to maximize stability. This forms product 3, a complex bicyclic structure with additional stereochemistry from the second Diels-Alder reaction.\n\nThe final product's stereochemistry is determined by the endo rule in both Diels-Alder reactions. The options provided represent different stereochemical configurations, and based on the reasoning, the major isomer corresponds to **option A**, which aligns with the stereochemical outcome expected from the endo rule.\n\nAnswer: A"
