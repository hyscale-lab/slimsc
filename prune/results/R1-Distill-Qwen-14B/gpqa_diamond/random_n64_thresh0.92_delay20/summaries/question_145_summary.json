The compound has the following substituents:\n- **C2**: CH3, CH2-C1, CH2-C3, and H. These are four different groups, so C2 is a chiral center.\n- **C5**: OH, CH2-C4, CH2-C6, and H. These are four different groups, so C5 is a chiral center.\n- **C6**: Cl, CH2-C5, CH2-C7, and H. These are four different groups, so C6 is a chiral center.\n- **C9**: CH2CH3, CH2-C8, CH2-C10, and H. These are four different groups, so C9 is a chiral center.\n\nThus, there are **4 chiral centers**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Double Bonds and Geometric Isomerism\nThe compound has two double bonds at positions **3,7-dien** (C3=C4 and C7=C8). For geometric isomerism (E/Z), each double bond must have two different substituents on each carbon. \n\n- **C3=C4**: Substituents on C3 are CH(CH3) and CH2; on C4 are CH2 and CH(OH). These are different, so E/Z is possible.\n- **C7=C8**: Substituents on C7 are CH2 and CH2; on C8 are CH2 and CH(CH2CH3). These are different, so E/Z is possible.\n\nThus, there are **2 double bonds**, each contributing a factor of 2 for geometric isomerism.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Stereoisomers\nThe total number of stereoisomers is the product of the possibilities from chiral centers and double bonds:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Stereoisomers} = 2^{\\text{number of chiral centers}} \\times 2^{\\text{number of double bonds}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Stereoisomers} = 2^4 \\times 2^2 = 16 \\times 4 = 64\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Reconcile with Options\nThe calculated value of 64 does not match any of the provided options (A: 4, B: 16, C: 32, D: 8). This discrepancy suggests a potential issue in the analysis, such as overcounting chiral centers or double bonds. Upon re-evaluation, it is possible that the molecule has internal symmetry or that some double bonds do not contribute to geometric isomerism. However, based on the given options, the most reasonable answer is **16**, which corresponds to the stereoisomers arising from the chiral centers alone.\n\nANSWER: B"
