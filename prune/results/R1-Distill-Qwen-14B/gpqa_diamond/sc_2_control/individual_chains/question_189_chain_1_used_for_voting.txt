Okay, so I have this physics question here about particles and symmetry, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question asks which of the given particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. The options are Phonon, Skyrmion, Magnon, and Pion.

Hmm, I remember that spontaneous symmetry breaking is a concept in physics where the underlying laws are symmetric, but the system as a whole doesn't exhibit that symmetry. Like how a spinning top can fall over in any direction when it loses its balance, but the ground state breaks rotational symmetry.

Wait, right, particles like the Higgs boson are linked to the symmetry breaking in the Standard Model. But that's not one of the options here. Let me think about each option.

Phonon: Phonons are related to vibrations in a crystal lattice. They're quantized sound waves. I think phonons arise from the vibrations, which are due to the collective movement of atoms in a crystal. So if the crystal has a certain symmetry, the phonons would correspond to the ways the lattice can vibrate without breaking that symmetry. But wait, phonons are typically massless in the case of a perfect crystal. But in reality, due to defects and other things, maybe phonons have some effective mass. Or perhaps phonons are a result of broken symmetry. Wait, no, phonons are more about the quantized modes of vibration of a lattice, which is a result of the crystal's periodic structure. So the underlying symmetry is that of the crystal, and phonons are the quasiparticles representing the vibrational modes. But do they result from spontaneous symmetry breaking? Hmm, maybe not directly.

Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons, right? They were proposed by Skyrme as a model for atomic nuclei. Skyrmions arise in theories where there's a certain symmetry, and the vacuum can have different topological states. I think Skyrmions are associated with the pion field, and pions are Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking. So Skyrmions must come from a symmetry that's spontaneously broken because they have a topological structure that's a result of that symmetry breaking.

Magnon: Magnons are quasiparticles in magnetic materials. I remember that in a magnetically ordered system, like a ferromagnet, the spins are all aligned. The magnon is the quantized excitation of the spin waves. When the system is in a magnetically ordered state (like below the Curie temperature), the symmetry of the system is broken. So the magnon arises due to the broken symmetry. For example, in a ferromagnet, the continuous rotational symmetry of the spins is broken to a discrete symmetry. So magnons are tied to the broken symmetry.

Pion: Pions are the lightest mesons, composed of up and anti-down quarks, etc. In the context of chiral symmetry breaking, the pions are the Goldstone bosons. Chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously in QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) at low energies, leading to the appearance of pions as the massless (well, almost) particles. So pions are definitely associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.

So the question is which particle is NOT associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. Let's see:

Phonons: If the crystal has a certain symmetry, the phonon dispersion might depend on it, but do phonons arise from a broken symmetry? Or are they due to the underlying periodic structure? Wait, in a perfect crystal with translational symmetry, phonons are the way the lattice vibrations propagate, but if the crystal has a broken translational symmetry (like defects), then phonons might gain effective mass, but in the perfect case, they are massless. But I'm not sure if phonon's existence implies a broken symmetry. Alternatively, phonons are a result of the crystal's periodicity, which is a form of broken translational symmetry in the crystal as a solid, but maybe the underlying laws are symmetric. Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. 

Wait, spontaneous symmetry breaking is when the system's vacuum (ground state) doesn't respect the symmetry, but the laws do. So for example, in a superconductor, the symmetry is broken in the ground state (Cooper pairs form), but the laws are symmetric.

Phonons in a crystal: The ground state of a crystal is in a periodic arrangement, which breaks the translational symmetry (because it's a lattice with a repeating unit). So the underlying laws (like the Schr√∂dinger equation for particles in a periodic potential) have translational symmetry, but the actual crystal state breaks that. So phonons arise from the broken translational symmetry. So phonons are associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.

Wait, but wait, phonons are more about the vibrational modes, not the ground state's symmetry. So in that case, the spontaneous symmetry breaking is in the ordering of the crystal. So the presence of phonons is a result of the broken symmetry of the crystal. So that would mean phonons are connected to a broken symmetry.

If that's the case, then all the options except one are connected to broken symmetries. So which one isn't?

Wait, let's list each:

A) Phonon: yes, broken symmetry (crystal has periodicity, broken translational symmetry).

B) Skyrmion: yes, they result from symmetry breaking in the theory (like chiral symmetry for pions).

C) Magnon: yes, from magnetic ordering, broken spin symmetry.

D) Pion: yes, from chiral symmetry breaking.

So if all options are linked to broken symmetry, then none is correct. But that can't be. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, the question is about which particle is NOT associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. So one of these is not a result of such broken symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the phonon isn't a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking, but rather a result of a different kind of symmetry or no symmetry breaking.

Wait, phonons are quantized versions of the normal modes of vibration of the crystal. The existence of phonons doesn't require spontaneous symmetry breaking in the same sense as, say, the Higgs mechanism. Because in a crystal, the translational symmetry is explicitly broken by the periodic structure. Wait, but no, the underlying laws (like the forces between atoms) have translational symmetry. The ground state (crystal) breaks the translational symmetry, so yes, that's spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Wait, but in that case, all the options are linked to SSB. Then the question is wrong. Hmm, maybe the correct answer is the phonon, perhaps phonons are not associated with SSB.

Wait, another thought: perhaps phonons are a result of broken symmetry but not of the spontaneous kind. Because in a crystal, the translational symmetry is explicitly broken by the periodic structure. Wait, no, the system's ground state (the crystal) breaks the translational symmetry. So it's spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Hmm. Now I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the phonon is a Goldstone boson. But in the case of phonons, are they Goldstone? Wait, Goldstone's theorem says that for every continuous symmetry that is spontaneously broken, there's a Goldstone boson. But in a crystal lattice, the translational symmetry is discrete, not continuous. So Goldstone's theorem doesn't apply. So phonons are not Goldstone bosons, but rather Nambu-Goldstone? Wait, no, Nambu-Goldstone are for internal symmetries. Phonons are for spatial symmetries.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the concept. Which of these particles is a result of a symmetry that's spontaneously broken.

- Skyrmion: Yes, comes from chiral symmetry breaking.

- Magnon: Yes, comes from magnetic ordering (broken spin symmetry).

- Pion: Yes, Goldstone boson from chiral symmetry.

Phonon: Does the phonon arise from a spontaneously broken symmetry? Because the crystal's ground state (the lattice) breaks the translational symmetry which is present in the underlying laws.

So yes, phonons are associated with broken symmetry. So if all options are, then the question is wrong. But that can't be. So perhaps the answer is A) Phonon? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, maybe the phonon isn't a Goldstone boson because the symmetry is broken explicitly, not spontaneously. Because in a crystal, you have a periodic structure, so the translational symmetry is explicitly broken by the potential. So the system's Hamiltonian doesn't have translational symmetry because the potential is periodic but not uniform. So in that case, the symmetry breaking is explicit, not spontaneous. Oh! That's a key point.

So spontaneous symmetry breaking is when the laws (Hamiltonian) are symmetric, but the system's state (ground state) isn't. For example, in ferromagnetism, the Hamiltonian is symmetric under rotation, but the ground state picks a specific direction. So the symmetry is broken spontaneously.

In a crystal, the potential is periodic, so the Hamiltonian itself doesn't have translational symmetry. Because the crystal structure explicitly breaks the translational symmetry, so the symmetry breaking is explicit, not spontaneous. So phonons are a result of explicit symmetry breaking, not spontaneous. So that would mean the phonon is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.

So the question asks which is NOT associated with SSB. So the answer would be A) Phonon.

So the correct answer is A.

To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, let us analyze each option:

### A) Phonon  
Phonons are quantized vibrational modes of a crystal lattice. In a perfect crystal, the translational symmetry of the underlying laws is explicitly broken by the periodic structure of the lattice. Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the system's ground state breaks the symmetry of the underlying laws, but in this case, the symmetry breaking is explicit due to the crystal's periodicity. Therefore, phonons are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.

### B) Skyrmion  
Skyrmions are topological solitons that arise in theories with spontaneously broken symmetries. They are associated with the pion field and are a result of chiral symmetry breaking in the context of nuclear physics. Thus, skyrmions are linked to spontaneously-broken symmetry.

### C) Magnon  
Magnons are quasiparticles representing spin wave excitations in magnetic materials. In a magnetically ordered system, such as a ferromagnet, the continuous rotational symmetry of the spins is spontaneously broken to a discrete symmetry. Magnons arise as a result of this spontaneous symmetry breaking.

### D) Pion  
Pions are the lightest mesons and appear as Goldstone bosons in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) due to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry at low energies. They are directly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Phonons are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry because the translational symmetry breaking in a crystal is explicit, not spontaneous. All other particles listed (Skyrmion, Magnon, Pion) are tied to spontaneously-broken symmetries.
