Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me see what the question is. Oh right, it's about iron atoms being more excited in star_1 compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we have to find the equation relating the effective temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, the problem states that the photospheres are in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I should probably think about the Boltzmann distribution here. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation describes the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(kT) ). But wait, in this case, I think the excitation is higher in star_1. So star_1 has more atoms in the upper energy level compared to star_2. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of populations.

Wait, the problem says that the number of excited iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Let me clarify: the ratio (n2/n1) for star_1 and star_2. Or wait, more accurately, for each star, their own ratio is considered.

Wait, maybe it's better to model it as:

For star 1: n1_2 / n1_1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE / (k T1) )

Similarly, for star 2: n2_2 / n2_1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE / (k T2) )

But in the question, it's stated that in star_1, the excited level is twice that of star_2. Wait, not exactly. Let me read again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe n2_1 (upper level population) is twice n2_2 (lower level population) for star_1 compared to star_2? Or perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, perhaps the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So let me define:

For star_1: (n_upper / n_lower) = 2 * (n_upper' / n_lower') for star_2.

Wait, maybe more accurately, the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n_upper / n_lower)_1 = 2 * (n_upper / n_lower)_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower). Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, the question says star_1's atoms are twice as excited, so more in the excited state. So perhaps the ratio is higher in star_1.

Let me think about the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). Assuming g2 and g1 are the statistical weights of the upper and lower levels, respectively. If ΔE is the energy difference between the upper and lower levels.

So if star_1 has more excited atoms, the ratio (n_upper / n_lower)_1 is higher than that for star_2. So,

(n_upper / n_lower)_1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

(n_upper / n_lower)_2 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the ratio between the two is:

[(n_upper/n_lower)_1 ] / [(n_upper/n_lower)_2 ] = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents. So,

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Hmm, but the problem says that star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2. So (n_upper/n_lower)_1 = 2*(n_upper/n_lower)_2. So the ratio is 2.

So,

exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = 2

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

ΔE/(k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)

Now, let's compute this. Let me note that ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, wait, 1.38e-23 J is 1.38 x10^-23 J. Oh, and Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's a coincidence! So k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So substituting k, the equation becomes:

(1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) * ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)

Simplify the terms. The 1.38e-23 cancels out, so we get:

1 * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Which rearranges to:

(1/T2 -1/T1) = ln(2)

Wait, but in the options, we have ln(2) equals something involving T1 and T2. Let's rearrange the equation:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

Which is equivalent to:

( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2 )

Multiply both sides by T1 T2 to eliminate denominators. Wait, let's see:

Let me write it as (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

Because:

1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

Hmm, so the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Wait, but the problem is to find the correct equation for the temperatures.

Looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes. So that matches.

Wait, the options are:

A) ln(2) = T2 / T1

B) ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2 )

C) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2

D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So D is the correct equation.

But wait, wait a second. Let's double-check.

We had:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2 )

Which is the same as 1/(T2) = 1/(T1) + ln(2 )

But wait, when we rearrange this:

(1/T2 -1/T1) = ln(2 )

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T1 - T2 = ln(2) * T1 T2

Then,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

Which is exactly option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J, and the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann distribution is used to describe the population of energy levels in such systems.

For star 1 and star 2, the ratio of populations in the upper and lower energy levels can be expressed using the Boltzmann factor:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are the statistical weights of the upper and lower levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The problem states that the excitation ratio for star 1 is twice that of star 2, so:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}/n_{\text{lower}} \, \text{(star 1)}}{n_{\text{upper}}/n_{\text{lower}} \, \text{(star 2)}} = 2.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions for each star:

\[
\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)} = 2.
\]

Simplifying the ratio:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), the \( \Delta E \) and \( k \) terms cancel out, leaving:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rearranging this equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A**: Incorrectly relates \( T_2 \) and \( T_1 \) without considering the correct relationship derived from the Boltzmann distribution.
- **Option B**: Incorrectly involves \( T_1 + T_2 \) in the numerator, which does not arise from the derivation.
- **Option C**: Incorrectly includes \( (T_1 T_2)^2 \) in the denominator, which is not consistent with the derived equation.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
