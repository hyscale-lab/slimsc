Okay, so I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the given decay reaction. The reaction is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a muon(+) and a neutrino. Hmm, right, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle is at rest and decays, the energy and momentum have to be conserved. 

Wait, the pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. That means the total momentum of the decay products must also be zero. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. 

But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they are leptons and have very little mass, almost massless, but in this case, the muon has a rest mass of about 105.7 MeV. The pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV. So the decay is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. 

Since the pion is at rest, the total energy of the decay products must equal the rest energy of the pion. Because the pion isn't moving, all its energy goes into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the products. 

So the total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After the decay, the total energy of the muon and neutrino must add up to this. 

But the muon has its own rest mass. So the energy of the muon will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is negligible. 

Wait, but the neutrino's mass is usually considered negligible in these kinds of problems. So the neutrino's energy is approximately its kinetic energy. 

Let me write down the equations. The total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV. 

Also, the momentum of the muon and the neutrino must be equal and opposite, so p_mu = p_nu = p (but opposite direction). 

The muon's energy is given by E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2, but since we use MeV and c=1 units, it's E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). 

The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p, because for massless particles, E = |p|.

So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.

Substituting E_mu and E_nu gives:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, this looks like an equation with one variable, p. Let me square both sides to solve for p.

Wait, but when you have sqrt(a) + b = c, squaring gives a + 2b sqrt(a) + b² = c². Let me set a = p^2 + (105.7)^2, and b = p.

So:

sqrt(p² + 105.7²) + p = 139.6

Let me let x = p, to make it easier.

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x

Now square both sides:

x² + 105.7² = (139.6 - x)^2

Expand the right side:

= (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

105.7² = (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * x

Let me compute the numbers.

105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7. Let me compute that. 100^2 is 10,000. 5.7^2 is about 32.49. The cross term is 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 100² + 2*100*5.7 +5.7² = 10,000 + 1,140 + 32.49 = 11,172.49 MeV²? Wait, actually, 105.7^2 is 105^2 is 11,025, plus 2*105*0.7=147, plus 0.7^2=0.49. So 11,025 +147=11,172, plus 0.49 is 11,172.49. So yes, approximately 11,172.49.

139.6 squared: Let's compute 140^2 is 19,600. But 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So 139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19,600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19,600 -112 is 19,488, plus 0.16 is 19,488.16.

So plugging into the equation:

11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - (2 * 139.6) * x

Wait, the equation after subtraction is 105.7² = 139.6² - (2 * 139.6) x.

So:

11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - (279.2 x)

Rearranging:

279.2 x = 19,488.16 - 11,172.49

Calculate the right side: 19,488.16 minus 11,172.49.

19,488.16 - 11,172.49 = let's see:

19,488.16
-11,172.49
-------------
Subtract 11,000 from 19,488.16: 8,488.16
Then subtract 172.49: 8,488.16 -172.49 = 8,315.67

So 279.2 x = 8,315.67

Divide both sides by 279.2:

x = 8,315.67 / 279.2

Let me compute that. 

279.2 * 30 = 8376. That's higher than 8315.67. So maybe 29.78? Let's see: 279.2 * 29 = 

279 * 30 is 8370, minus 279 is 8370 -279=8091. Hmm wait, no: 279.2 *29= 279.2*(30-1)=8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

Wait, 29*279.2=8096.8. 

Wait but 8,315.67 is less than 8,096.8? Wait no, 8,315.67 is more than 8,096.8. So 8,315.67 - 8,096.8 = 218.87.

So 279.2 * 0.8 would be about 223.36. Close enough. So 29.8 will be 29 + 0.8 = about 29.8.

So x ≈ 29.8.

Wait but wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Let me compute 279.2 * 30 =8376, minus 279.2 *0.2=55.84 → 8376 -55.84=8320.16.

But our target is 8,315.67. So 8320.16 is a bit higher. So maybe x is approximately 29.8 - (8320.16-8315.67)/(279.2) ?

Wait, the difference is 8320.16-8315.67=4.49.

So delta x is 4.49 /279.2 ≈ 0.016.

So x≈29.8 - 0.016=29.784 ≈ 29.78.

So x≈29.78 MeV/c.

So p = approx 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me recheck the math. Because earlier, I thought that x is p, which is the neutrino's energy (E_nu), and for the muon, E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt(29.78^2 +105.7^2).

Let me compute that.

29.78 squared is approx 886.8 (since 30^2=900). 105.7^2 is 11,172.49. So 886.8 + 11,172.49 = 12,059.29. Square root is sqrt(12,059.29) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So E_mu ≈109.81 MeV, E_nu≈29.78 MeV.

Total E =109.81 +29.78 =139.59 MeV, which is close to 139.6 MeV, which makes sense because we approximated.

Wait, but the pion's rest mass is 139.6, so it's correct.

But the question asks for the kinetic energy of each product. The kinetic energy is their total energy minus their rest mass.

For the muon: KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 =4.11 MeV.

For the neutrino: KE_nu = E_nu - 0 =29.78 MeV.

Wait, but the options don't have 4.12 and 29.8. Let me check the options.

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That seems to match.

Wait, but wait, the options are given as the KE of the product particles. So KE_mu is approximately 4.12 MeV, and KE_nu is approximately 29.8 MeV.

So looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Yes, that would be it. So the correct answer should be option D.

To determine the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay reaction:

\[
\pi^+ \ ( \text{at rest} ) \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

we use conservation of energy and momentum. The total energy of the decay products must equal the rest energy of the pion, which is \( 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \). The muon has a rest mass of \( 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), while the neutrino is assumed to be massless.

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   \[
   E_\mu + E_\nu = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}
   \]
   where \( E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2} \) (energy of the muon) and \( E_\nu = p \) (energy of the neutrino, since it is massless).

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the decay products must be zero, implying \( p_\mu = p_\nu = p \), but in opposite directions.

### Solving for \( p \):
Substituting \( E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2} \) and \( E_\nu = p \) into the energy conservation equation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6
\]

Let \( x = p \). Squaring both sides:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - x
\]
\[
x^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - x)^2
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
x^2 + 11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 279.2x + x^2
\]
\[
11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 279.2x
\]
\[
279.2x = 19,488.16 - 11,172.49
\]
\[
279.2x = 8,315.67
\]
\[
x = \frac{8,315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV/c}
\]

Thus, \( p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV/c} \).

### Calculating Energies:
1. **Muon Energy**:  
   \[
   E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2} \approx \sqrt{886.8 + 11,172.49} \approx \sqrt{12,059.29} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

2. **Neutrino Energy**:  
   \[
   E_\nu = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

### Kinetic Energies:
1. **Muon Kinetic Energy**:  
   \[
   KE_\mu = E_\mu - m_\mu = 109.81 - 105.7 \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

2. **Neutrino Kinetic Energy**:  
   \[
   KE_\nu = E_\nu = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

### Matching with Options:
The closest match to the calculated kinetic energies is:

**Option D: \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \)**.
