Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, first things first. I remember that when dealing with angular momentum operators, the eigenvalues correspond to the components of the angular momentum along a particular direction. So the operator P here is probably the angular momentum operator, maybe the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Because the components Px, Py, and Pz are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so let me look at those matrices again. For Px, it's [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And Pz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix, all multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P is probably the vector sum of these components, right? So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z, where n is the direction vector in the x-z plane. Oh wait, the direction vector is in the x-z plane, so n_y must be zero. So n has components (nx, 0, nz), and it's a unit vector, so nx² + nz² =1.

So the operator P is (n_x (ħ/2) σx ) + (0) + (n_z (ħ/2) σz ), because Py is multiplied by zero. So the operator simplifies to (n_x σx + nz σz) multiplied by ħ/2.

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let me denote the eigenvalue as λ = +ħ/2. The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = λ |ψ>. Since P is (n_x σx + nz σz) * (ħ/2), the equation becomes:

(n_x σx + nz σz) * (ħ/2) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Dividing both sides by (ħ/2), we get:

(n_x σx + nz σz) |ψ> = |ψ>

So (n_x σx + nz σz) |ψ> = 1 * |ψ>, meaning that the matrix (n_x σx + nz σz) has eigenvalue 1 for this eigenvector.

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = λ |ψ>, where λ is ħ/2. So when we factor out ħ/2, the matrix part must have eigenvalue 1. So the matrix M = n_x σx + nz σz must have eigenvalue 1 when multiplied by |ψ>.

So to find the eigenvector, we can construct the matrix M, find its eigenvectors for eigenvalue 1, and then normalize it.

But let me think about the structure of M. It's a 2x2 matrix because each component is 2x2. So M = n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Let me write that out:

M = [ [nz, n_x],
       [n_x, -nz ] ]

Because when you add them, the (1,1) element is nz, (1,2) is n_x, (2,1) is n_x, and (2,2) is -nz.

So the matrix M is:

[ nz, n_x ]
[ n_x, -nz ]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 1.

The general approach is to solve (M - I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix. So:

M - I = [ nz - 1, n_x           ]
         [ n_x,    -nz - 1 ]

So the matrix equation is:

(nz -1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-nz -1) b = 0

Where the eigenvector is [a; b]. Let's write the first equation:

(nz -1) a + n_x b = 0 → (1 - nz) a = n_x b → a = (n_x / (1 - nz)) b

So any eigenvector can be written in terms of b. Let me let b = 1 (for simplicity, we can scale later), then a = n_x/(1 - nz).

Wait, but we have to ensure that the second equation is satisfied. Let's substitute a from the first equation into the second.

The second equation is:

n_x a + (-nz -1) b = 0 → n_x (n_x/(1 - nz)) ) + (-nz -1) * 1 = 0.

Let me compute that:

n_x² / (1 - nz) - (nz +1) = 0 → Multiply both sides by (1 - nz):

n_x² - (nz +1)(1 - nz) ) = 0.

Expanding (nz +1)(1 -nz) → 1*(1 -nz) +nz*(1 -nz) → 1 - nz + nz - nz² → 1 - nz².

So we have:

n_x² - (1 - nz²) =0 → n_x² = 1 - nz² → But wait, since n is a unit vector, n_x² + nz² =1 → So n_x² = 1 - nz². So this equation is automatically satisfied. So the eigenvectors are a multiple of [n_x, 1 - nz ]^T.

Wait, because from a = n_x/(1 -nz) * b → let’s take b = (1 - nz ), then a = n_x.

Wait, let me clarify. Let me let b be (1 - nz ), then a would be n_x. So the eigenvector is [n_x, (1 - nz)]^T.

Wait, let me go back. From a = (n_x/(1 - nz)) * b. Let me choose b = (1 - nz), then a = n_x. So the eigenvector is [a; b] = [n_x; (1 - nz)]. But wait, that's not the only possibility. Because you can scale the vector by any non-zero scalar. So the eigenvector is proportional to [n_x; (1 - nz)].

But wait, let me double-check. Let me plug a = n_x and b = (1 - nz) into the matrix equation.

First equation: (nz -1) a + n_x b = (nz -1) *n_x + n_x (1 - nz) → n_x (nz -1 +1 -nz ) → n_x(0) =0. So yes, that works.

Second equation: n_x a + (-nz -1) b = n_x^2 + (-nz -1)(1 - nz) → n_x^2 + [ (-nz)(1 - nz) -1*(1 - nz) ]

Wait, but n_x^2 =1 - nz², so substituting:

(1 - nz²) + [ (-nz + nz²) - (1 - nz) ]

Simplify the terms inside the square brackets:

(-nz + nz² -1 + nz ) → (nz² -1 )

So the whole expression is:

(1 - nz²) + (nz² -1 ) = 0.

Yes, that's correct. So the vector [n_x, 1 - nz] is indeed an eigenvector for eigenvalue 1.

Now, the problem says the operator is P, and we want its eigenvector normalized. So the eigenvector we found is [n_x; (1 - nz)].

But wait, the problem is in terms of the direction vector n in the x-z plane. Let me parametrize n. Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, no. Wait, wait. The unit vector in spherical coordinates is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So φ must be 0 or π, but more generally, it's any angle where the y-component is zero. So let me think of n as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), because in the x-z plane, the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe θ is the angle in the x-z plane from the x-axis? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to parameterize the direction n as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the x-axis towards the z-axis. So that the unit vector is (cosθ, 0, sinθ). Then, n_x = cosθ, nz = sinθ.

Wait, let me confirm. If θ is the angle between the direction vector and the x-axis, then n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. Because, for θ=0, it's along x, for θ=90 degrees, it's along z.

So substituting into our eigenvector [n_x, 1 - nz ] → [cosθ, 1 - sinθ ].

Wait, but wait. The eigenvector is [n_x, 1 - nz] → [cosθ, 1 - sinθ].

But wait, the eigenvector I found is [n_x, 1 - nz], which would be [cosθ, 1 - sinθ]. But wait, that can't be right because in the case where the direction is along z, like θ=90 degrees, then n_x=0, nz=1. So the eigenvector would be [0, 0], which is not possible. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The eigenvector I found is [n_x, 1 - nz], but that's only correct when the denominator (1 - nz) is non-zero. If nz=1, then 1 -nz is zero, and the previous approach breaks down. So in the case when the direction is along z (nz=1, n_x=0), the eigenvector equation changes.

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of spherical coordinates. Let me consider that the direction n is given by an angle θ from the z-axis and φ=0 since it's in the x-z plane. So n_x = sinθ cosφ, but φ=0, so n_x = sinθ. Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should represent n as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so φ=0 or φ=π. So n becomes (sinθ * 1, 0, cosθ). Wait, that would make n_x = sinθ, nz = cosθ, but that could also work. Alternatively, perhaps it's more conventional to have n_x = cosθ when θ is measured from the x-axis. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express n in terms of its polar angles. Let me think: the direction n is in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle between the direction vector and the x-axis. So n_x = cosθ, nz = sinθ.

Wait, that makes sense. So when θ=0, the direction is along x, and when θ=90 degrees, it's along z.

So substituting back into the eigenvector components:

a = n_x = cosθ,

b = 1 - nz = 1 - sinθ.

So the eigenvector is [cosθ, 1 - sinθ ]^T.

Wait, but wait, when θ=90 degrees, the eigenvector becomes [0, 0]^T, which is impossible because eigenvectors can't be zero. So perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, wait, no. When n is along the z-axis (θ=90 degrees), then n_x=0, nz=1. In this case, the matrix M becomes [ [1,0], [0,-1] ] multiplied by (ħ/2). So the eigenvalues are ±1. The eigenvector for eigenvalue 1 would be [1,0]^T, and for -1, it's [0,1]^T.

So in that case, the eigenvector should be [1, 0], but according to our earlier expression, when θ=90 degrees, the eigenvector would be [0, 1 -1 ] → [0, 0], which is zero, which can't be. So something's wrong here. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Instead, perhaps I should diagonalize the matrix M.

Wait, the matrix M is [[nz, n_x], [n_x, -nz]]. The eigenvalues are found by solving det(M - λ I) = 0 → (nz - λ)(-nz - λ) - n_x² = 0 → (λ² - nz²) - n_x² = 0 → λ² = nz² + n_x². But since n_x² + nz² =1, then λ²=1, so λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So for the eigenvalue +1, we're looking for the eigenvector. So the eigenvector |ψ> satisfies (M - I)|ψ> =0.

So the matrix M-I is [[nz-1, n_x], [n_x, -nz -1]].

So the equations are:

(nz -1) a + n_x b =0 → (1 - nz) a = n_x b → a = (n_x/(1 - nz)) b.

But when nz=1, which is the case when the direction is along +z, then denominator becomes zero. So perhaps we should approach this case separately.

Alternatively, when nz=1, the matrix M is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. The eigenvalues are +1 and -1. The eigenvector for +1 is [1, 0], and for -1 it's [0,1].

Similarly, when nz=-1, the matrix M is [[-1,0],[0,1]], eigenvalues ±1, and the eigenvectors are [0,1] and [1,0], respectively.

So for the general case where nz is not ±1, let's proceed.

The eigenvector for +1 is [a, b]^T, where a = (n_x/(1 - nz)) b.

So let's express this as a vector proportional to [n_x, 1 - nz]^T, as I originally thought.

But when θ=90 degrees, nz=1, so 1 -nz=0, which makes the vector [n_x, 0]^T, but n_x=0 in that case. So that's [0, 0], which is invalid. Hence, I must have an error in my approach.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should express the eigenvector in terms that are valid for all cases except when 1 -nz is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the eigenvector as [n_x, 1 - nz]^T, but when nz=1, the vector becomes [0,0], which is impossible, so perhaps I should find another way.

Wait, maybe I should parameterize the eigenvector in terms of angles. Let me think about the components. The eigenvector is [a, b]^T.

When the operator M is expressed in terms of θ, perhaps I can find a way to write the eigenvector in terms of spherical coordinates.

Wait, another approach: the eigenvector of the spin operator along a direction n is given by the spinor:

|ψ> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]^T,

where θ is the angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle. But since our direction is in the x-z plane, φ=0 or π, so e^{iφ} would be ±1.

But wait, in our case, the direction is along (n_x, 0, n_z). So φ is 0, so e^{iφ}=1. So the spinor becomes [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, where θ is measured from the positive z-axis towards the x-axis.

Wait, but in our case, the operator is P, which is like the spin-1/2 operator. So the eigenvector for +ħ/2 along direction n would be given by this spinor.

So let's see the options:

Option C is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Option B is [ cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) ].

Wait, but if our spinor is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], then perhaps option C is the correct one. But wait, the question says the eigenvector is normalized, so we have to check.

Wait, the general spinor for spin-1/2 in direction (theta, phi) is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T. So in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi=0, so the spinor becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But wait, the problem says the operator is P, which is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the spinor should be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, where theta is the polar angle from the z-axis. So in this case, the eigenvector is as in option C.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

But wait, I thought the eigenvector would be (n_x, 1 - nz ), but according to the spinor approach, it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The operator P is given as a vector operator with components Px, Py, Pz. So the operator along n would be P·n = (n_x Px + n_z Pz ), since Py is zero.

The eigenvalue for this operator is ħ/2, so the eigenvector is the spin-up state along direction n.

The spin-up state is given by the spinor [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T, where theta is the angle from the z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi=0, so e^{i phi}=1.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But wait, let me calculate the norm. The norm squared is cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) )=1, so it's already normalized.

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches. So option C would be the correct answer.

But wait, the options in the problem include hbar factors. For example, option A has sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar. But in our case, the eigenvector is dimensionless because it's a spinor, so the components should be dimensionless. But the options have some with hbar, which is a unit of action, so perhaps that's a mistake. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, looking back, the problem says "what are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" So the eigenvector should be a unit vector, so the elements should be numbers without units, not multiplied by hbar. So in that case, options with hbar (options A, D) might not be correct, unless the question is considering the eigenvector multiplied by hbar, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, but perhaps the eigenvector is expressed in terms of some other variables.

Wait, let me think again. The eigenvector we're looking for is the spin-up state along direction n. So for a spin-1/2 particle, the spin-up state along direction n is given by:

|+n> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T,

where theta is the polar angle from the z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. Since n is in the x-z plane, phi=0, so the state becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which matches option C.

Looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Yes, that's the correct one.

Wait, but what about option B? Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which would be the spherical harmonics or something else, but for spin-1/2 it's theta/2.

So I think the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is constructed from its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \times 2$ matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the $y$-component of $\vec{n}$ is zero, and $\vec{P}$ simplifies to $P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.

### Step 1: Construct the matrix representation of $\vec{P}$
The components of $\vec{P}$ are:
- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli X matrix),
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli Z matrix).

Thus, the operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is:
\[
P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
P | \psi \rangle = \lambda | \psi \rangle,
\]
where $\lambda = +\hbar/2$ is the eigenvalue corresponding to the spin-up state. Substituting $P$, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, we get:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z - 1 & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for the eigenvector
From the first row of the matrix equation:
\[
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0 \implies a = \frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} b.
\]
Substituting $a$ into the second row:
\[
n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0,
\]
\[
n_x \left(\frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} b\right) + (-n_z - 1)b = 0.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_x^2}{1 - n_z} b - (n_z + 1)b = 0.
\]
Using $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$ (since $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector), we find:
\[
\frac{1 - n_z^2}{1 - n_z} b - (n_z + 1)b = 0 \implies (1 + n_z)b - (n_z + 1)b = 0,
\]
which is satisfied for all $b$. Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} n_x \\ 1 - n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The eigenvector must be normalized:
\[
\sqrt{|n_x|^2 + |1 - n_z|^2} = 1.
\]
Using $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$, we find:
\[
|n_x|^2 + |1 - n_z|^2 = n_x^2 + (1 - n_z)^2 = n_x^2 + 1 - 2n_z + n_z^2 = 1 - 2n_z + 1 = 2(1 - n_z).
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}} \begin{bmatrix} n_x \\ 1 - n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Express in terms of spherical coordinates
The direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane can be parameterized as:
\[
n_x = \sin\theta \cos\phi, \quad n_z = \cos\theta,
\]
where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis, and $\phi = 0$ (since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane). Substituting these into the eigenvector:
\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(1 - \cos\theta)}} \begin{bmatrix} \sin\theta \\ 1 - \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Using trigonometric identities:
\[
1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2), \quad \sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2),
\]
we find:
\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 6: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect since the eigenvector is dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Represents a general spherical harmonic but does not match the spin-1/2 eigenvector.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.
- **Option D**: Includes $\hbar$ and incorrect normalization factors.

The correct answer is **Option C**.

ANSWER: C
