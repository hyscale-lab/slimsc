Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles after a pion decays. The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a muon(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. The options are multiple-choice, so I need to calculate and pick the right one.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think for these kinds of problems, the neutrino's rest mass is considered negligible compared to the other particles. So, maybe the neutrino's energy can be approximated without considering its rest mass. Or do I need to think about that more?

Hmm, the pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum should still be zero because momentum is conserved. So, the momentum of the muon plus the momentum of the neutrino should equal zero. That means they have equal and opposite momenta. So, their magnitudes are the same, but directions are opposite.

Let me recall the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion since it's stationary. So total energy is m_pi c^2. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But the pion is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. So, the sum of the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be zero. That gives p_mu = -p_nu. Their magnitudes are equal, so p_mu = p_nu.

Wait, neutrinos are leptons, but their masses are super small. I think for the muon neutrino, the mass might be around a few eV, which is way smaller than the MeV scale of the muon and pion. So, probably, we can approximate the neutrino's mass as zero. So, its energy would be just pc, right? Because for a massless particle, E = pc.

So, if the neutrino's mass is negligible, then E_nu = p_nu c. And since p_mu = p_nu, then E_nu = p_mu c.

Now, the muon has rest mass, so its energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. Let me denote E_mu as the total energy of the muon. So, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

But wait, maybe I should think in terms of four-momentum. The pion's four-momentum is (m_pi c^2, 0), because it's at rest. The muon and neutrino's four-momenta must add up to that.

Let me write this out. Let's denote the neutrino's energy as E_nu and the muon's as E_mu. Their momenta are vectors, so their vector sum is zero. So, the magnitudes are the same, but their directions are opposite.

So, the total energy is E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

But E_pi = m_pi c^2.

Since E_nu is approximately p_nu c (since m_nu is negligible), and E_mu is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ), but since p_mu = p_nu, let's denote p as the magnitude of p_mu.

So, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

E_nu = p c

So, total energy: m_pi c^2 = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c

Let me set x = p c. Then, the equation becomes:

m_pi c^2 = sqrt( x^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + x

So, rearranging:

sqrt(x^2 + m_mu^2 c^4) = m_pi c^2 - x

Now, square both sides:

x^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 = (m_pi c^2 - x)^2

Expanding the right side: (m_pi c^2)^2 - 2 m_pi c^2 x + x^2

So,

x^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 = m_pi^2 c^4 - 2 m_pi c^2 x + x^2

Subtract x^2 from both sides:

m_mu^2 c^4 = m_pi^2 c^4 - 2 m_pi c^2 x

Bring the terms with x to one side:

2 m_pi c^2 x = m_pi^2 c^4 - m_mu^2 c^4

Factor c^4 on the right:

2 m_pi c^2 x = c^4 (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 )

Divide both sides by 2 m_pi c^2:

x = [ c^4 (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) ] / ( 2 m_pi c^2 )

Simplify:

x = [ c^2 (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) ] / (2 m_pi )

But x is p c, so p = x/(c) = [ c (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) ] / (2 m_pi )

Wait, let me compute this numerically. The masses are given in MeV/c^2, so m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c², m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c².

Compute m_pi^2 - m_mu^2:

m_pi^2 = (139.6)^2 = let's compute that.

139.6 squared:

139.6 * 139.6 ≈ (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 (MeV/c²)^2.

Similarly, m_mu^2 = (105.7)^2.

105.7^2: 100^2 = 10000, 5.7^2=32.49, 2*100*5.7=1140. So, 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49.

So, m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 (MeV/c²)^2.

Then, m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 = 8315.67 (MeV/c²)^2.

Wait, but in the equation for x, we have x = [ c^2 (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) ] / (2 m_pi )

Wait, but actually, the units would be:

(m_pi and m_mu are in MeV/c², so when squared, it's (MeV/c²)^2.)

Wait, but when you compute x, which is p c, the units should be MeV, since p is in MeV/c (because E=pc for neutrino), so p*c would be in MeV.

Let me double-check the calculation.

x = [ c^2 (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) ] / ( 2 m_pi )

Wait, but m_pi is in MeV/c², so m_pi^2 is (MeV/c²)^2.

c^2 multiplied by (MeV/c²)^2 gives (MeV)^2 / c^2 * c^2) = MeV².

Wait, no, let me think. c^2 has units (m/s)^2. But in particle physics, everything is often in natural units where c=1.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-express this without worrying about units, because in particle physics, energy and mass are related by E=mc², so we can work in units where c=1, so E in MeV, mass in MeV/c², etc.

Wait, maybe I should compute the numbers without worrying about units, just using the numerical values.

So,

x = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) ] / (2 m_pi )

Because when c=1, the terms are in MeV², etc. Let's compute that.

m_pi =139.6, m_mu=105.7.

m_pi^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16

m_mu^2=105.7^2=11172.49

m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 = 8315.67

Divide by (2 * m_pi) = 2 *139.6 = 279.2

So,

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30=8376, so 29 *279.2 = 8096.8. 8315.67 is 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87 higher.

218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783. So, around 29.783.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 279.2 * 29.783:

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Approximate: 279.2 * 30 = 8376. That's more than 8315.67, so subtract 279.2 * (30 - x) = 8315.67.

Compute 30 - x = 8315.67/(279.2) = let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me see, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376, minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8. 

So 29 would give 8096.8, which is less than 8315.67.

Difference is 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783. So, x ≈ 29.783.

So, x ≈29.783 MeV.

Wait, but x is p c, so p = x / c. But in natural units, c=1, so p = x =29.783 MeV/c.

Wait, no, wait. No, in the equation x is in units where c is 1, so x is in MeV.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with units. Let me think again.

Wait, in the equation, x = p c. So, if x is in MeV, then p would be in MeV/c.

But since we're working in units where c=1, perhaps the units are handled correctly.

Wait, no, perhaps I should have considered the units earlier. Let me clarify.

The mass energy is m c², so m_pi c² is 139.6 MeV, m_mu c² is 105.7 MeV.

So, when I compute x = [c² (m_pi² - m_mu²)] / (2 m_pi )

Wait, no, because m_pi and m_mu are in MeV/c². So, m_pi² would be (MeV/c²)^2, and multiplying by c^4 (since x is p c, which has units MeV) would give:

Wait, perhaps I should recompute with units.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating too much. Let me proceed numerically.

So, x ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.783 MeV.

So, x is approximately 29.783 MeV.

So, neutrino's energy is E_nu = x =29.783 MeV. Wait, but that can't be right because the muon's energy would be sqrt( x^2 + m_mu^2 ), which would be sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Wait, 29.783 squared is about 886, and 105.7 squared is about 11172.49. So, sqrt( 886 + 11172 ) ≈ sqrt(12058) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

So, the muon's energy is about 109.8 MeV, neutrino's is 29.783 MeV. So, total energy would be 109.8 +29.783 ≈ 139.583 MeV, which is about m_pi c² (139.6), so that checks out.

So, the muon's kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c². Because E_mu is the total energy, which includes rest mass. So, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c².

E_mu is 109.8 MeV, m_mu c^2 is 105.7 MeV. So, KE_mu is 109.8 - 105.7 =4.1 MeV.

Wait, that's about 4.1 MeV.

Now, the neutrino's energy is E_nu =29.783 MeV. Since its rest mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is the same as its total energy, so KE_nu ≈ 29.783 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, one of them is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which is option D.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV

B) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV

C) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV

D)4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV

So, our calculation gives KE_mu ≈4.1 MeV, KE_nu≈29.8 MeV. So that's option D.

But wait, let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, when I calculated x, I got approximately 29.783 MeV. So, E_nu is 29.783, which is approximately 29.8 MeV. The muon's KE is around 4.1 MeV.

So, option D matches this.

But wait, wait, could there be a mistake in the calculation of x?

Let me recalculate x more accurately.

m_pi =139.6, m_mu=105.7.

m_pi^2 =139.6 *139.6.

Let me compute 139.6^2 accurately.

139.6 * 139.6:

= (140 -0.4)^2

=140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2

=19600 - 112 +0.16 → 19600-112=19488, +0.16=19488.16.

m_mu^2 =105.7^2.

105.7 *105.7:

Compute 105*105=11025.

But 105.7 is 105 +0.7. So,

(105 +0.7)^2 =105² + 2*105*0.7 +0.7^2.

105^2=11025.

2*105*0.7=210*0.7=147.

0.7^2=0.49.

So, 11025 + 147=11172 +0.49=11172.49.

So, m_pi^2 -m_mu^2=19488.16 - 11172.49 =8315.67.

Then, 8315.67 / (2 *139.6 ) =8315.67 /279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 /279.2.

Compute 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376; minus 279.2 →8376-279.2=8096.8.

8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

So, 218.87 /279.2 →approx 0.783.

So, 29.783.

Hmm, so x=29.783 MeV.

So, E_nu=29.783 MeV, E_mu= sqrt(29.783^2 +105.7^2).

29.783^2 ≈ 886.9 (because 30^2=900, 30^2 =900; 29.78^2≈ (30-0.22)^2=900 -2*30*0.22 +0.0484=900-13.2 +0.0484=886.8484).

105.7^2=11172.49.

Sum:886.8484 +11172.49≈12059.3384.

Square root of 12059.3384 is approximately sqrt(12059.3384). Let me compute that.

What's 109.8^2? 109.8 *109.8= (110 -0.2)^2=12100 - 44 +0.04=12056.04.

Hmm, 109.8^2=12056.04, which is less than 12059.3384.

Next, compute 109.8^2=12056.04.

Difference:12059.3384 -12056.04=3.2984.

So, (109.8 + delta)^2 = 12056.04 + 2*109.8 *delta +delta^2 =12059.3384.

Assume delta is small, delta^2 negligible.

So, 2*109.8 * delta ≈3.2984 → 219.6 *delta ≈3.2984 → delta≈3.2984/219.6≈0.015.

So, E_mu≈109.8 +0.015=109.815 MeV.

So, KE_mu= E_mu - m_mu c²=109.815 -105.7=4.115 MeV ≈4.12 MeV.

E_nu=29.783 MeV.

So, the KE of the muon is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.783 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

So, the answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion, \( \pi^+ \), into a muon, \( \mu^+ \), and a neutrino, \( \nu \). The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). The neutrino's rest mass is negligible compared to the other particles.

### Key Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved. Initially, the pion is at rest, so its total energy is its rest energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino:
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. This means the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal, but their directions are opposite:
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

### Energy of the Neutrino
The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its total energy is equal to its momentum times the speed of light:
\[
E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c.
\]

### Energy of the Muon
The muon's total energy is the sum of its rest energy and its kinetic energy:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(p_{\mu^+} c)^2 + (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2}.
\]
Since \( p_{\mu^+} = p_{\nu} \), we denote the magnitude of the momentum as \( p \). Thus:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2}.
\]

### Solving for \( p \)
Using energy conservation:
\[
m_{\pi^+} c^2 = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}.
\]
Substituting \( E_{\mu^+} \) and \( E_{\nu} \):
\[
m_{\pi^+} c^2 = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2} + p c.
\]
Let \( x = p c \). Then:
\[
m_{\pi^+} c^2 = \sqrt{x^2 + (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2} + x.
\]
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 - x,
\]
\[
x^2 + (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2 = (m_{\pi^+} c^2 - x)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
x^2 + (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2 = (m_{\pi^+} c^2)^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} c^2 x + x^2.
\]
Canceling \( x^2 \) and solving for \( x \):
\[
2 m_{\pi^+} c^2 x = (m_{\pi^+} c^2)^2 - (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2,
\]
\[
x = \frac{(m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2)}{2 m_{\pi^+}}.
\]

### Numerical Calculation
Substitute \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad m_{\mu^+}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.783 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus:
- The neutrino's energy is \( E_{\nu} = x = 29.783 \, \text{MeV} \).
- The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{x^2 + (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2} = \sqrt{29.783^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]
\[
29.783^2 \approx 886.9, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49, \quad E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{886.9 + 11172.49} \approx \sqrt{12059.39} \approx 109.815 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} c^2 = 109.815 - 105.7 \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: D**
