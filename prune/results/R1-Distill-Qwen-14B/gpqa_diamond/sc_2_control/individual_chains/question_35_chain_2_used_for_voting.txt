Okay, so I have this question about angular momentum operators and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum in quantum mechanics is represented by matrices, and eigenvalues come into play when you have operators like Ay.

Wait, the problem says that Ay is equal to c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is given as h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), the second row is (i, 0). So let me write that down.

So S looks like this:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Right, and c is h/(4π). So Ay = c * S. That means each element of S is multiplied by c. So Ay would be:
[ 0* c   (-i)*c ]
[ i*c    0 ].

Which simplifies to:
[ 0   (-i c) ]
[ i c   0 ]

Hmm, now I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay. The eigenvalues satisfy the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So setting up the matrix (Ay - a I):

[ -a    (-i c) ]
[ i c    -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (i c)(-i c) = a² - (i c)(-i c).

Wait, (i c)(-i c) is equal to (i * (-i)) * c². i*(-i) is (i^2)*(-1) = (-1)*(-1) = 1. Because i times -i is -(i^2) which is -( -1) = 1. So (i c)(-i c) = (1) * c² = c².

So determinant equation is a² - c² = 0. So a² = c² → a = ±c.

Oh wait, c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers? Because c is real. So the eigenvalues are purely real. Wait, but wait. Because S is a Hermitian matrix? Let me think: the matrix S is equal to [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me check if S is Hermitian. A matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose.

The conjugate transpose of S would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Which is the same as S because the first row becomes [0, i], which is the same as the second row of S but transposed. Wait, no: S is [[0, -i],[i,0]], its conjugate transpose would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as S because S's second row is [i, 0], so the conjugate transpose of the second row is [0, i]. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps S is anti-Hermitian? Because S† = -S? Let's see: S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. The negative of S is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is indeed S†. So S is anti-Hermitian. So S is i times Hermitian? Not sure, but what matters is that Ay = c * S. Since c is real, and if S is anti-Hermitian, then Ay is anti-Hermitian as well. Anti-Hermitian operators have purely imaginary eigenvalues, but wait, that's conflicting with what I found earlier.

Wait a second, earlier when I calculated the eigenvalues, I got a = ±c, which are real. But if Ay is anti-Hermitian, then Ay = i H, where H is Hermitian. So the eigenvalues would be purely imaginary. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-express Ay. Since S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], and c is h/(4π), then Ay is:

( h/(4π) ) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]].

Which is (h/(4π)) * S.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the determinant correctly. Let me re-derive the characteristic equation. The matrix Ay - a I is:

[ -a     (-i c) ]
[ i c    -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - (-i c)(i c). Let me compute (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c². (-i)(i) is -(i²) = -(-1) = 1. So it's (1) c² = c².

Wait, so the determinant is a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c. So a is real. So the eigenvalues are real. But if Ay is anti-Hermitian, eigenvalues should be imaginary. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in thinking S is anti-Hermitian. Let me check S again.

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The conjugate transpose S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. So S† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]].

Comparing to S, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], it's clear that S† is the same as the negative of S. Because:

If S is [[A, B],[C, D]], then -S is [[-A, -B], [-C, -D]]. So S† should be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is equal to -S. Because -S is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. So yes, S† = -S, so S is anti-Hermitian. Therefore, Ay = c S is anti-Hermitian because c is real. So Ay is anti-Hermitian, meaning its eigenvalues are purely imaginary.

But according to the characteristic equation, the eigenvalues are a = ±c, which are real. That's a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Let me think again. Since S is anti-Hermitian, then Ay is anti-Hermitian (because c is real). So Ay must have purely imaginary eigenvalues. Therefore, my earlier calculation must have an error.

Alternatively, perhaps S is not anti-Hermitian. Let me re-calculate S†. S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The conjugate transpose would be elements (1,2) become (2,1), and (2,1) become (1,2), and each element is conjugated. So (1,2) is -i, so the conjugate is i, so S† would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Comparing to S, S is [[0, -i],[i,0]]. So S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is equal to -S because -S is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. So yes, S† = -S, confirming that S is anti-Hermitian.

Therefore, Ay must have eigenvalues that are purely imaginary. So the earlier conclusion that a^2 = c^2 leading to real a must be wrong. So where did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that when dealing with 2x2 matrices, the trace is the sum of diagonal elements, and determinant is the product. Let's recompute the characteristic equation.

The matrix Ay - a I is:

[ -a          (-i c) ]
[ i c         -a ]

The determinant is ( (-a)(-a) ) - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Wait, (-i c) * (i c) = (-i)(i) c^2 = (i^2) c^2 = (-1)c^2. So the determinant is a² - ( (-1) c² ) = a² + c².

Wait, that's different. Oh! Because the determinant is (Ay - a I)_{11} * (Ay - a I)_{22} - (Ay - a I)_{12} (Ay - a I)_{21}.

So:

a² + c² = 0 → a² = -c² → a = ±i c.

Ah! That's it. So the eigenvalues are a = i c and a = -i c. So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, which makes sense for an anti-Hermitian operator.

So c is h/(4π). So a = ±i h/(4π). Wait, but the options don't seem to have this. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, because my a is purely imaginary, but the real parts here are non-zero.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That depends on c's value. c = h/(4π), which is not necessarily 1/2 or 1. Hmm, perhaps if h is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626e-34 J s, but the options are using c as a unit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the units wrong, but the question seems to be in a more abstract math context.

Wait, perhaps the question uses ħ instead of h? Because in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum is often expressed in terms of ħ. Wait, but the question says c = h/(4π). Oh, because ħ = h/(2π), so c would be (h)/(4π) = ħ / 2.

But regardless, the eigenvalues are ±i c, which are ±i h/(4π). So the eigenvalues have zero real parts and imaginary parts ±h/(4π). So their imaginary parts are ±c, which is h/(4π). But looking back at the options, which one matches this?

Option B) says the imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't align with our eigenvalues unless c is 1/2. Let me see, if c = 1/2, then a = ±i/2, so imaginary parts are ±1/2. But in our case, c is h/(4π), which is not necessarily 1/2 unless perhaps we are using units where h=2π. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not considering the units, just the mathematical structure. But looking at the options, none seem to directly match. Let me see what's given.

Wait, the question states that Ay = c·S, and S is given. So perhaps I should compute the eigenvalues directly without worrying about the Hermiticity.

So, the matrix Ay is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]. To find the eigenvalues, as I did, I set up the equation:

| Ay - a I | = 0 → determinant is a² + c² = 0.

So a^2 = -c² → a = ±i c. Thus, the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, a = i c and a = -i c.

The real parts are zero, and the imaginary parts are c and -c. So for each eigenvalue, the real part is zero and the imaginary part is ±c.

Looking at the options, which one aligns with this?

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts are ±h/(4π). Wait, 2πh would be a large value, but our c is h/(4π). So 2πh = 8π² c. So it's not matching.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That would require c = 1/2. Unless in some unit system, but the question doesn't specify that. So doesn't seem correct.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Angular momentum components usually don't share eigenfunctions unless they commute. [Ay, Az] = iħ A something, so they don't commute, so eigenfunctions of Ay aren't eigenfunctions of Az. But A² commutes with all components, so eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So C says that the eigenfunction of Ay is also eigenfunction of A², which is correct. So C might be the correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, I'm not sure what D is saying. The basis functions are the eigenvectors? Or are the eigenfunctions the basis for Ay? I think the statement is saying that the eigenvectors of Ay form a basis for the space, which they do for 2x2 matrices since they have two eigenvectors (assuming they're distinct). So D might be a correct statement.

But I need to focus on which statement is correct during the calculation.

Now, looking back at the options, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So from the eigenvalues, the real parts are zero, and the imaginary parts are ±c. So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So looking at the options, none of the options A or B are correct in this case.

Looking at option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with Ay, so its eigenfunctions can be shared. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions. Well, any set of eigenvectors for a 2x2 matrix (assuming they're linearly independent) form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the options are about which statements are correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is C or D.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the structure of the matrix Ay. It is a 2x2 matrix, and we're finding its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Since it's a 2x2, it should have two eigenvalues (each with algebraic multiplicity 1) and the eigenvectors should form a basis.

So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I think that's correct because two eigenvectors (for a 2x2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues) are linearly independent, hence forming a basis.

But wait, in this case, the eigenvalues are i c and -i c, which are distinct (assuming c ≠0). So the eigenvectors are two in number and linearly independent, so they form a basis. So D is correct.

But the question is, during the calculation of Ay's eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

So, which of the options is correct. Now, let's go through each option:

A) Im eigenvalue ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, because the eigenvalues are purely imaginary.

B) Im ±1/2, real ±1. Not unless c=1/2. But our c is h/(4π), which isn't 1/2 unless h= 2π².

C) The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so same eigenfunctions. But Az doesn't commute, so eigenfunctions are different.

D) The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That's correct because for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (if distinct) form a basis.

So, looking at the options, both C and D are correct statements. But I need to find which one is correct according to the options.

Wait, the question is which statement will I consider to be correct during the calculation.

If I'm calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, which of the statements is correct.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, it commutes with Ay, so yes, the eigenfunctions for Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But they are not eigenfunctions of Az, because [Ay, Az] ≠0.

So statement C is correct.

Option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, the matrix operator's basis functions are the eigenvectors. So if you have a complete set of eigenvectors, they form a basis. So D is correct.

But the options are presented as separate statements, so which one is correct?

The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

If I found that eigenvalues are purely imaginary, then options A and B are incorrect. So the correct statements must be C or D.

Now, looking back at the problem statement, the matrix operator Ay is given, and during the calculation, which statement is correct.

So, statement D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, which is 2D, D is correct.

But let me think again: the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

If I'm calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Option C: the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A². That is correct because A² commutes with Ay.

Option D: the eigenfunctions form the basis. That's also correct because they are two eigenvectors in 2D space.

So both C and D are correct statements.

But looking at the options, the correct answer is either C or D.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D states that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the matrix operator is a 2x2 matrix, and its eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct.

So, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, which of the options is correct.

Wait, the options are:

A) The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh, real ±h/4π. No, because eigenvalues are purely imaginary.

B) Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Again, only if c=1/2, which is not the case.

C) Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Correct.

D) Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. Correct.

So, both C and D are correct.

But looking at the problem, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, only one can be the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is which statement is correct in the context of the calculation. So perhaps statement D is correct because when you diagonalize Ay, the eigenvectors form the basis.

But in any case, the problem is multiple choice, so I need to choose the correct option.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the options. Let me look for any possible clues.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, and since [A², Ay] =0, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So that's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

That is correct because the eigenvectors of Ay (if they are distinct) form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct.

So both C and D are correct statements. But looking at the options, the question is which statement is correct.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is because in 2x2, the eigenvectors might not always form a basis if the eigenvalues are the same (i.e., repeated eigenvalues). But in this case, the eigenvalues are i c and -i c, which are distinct (as long as c is not zero, which it isn't). So the eigenvectors are distinct and hence form a basis.

So both C and D are correct. But the options don't say 'which are correct', they are individual options.

Wait, looking at the problem statement, the options are:

A), B), C), D).

I have to choose which is correct.

Since the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Another thought: the matrix Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and every 2x2 matrix has a basis of eigenvectors, so D is correct.

So the possible correct options are C and D.

But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Looking back at the problem statement, the question is asking which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, you find that Ay has purely imaginary eigenvalues, so the real parts are zero, which would eliminate options A and B.

So statements A and B are incorrect.

Now, between C and D, both are correct, but the question only allows one correct answer. So perhaps I need to read the options again.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So that's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay. Which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So perhaps both C and D are correct statements, but the options may have only one correct.

Wait, if I look at the options, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Because the question is about which statement is true during the calculation. So in the process of finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which of the statements is correct. The fact that the eigenfunctions form a basis (D) is a general property, but perhaps the correct option is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, as the question is about the process of calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because eigenfunctions of any matrix with distinct eigenvalues form a basis.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

This is correct because A² commutes with Ay, so their eigenfunctions are the same. But Az doesn't commute, so the eigenfunctions are different.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Which is correct because they form a basis.

So both are correct statements. But the options are presented as separate choices, so the correct answer must be either C or D.

But perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the question is about which statement is considered correct during the calculation, which would be the fact that the eigenfunctions are shared with A² but not with Az.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is D.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Without further information, perhaps the intended correct answer is C.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the calculation leads to the conclusion that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az, which is statement C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, which is a characteristic of anti-Hermitian operators. So the real parts are zero. So the eigenvalues have no real parts.

Looking at the options, which ones are consistent with this.

Option A says real parts are ±h/(4π), which is c. So real parts non-zero → incorrect.

Option B: real parts ±1 → non-zero → incorrect.

So only options C and D are possible.

So given the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, and assuming the eigenvectors form a basis, both C and D are correct statements. But since the question provides only one correct option, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps statement D is not correct. Because the matrix operator's basis functions are the eigenvectors, but perhaps the question is referring to the matrix representation. Hmmm.

Wait, the question says in option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I think that's correct, as the eigenvectors form the basis for the space on which the operator acts.

So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow that. So maybe the correct option is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the problem again.

The matrix is 2x2, and it's anti-Hermitian, so eigenvalues are purely imaginary. The eigenfunctions are orthogonal and can form a basis. So both C and D seem correct.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is C, because it addresses the relationship between Ay and A².

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me review the problem again.

The options are:

A) Imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). → No, eigenvalues are purely imaginary.

B) Imaginary ±1/2, real ±1 → No.

C) Eigenfunctions φ of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. → Yes.

D) Eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. → Yes.

So, both C and D are correct. But in a multiple-choice question, only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But in the problem statement, the options are presented as separate, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, I think the correct answer is C. Because the question is about the process of calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and which statement is correct during that process. So the correct statement is that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That would be a correct conclusion during the calculation.

So I'm going to go with option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix given by:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( A_y \) is anti-Hermitian because \( S \) is anti-Hermitian, and \( c \) is real. Anti-Hermitian operators have purely imaginary eigenvalues.
   - The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues are \( a = \pm i c \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \). Thus, the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, with no real parts.

2. **Critical Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, and their imaginary parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 2\pi h \).
   - **Option B:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect unless \( c = \frac{1}{2} \), which is not the case here since \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so their eigenfunctions are shared. However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are distinct.
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is correct because the eigenvectors of a 2×2 matrix with distinct eigenvalues (as in this case) form a basis for the vector space.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Both options C and D are correct. However, the question asks for the statement that is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Option C is more relevant to the calculation process, as it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \), which is a key aspect of angular momentum operator properties.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
