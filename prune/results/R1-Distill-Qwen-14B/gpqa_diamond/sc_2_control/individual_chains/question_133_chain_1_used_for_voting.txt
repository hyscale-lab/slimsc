Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with all these phosphate calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with 200 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, HPO₄³⁻, in this solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, and the Ka values for H₃PO₄ are given as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, orthophosphate is HPO₄³⁻. Wait, but I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. So depending on the solution's pH, the dominant species would change. Since we're mixing a diprotic and a triprotic phosphate salt, maybe the solution is buffered somewhere between the second and third dissociations.

Let me think: the salts are KH₂PO₄ (which is H₂PO₄⁻ when dissolved) and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (which gives HPO₄²⁻ when dissolved). Wait, no, actually, KH₂PO4 dissociates into K+ and H₂PO4⁻. Similarly, Na₂HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4²⁻. So when these are in solution, they contribute H₂PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ ions.

But the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO4³⁻. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the phosphate ion can have different charges depending on how many protons are attached. 

H3PO4 is triprotic. So:

1. H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4⁻ (Ka1)
2. H2PO4⁻ → H+ + HPO4²⁻ (Ka2)
3. HPO4²⁻ → H+ + PO4³⁻ (Ka3)

So, HPO4²⁻ is the dihydrogen phosphate, and PO4³⁻ is the phosphate ion. Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate, which I think is H3PO4 itself, but no, in solution, it would be in various forms. Wait, no, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, which is PO4³⁻. Alternatively, some sources might refer to HPO4²⁻ as orthophosphate. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I should look up: what is orthophosphate? Oh, right, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4³⁻. Or wait, no, no, wait. Let me think about it. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. So the orthophosphate ion is the conjugate base. So when all three protons are lost, you get PO4³⁻. But wait, in solution, the species present would be a mix of H3PO4, H2PO4⁻, HPO4²⁻, and PO4³⁻, depending on pH.

Wait, but in this problem, we're adding KH₂PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So when these dissolve, what do they give?

KH₂PO4 → K+ + H2PO4⁻.

Na2HPO4 → 2 Na+ + HPO4²⁻. Because the formula is Na2HPO4, so each unit gives HPO4²⁻.

Wait, so the solution has H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. So what about the orthophosphate ions? Are they present here?

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO4²⁻. Or wait, maybe they're referring to PO4³⁻. Hmm, the term is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, perhaps the problem defines orthophosphate as HPO4³⁻, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, I think I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible phosphate species in the buffer solution made by mixing H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. When you mix a weak acid (H2PO4⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO4²⁻), you create a buffer solution. The pH will be determined by the pKa2 of H3PO4, which is around 7.2, because Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is about 7.2.

In this buffer, the primary species are H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. So the concentration of HPO4²⁻ would be in solution, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4²⁻, which is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, not the monohydrogen or trihydrogen forms.

Wait, but the options are all around 1e-7 M, which is lower than the concentrations I would expect just from the salts. So maybe there's some dissociation involved.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step.

First, let's calculate the concentrations of each salt in the solution.

The volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

Molarity is moles per liter.

So for KH₂PO4:

Mass = 1.00 g. Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007337 mol.

So concentration in 0.2 L is 0.007337 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036685 M.

Similarly for Na2HPO4·2H2O:

Mass = 1.00 g. Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005607 mol.

Concentration is 0.005607 / 0.2 ≈ 0.028035 M.

So in solution, we have:

[H2PO4⁻] = 0.036685 M

[HPO4²⁻] = 0.028035 M

Now, considering that H2PO4⁻ can donate another H+ to become HPO4²⁻, and HPO4²⁻ can donate another to become PO4³⁻.

But given that the solution is a mix of H2PO4⁻ (weak acid) and HPO4²⁻ (its conjugate base), the pH will be around pKa2.

So the buffer equation applies here, using Ka2.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA]).

Here, HA is H2PO4⁻, and A- is HPO4²⁻.

So pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻])

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) = about 7.208.

So:

pH = 7.208 + log(0.028035 / 0.036685)

Calculate that ratio: 0.028035 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.765.

Log(0.765) is approximately -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.115 ≈ 7.093.

Now, from this pH, we can find the concentration of HPO4²⁻ and H2PO4⁻ and PO4³⁻.

Wait, but wait, what about the third dissociation? The solution's pH is about 7.1, which is just below pKa2 (7.208), so the solution is slightly acidic. But since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, the concentration of PO4³⁻ would be very low. So we can probably ignore PO4³⁻ compared to HPO4²⁻.

But the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate refers to PO4³⁻, then its concentration would be very low. Alternatively, if orthophosphate refers to HPO4²⁻, then it's already present at 0.028 M.

But the options are in the order of 1e-7 M, which is way lower than 0.028 M. So that can't be the case. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the dissociation from HPO4²⁻ to PO4³⁻. So, in the solution, some of the HPO4²⁻ will dissociate into PO4³⁻. The amount depends on the pH and Ka3.

Because the solution's pH is around 7.09, which is just below pKa2 (7.208), but let's see about the HPO4²⁻ dissociating into PO4³⁻.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2. So the concentration of PO4³⁻ would be very low.

So, let's model this. Let me denote:

At equilibrium, [H+] = 1e-7.09 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

We can model the dissociation of HPO4²⁻:

HPO4²⁻ ↔ H+ + PO4³⁻.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12 = [H+][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]

We can rearrange to [PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻]) / [H+]

We know [HPO4²⁻] is approximately 0.028035 M, but wait, no, because some of it dissociates into PO4³⁻. But since Ka3 is so small, the change would be negligible.

Wait, but let's think. The initial concentration of HPO4²⁻ is 0.028035 M. Let x be the concentration that dissociates into PO4³⁻. Then:

[H+ added from PO4³⁻ dissociation] is negligible compared to the H+ from the buffer.

So,

Ka3 = (x * [H+]) / (0.028035 - x) ≈ (x * [H+]) / 0.028035

Because x is so small compared to 0.028 M.

So x = (Ka3 * 0.028035) / [H+]

We have Ka3 = 1.8e-12, [H+] = 8.23e-8.

So x = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.23e-8)

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 ≈ 5.0463e-14.

Divide by 8.23e-8: 5.0463e-14 / 8.23e-8 ≈ 6.13e-7.

So [PO4³⁻] = x ≈ 6.13e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm, but let me double-check.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the value of [H+].

Wait, pH is 7.093, so [H+] = 10^(-7.093) = approximately 8.23e-8 M.

So plugging the numbers:

x = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / 8.23e-8

Let me compute this accurately:

1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = 5.0463e-14.

5.0463e-14 / 8.23e-8 = (5.0463 / 8.23) * 1e-6 = approx 0.613 * 1e-6 = 6.13e-7.

So x ≈ 6.13e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. But let's think about the initial assumption that [HPO4²⁻] is approximately 0.028 M. But wait, some of it would have dissociated into H2PO4⁻, right? No, wait, no, KH2PO4 gives H2PO4⁻, and Na2HPO4 gives HPO4²⁻. So the HPO4²⁻ is a base, and in the buffer, it's the conjugate base of H2PO4⁻. So in the solution, HPO4²⁻ can act as a base or as an acid.

Wait, but perhaps the initial assumption ignores activity coefficients and other factors, but given the problem, we proceed with the approximation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps we should calculate the exact concentrations considering the buffer.

Wait, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. So the pH is determined by their concentrations.

But to find the concentration of PO4³⁻, which is HPO4²⁻ losing a proton, I can use the Ka3 expression.

So [PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻]) / [H+].

We already have [HPO4²⁻] as 0.028035 M, and [H+] as 8.23e-8 M.

So:

[PO4³⁻] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.23e-8)

As before, which gives approx 6.13e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 6.24e-7 M

Option D) 3.97e-7 M

Hmm, so 6.13 is closest to 6.24e-7.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the exact numbers.

Compute 1.8e-12 * 0.028035:

1.8 * 0.028035 = 0.050463, so 0.050463e-12 = 5.0463e-14.

Now, 5.0463e-14 divided by 8.23e-8.

5.0463 / 8.23 = approximately 0.613.

So 0.613e-6 = 6.13e-7.

So 6.13e-7 is approximately 6.1e-7, which is close to option A (6.24e-7). Let me see why the discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the exact pH is not 7.093. Let me recalculate the pH more precisely.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻])

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) = approximately 7.208.

The ratio [HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻] is 0.028035 / 0.036685.

Let me compute that accurately:

0.028035 / 0.036685 = (28035 / 36685) ≈ 0.76545.

Log(0.76545) is approximately -0.115.

So pH = 7.208 - 0.115 = 7.093.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.093) = ?

Calculate 10^(-7.093):

10^0.907 ≈ 8.17 (since 10^0.9 ≈7.94, 10^0.907≈8.17 )

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 10^(-7.093) is 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.877 ≈ 8.77e-8.

Wait, let me compute it precisely. The exponent is -7.093.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093).

10^(-0.093) is approximately 10^(-0.1) = 0.794. But more accurately:

Using logarithm tables or natural exponentials:

ln(10^0.093) = 0.093 * ln(10) ≈ 0.093 * 2.3026 ≈ 0.2142.

So 10^0.093 = e^0.2142 ≈ 1 + 0.2142 + (0.2142^2)/2 + (0.2142^3)/6 ≈ 1.237.

So 10^(-0.093) = 1 / 1.237 ≈ 0.808.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.808 ≈ 8.08e-8 M.

So plugging back into [PO4³⁻] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.08e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = 5.0463e-14.

Denominator: 8.08e-8.

So 5.0463e-14 / 8.08e-8 = (5.0463 /8.08) * 1e-6.

5.0463 /8.08 ≈ 0.6248.

So 0.6248e-6 = 6.248e-7 M.

Ah, so approximately 6.25e-7 M.

Which is very close to option A, which is 6.24e-7 M.

So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we start by analyzing the given data. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (molar mass = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (molar mass = 177.99 g/mol) in a total volume of 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociation of these salts contributes H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions, respectively. The solution is buffered between H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with the pH determined by the second dissociation constant of H₃PO₄, Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸.

### Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007337 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = \( \frac{0.007337}{0.2} \approx 0.036685 \, \text{M} \).  

- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005607 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = \( \frac{0.005607}{0.2} \approx 0.028035 \, \text{M} \).  

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the buffer
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
\]
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = \log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log \left( \frac{0.028035}{0.036685} \right)
\]
\[
\frac{0.028035}{0.036685} \approx 0.765, \quad \log(0.765) \approx -0.115
\]
\[
\text{pH} \approx 7.208 - 0.115 = 7.093
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻
The third dissociation of H₃PO₄ is governed by \( \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \):  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]
Rearranging for \( [\text{PO₄³⁻}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]
From the pH, \( [\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.08 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \).  
Substitute values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028035)}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] \approx \frac{5.0463 \times 10^{-14}}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of \( \text{PO₄³⁻} \) is approximately \( 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option A (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).

**Answer: A**
