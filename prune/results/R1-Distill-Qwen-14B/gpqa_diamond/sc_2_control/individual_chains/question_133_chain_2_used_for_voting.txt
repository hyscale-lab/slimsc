Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molar masses are given: KH₂PO₄ is 136.09 g/mol and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution. The Ka values for H₃PO₄ are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm. Orthophosphate ions are PO₄³- right? So the concentration of PO₄³- in solution.

I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. The species can be H₃PO₄, H₂PO₄⁻, HPO₄²⁻, and PO₄³⁻. Since the problem is about orthophosphate, which is PO₄³-, I need to find how much of that is present.

Wait, but the initial substances are KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. So they must dissociate in solution. Let's think about what each of these salts does.

KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K+ and H₂PO₄⁻. So each mole of KH₂PO₄ gives one mole of H₂PO₄⁻.

Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, when dissolved, probably gives Na+ and HPO₄²⁻. Let me confirm: The formula is Na₂HPO₄, so yes, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO₄²⁻.

So in solution, we have H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions. But wait, phosphate can undergo hydrolysis and shift between these species based on the pH. So the presence of both might affect the pH, which in turn affects the speciation of phosphate.

But how do I find the concentration of PO₄³-? I think I need to consider the equilibrium between HPO₄²⁻ and PO₄³-.

The relevant equilibrium would be HPO₄²- ↔ H+ + PO₄³-.

But wait, looking at the Ka values, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4⁻, with Ka1 = 7.5e-3.

The second dissociation is H2PO4⁻ → H+ + HPO4²⁻, Ka2 =6.2e-8.

The third is HPO4²⁻ → H+ + PO4³⁻, Ka3=1.8e-12.

Wait, so that means the HPO4²- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-.

So the concentration of PO4^3- will depend on the concentration of HPO4^2- and the pH of the solution.

But wait, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the salts. So the pH will determine the ratio of these ions and how much of each converts to the other.

So I think this is a buffer solution problem, because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, but in this case, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in solution. So H2PO4^- can act as a weak acid (since it can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-), and HPO4^2- can act as a weak base (since it can gain a proton to become H2PO4^-).

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of the HPO4²⁻ as the acid and PO4³⁻ as the conjugate base? Or vice versa.

Wait, the third dissociation is HPO4²- ↔ H+ + PO4³-. So HPO4²- is acting as an acid here, donating a proton to become PO4³-.

So the Ka3 is 1.8e-12. That's a very small Ka, so PO4³- will be in low concentration.

But how does that help me? I need to find the concentration of PO4³-.

Wait, but in this solution, the initial phosphate species are H2PO4^- and HPO4²-.

So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- which can interconvert based on pH. So the concentration of PO4^3- will be determined by the pH and the concentrations of HPO4^2-.

So perhaps the solution's pH can be determined from the buffer system of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but what buffer? Because both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can act as acids and bases. So maybe the pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation using Ka2.

Wait, the second dissociation is H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-, so the Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So the Henderson equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

So if I can find the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-], I can find the pH.

But how much of each do I have?

Wait, from the problem statement, we have 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Let me compute their molarities.

First, calculate moles of each.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007346 mol.

Same for Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005611 mol.

But wait, when each dissolves, how much of each ion do they release?

KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-

So 1 mole of KH2PO4 gives 1 mole of H2PO4^-.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O.

So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives 1 mole of HPO4^2-.

So the moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007346 mol, and moles of HPO4^2- is 0.005611 mol.

But wait, the solution is 0.2 L, so the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007346 / 0.2 ≈ 0.03673 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005611 / 0.2 ≈ 0.02806 M.

So now, applying the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

[Wait, wait, pKa = -log(Ka). So for Ka2=6.2e-8, pKa2= -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.]

So pH = 7.208 + log(0.02806 / 0.03673) 

Calculate the ratio: 0.02806 / 0.03673 ≈ 0.7645.

Log(0.7645) is approximately log(0.7645) ≈ -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.114 ≈ 7.094.

So the pH is around 7.09.

Now, with this pH, I can find the concentration of PO4^3- from the HPO4^2-.

The reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So, at pH 7.09, what's the [PO4^3-]?

The expression for Ka3 is: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

Rearranged, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But [H+] can be calculated from pH: pH =7.09 → [H+]=1e-7.09 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute that:

pH =7.09 → [H+]=10^(-7.09) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.09) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.81 ≈8.1e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3=1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-]= 0.02806 M, [H+]=8.1e-8.

Putting in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.1e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 ≈ 5.05e-14.

Denominator: 8.1e-8.

So 5.05e-14 /8.1e-8 ≈6.23e-7 M.

Wait, that's approximately 6.23e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. That seems very close.

But wait, let me check all calculations again.

First, moles of KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 = let's compute accurately.

136.09 is approximately 136.09. 1 /136.09 ≈0.007346 mol. Correct.

Same for Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1 /177.99 = approx 0.005611 mol. Correct.

Concentration in 0.2 L: yes, 0.007346 /0.2 = 0.03673 M, and 0.005611/0.2=0.02806 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2= log(6.2e-8) = 7.2076 (since 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 1e-8; log(6.2)=0.792, so 7.792? Wait, wait no: Wait, pKa is the negative log.

Wait, Ka2=6.2e-8 → pKa2= -log(6.2e-8)= 7.2076.

Wait, because log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8)= 0.7924 + (-8) = -7.2076. So pKa2=7.2076.

So pH=7.2076 + log(0.02806/0.03673).

Compute 0.02806/0.03673≈0.7645.

log(0.7645)=?

Log(0.7)= -0.1549, log(0.76)= approximately log(7.6e-1)= log(7.6) + log(1e-1) ≈ 0.8808 -1= -0.1192.

Wait, more accurately: Let me compute it.

0.7645 is between 0.76 and 0.77.

Log(0.76)= log(7.6*10^-1)= log(7.6)=0.8808 → 0.8808-1= -0.1192.

Log(0.77)= log(7.7)=0.8865 → 0.8865-1= -0.1135.

So 0.7645 is closer to 0.76 than 0.77, so log(0.7645)≈-0.114.

So pH=7.2076 -0.114≈7.0936.

So [H+]=10^(-7.0936) ≈ 8.18e-8 M.

Now, compute [PO4^3-]:

Ka3=1.8e-12= [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+]

= (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.18e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Divide by 8.18e-8: 5.0508e-14 /8.18e-8 ≈6.17e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.17e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7) but not exactly. Hmm, maybe more precise calculations would get closer.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me recalculate [H+] more precisely.

pH=7.0936 → [H+]=10^(-7.0936)= ?

10^(-7) is 1e-7, 10^(-0.0936)=?

Compute 10^(-0.0936)= 1/(10^0.0936).

Compute 0.0936 * ln(10)=0.0936 * 2.3026≈0.2153 → e^0.2153≈1.240.

So 10^0.0936≈1.240 → 10^(-0.0936)=1/1.240≈0.8064.

So [H+]=1e-7 * 0.8064=8.064e-8 M.

Now, compute [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02806 )/(8.064e-8)

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = (1.8 * 0.02806)=0.050508 → 5.0508e-14.

Denominator: 8.064e-8.

5.0508e-14 / 8.064e-8 = (5.0508 /8.064 ) * 1e-6.

5.0508/8.064≈0.6265 → 0.6265e-6=6.265e-7 M.

Which is about 6.265e-7 M. So that's 6.265e-7, which rounds to 6.27e-7. But the option A is 6.24e-7.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exact numbers.

Wait, perhaps more precise calculation is needed.

Let me compute the exact moles and concentrations.

Molar masses:

KH2PO4: K=39.10, H2=2(1.008)=2.016, P=30.97, O4=64.00. Sum: 39.10+2.016+30.97+64=136.086 g/mol. So 136.086 g/mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Na2=2(22.99)=45.98, HPO4= (H:1.008, P:30.97, O4:64.00) →1.008+30.97+64=95.978. Plus 2 H2O: 2*(2*1.008 +16.00)=2*(18.016)=36.032. Total: 45.98 +95.978 +36.032= 177.99 g/mol.

So moles of KH2PO4: 1.00g / 136.086 g/mol = approximately 0.007345 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g /177.99≈0.005611 mol.

So concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007345 /0.2 = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005611 /0.2 = 0.028055 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = 7.2076.

Ratio: 0.028055 /0.036725 = 0.7643.

Log(0.7643)= ?

Let me compute this using more precise method.

Log(0.7643) = log(7.643 * 10^-1)= log(7.643) + (-1) * log(10).

Log(7.643)= approximately 0.8840 → 0.8840 -1= -0.116.

Wait, no, wait: because it's 7.643e-1, so the log is log(7.643) -1. log(7.643)=0.8840 (since 10^0.884=7.64). So log(0.7643)=0.8840 -1= -0.116.

Wait, but let me check with calculator approach.

Using the formula: ln(x)=x-1 - (x-1)^2/2 + (x-1)^3/3 - ... for small x-1.

Wait, but perhaps using a calculator method isn't practical. Alternatively, I can use an approximate value.

But perhaps using exact calculation: let me use a calculator's log function.

Alternatively, since I don't have a calculator, perhaps I should proceed with the approximate value of -0.116.

So pH=7.2076 -0.116=7.0916.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0916)= 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0916).

Compute 10^(-0.0916)= 1/10^0.0916.

Compute 0.0916 * ln(10)=0.0916 * 2.3026≈0.211.

e^0.211≈1.235.

So 1/1.235≈0.8099.

So [H+]=1e-7 * 0.8099=8.099e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-]= (1.8e-12 *0.028055 ) / (8.099e-8 )

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028055 = 5.05e-14.

Denominator:8.099e-8.

So 5.05e-14 /8.099e-8= (5.05/8.099) * 1e-6.

5.05 /8.099≈0.6235.

0.6235e-6=6.235e-7 M.

So about 6.235e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. So that's the closest.

But wait, perhaps I should consider that some of the HPO4^2- might dissociate into PO4^3-.

Wait, but the solution also contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and their presence affects the pH. But I think the approach I've taken accounts for that by using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, another way to think about this is to consider that the HPO4^2- can dissociate as:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

But the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- affects the pH, which in turn affects the equilibrium for PO4^3-.

Wait, but I accounted for that by calculating pH from the buffer, so the [PO4^3-] is based on that pH.

So I think this should give the correct concentration.

So the answer should be option A:6.24e-7 M.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and the equilibria involving phosphate species. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, with molar masses of 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The dissociation of these salts contributes to the concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ in the solution.

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007346 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  Concentration in 0.2 L:  
  \[
  [\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-] = \frac{0.007346}{0.2} \approx 0.03673 \, \text{M}
  \]

- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005611 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  Concentration in 0.2 L:  
  \[
  [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] = \frac{0.005611}{0.2} \approx 0.02806 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The second dissociation of phosphoric acid is relevant here:  
\[
\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{HPO}_4^{2-}, \, K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}
\]  
The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]} \right)
\]  
- \(\text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208\)
- Ratio:  
  \[
  \frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]} = \frac{0.02806}{0.03673} \approx 0.7645
  \]  
- \(\log(0.7645) \approx -0.114\)

Thus,  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 - 0.114 \approx 7.094
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻
The third dissociation of phosphoric acid is relevant for the formation of PO₄³⁻:  
\[
\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{PO}_4^{3-}, \, K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}
\]  
The equilibrium expression is:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO}_4^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}
\]  
Rearranging for \([\text{PO}_4^{3-}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]  
- \([\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.094} \approx 8.18 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\)
- Substituting values:  
  \[
  [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.02806)}{8.18 \times 10^{-8}}
  \]  
  - Numerator:  
    \[
    (1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.02806) \approx 5.05 \times 10^{-14}
    \]  
  - Denominator:  
    \[
    8.18 \times 10^{-8}
    \]  
  - Result:  
    \[
    [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{5.05 \times 10^{-14}}{8.18 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.17 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
    \]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) is approximately \(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
