Okay, I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's try to break it down step by step.

So, the problem is about an electron's spin state and measuring probabilities for a certain operator. Let's start by understanding what's given.

The state is |alpha> and it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, what's that mean? Oh, right, when something is proportional, it means it's equal up to a normalization factor. So I need to normalize this state first.

First, let's write the state as a vector. |up> and |down> are the basis states for spin in the z-direction. So |alpha> can be written as a two-component vector. The components are (1+i) and (2-i). But wait, I think I have to normalize this vector. The norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.

Calculating the norm: |1+i|^2 is (1^2 +1^2)=2, and |2-i|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2)=4+1=5. So the total norm is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but the problem says it's proportional, so maybe the normalization is already accounted for. Hmm, but for probabilities, we need the state to be a unit vector. So I think I have to compute the normalization factor. So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T multiplied by 1/sqrt(7). Because when I add the squares, it becomes (2 +5)=7, so 1/sqrt(7) makes it unit length.

Next, the operator whose matrix representation A has elements Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so the matrix is 2x2 because it's dealing with spin up and down. So for a 2x2 matrix, the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2, and the diagonal is zero? Let me write that down.

So matrix A is:
[ [0, (hbar/2)],
  [(hbar/2), 0] ]

Oh wait, that's interesting. Because the operator has non-zero elements only where i≠j, that's the form of the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0 1],[1 0]]. So A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of Pauli X, which are |+x> and |-x>, the spin eigenstates along the x-axis. Because the eigenstates of Pauli X are |+x> and |-x>, and their corresponding eigenvalues are +1 and -1, scaled by hbar/2 in this case.

But wait, the question is about measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of operator A. So the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of A. Since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, its eigenvalues are (hbar/2)(1) and (hbar/2)(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

But to find the probabilities, I need to express the state |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Because the probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in |alpha>.

So first, I should find the eigenstates of A. Let me recall, the eigenstates of sigma_x (which A is a multiple of) are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for +1 and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for -1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The eigenstates for sigma_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). Because sigma_x acting on |+x> gives +|+x>, etc.

So, the eigenstates of A are the same as those of sigma_x. Because A is a scalar multiple of sigma_x.

So, I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x> or |up> and |down>, whichever is more convenient. But since the question is about the probabilities for the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>, I should express |alpha> in that basis.

So, let me proceed step by step.

First, find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Express |alpha> as c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

Alternatively, |alpha> = (a |+x> + b |-x> ), and find a and b.

But perhaps it's easier to write |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down> and then express |alpha> in terms of those.

Wait, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, let's express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me write |alpha> as ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) |up> + ( (2-i)/sqrt(7) ) |down>.

So, substituting |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

Since |up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2)
and |down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2)

So, substituting into |alpha>:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ] * [ (|+x> + |-x> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] 
plus [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ] * [ (|+x> - |-x> ) / sqrt(2) ) ]

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(7) and 1/sqrt(2):

= [1/sqrt(14)] [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>) ]

Expand the terms:

= [1/sqrt(14)] [ (1+i + 2 -i)|+x> + (1+i - (2 -i)) |-x> ]

Simplify the coefficients:

Coefficient of |+x>:
(1+i) + (2 -i) = 1+2 +i -i = 3

Coefficient of |-x>:
(1+i) - (2 -i) = 1-2 +i +i = (-1) + 2i

So, putting it together:

|alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |-x> ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, but wait, let's re-calculate the coefficients to make sure.

For the |+x> term:

(1+i) * |+x> comes from the first term, and (2-i) * |+x> comes from the second term, right?

Wait no, let me recheck. The expansion is:

(1+i) |up> is (1+i) [ (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) ]

Similarly, (2-i) |down> is (2-i) [ (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2) ]

So when we add them:

(1+i) [ |+x> + |-x> ] + (2-i) [ |+x> - |-x> ] 

Which is [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] |+x> + [ (1+i) - (2-i) ] |-x> 

So, the coefficient for |+x> is (1+i + 2 -i) = 3.

Coefficient for |-x> is (1+i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i).

So, yes, that's correct.

So the state is (3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |-x> ) / sqrt(14)

Now, the probability of measuring |+x> is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient of |+x>, which is (3 / sqrt(14) )^2.

Similarly, the probability for |-x> is | (-1 +2i) / sqrt(14) |^2.

Let's compute these.

First probability: |3|^2 /14 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Second probability: | -1 + 2i |^2 /14 = (1^2 + 2^2)/14 = (1+4)/14=5/14≈0.35714.

Wait, but wait, adding 9/14 and 5/14 gives 14/14=1, which is correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches these probabilities.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36. That's close to 9/14 which is ~0.6428, and 5/14 (~0.357) rounds to 0.36.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29. Hmm, not matching.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72. No.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46. No.

So A is looking good so far.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The expectation value <A> is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

But wait, since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, and the expectation value of sigma_x in state |alpha> is the expectation of sigma_x. Alternatively, since |alpha> is in the z-basis, perhaps it's easier to compute it using the matrix form.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>, which are eigenstates of A, the expectation value is sum (p_i * a_i ), where p_i is the probability and a_i the eigenvalues.

So, the eigenvalues of A are (hbar/2) for |+x> and (-hbar/2) for |-x>.

So, <A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) ) 

= [ (9 -5) * hbar/2 ] /14 

= (4 * hbar/2 ) /14

= (2 hbar) /14 

= hbar /7.

So the average is hbar/7.

Which matches option A.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. So option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves an electron's spin state described by |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by Aij = ℏ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be computed.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize, calculate the norm:
\[
\text{Norm} = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |down⟩.
\]

### Step 2: Express |α⟩ in terms of the eigenstates of A
The operator A has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix},
\]
which corresponds to the Pauli X matrix scaled by ℏ/2. The eigenstates of A are the spin eigenstates along the x-axis:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ + |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ - |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
Substitute |up⟩ and |down⟩ in terms of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ into |α⟩:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \frac{|+x⟩ + |-x⟩}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \frac{|+x⟩ - |-x⟩}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right)|+x⟩ + \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right)|-x⟩ \right].
\]
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ 3|+x⟩ + (-1 + 2i)|-x⟩ \right].
\]

### Step 3: Calculate probabilities
The probability of measuring |+x⟩ is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient of |+x⟩:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6428.
\]
The probability of measuring |-x⟩ is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient of |-x⟩:
\[
P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{1^2 + 2^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the average value of A
The eigenvalues of A are ℏ/2 (for |+x⟩) and -ℏ/2 (for |-x⟩). The average value of A is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substitute the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is ℏ/7. This matches **Option A**.
