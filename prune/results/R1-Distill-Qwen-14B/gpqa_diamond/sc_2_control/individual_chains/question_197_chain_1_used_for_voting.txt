Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given. The compound X has some IR and NMR data provided. Hmm, I remember that IR is useful for functional groups, and NMR for structure determination.

First, the IR data: looking at the peaks. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably O-H or N-H stretch. But wait, the next peaks are at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. The 1720 is a strong peak, which often indicates a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. Then 1610 and 1450 might be C=C stretching, so maybe an aromatic ring with substituents.

Now the 1H NMR data. Let's see:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, likely an acidic proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an enol proton, but carboxylic acid makes sense because the IR has a 1720 peak which can correspond to a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait! Carboxylic acids have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, so this could be a -COOH group.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. Aromatic regions. Maybe para-substituted benzene. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are typically as two doublets. So perhaps two substituents on the benzene ring, in para positions.

-7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Also a doublet, but lower shift. Maybe an electron-withdrawing group is present, like a nitro or carbonyl, which would deshield the protons.

Wait, if the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, that suggests there are substituents on the benzene ring. Let's think about para-substituted benzene. For example, substituents that are electron-withdrawing or donating.

Looking back at the IR, the peaks at 1610 and 1450: Those could be the C=C stretches of the aromatic ring, possibly with substituents. Also, the 1720 could be a carbonyl, maybe an ester or ketone or acid. But if the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad peak, that's more indicative of a carboxylic acid because the -OH in a carboxylic acid is broad. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring with a substituent and a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet for one proton. Carboxylic acid has two protons usually, but wait, wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Carboxylic acid is -COOH, which has two equivalent protons. But sometimes if the structure is such that the protons are not equivalent, but in most cases, they are. However, in some cases, like when the molecule is rigid, maybe they split, but that's more rare. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, which is usually a singlet around 9-10 ppm. But the aldehyde would have a peak around 2800-2700 cm-1 in IR for the C-H stretch. Wait, but the IR here doesn't mention that. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl group would be around 1700 cm-1, which the IR has at 1720. That's a bit higher, but possible. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Esters have carbonyls around 1740-1720 cm-1, which fits. So, 1720 is more likely an ester than a carboxylic acid. Hmm, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet for one proton. Wait, maybe it's a phenol, but phenol's OH is usually broader, around 5 ppm? No, wait, phenol's OH is around 10 ppm, but it's a broad peak. But in that case, the IR would show an O-H stretch, which the first peak is 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak for O-H or N-H. So that could fit with a phenol as well.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Let's try to piece together the structure.

Looking at the NMR:

- 10.5 ppm: Maybe a phenol OH, but then the IR would have a broad O-H stretch around 3400-2500. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be strong and broad, which matches the IR's 3400–2500. Also, the 1720 in IR could correspond to the carbonyl in the acid. Wait, but wait, the pKa of a carboxylic acid is around 4-5, so it would be deprotonated in D2O, but NMR is usually done in solvent like CDCl3, so the O-H would be present. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the NMR would show a broad peak for two protons (the -OH is one proton, but wait, no, the -COOH has two protons. Wait, no, wait, -COOH has two -OH groups? No, no, wait: No. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Wait, no: The carboxylic acid group is -COOH, which has two oxygen atoms but only one hydrogen (the -OH is on the oxygen). Oh, wait no, the structure is R-COOH, so the -OH is a single proton. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, no, that's correct. The carboxylic acid has a single -OH group, so the NMR would show a singlet for one proton at around 10-12 ppm, which matches the 10.5 ppm, broad singlet.

So, that suggests that the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but looking at the IR again, the 1720 suggests a carbonyl, which would fit with the acid. So perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the NMR aromatic protons:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)

This is typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, if there's a substituent on the ring that's electron-withdrawing, which would cause the adjacent protons to deshield and appear upfield or downfield? Hmm, let me think. Electronegative substituents like nitro groups, or carbonyl groups, would cause the ortho and para protons to be deshielded, so they would appear downfield. For example, in para-methyl benzoic acid, the ring would have the COOH group at the para position relative to the methyl.

Wait, but the two doublets in the NMR at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm suggest two sets of two protons each. Let's imagine a benzene ring with a substituent at the para position. For example, if there's a substituent on carbon 4, then the protons on carbons 2 and 6 would be one set, and those on 3 and 5 would be another. Or wait, maybe the substituent is at the para position relative to another group.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ring has a substituent on C-1 and another on C-4, but that's less likely. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is on C-4, and maybe another substituent on C-1, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the ring has two substituents. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the substituents.

The 1H NMR shows:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet for one proton. Maybe a CH group next to an electronegative atom, like O or N. Or perhaps part of a CH2 group adjacent to something else.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons as a multiplet. Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to something else, like a carbonyl group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons as a doublet. That sounds like a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps part of an isopropyl group. Wait, no. Wait, wait: A doublet for 3H suggests a CH3 group attached to something that has two adjacent protons. Like in an isopropyl group, but wait: in an isopropyl group, the central CH is split into a septet, but perhaps in this case, it's a different arrangement.

Wait, 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. That's a bit unusual. Wait, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a CH2 group. For example, CH(CH3)2 would have a triplet for the methyl, but that's at around 1.2 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl attached to an oxygen, but that's usually around 3 ppm or so.

Wait, let me think again. So, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a triplet for 3H. That's typical of a methyl group at the end of an ethyl chain. For example, CH2CH3 would have a triplet at around 1 ppm for the CH3.

So, putting that together, the 0.9 ppm t,3H is a methyl group attached to a CH2. So, maybe something like CH2CH2CH3, but that's a propyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a side chain. Let me try to piece it together.

So, the aromatic part: two substituents? Or a substituent and a carboxylic acid.

Wait, wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group and an ester or another group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring has a substituent that's a ketone or ester group.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when alkenes react with red phosphorus and HI, it's a bromonium or phosphonium intermediate, leading to anti addition. Wait, no, more accurately, red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydroxylation of alkenes, but wait, another possibility is the cleavage of the double bond. Or perhaps it's for the elimination of HX. Wait, no, another thought: when alkenes react with HI in presence of red phosphorus, it's used in the addition, but more importantly, perhaps it's used for the deoxygenation of ketones? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's the production of alkanes from alkenes via dehalogenation.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what the reaction is doing. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroxymercuration reaction? No, wait, that's mercury. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI is used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, but perhaps more importantly, it's used for the cleavage of certain functional groups.

Wait, another approach: if the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a dehalogenation reaction. For example, in the presence of red phosphorus, organohalides can undergo elimination. Alternatively, maybe the compound X has a halogen that is being removed.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure first.

Looking back at the NMR, the aliphatic protons:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): perhaps a CH group adjacent to an oxygen or another electronegative atom.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): CH2 group adjacent to something.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): CH3 attached to a CH, which is itself attached to something else. Like in an isopropyl group, but wait, isopropyl groups usually have a septet for the CH3.

Wait, maybe it's part of a longer chain. For example, (CH2)2CH3 or something similar.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) suggests a terminal methyl group, like CH2CH2CH3. So, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a side chain that includes a CH2CH2CH3 group.

Putting all this together, perhaps the structure is something like 4-(something)benzoic acid. Or perhaps the benzene ring has a substituent that includes a propyl group.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

So that would be a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group attached to the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2-C(Ph-Et)-COOH.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group on the para position. So the structure would be Ph-COOH with a sec-butyl (CH2CH(CH2CH3)) group at position 4.

Wait, let me think about the NMR for each possibility.

If the compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the structure would be:

Ph (with substituents) such that the substituents are at the para positions. The benzoic acid is at position 1, and the sec-butyl is at position 4?

Wait, no. Wait, benzoic acid is at position 1, and the substituent is at position 4. So the structure would be:

Ph-COOH at position 1, and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Wait, the substituents on the benzene ring would be the COOH group and the sec-butyl group. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H, as in para-substituted benzene.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be split into two sets: the two protons ortho to the sec-butyl group and the two para to the COOH group, but wait, in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and a substituent at position 4, which is another group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group or an ethyl group.

Wait, let me think about the NMR of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The structure would be:

Benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position. So the benzene ring would have a COOH group and a sec-butyl group opposite each other.

The aromatic protons would be two doublets because of the para substitution. The protons adjacent to the COOH group would be more deshielded (higher ppm) and the protons adjacent to the sec-butyl would be less deshielded (lower ppm). So maybe the 8.0 ppm (d) is the protons next to the COOH, and 7.2 ppm (d) next to the sec-butyl.

Looking at the aliphatic protons:

The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So, the structure would have a CH2 connected to the benzene, then a CH connected to another CH2CH3.

So, the CH2 would be adjacent to the benzene and the CH. The CH would have two adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have:

2.9 ppm (m,1H): perhaps the CH in the sec-butyl group.

1.7 ppm (m,2H): could be the adjacent CH2.

1.4 ppm (d,3H): the CH3 attached to the CH.

Wait, but wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet. In a sec-butyl group, the CH3 is attached to the CH, which is attached to another CH2 group. The CH group's protons would be split by the neighboring CH2. So, the CH would be a triplet or a multiplet. The CH2 would be a quartet, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps in the case of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the CH2 next to the benzene would appear around 2.5-3 ppm, and the CH would be around 1.5-2 ppm. Hmm, but the NMR shows:

At 2.9 ppm (m,1H): perhaps the CH group.

At 1.7 ppm (m,2H): the adjacent CH2.

At 1.4 ppm (d,3H): the CH3 attached to the CH.

Wait, perhaps the CH3 in the sec-butyl is the 1.4 ppm, as a doublet, which suggests that the CH group is split into a doublet by the adjacent CH2. But that might not make sense because the CH is adjacent to a CH2 with two protons. So the CH would be a triplet, perhaps.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. So, the structure is 4-isobutylbenzoic acid.

Wait, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the CH would have two CH3 groups attached. So, the CH would be a septet, but that's not matching the NMR, which shows a multiplet for 1H at 2.9 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached in a certain way.

Wait, let's think about the aliphatic region again.

We have:

2.9 ppm (m,1H): could be a CH group.

1.7 ppm (m,2H): perhaps a CH2 adjacent to something.

0.9 ppm (t,3H): CH2CH2CH3, as part of a longer chain.

Wait, let's think of a propyl group. For example, a benzene ring with a propyl group attached. So, the substituent is CH2CH2CH3.

In that case, the CH2 adjacent to the benzene would be around 2.5 ppm (a triplet), the middle CH2 around 1.5 ppm (a quartet), and the terminal CH3 around 1 ppm (a triplet). But in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, and the 0.9 is a triplet for 3H.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the options.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would be a toluene derivative with substituents at positions 1 and 4. But I'm not sure.

Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So benzene with isobutyl at position 1 and methyl at position 4.

Hmm.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group. So the product must have a carbonyl. Looking at the options, options A and C have carbonyl groups (propanoic acid and benzoic acid, respectively). The other options are aromatic compounds without carbonyls.

Wait, but the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus. If the starting compound X has a carbonyl group, perhaps after reaction, the carbonyl is converted into something else.

Wait, another thought: Could the reaction be a reduction of the carbonyl group? For example, a ketone or aldehyde being reduced to an alcohol.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI is more commonly used for the addition to alkenes, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound X is an ester. Because the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is typical for esters. So, perhaps X is an aromatic ester.

So, perhaps X is something like a benzene ring with an ester group, such as methyl benzoate.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 10.5 ppm peak, which would not fit with an ester. Because esters have the carbonyl, but the O-H (if any) would be a different situation. Wait, but esters don't have O-H protons, so the 10.5 ppm peak would have to be something else.

Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let's think again.

If the IR shows 1720 cm-1 and a broad O-H stretch, then the compound likely has a carbonyl and an O-H group.

So, a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have both.

So, the starting compound X is a substituted benzoic acid.

Now, when a benzoic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroxymercuration reaction? No, that's mercury. Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is the reduction of the benzoic acid.

Wait, but benzoic acid is not easily reduced under those conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of a nitrile to an amine, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is the cleavage of a benzyl halide. Wait, perhaps the starting compound has a benzyl halide group, but I don't see any halide in the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a benzaldehyde, but then the IR would have a peak around 2800 and 2700 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, which is not mentioned here. So that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the IR's 1720 cm-1 is not a carbonyl. Could it be an ester, perhaps. Wait, but I'm stuck.

Let me try to match the NMR data to the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the structure is:

Benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H. The COOH group would give a peak around 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet.

The aliphatic protons would include:

- The CH2 adjacent to the benzene (probably around 2.5 ppm as a triplet).

- The CH in the sec-butyl group, which would be adjacent to two CH2 groups. So, perhaps as a multiplet around 1.7 ppm.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H. Hmm, perhaps that's the CH2 adjacent to the benzene.

Wait, the structure would be:

Ph–CH2–C(H)(CH2CH3)

So, the CH2 attached to the benzene would be at around 2.5 ppm (m, 2H). But the NMR shows 2.9 ppm (m,1H), which is a single proton. Hmm, perhaps that's the CH.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure.

The benzene ring has COOH at position 1 and a (CH2)CH(CH2CH3) group at position 4.

So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, but then the CH2 group would be attached to the benzene, and the CH is attached to the CH2CH3.

So, the CH would have two neighboring groups: the benzene (but that's not a factor) and the CH2CH3.

Wait, but in the NMR, the CH would be a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 (if the CH2 is a triplet). Or perhaps a multiplet if more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is split into a triplet. But in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. So that's the CH group.

Then, the CH2 would be adjacent to that CH, so perhaps a triplet around 1.7 ppm. The CH2CH3 would be a triplet around 0.9 ppm.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have 1.7 ppm (m,2H), which could be the CH2 group, and 0.9 ppm (t,3H) for the CH2CH3.

So, the aliphatic protons would look like:

- CH2 group at ~2.5 ppm (if attached to the benzene), but in the NMR it's at 2.9 ppm. Hmm, that's a bit higher than expected. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is next to an electronegative group, which would deshield it and shift it upfield or downfield. Wait, maybe it's next to an oxygen, but in this case, it's attached to the benzene, so no oxygen nearby.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the CH2 is part of a larger group. For example, if the substituent is a propyl group, then the CH2 would be part of that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. So, the structure would be Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, but that doesn't quite fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group (n-butyl), so the structure is Ph–CH2CH2CH2CH3. Then, the CH2 groups would have their own shifts.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reaction again. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So, what would happen if the starting material has a carbonyl group, like a benzoic acid.

Benzoic acid on reaction with HI and red phosphorus. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to form the acid.

Wait, but the product options include benzoic acids, so perhaps the reaction is hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the reaction conditions: If X is an ester, and it's treated with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a hydrolysis to form the acid. For example, in acidic conditions, the ester would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is elimination. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let me look at the options again.

Options A and C are carboxylic acids. Options B and D are alkanes with substituents.

If X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. So, looking at the options, options A and C are acids.

But in the IR and NMR data of X, there's a broad O-H peak, which would suggest that X is a carboxylic acid. Because if X were an ester, the O-H wouldn't be present. So perhaps X is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but then the reaction is X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. So, what reaction would that be?

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroxymercuration reaction? No, that's with mercury. Alternatively, perhaps it's the reduction of a nitrile. Wait, nitriles can be reduced to amines using red phosphorus and HI. But that's not relevant here.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is the deoxygenation of a ketone to an alkane. But that would require a ketone, which would have a carbonyl peak around 1700 cm-1. The IR of X shows 1720, which is more in line with an ester.

Wait, perhaps X is a nitrile. But then the IR wouldn't have the 1720 cm-1 peak.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde which is being reduced to a benzyl alcohol. But then the IR would show the aldehyde C-H stretch, which is not mentioned here.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on the reaction part. Let me try to proceed with the structure.

If the NMR data corresponds to option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the structure would fit.

The 1H NMR would have:

- Aromatic protons: two doublets, 2H each, at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm.

- The COOH proton: 10.5 ppm, broad.

- The aliphatic protons: the CH group (sec-butyl) at around 2.9 ppm (m,1H), the adjacent CH2 at 1.7 ppm (m,2H), and the CH3 at 1.4 ppm (d,3H). Wait, but wait, in a sec-butyl group, the CH3 is attached to the CH, which is attached to the CH2. So the CH3 would be a triplet, perhaps. But the NMR shows a doublet for 3H at 1.4 ppm. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an iso-propyl group.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. For example, the structure is Ph–CH2–C(CH3)2.

In that case, the CH2 would be around 2.5 ppm, the C(CH3)2 would be a singlet, but perhaps the CH2 group next to the benzene would be a triplet, etc.

Wait, but I'm not seeing a clear fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropyl group, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, let me think of the options again.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The structure would have the benzoic acid group and a sec-butyl group at the para position.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons would match the data.

The aliphatic protons would be:

- The CH2 group attached to the benzene: perhaps around 2.5 ppm, but the NMR shows 2.9 ppm (m,1H). Hmm, that's a single proton, not two.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the structure. Maybe the substituent is a (CH2)2 group leading to a longer chain, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group. But then the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 groups.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to match each option's structure to the NMR.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Structure: benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4.

Sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

In the NMR:

- The aromatic protons are 8.0 (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H).

- The COOH gives 10.5 (bs,1H).

- The aliphatic protons:

The CH2 adjacent to benzene: in a sec-butyl group, the CH2 is next to the benzene and the CH. So, the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH. Each proton in the CH2 would be adjacent to the CH.

Wait, the CH2 would have two protons, so each would couple with the CH's proton. So, the CH2 would be a doublet for each proton, but since there are two protons, it would be a quartet. But in the NMR, it's 2.9 ppm (m,1H) and 1.7 ppm (m,2H). Hmm, perhaps it's the CH group that's at 2.9 ppm, and the adjacent CH2 at 1.7 ppm.

Wait, the CH in the sec-butyl group is connected to two CH2 groups: one attached to the benzene and one attached to the CH2CH3. So, the CH would have neighboring protons from both sides, leading to a more complex splitting. So, the CH's proton would be a multiplet, perhaps at around 2.9 ppm.

The adjacent CH2 (attached to the benzene) would have two protons, each coupling with the CH. So, each would be a doublet, but together, perhaps they appear as a quartet around 1.7 ppm.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, which could fit.

The CH2CH3 group's CH2 would be at around 1.4 ppm, but as a triplet, perhaps. But in the NMR, it's a doublet for 3H at 1.4 ppm. Hmm, that doesn't fit well because the CH2CH3 would typically be a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2CH3 is attached to the CH in a way that the CH3 is split into a doublet. But I'm not sure.

Another option: Let's think about option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Structure: propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group on the second carbon.

So, the structure is CH2(C6H4CH2CH3)COOH.

The aromatic protons would be similar to option C, perhaps.

The aliphatic protons would include:

- The CH2 attached to the phenyl group: perhaps around 2.5 ppm (m,2H).

- The CH2 in the ethyl group attached to the benzene: maybe around 1.5 ppm (m,2H).

- The terminal CH3: around 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

Wait, but in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, which doesn't fit with a CH2 group. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2 next to the phenyl is at 2.9 ppm. But a CH2 would have two protons, so perhaps it's a triplet or quartet.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the reaction again.

If X is a benzoic acid derivative, and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a reduction. But I don't recall red phosphorus and HI being used for reducing carboxylic acids. Alternatively, maybe it's a decarboxylation, but that typically requires heat.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to form the acid. So, if X is an ester like methyl benzoate, reacting with HI and red phosphorus (acidic conditions) would hydrolyze it to benzoic acid.

But the NMR of X shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which would be the COOH group, so X is already a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the reaction is not hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction is converting it to an amine. But that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, think about the reaction as a deoxygenation. If X has a carbonyl group, perhaps the reaction removes the oxygen, converting it into an alkane.

So, if X is a benzaldehyde, the reaction would reduce it to benzyl alcohol. But in that case, the IR wouldn't have a broad peak at 3400–2500 cm-1 because aldehydes don't have O-H. Hmm, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone, and the reaction reduces it to an alcohol. But then the NMR would show a OH group, which it does, but I'm not sure about the rest.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of a carbonyl group, converting it into a double bond.

Wait, I'm not making progress on the reaction part. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the reaction is something that adds HI, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard reaction, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is adding HI to a triple bond or a double bond, but I don't know if X has that.

Wait, the IR of X shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a carbonyl, and the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 suggest aromatic C=C.

So, X is a substituted benzoic acid.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehalogenation, but I don't see any halide in X's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible products.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if the reaction is a reduction, perhaps from a nitrile to an amine, but that doesn't produce a benzoic acid.

Alternatively, if the reaction is elimination, perhaps the product is different, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't changing the benzoic acid part, but modifying another part of the molecule.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the substituent on the benzene ring is a group that can react with HI. For example, an ester group.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the possible structures again.

The NMR data suggests the presence of a benzene ring with two substituents (as indicated by two doublets for the aromatic protons), a carboxylic acid group (10.5 ppm), and an aliphatic chain with a CH group, a CH2 group, and a terminal CH3 group.

So, the substituent on the benzene is likely a propyl or butyl group.

Now, thinking of the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure is:

Ph–COOH and Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH3).

In the NMR, the aliphatic protons would include:

- The CH2 group attached to the benzene (maybe around 2.5 ppm as a quartet).

- The CH group in the sec-butyl (maybe around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet).

- The CH2CH3 group (around 1.4 ppm as a doublet, perhaps due to coupling with the adjacent CH).

Wait, but in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. So, that would suggest that the CH3 is adjacent to a CH, which would be the case in a sec-butyl group. So, perhaps that's the case.

So, putting it all together, the structure of X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are commonly used in the hydroxymercuration reaction, but that's for adding water across double bonds in a Markovnikov fashion. Alternatively, I recall that red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce nitriles to amines, but that's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation. But I don't see any halides here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is the elimination of water from a carbonyl group to form an alkene. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to form the acid. But X is already a carboxylic acid, so that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol. But that would require a reducing agent, and I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Wait, another possibility is that the reaction is the Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings, but that typically uses ammonia and a metal like sodium or magnesium. Not sure about red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm, I'm not making progress on the reaction part, but perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the benzoic acid part but another part of the molecule. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is removing the benzoic acid group.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is cleaving the benzoic acid into something else, but I can't think of a reaction that would do that with red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride from the benzoic acid, but that usually involves thionyl chloride (SOCl2), not HI and red phosphorus.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI: One reaction I can think of is the addition to alkenes, but without knowing if X has a double bond, I can't say. But the IR of X shows peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are typical of aromatic C=C stretching, so maybe X doesn't have an alkene in the side chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of a halogen, but I don't think X has any.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the O-H is replaced by something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the conversion of a nitrile to an amine, but I don't think X is a nitrile.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the product is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and that the reaction doesn't change the structure, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another angle: What if the reaction is the conversion of the benzoic acid into an acid chloride, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an anhydride, but again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't changing the substituent but modifying another part of the molecule. For example, if X is an ester, it could be converting to a carboxylic acid, but the product would then be the same as X, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think of the possible product structures.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If the reaction is converting the benzoic acid into something else, perhaps it's losing the COOH group. But I don't know how that would happen with red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is adding HI to a triple bond, but I don't see a triple bond in X.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a nitrile, which upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI becomes an amine. But then the product would be an amine, which isn't among the options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but without more information, I can't say.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by HI. But I don't know where the leaving group would be.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that's done with Mg, not red phosphorus.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the NMR data.

The NMR data fits best with option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Thus, the product would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction involving compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data:

**IR Data:**
- 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad, likely O-H stretch)
- 1720 cm⁻¹ (strong peak, indicative of a carbonyl group, likely a carboxylic acid)
- 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretching)

**1H NMR Data:**
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): Doublet for 3H, likely a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): Triplet for 3H, likely a terminal CH₃ group in an alkyl chain.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**
   - This structure includes a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group at the second carbon.
   - The NMR data does not support this structure because the aliphatic region does not match the expected pattern for a propanoic acid with an ethylphenyl group.

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**
   - This is a substituted benzene with an isobutyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4.
   - The IR data does not support this structure because it lacks a carbonyl group, which is indicated by the 1720 cm⁻¹ peak.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**
   - This structure consists of a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position.
   - The aromatic protons (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm) match the para-substitution pattern.
   - The aliphatic region matches the expected pattern for a sec-butyl group: a CH group at 2.9 ppm, a CH₂ group at 1.7 ppm, and a CH₃ group at 1.4 ppm.
   - The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**
   - This is a substituted benzene with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4.
   - The IR data does not support this structure because it lacks a carbonyl group, which is indicated by the 1720 cm⁻¹ peak.

### Conclusion:
The IR and NMR data are most consistent with **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The aromatic protons, carboxylic acid group, and aliphatic protons all align with this structure. The reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) do not appear to alter the benzoic acid group but may modify other parts of the molecule, though the product remains consistent with the structure of Option C.

**Answer: C**
