Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize the structure. So, the main chain is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is at position 1, which is a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. Also, there's a carbonyl group because it's a carbaldehyde.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is a triple bond, so the structure is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (like C≡C- attached). So, the molecule starts as cyclohexane with a triple bond.

I need to figure out the sequence of reagents to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target compound. Let's think about the possible reactions and how they can build the structure.

First, the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group. Wait, no, more accurately: the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is connected to another cyclohexane ring. Or wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, but that might not be right. Let me re-read the target name.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Breaking it down: the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part is a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group. The substituent at position 1 is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So the substituent is a methyl group (CH2-) that's attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Or maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)- group. Wait, perhaps it's a secondary alcohol because of the hydroxy on the methyl.

Let me sketch this. The main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1, there's a substituent: a CH(OH)- group connected to a cyclohexyl. So the structure would be cyclohexane with a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group attached at position 1. And on the same main ring, there's a carbonyl group (aldehyde) probably at position 1 as well? Or maybe the substituent and the aldehyde are on adjacent positions? Hmm, not entirely sure, but let's focus on the synthesis steps.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a triple bond (ethynyl group). So, maybe we can perform some reactions to add substituents.

Let me think about the steps needed:

1. The target has an aldehyde group. How can I introduce that? One way is oxidation of a primary alcohol. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a triple bond, which could be used in some addition reactions.

Wait, another approach: maybe we can perform a hydration of the triple bond to form a ketone or an alcohol, and then oxidize or modify further.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use some kind of alkylation or addition to the triple bond to build the substituent.

Let me think about the reagents in the options. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Hmm, I'm not sure. NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation, like in elimination or alkyne chemistry. Methyl chloride would be an alkylating agent. So maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction or alkyne alkylation.

Wait, NaNH2 and methyl chloride could be for alkynide formation. If ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2, it might deprotonate the triple bond, forming an acetylide. Then methyl chloride could alkylate the acetylide, adding a methyl group. But wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, the acetylide would have two triple bonds? Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group. Deprotonating that would give an acetylide: cyclohexyl-C≡^−, then methyl chloride would add a methyl, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.

But that's not very helpful. Maybe that's followed by hydrogenation. H2 with Pd would reduce the triple bond to a single bond. So, cyclohexyl-C-C-Me, but that would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me? Wait, no, maybe after alkylation, the triple bond is converted to a single bond, so we get a cyclohexyl group connected to a CH2-CH2-Me? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first step is making an alkyne longer. But I'm not quite following.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH. Hmm. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would form an ethylated acetylide. Then Li and liquid NH3 are conditions for a Birch reduction, maybe? Or perhaps for elimination. Then ozone followed by workup (like oxidative cleavage). Then NH4OH—maybe for acid workup or for forming an amine? Not sure.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd with CaCO3; then O3 with (CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2. So, after alkyne alkylation and hydrogenation, we might have a cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me group? Then ozonolysis would cleave double bonds, but if the hydrogenation step didn't create any double bonds, maybe another step did. Wait, perhaps earlier steps involve elimination.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3 with (CH3)2S; then NH4OH. Hmm, NaNH2 with methanol? Maybe forming a protective group, but not sure. Li and liquid NH3 could be for deprotonation or elimination, like in the formation of alkyne from alkene via dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me outline what needs to be done to get to the target.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group and a cyclohexyl-substituted hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps we can introduce the aldehyde via oxidation, and the hydroxymethyl via some kind of addition or oxidation.

Starting from ethynylcyclohexane:

1. Maybe add a methyl group to the triple bond, turning it into an alkyne with a substituent.
2. Then perform a reduction to form a double bond or a single bond with substituents.
3. Maybe form an epoxide or something else to introduce the hydroxyl group.
Wait, another thought: perhaps the triple bond can be converted into a carbonyl group. For example, via hydration to form a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe we can perform an alkyne alkylation to add a substituent, then hydrogenate the triple bond to form a single bond with substituents.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps we can form a di-substituted cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps we need to perform a hydroxylation somewhere. Maybe via some epoxidation followed by ring-opening, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, considering that the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)- group, perhaps we can use a Grignard reagent or some organometallic reagent.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a triple bond. Let me think about the possible reactions:

1. Deprotonate the triple bond (ethynyl group) using NaNH2 to form a strong base (acetylide ion).
2. Alkylation with methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the acetylide, making a longer triple bond. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes something like cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 after alkylation? No, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2CH2C≡CH? No, more accurately, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group.

Deprotonating that with NaNH2 would give cyclohexylacetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡^−). Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate it, adding a methyl group. So the product would be cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Then, step 2: H2 with Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond into a single bond, giving cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, hydrogenation of an alkyne would typically give cis or trans alkene, but if it's fully hydrogenated with H2 and a catalyst, it would become a single bond. So cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no, because H2 and Pd would add two hydrogens across each triple bond. So the product would be a single bond: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's a three-carbon chain attached to the cyclohexane. Not sure if that's helpful.

But the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) group. So perhaps after hydrogenation, we can introduce an alcohol group.

Alternatively, maybe instead of alkylation, another approach is needed.

Wait, maybe after alkylation and hydrogenation, we can perform an oxidation to introduce a carbonyl group. But in the target, the aldehyde is present, so perhaps we can oxidize a primary alcohol.

Wait, but let's think about the steps. Let me see the options again.

Looking at option C: after the first two steps, it's H2 with Pd-CaCO3. So that would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So the first step is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, which adds a methyl to the triple bond, making it longer. Then, hydrogenation gives a single bond.

So after step 2, the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis. Wait, but ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So if the molecule has a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it. But after hydrogenation, there's no double bond. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me consider another approach.

The target molecule has a carbonyl group, so perhaps that comes from oxidation of a primary alcohol. So maybe in the reaction steps, we need to introduce a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone via hydration. So, for example, using H2O in presence of a catalyst like HgSO4 and H2SO4, which would hydrate the triple bond to a ketone. But ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexyl ketone. Wait, but that would form a ketone, not an aldehyde. So that might not directly help.

Wait, but if we can form an aldehyde, perhaps through some other pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted to a vinyl group, then subjected to some addition to form a diol, which could then be oxidized.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the target molecule is formed via a cyclohexene ring-opening. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can introduce a protecting group for the triple bond, then perform some ring expansion or substitution.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reagents again.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li and liquid NH3; then O3 with (CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

NaNH2 and methanol: perhaps this is for deprotonation and alkylation, but methanol is a good nucleophile. Alternatively, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol might act as a methylating agent. Wait, but NaNH2 is used for deprotonating things like ethynyl groups. So in the first step, maybe it's deprotonation of the ethynyl to form an acetylide, which would then react with methanol. But wait, methanol is a methyl group source. So the acetylide would attack the methyl, adding a methyl group to the triple bond. So the product would be cyclohexyl-C≡C-OCH3? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is quenched with methanol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first step forms a Grignard reagent, but NaNH2 is more for deprotonating rather than Grignard.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is for deprotonating the ethynyl group to form an acetylide, which then reacts with some alkylating agent. But in option D, the first step uses methanol. So perhaps the acetylide attacks the methyl group from methanol, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-OCH3. But that seems a bit odd.

Then, the second step is Li and liquid NH3. Those conditions are typically used for Birch reductions or for elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation to form alkynes. Alternatively, Li in liquid NH3 is used for the formation of alkynes from alkenes via dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if after the first step, we have a methyl ether attached to the triple bond, then using Li and NH3 might cause elimination, forming a triple bond again but with a longer chain. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonation step. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me think about the target again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main ring is cyclohexane with an aldehyde group. The substituent at position 1 is a CH(OH) group attached to a cyclohexyl group.

So, to get the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl substituent, perhaps we can perform a substitution or addition reaction where a hydroxyl group is introduced adjacent to a cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the hydroxymethyl group is formed via oxidation of a secondary alcohol. Wait, but oxidation of secondary alcohols gives ketones, not aldehydes. So that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group comes from a Grignard addition. For example, adding a Grignard reagent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, but how do I get the carbonyl group in the first place? Maybe via oxidation of an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds and can form carbonyl groups. So perhaps in one of the steps, ozonolysis is used to break a double bond into an aldehyde.

Looking back, option C includes ozonolysis with O3 and (CH3)2S. That's a reductive workup, which would break the ozonides into aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substitution.

So, if after some steps, there is a double bond between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups. But wait, the target only has one aldehyde, so perhaps the double bond is at the end.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, if the molecule has a primary alcohol, we can oxidize it to an aldehyde. But oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes is tricky because they usually go all the way to carboxylic acids. So perhaps using a mild oxidizing agent, like CrO3 under specific conditions, but I'm not sure if that's part of the reagents here.

Looking at the options, option C has O3 followed by (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. So, that would convert a double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me re-examine the steps in option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: likely alkylating the acetylide, making the triple bond longer.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond. So, cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3 with (CH3)2S: but where's the double bond? Unless step 2 didn't hydrogenate the triple bond all the way, leaving a double bond. Wait, H2 and Pd usually hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds, not alkenes. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation isn't complete, but that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a step where a double bond is introduced. Maybe before the hydrogenation, we have a double bond that's then hydrogenated. But that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a double bond via partial hydrogenation, and then ozonolysis is used. But if the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave that double bond.

Wait, let me think about option C again. Steps 1 and 2: NaNH2 and methyl chloride, then H2/Pd.

After step 1: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

After step 2: hydrogenation converts triple bond to single bond, so cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. But that's ozonolysis on a single bond, which doesn't do anything. So that can't be right. So perhaps option C isn't correct.

Now, looking at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol. So, deprotonate the ethynyl group to form an acetylide, which may react with methanol. But methanol isn't a good methylating agent. Wait, perhaps it's more about deprotonation and then quenching with methanol, but I'm not sure what that would give.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Conditions for elimination, perhaps. So if the product from step 1 is a methyl ether, then Li/NH3 might deprotonate and eliminate, forming a triple bond again but longer. Or maybe it's a Birch reduction, but that usually applies to aromatic rings.

Alternatively, maybe step 1 gives a cyclohexyl-C≡O-Me group? Not sure.

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Again, ozonolysis requires a double bond.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form acetylide, then add methanol (but why?) Maybe it's a substitution, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is making a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not sure.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the target structure again. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)- group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane ring, which also has an aldehyde group.

Perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Adding a methyl group to the triple bond via alkylation.
2. Hydrogenating to form a single bond, leading to a longer chain.
3. Introducing a double bond via elimination.
4. Ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into aldehyde groups.
5. Introducing a hydroxyl group via some oxidation or epoxide opening.

Wait, perhaps using ozonolysis to introduce the aldehyde.

But let me try to think through the steps in option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation. But methanol might not be the best electrophile. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is treated with methanol, giving a methyl ether. So the product after step 1 would be cyclohexyl-C≡OCH3?

Step 2: Li and liquid NH3. This is a condition for elimination. If we have a structure like cyclohexyl-C≡OCH3, perhaps under Li/NH3, it could eliminate to form a triple bond again, but that seems unlikely. Or maybe it's a Birch reduction, but that applies to aromatic rings.

Alternatively, step 2 could be a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't see a halide in the structure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the correct order of reactions.

The target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So perhaps this is made via a substitution reaction, like using a Grignard reagent to add to a carbonyl.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So perhaps the triple bond is used to add a methyl group, then hydrogenated, then a diol is formed, which is then oxidized.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. For example, using O3 and H2O would break the triple bond into two carbonyls, but that's ozonolysis.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane has one triple bond. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, but the position matters.

Wait, ozonolysis of an internal triple bond would give two carbonyl groups. But in ethynylcyclohexane, the triple bond is terminal, so ozonolysis would give a single carbonyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, let me think. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. Ozonolysis of this would break the triple bond into two carbonyls. So, the product would be a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group (since the triple bond C≡CH upon ozonolysis would give a CHO group and a CH2O group? Wait, no. Ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne (like R-C≡CH) would give R-CHO (an aldehyde) and CH3CHO (another aldehyde). But wait, actually, ozonolysis of an alkyne typically gives diketones if it's internal, but for terminal alkynes, it might give a different product.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check ozonolysis of terminal alkynes. Ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne (like HC≡C-R) typically gives R-COOH and HCOOH (formic acid) under oxidative conditions. But if it's a reductive workup, like with (CH3)2S, then it might produce R-CH2-CHO and HCHO (formaldehyde). Hmm, I'm a bit uncertain.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolyzed to form two carbonyl groups. But how does that fit into the options.

Looking back at the options, option C includes O3 and (CH3)2S (which is a reductive workup). So, if the triple bond is converted into a double bond first, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

So, possible steps:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group (step 1 in option C: NaNH2, methyl chloride).
2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond (but wait, H2/Pd would add hydrogen to the triple bond, converting it to a single bond, not a double bond. So perhaps the hydrogenation is partial, but I don't think so. H2 with Pd typically fully hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond.

Hmm, so perhaps option C's step 2 isn't the way to go.

Wait, maybe the triple bond is first converted into a double bond via another method. For example, using Hg(OAc)2 and heat to cause dehydrohalogenation, but that's not part of the options.

Alternatively, after alkylation, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a trans-alkene via some other method, which is then hydrogenated.

Wait, maybe the alkylation step adds a methyl group to the triple bond, making it longer, and then the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is:

1. Deprotonate the triple bond to form an acetylide.
2. Alkylate with methyl chloride to add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne.
3. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene.
4. Ozonolyze the alkene to form two carbonyl groups.
5. Work up with (CH3)2S to form aldehydes.
6. Then introduce the hydroxyl group via some dihydroxylation or epoxide opening.

But I'm not seeing all these steps in the options.

Looking again, option C's steps are:

1. Alkylation to make the triple bond longer.
2. Hydrogenate to single bond.
3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S.
4. Ba(OH)2.

Hmm, step 3 is ozonolysis but the molecule is a single bond. So that won't work. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: perhaps this is making a protective group.
2. Li and liquid NH3: maybe elimination to form a triple bond.
3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S: which requires a double bond.
4. NH4OH: maybe for acid workup.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a double bond. Let me think.

If step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol, it could be deprotonating the ethynyl group to form an acetylide, which reacts with methanol. But I'm not sure what product that would form. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard-like reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a Birch reduction, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis-alkane, but I don't think Birch does that. Birch is usually for aromatic rings, like benzene to cyclohexadiene.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of the target molecule differently. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)- group, which is attached to another cyclohexane ring that has a carbonyl group.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a new carbon-carbon bond between the main cyclohexane and the substituent.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the target is synthesized via a double alkylation of the acetylide. For example, treating ethynylcyclohexane with two equivalents of R-X.

But the options don't have two alkylation steps. Looking at option A, it has NaNH2 and methyl chloride as step 1, and then step 2 is H2/Pd. So adding a methyl group and then hydrogenating.

Wait, perhaps after adding a methyl group via alkylation, hydrogenation would give a single bond. Then, Ba(OH)2 could induce some kind of elimination or epoxide formation. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used for epoxidation perhaps, but more commonly for elimination reactions. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used in the formation of epoxides from epoxide precursors, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones, but that's typically done with other reagents.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the correct reagents that would form the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve forming a cyclohexene via some hydrogenation, then dihydroxylation to form a diol, which can then be modified.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via a ring-opening metathesis, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, another thought: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group. That suggests that perhaps a Grignard reagent is added to a carbonyl group to form a new carbon chain.

So, perhaps the process is:

1. Convert the ethynylcyclohexane into an aldehyde via some oxidation.
2. Then add a Grignard reagent (like cyclohexyl magnesium bromide) to the aldehyde, forming a new carbon chain with an alcohol group.
3. Then, perhaps oxidize the alcohol to a ketone or leave it as a hydroxyl group.

But how do I get the aldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane?

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is oxidized to a diketone, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne, so oxidation would form a ketone and a carboxylic acid. But that doesn't directly give an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to ozonolysis to break it into carbonyl groups. So, for example, H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis-alkene (maybe after partial hydrogenation), then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls.

So, the steps would be:

1. Hydrogenate ethynylcyclohexane to form cyclohexane with a cis-CH2-CH2- group. Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond would give a single bond, not a double bond. So that approach might not work.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a trans-alkene via some method, like using a catalyst, and then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

But I'm not seeing that in the options. Let me re-examine the options again.

Looking at option C:

Step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. So, after steps 1 and 2, we need a double bond for ozonolysis. So, perhaps step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the triple bond all the way, but just partially to a double bond. But H2 and Pd generally go to full hydrogenation.

Wait, unless in step 2, the hydrogenation is done under specific conditions to stop at the alkene. But I thought that requires a poisoned catalyst or specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is H2 with a Lindlar catalyst, which would hydrogenate a triple bond to a cis-alkene. Then, step 3 would ozonolyze the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But looking at the options, option C's step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is a standard condition for full hydrogenation, not partial. So that might not work.

Alternatively, if step 1 adds a methyl group to the triple bond, making it a longer alkyne, and step 2 hydrogenates it to a trans-alkene, but again, H2/Pd would fully hydrogenate.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to match the steps in the options with the target.

The target has both an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl.

Looking at option C:

After step 3 (ozonolysis), perhaps we have an aldehyde group. Then, Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination or for forming an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols, but I'm not certain.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination reactions. In the presence of an alcohol, perhaps it could dehydrate it to form a ketone or aldehyde. But in this case, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is used in a Corey-Fuchs reaction or something else, but I'm not remembering.

Another approach: Let's think about each reagent's purpose.

The target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl. So perhaps that comes from a Grignard addition to a carbonyl.

But how to get the carbonyl? Maybe via ozonolysis of a double bond.

Looking at option C again:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkylation of the triple bond, making it longer.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate to single bond.

So after step 2, the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so nothing happens. So that can't be right. So option C is probably incorrect.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps form a methyl ether on the acetylide.

2. Li, NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a longer alkyne.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → requires a double bond.

4. NH4OH → acidic workup.

But after step 2, maybe we have a longer alkyne, which upon hydrogenation wouldn't form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 doesn't hydrogenate but does something else.

Alternatively, maybe step 1 adds a methyl group via alkylation, and step 2 converts the triple bond into a double bond via some elimination. But I'm not sure.

Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is used for deprotonation to form strong bases, perhaps for elimination reactions. So, if after step 1, the molecule is an alkyne with a good leaving group, step 2 could eliminate to form a longer alkyne, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 creates a di-substituted acetylide, which upon reaction with Li/NH3 could form a more substituted alkyne.

This is getting too vague. Perhaps I should consider the correct answer based on the options' sequences.

The correct answer likely involves:

- Alkylation of the triple bond (using NaNH2 and an alkyl chloride)
- Hydrogenation to form a single bond
- Ozonolysis to form the aldehyde group
- Some dihydroxylation or epoxide opening to form the hydroxymethyl group

Looking at option C, after alkylation and hydrogenation, the molecule would have a single bond. But without a double bond, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the hydrogenation isn't complete. If step 2 in option C is H2 with Pd, it would hydrogenate the triple bond all the way to a single bond, making a three-carbon chain. But then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. So option C doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I should think of the correct sequence as:

1. Alkyne alkylation (NaNH2 and MeCl) → longer alkyne.
2. Partial hydrogenation to a trans-alkene (using H2 and a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's).
3. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. Workup to form aldehydes.
5. Introduce the hydroxyl group via some epoxide or dihydroxylation.

But looking at the options, none mention a poisoned catalyst for partial hydrogenation. So perhaps option C's step 2 is not partial.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B or D.

Wait, option B's steps are:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylation of the triple bond with ethyl group.
2. Li, NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a longer alkyne.
3. O3, H2O → cleavage to form carbonyls.
4. NH4OH → workup.

Hmm, after step 3, ozonolysis would break the alkyne into two carbonyl groups. But if the alkyne is longer, perhaps the workup would form an aldehyde and a ketone. Then, step 4 could be for acid workup.

But the target has an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group. I'm not seeing how the hydroxymethyl is formed here.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps making a methyl ether.
2. Li, NH3 → elimination to form a longer alkyne.
3. O3, (CH3)2S → cleavage.
4. NH4OH → workup.

But without a double bond, ozonolysis won't work. Unless in step 2, after elimination, a double bond is formed.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the acetylide is treated with methanol, perhaps leading to a propargyl alcohol or something else. Then, step 2 with Li and NH3 could eliminate to form a longer alkyne. Then, step 3 would cleave that into carbonyls.

But I'm not confident.

Another thought: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl to another cyclohexane with an aldehyde. So perhaps we can form a di-substituted cyclohexane by adding the cyclohexyl group via a Grignard or similar.

But how to get the Grignard reagent? Maybe via alkylation of the acetylide.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form acetylide.
2. Alkylate with methyl chloride to add a methyl group.
3. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain.
4. Introduce a double bond via elimination.
5. Ozonolyze to form an aldehyde.
6. Introduce the hydroxyl group via oxidation.

But none of the options include all these steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not certain.

Given the confusion, perhaps I should think about the correct answer being option C. Let me try to go through option C again.

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylates the triple bond, making it longer.

So ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-C≡CH) becomes cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond. So now it's cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3, (CH3)2S → but the molecule is now a single bond. So ozonolysis doesn't work. So step 3 can't be correct.

Thus, option C is probably not correct.

Looking at option A:

Steps: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

So after step 1: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination, forming a double bond. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination to form alkenes from alcohols or other suitable substrates. But in this molecule, we have a cyclohexane with a -CH2-CH2-CH3 group. How would Ba(OH)2 affect that? It would need an alcohol or another leaving group.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, we have cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3, which upon treatment with Ba(OH)2 might eliminate to form a double bond. But I'm not sure because there's no obvious leaving group or adjacent hydroxyl group.

Ba(OH)2 could cause dehydrohalogenation if there's a halide, but in this molecule, there isn't. So perhaps this step isn't relevant.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could cause oxidation or other reactions, but I'm not sure.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's a Jones oxidation condition, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids and secondary alcohols to ketones.

But where is the alcohol in this molecule? Unless step 3 introduces an alcohol.

Hmm, I'm not seeing it.

Another approach: Perhaps the correct sequence is in option C.

Wait, maybe after step 2 in option C, there's a double bond from another source. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that the hydrogenation isn't complete, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

But I'm really not certain. Based on the options and the target, the steps likely involve alkylation, hydrogenation, and ozonolysis to form the aldehyde, followed by introducing the hydroxymethyl group.

But considering all that, I'm going to make an educated guess that option C is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde core with a substituent at position 1: a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane, the synthesis must introduce the aldehyde group and the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl substituent.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the triple bond, forming an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to alkylate the acetylide, resulting in cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, yielding cyclohexyl-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, but there is no clear leaving group or alcohol in the molecule at this stage to justify elimination or oxidation.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Jones oxidation conditions, which require a primary alcohol to oxidize to a carboxylic acid. However, no alcohol is present in the molecule at this stage.

This sequence does not explain how the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group is introduced or how the aldehyde is formed. **Option A is unlikely.**

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the triple bond, forming an acetylide, which reacts with ethyl chloride to alkylate the acetylide, resulting in cyclohexyl-C≡C-C₂H₅.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Conditions for elimination or dehydrohalogenation, potentially forming a longer alkyne.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double or triple bonds, but the product after step 2 is unclear, and there is no double bond for ozonolysis to act on.
4. **NH₄OH**: Likely for neutralization or workup, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

This sequence does not provide a clear pathway to the target molecule. **Option B is unlikely.**

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the triple bond, forming an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to alkylate the acetylide, resulting in cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, yielding cyclohexyl-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the product after step 2 is a single bond, making this step ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, but no clear reaction pathway is evident for introducing the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group.

This sequence fails to achieve the target molecule due to the lack of a double bond for ozonolysis. **Option C is unlikely.**

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the triple bond, forming an acetylide, which reacts with methanol. The exact product is unclear, but it may involve forming a methyl ether or a different intermediate.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Conditions for elimination or dehydrohalogenation, potentially forming a longer alkyne.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the product after step 2 is unclear, and there is no double bond for ozonolysis to act on.
4. **NH₄OH**: Likely for neutralization or workup, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

This sequence does not provide a clear pathway to the target molecule. **Option D is unlikely.**

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly and logically leads to the target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** was considered the most plausible, despite the inconsistencies in the sequence.
