Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the reactions. Let's break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, there's a possibility of a nucleophilic addition. But wait, wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are nucleophiles. So maybe it's an addition reaction.

Wait, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition, right? So in the first step, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) is reacting with NaCN. So the mechanism would be the CN- attacking the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin. Right, a cyanohydrin formation. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me visualize that: the ketone (butan-2-one) has a carbonyl group. Adding CN- would give a compound with a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon, which fits the product structure.

So the reagent A would be involved in the work-up after the nucleophilic addition. Usually, when you add a cyanide to a ketone, you might need an acid to protonate the oxygen. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. After the cyanide attacks, the oxygen is a negative charge, maybe as an alkoxide. To get the hydroxyl group, you'd need to protonate it. So perhaps the work-up involves an acid like H3O+ (which is option A or B as reagent A).

Wait, but what about other possibilities? Are there other conditions for cyanohydrin formation? I think sometimes it's done under basic conditions, but maybe the work-up uses acid. So for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Looking at the product, the nitrile group (-CN) has been converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So the reaction is converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. For the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, typically, it's done under strong acidic conditions, like using H2SO4 or HCl, and heat. Or under basic conditions followed by acid work-up. Wait, but in this case, the reaction is in the presence of H2O and reagent B. Let's think: the nitrile to carboxylic acid usually requires some kind of hydrolysis. 

Wait, another thought: the nitrile could be oxidized. But oxidation of nitriles can give different products. For example, using KMnO4 under certain conditions can give different acids. But in this problem, the nitrile is converting to a carboxylic acid, so hydrolysis is likely.

So, the reaction could be hydrolysis of the nitrile group. Let's think about the reagents. Common reagents for nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid are strong acids. For example, using HCl (H2O, HCl, heat) or H2SO4. Alternatively, sometimes it's done with a strong base, like aqueous NaOH, followed by acidification.

Wait, but in the question, the reagent B is used with H2O. So what's reagent B? Let's see the options. Looking at the options, for B, options are HCl, CH3COOH, HCl again, or CH3COOH. So which is correct for hydrolysis of nitrile to acid.

In the case of acidic hydrolysis, HCl is often used. So B would be HCl. Alternatively, if it's basic conditions, you might use NaOH, but the product needs to be acidified. Hmm, but in the product, the hydroxyl is present, so perhaps the conditions shouldn't affect that part.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile and a hydroxyl group. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile, you don't want to affect the hydroxyl group. Let me think: if you use a strong acid, like HCl, the hydroxyl would get protonated, but it's not part of the reaction, so that's okay.

So, for the second step, reagent B is HCl. Let me see the options:

Looking at the options for B—options are A) B=HCl, B) B=CH3COOH, C) B=HCl, D) B=CH3COOH.

So in the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+. Let's see which options have A as H3O+.

Option A: A= H3O+, B= HCl. That fits.

Option B: A= H3O+, B= CH3COOH. So B is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. Would that work for the hydrolysis of nitrile to acid? Maybe not as effectively as HCl.

So for the second reaction, correct reagent B is HCl. So in the options, A and C have B=HCl. But for A, when looking at the first reaction, option C says A is NaHSO3. Hmm, why would that be?

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I thought that was used for the reduction of ketones, but wait—I'm a bit mixed up. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

The first reaction is NaCN and A. So butan-2-one plus NaCN in presence of A gives the cyanohydrin. So the mechanism is: the ketone's carbonyl group is attacked by CN- (from NaCN), forming an alkoxide, which is then protonated by H+ (from A) to become the hydroxyl group.

So reagent A would be an acid, like H3O+ (proton source). So in the options, A is either H3O+ (options A and B) or NaHSO3 (options C and D).

Wait, but wait. Sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) is a source of HSO3^- which can act as a nucleophile as well. But in this reaction, it's the CN- that's attacking the carbonyl. So the role of A is probably to protonate the alkoxide after the attack.

So, in the first step, after the nucleophilic attack, the oxygen is an alkoxide (O-). To get the hydroxyl group, you need to protonate it. So the work-up would involve an acid. So A should be H3O+.

So that leaves options A (A=H3O+, B=HCl) and C (A=NaHSO3, B=HCl) as possibilities for the second part.

Wait, but let's consider if there's another possibility for the first reaction. Oh, wait a second. I think that when you have a ketone reacting with a nitrile in presence of H2SO4 or acid, it's the acid that provides the H+ for the protonation. So perhaps A is H3O+ (which is the same as H+ from H3O+ in solution).

So option A has A as H3O+ and B as HCl. Let's check the other parts.

In the second reaction, when the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, using HCl (B) as the reagent would make sense. So the correct reagents would be A = H3O+ and B = HCl. That would correspond to option A.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options:

Option A is A= H3O+, B = HCl.

Option C is A= NaHSO3, B= HCl.

So according to this, if the first reaction uses H3O+, then option A is correct. But wait, I'm a bit confused because another thought comes to mind: sometimes, when you have a nitrile addition, you might use something like H2SO4 as a catalyst. But I think that in the case of the cyanohydrin formation, the reaction is typically done in water under acidic conditions. So the work-up would involve adding acid, like H3O+.

So putting it all together, the first reaction uses H3O+ (A=H3O+), and the second uses HCl (B=HCl). So the correct option is A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other possibilities?

Wait, another angle: the first reaction. Butanone + NaCN gives a cyanohydrin upon acid work-up. So the reagent A is H3O+. That's correct.

Second reaction: nitrile to carboxylic acid. So, in the presence of H2O and reagent B.

The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is often done using strong acids like HCl with heat. So B is HCl.

So the correct answer should be A, where A = H3O+ and B = HCl.

The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. In this reaction, the nucleophile (CN⁻ from NaCN) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone, forming an alkoxide intermediate. To convert the alkoxide into the hydroxyl group in the product, an acid is required for protonation. Therefore, reagent A must be an acid, specifically H₃O⁺, which provides the necessary protons.

The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) in the presence of water and reagent B. This is a hydrolysis reaction, and nitriles are typically hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic conditions. Among the options, HCl is the most suitable reagent for this transformation, as it provides the acidic environment required for the reaction.

Considering the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, B (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and not suitable for efficient nitrile hydrolysis.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it does not provide the necessary acid for protonation in cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.
