Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the RV method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

Alright, the question says that two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun, have planets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both planets are similar to Neptune in mass, and the orbits are circular. They've given the spectral line shifts for each planet: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, the RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves due to the planet's gravity, causing the spectral lines to shift. The shift depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and other factors. But since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, those factors are the same.

Oh, right! The formula I remember for the RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2π * (a)^(1/3)) ) ), but wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, I think the formula can be simplified when the planet mass is much smaller than the star's mass. Since Neptune is much less massive than the Sun, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(0.5)). Oh wait, but the planets have circular orbits, so e=0. So the denominator becomes 1, simplifying the formula.

Wait, maybe another approach. The RV method's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ] * ( sin(i) ) / ( (P * (1 day)^-1 )^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. And since both stars have same mass, and planets similar mass, M_p cancels out when comparing K1 and K2.

Wait, but in this question, both planets have similar masses. So, their K values should be proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), because K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3), since K ~ (v) depends on the orbital speed.

Wait, maybe it's better to look at the formula for the RV semi-amplitude. The formula is:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) * (2π) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(a^(1/3)) )

Hmm, perhaps another way. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since e=0 and i=90 degrees (edge-on orbit, which is often assumed when using RV method), sin i =1. So K simplifies to:

K = ( (27 pi G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since the two planets have the same M_p and same M_star, the K is proportional to 1 / (P)^(1/3).

So, K1 = k / (P1)^(1/3)
K2 = k / (P2)^(1/3)

Where k is a constant for both.

Given that K2 is 7 milliangstroms and K1 is 5. So, K2/K1 = 7/5.

But wait, in the RV method, higher K means a larger velocity amplitude, which implies a larger acceleration, which depends on the planet's mass and orbital period. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 must be smaller than P1. Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer P2 is than P1. So, if P2 is smaller, the ratio would be less than 1.

Wait, let's get this right. Let me think about it again.

K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)). So, if K2 = (7/5) K1, then 1/(P2^(1/3)) = (7/5) (1/(P1^(1/3))) )

Wait, no. Let me set up the proportion correctly.

K1 ∝ 1/P1^(1/3)
K2 ∝ 1/P2^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = [1/P1^(1/3)] / [1/P2^(1/3)] ] = [P2/P1]^(1/3)

Wait, no. Let me write it correctly. Let me write K1 as proportional to 1/P1^(1/3), K2 as proportional to 1/P2^(1/3). So, K1 = (1/ P1^(1/3)) * C, where C is a constant. Similarly, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * C. So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

But wait, from the question, K2 is given as 7, K1 as 5. So, K2/K1 = 7/5.

So, 7/5 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → then P2/P1 = (7/5)^3 = 343/125 ≈ 2.744. So, P2 is longer than P1 by about 2.744 times. But the options don't have that. Let me check the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

Wait, none of these are around 2.744. Hmm, perhaps I inverted something.

Wait, maybe I got the proportionality wrong. Because K is proportional to (v) which is the velocity. The velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit is given by K, and it's related to the orbital speed of the star.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to go back to the formula for K:

K = [ (G * M_p sin i) / (c * (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) * P^(1/3)) ) ]^(1/3)

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Maybe a better approach is to use the relation between velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

Wait, the formula I think is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So,

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i / ( M_star^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) * P^(1/3) )

But since e=0, and sin i is 1 (assuming edge-on orbit), this simplifies to:

K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K2/K1 = 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3), because as K increases, P decreases.

Wait, let me clarify. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So, for K2 = 7 and K1=5,

(7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

So, cubing both sides,

(7/5)^3 = P1/P2.

Which is 343/125 ≈ 2.744.

So, P1 = 2.744 * P2 → P2 = P1 / 2.744.

But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, P2 / P1 = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.365.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So, the ratio is approximately 0.36 times. So, planet #2's orbital period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, it's shorter. So, P2 is shorter; thus, the answer would be A) ~0.36.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because if K is larger, that implies a shorter period. Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So, larger K means smaller P.

So, K2 (7) > K1 (5) → P2 < P1. So, the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1, which would be option A.

But let me make sure I did the algebra correctly.

We have K2/K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3).

So, 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

Cubing both sides: (7/5)^3 = P1/P2.

So, P1 = (343/125) * P2 → P2 = (125/343) * P1.

125 divided by 343 is approximately 0.364, which is about 0.36 times. So, P2 is about 0.36 times P1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, it's shorter.

So, the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then P2 is shorter. So the ratio is ~0.36. So, the answer is option A.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), i.e., 

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}.
\]

Given that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), we can write:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{P_1}{P_2}^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( K_2 / K_1 = 7 / 5 \), we get:

\[
\frac{7}{5} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}.
\]

\[
\frac{343}{125} = \frac{P_1}{P_2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's orbital period is shorter than planet #1's.
