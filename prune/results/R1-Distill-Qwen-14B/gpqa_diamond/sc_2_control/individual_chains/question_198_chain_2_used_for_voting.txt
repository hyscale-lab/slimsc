Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us about the tendency of a metal ion to form a complex with ligands. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

So, the setup is a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants provided are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, I think the numbering goes from the simplest complex to the more complex ones. So Co(SCN)n^2- where n is 1, 2, 3, 4?

Wait, no, maybe the β's are for each step. Stability constants are usually for each successive addition of a ligand. So β1 is for CoSCN^+, β2 would be for Co(SCN)2^0, β3 for Co(SCN)3^-...? Or wait, each β is the formation constant for each additional ligand. So the formation of the first SCN, the second, etc. So the overall β for the complex with n ligands would be the product of β1 up to βn.

Wait, no. Wait, each β is for the nth step. So, for example, the overall β for Co(SCN)_n would be β1 * β2 * ... * βn. Or wait, maybe each β represents the equilibrium for adding each ligand. So for the first complex, [CoSCN+]/[Co^2+][SCN^-] = β1=9. Then the second complex would have [Co(SCN)_2]/[CoSCN+][SCN^-] = β2=40. So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_2 would be β1 * β2 = 9*40=360.

Wait, or maybe each β is the overall stability constant for each step. So the first complex, n=1: β1=9. Second, n=2: β1*β2=9*40=360, n=3: 9*40*63=22680, n=4: 22680 *16= 362880.

Wait, I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, each β is the stepwise formation constant. So each β represents the addition of one SCN- to the previous complex. So for n=4, the overall β is β1 * β2 * β3 * β4. But wait, the given β4 is 16. Hmm, that's confusing because β3 is 63, which is higher, and β4 is lower. That might mean that the fourth complex is less stable than the third. That's unusual, but possible.

But the question is about the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which are the Co(SCN)_2^0 species. So n=2.

But wait, the problem says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Wait, I thought that the different complexes have different colors, and that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is blue. Oh wait, no, perhaps for Co(II), the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is blue, but the problem is asking about dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- per Co. So that would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, but the question's wording says "dithiocyanato" which is two SCN ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which has two SCN- attached.

So I need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 in the solution.

To find the distribution of different Co complexes, I can use the stability constants and the concentrations to find out which species are predominant.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex using the given β values and the concentrations of Co and SCN^-.

The problem is that the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M, which is the sum of all Co species: [Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

But calculating all that might be complex. Alternatively, I can use the distribution equation based on the formation constants.

Wait, the solution involves using the formula for the fraction of each complex. The fraction f_n of the complex with n ligands is given by:

f_n = (β_1 β_2 ... β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n) / (sum over m=0 to 4 of (β_1 β_2 ... β_m [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^m) )

But wait, since m goes from 0 to 4, the denominator is the sum of all possible species. For m=0, it's [Co^2+], which is the free ion.

Wait, more accurately, the total concentration of Co is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M, which equals the sum of all species. So each species is present in a certain concentration determined by the β values and the ligand concentration.

But the way to compute the fractions is to consider the terms involving the formation constants and ligand concentrations.

So for each species CoL_m, the concentration is [CoL_m] = β_1 β_2 ... β_m [Co^2+][L]^m.

But [Co^2+] is a bit tricky because it's part of each term. Alternatively, the fraction f_m for each species is (β_1 β_2 ... β_m [L]^m) / (sum from k=0 to 4 of (β_1 ... β_k [L]^k) )

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let’s consider that the free Co^2+ is [Co^2+], and each complex is formed stepwise. The fraction f_m of each complex is determined by the product of the β's up to that step, multiplied by the ligand concentration to the mth power, all divided by the sum of all such terms for m from 0 to 4.

More precisely, each complex Co(SCN)_m has a term K_m = (β1 β2 ... βm) [SCN-]^m.

But since [Co^2+] is a common factor, when we write each complex's concentration as [CoL_m] = K_m [Co^2+], the sum of all [CoL_m] plus [Co^2+] equals c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But [Co^2+] can be expressed in terms of K_0 (which is 1) and all other K_m's.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the fractions without considering the absolute concentrations. Because the fractions depend on the ratios of the K_m terms.

Let’s define K_m as the product of β's up to m, multiplied by [SCN-]^m. So K_0 = 1, K_1=β1 [SCN], K_2=β1β2 [SCN]^2, etc. Then, the fraction f_m is K_m / (sum of K_k for k=0 to 4).

But wait, for the total concentration of Co, we have:

c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2−

Each term [CoL_m] can be written as K_m [Co^2+], so [CoL_m] = K_m [Co^2+]

So,

c(Co) = [Co^2+] (1 + K_1 + K_2 + K_3 + K_4 )

Which leads to:

[Co^2+] = c(Co) / (1 + K_1 + K_2 + K_3 + K_4 )

And the fraction of each species is f_m = K_m / (1 + K_1 + K_2 + K_3 + K_4 )

Wait, but wait, K_0 is 1, so the denominator is sum_{m=0}^4 K_m.

Wait, no, because K_0 is 1 (since all β's before m=0 are 1). So K_0 = 1, K_1 = β1 [SCN], K_2 = β1 β2 [SCN]^2, K_3=β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3, K4=β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4.

So the denominator is sum from m=0 to 4 of K_m.

Wait, that's correct. So the fraction f_m is K_m / (sum K_m from m=0 to 4).

So for each species, [CoL_m] = K_m [Co^2+]

Thus, the fraction f_m is (K_m) / (sum K_m) ).

So the steps are:

1. Compute K_0, K_1, K_2, K_3, K_4.

- K_0 = 1

- K_1 = β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

- K_2 = β1 * β2 * [SCN]^2 = 9*40*(0.1)^2 = (360) * 0.01 = 3.6

Wait, wait: [SCN-] is 0.1 M, so [SCN]^2 is 0.01. So K2 = 9 *40 *0.01 = 3.6.

Similarly,

K3 = β1*β2*β3 * [SCN]^3.

β3 is 63. So 9 *40=360, 360 *63=22680.

[SCN]^3 is (0.1)^3 = 0.001.

So K3 = 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68.

K4 = β1*β2*β3*β4 * [SCN]^4.

β4 is 16. So 22680 *16 = 362880.

[SCN]^4 is 0.1^4 = 0.0001.

So K4 = 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

Wait, let me compute each K step by step.

Compute each K:

K0 = 1.

K1 = β1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

K2 = β1 * β2 * [SCN]^2 = 9*40*(0.1)^2 = 360 *0.01=3.6.

K3 = β1*β2*β3 * [SCN]^3 = 9*40*63*(0.1)^3.

9*40=360; 360*63=22680.

(0.1)^3=0.001. 22680 *0.001=22.68.

K4 = β1*β2*β3*β4 * [SCN]^4.

22680 *16 = 362880.

(0.1)^4=0.0001.

362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So now sum all K_m:

Sum = K0 + K1 + K2 + K3 + K4 = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 +22.68+36.288.

Let me calculate that:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So sum is 64.468.

Now, the fraction of each species is K_m / sum.

We are interested in the species with m=2, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So f_2 = K2 / sum = 3.6 / 64.468.

Compute that: 3.6 /64.468.

Let me compute 3.6 ÷64.468.

Approximately, 64.468 ÷3.6 is about 17.907, so reciprocal (3.6/64.468)= ~0.05556.

Wait, 3.6 divided by 64.468. Let me compute it more accurately.

3.6 /64.468 = ?

Well, 64.468 *0.0555 = approx 3.58 (since 64.468 *0.05=3.223, 64.468*0.0055=0.354, total ~3.577). So 3.577 is about 3.6, so 0.0555.

So 3.6/64.468 ≈ 0.05556 or about 5.556%.

Wait, but that's about 5.55%, but looking at the options, the closest is D)16.9%, which is about 16.9%. Hmm, that's not matching. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the K's.

Wait, let's recheck each K value.

K0 =1.

K1=9 * 0.1=0.9.

K2=9*40*(0.1)^2.

9*40=360. 0.1 squared is 0.01. 360 *0.01=3.6. Correct.

K3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3.

9*40=360. 360 *63=22680. 0.1 cubed is 0.001. 22680 *0.001=22.68.

K4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360. 360 *63=22680. 22680 *16=362880. 0.1^4=0.0001. 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So K4 is 36.288.

Sum K0-K4: 1 +0.9=1.9, +3.6=5.5, +22.68=28.18, +36.288=64.468. Correct.

Thus f_2=3.6/64.468= approx 0.05556 or 5.556%.

But the options don't have 5.5%, so I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, earlier I assumed that the dithiocyanato is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, but perhaps the blue color is from a different complex. Let me think: I remember that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is the blue complex. So if the question is about [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, then I should calculate f_4 instead.

Wait, let me re-read the question. It says: "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". Dithiocyanato implies two SCN ligands, but maybe the blue complex is the tetrathiocyanato. Oh, perhaps I was confusing the terms. So perhaps the question is about the [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, which is blue, and it has four SCN-.

Wait, the confusion arises because sometimes the term dithiocyanato might refer to two SCN groups, but sometimes the nomenclature could be different. Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is the [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, which is a tetrathiocyanato complex. So in that case, the problem is asking for the percentage of the [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, which is m=4.

Wait, but the problem states dithiocyanato, which is two SCN, so that would be m=2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect in the term, but the answer options suggest that the percentage is around 16.9%, which is option D. Let's see: what fraction is for m=4.

f4= K4 / sum = 36.288 /64.468 ≈ 0.5628, which is 56.28%. Not matching any option. But looking at the options, the highest is A)42.3%.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the beta values differently. Maybe the β values given are for the overall complexes, not stepwise.

Wait, that's a different approach. Maybe β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^-, β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. So each β is the overall stability constant for that complex.

In that case:

β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) =9.

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]^0/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 )=40.

β3= [Co(SCN)_3]^-/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 )=63.

β4= [Co(SCN)_4]^2−/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 )=16.

If that's the case, then the calculation for each species is different.

In this scenario, the fraction f_m for each species is [Co(SCN)_m]/(sum of all species).

So for [Co^2+], the term is 1. For [CoSCN+], it's β1 [SCN]. For [Co(SCN)_2], it's β2 [SCN]^2. For [Co(SCN)_3], β3 [SCN]^3. For [Co(SCN)_4], β4 [SCN]^4.

So the sum is:

K = 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Each K is then divided by this sum to get the fraction.

Wait, so let me compute each term:

[SCN] =0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term for m=0: 1.

m=1: β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

m=2: β2 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

m=3: β3*(0.1)^3=63*(0.001)=0.063.

m=4: β4*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

So sum K = 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646.

So the fraction for m=4 is 0.0016 /2.3646 ≈0.000676, which is 0.0676%. That's way too small, and it's not matching any options. So that can't be right.

Hmm. So perhaps the initial approach was correct, but I messed up the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species." Dithiocyanato suggests two SCN groups, so m=2.

But according to the first approach, f_2 is approximately 5.55%, which is not among the options. So this suggests that perhaps I made an error in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are provided for each step, but I made a mistake in calculating the K's. Let me recalculate the K's.

Wait, in the first approach, K2 is β1*β2*(SCN)^2. So 9 *40=360. 0.1^2=0.01. So 360 *0.01=3.6.

But wait, [SCN] is 0.1 M. So (0.1)^2 is 0.01, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the β4 is 16, which is lower than β3=63. So perhaps the complexes beyond m=3 are less stable, but it's possible.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate all the K's again.

K0=1.

K1=9 *0.1=0.9.

K2=9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

K3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3= 22680 *0.001=22.68.

K4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4= 362880*(0.0001)=36.288.

So sum is 1+0.9=1.9, +3.6=5.5, +22.68=28.18, +36.288=64.468.

f2=3.6/64.468≈0.05556.

Wait, that's about 5.556%, which is about 5.56%. But none of the options match. So perhaps the problem was that I'm considering the stepwise approach, but the β's given are for the overall complexes, not stepwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the β's are given as the overall formation constants for each complex, not stepwise. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^−, β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

In that case, the fractions would be computed differently.

So each [Co(SCN)_m] is given by β_m [Co^2+][SCN]^m.

So the sum of all species (including [Co^2+]) is [Co^2+](1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4).

So the fraction for each species is (β_m [SCN]^m) / (sum of (β_k [SCN]^k) + 1).

So for the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 species, the fraction f2 is (β2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4).

Wait, the sum in the denominator is:

Denominator =1 + β1*(0.1) + β2*(0.1)^2 + β3*(0.1)^3 + β4*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

β1*(0.1)=9 *0.1=0.9.

β2*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

β3*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

β4*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

So denominator = 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646.

So f2 =0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169, which is 16.9%. That's option D.

Ah, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach, assuming stepwise β's, but the given β's are for the overall complexes. So the correct answer is D)16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]^0) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the stability constants provided and the given concentrations. The stability constants are interpreted as overall formation constants for each complex, not stepwise constants. The fraction of each species is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_m = \frac{\beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}
\]

where \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( \beta_4 = 16 \), and \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 1: Compute the terms in the denominator
1. \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
2. \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \)
3. \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \)
4. \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

The denominator is the sum of these terms plus 1 (for the free Co\(^2+\) ion):
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0
The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.

Answer: D
