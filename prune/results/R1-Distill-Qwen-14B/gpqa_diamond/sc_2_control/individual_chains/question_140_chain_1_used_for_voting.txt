Okay, so I'm looking at this chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 

Hmm, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, right? Wait, no, 273 K is 0 C, so 277 K is 4 C. So B must be a solid at that temperature. Wait, but melting point is the temperature where solid turns to liquid. So B's melting point is around 4 C. What solid melts at around 4 C? Maybe something like ice? No, ice melts at 0. Alternatively, maybe something else. Wait, could it be a carbonate? Or maybe another compound. Alternatively, perhaps B is some kind of salt. Alternatively, maybe it's NH3 or another compound with a low melting point.

But wait, the precipitate G is formed. Then when heated, it releases B. So maybe G is something like a carbonate that decomposes. For example, if G is calcium carbonate, upon heating, it would decompose into CO2 and CaO. But I'm not sure yet.

Let me think about gas W. The molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for a molecule like that, maybe it's a noble gas, like Argon (Ar, atomic number 18; 18 protons and 22 neutrons? Wait, no. Wait, Ar has 18 protons and 22 neutrons. So 18 +22=40. But the number of neutrons and protons in the atom would be 18 and 22, so not the same. So maybe another molecule.

Wait, maybe the molecule is CO2? No, CO2 has C (6 p, 6 n) and two O (8 p, 8 n each). Wait, but the molecule as a whole, maybe the sum. So CO2 has 6+8*2 = 22 protons. Neutrons: 6 (C's) + 8*2 (O's) = 6+16=22. Oh wait, so 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So CO2 would fit. But wait, the question says the gas's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, but in the molecule, each atom's protons and neutrons are summed. So for CO2, 6 (C) + 16 (O2) = 22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, each O has 8, so 6 + (8 *2) = 22. So yes, same number. So CO2 could be gas W. 

So if W is CO2, then the reaction between X and Y releases CO2. So Y must be something that when reacting with X produces CO2. What substances react to produce CO2? Maybe a carbonate reacting with an acid. Or maybe a metal reacting with an acid.

Wait, but the reaction is between X and Y, which is a liquid. Let me think. If Y is a liquid acid, maybe H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), or perhaps another acid. But if X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, then reacting with H2SO4 would produce CO2. Alternatively, maybe X is a bicarbonate.

But then the problem says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. That suggests that one of the elements in X has a higher atomic mass due to a heavier isotope. That might point to an element with multiple isotopes, like chlorine (Cl has 35Cl and 37Cl), or perhaps oxygen.

Wait, when I think of reagents in organic chemistry, X and its analog are used. Common reagents include things like NaOH, KOH, H2SO4, maybe some metals, or perhaps something like Grignard reagents. Alternatively, maybe X is a heavy metal, but I'm not sure yet.

The precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. If Y is an acid, maybe G is a metal hydroxide, but that would precipitate if it's insoluble. Alternatively, G could be a carbonate, but that's more if Y is an acid. Wait, if X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, then perhaps the reaction is: X (carbonate) + Y (acid) → CO2 (gas) + water + salt. But the precipitate would be the salt, which is maybe an insoluble carbonate? Or perhaps the acid is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is water. Hmm, but that's a liquid. Wait, another thought: if X is sodium metal (Na), and Y is water, but that would produce H2 gas, not CO2. So that doesn't fit.

Let me think again. Gas W is CO2, so X and Y reacting to produce CO2. So X could be a carbonate, and Y an acid. Alternatively, perhaps X is a bicarbonate.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a metal carbonate and Y is an acid, the reaction would produce CO2, water, and the corresponding salt. For example, Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O.

But the precipitate G would form. If Y is concentrated sulfuric acid, perhaps the reaction is more vigorous, but I'm not sure about the precipitate. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another solution.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal and Y is a solution of a carbonate. Wait, no, because Y is a liquid. Let me think of another angle.

The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm, keto acids are like acetic acid (CH3COOH), which has two oxygen atoms in the functional group (the carbonyl and the hydroxyl). Wait, but the product would have 2 oxygen atoms. For example, the product could be something like CH3COO^- (acetate ion) if X is a base, like NaOH. But then, the product would be sodium acetate, which has more oxygen atoms.

Wait, maybe the product is something else. Perhaps when a keto acid (like a ketone acid, though I think keto acid is more like a carboxylic acid, but maybe I'm wrong) reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is an ester or something else.

Wait, another approach: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is something like water, but that's only one O. Or maybe a molecule like O2? No, that's not from a reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the product is something like a carbonyl compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a hemiacetal or something, but that's more about functional groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between X and a keto acid to form something like CO2 and water, but I'm not getting it. Maybe I should think about the other parts first.

The question also says that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. What reagents are used a lot? Maybe NaOH, which is used in many reactions. Or perhaps something like H2O2, but that's a liquid. Wait, another possibility: X could be a heavy metal hydride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X must have an element with isotopes. For example, Cl has 35Cl and 37Cl. So if X is something like NaCl, but that's a salt. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound where one element has a heavier isotope.

Wait, the problem also mentions that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So X is a compound made of two elements, probably. So for example, if X is NaCl, the elements are Na and Cl. The lightest element is Na (atomic number 11, so lightest), and Cl (atomic number 17). But wait, their isotopes can vary. However, for the purpose of calculating cumulative atomic masses, we have to sum the masses of all lighter and heavier isotopes. Hmm, but maybe the elements are light, like H and O or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or N2. But then, the isotopes would be O-16 and O-18, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like H2O, but that might not fit the reagent scenario.

Wait, think about the reaction again. X reacts with Y, a liquid, to produce CO2 and a precipitate G. Then when G is heated, it releases B. And B's melting point is about 4 C.

Wait, if G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into CO2 and the oxide. For example, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) when heated would produce CaO and CO2. The melting point of CaO is about 2600 C, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps G is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), which upon heating doesn't decompose at normal temperatures. Wait, but maybe it's a different carbonate.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) decomposes upon heating to produce Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. The melting point of B would then be that of Na2CO3, which is about 828 C, not 4 C. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, another approach: the melting point of B is 277 K (4 C). What solid has a melting point around there? Maybe something like water ice, but that's 0 C. Alternatively, perhaps ammonium chloride? Wait, no, the melting point is higher. Or maybe some other salt like potassium nitrate? No, that's higher too.

Wait, maybe B is something like a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point around 277 K? I'm not sure about that; I might need to look it up, but I don't have that info. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about what B is. The product after heating G is B, and B's melting point is about 4 C. So B is a solid at 4 C. What about something like ethyl ether? No, that's a liquid around room temperature. Alternatively, maybe it's a solid like ammonium nitrate, but that's more about solubility.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate and upon heating, it decomposes to produce B as the oxide. Wait, but the oxide would have a higher melting point. Alternatively, maybe B is CO2, but that's a gas at room temp.

Wait, maybe G is a carbonate hydroxide, like sodium carbonate hydroxide (Na2CO3·H2O), which upon heating loses H2O and CO2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps G is a different compound. Maybe it's a sulfite? For example, sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) when heated could decompose into Na2SO4 and SO2, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bicarbonate, as earlier thought.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal. For example, if G is a carbonate of a metal that upon heating releases CO2 and leaves the metal. But then, the metal would have a higher melting point. Hmm, unless it's a metalloid. Alternatively, perhaps B is a non-metal.

Wait, another thought: if B's melting point is about 4 C, it could be a solid that is just above freezing. Maybe something like a solid organic compound, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a salt that has a low melting point, like sodium nitrate? No, sodium nitrate's melting point is higher. Maybe ammonium chloride? Let me think, I think its melting point is around 334 K (61 C). Not matching.

Wait, another thought. Maybe B is a hydrate. For example, sodium acetate trihydrate (NaC2H3O2·3H2O) has a melting point of about 270 K (about -3 C). Hmm, but the question says 277 K (~4 C). Close but not exact. Or perhaps another hydrate.

Alternatively, perhaps B is some kind of carbonate with water of crystallization. For instance, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point of about 277 K. I think that's correct! Because I seem to recall that sodium carbonate decahydrate (washing soda) has a melting point around 277 K (4 C). So B is washing soda, Na2CO3·10H2O.

Wait, then G is a precipitate which, when heated, releases B. Wait, no. Because G is the precipitate, and upon heating, G produces B. So if G is the decahydrate, perhaps when heated, it loses water and becomes anhydrous. No, because if G is the precipitate and upon heating, it forms B, which is the decahydrate. That doesn't make sense because heating usually removes water.

Wait, perhaps I have it reversed. G is the anhydrous form, and upon adding water, it becomes the decahydrate, but that's not heating. Alternatively, maybe G is the decahydrate, and heating it would lose water to become anhydrous. But then B would be the anhydrous form, which has a higher melting point. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, no. If G is the precipitate, which upon heating gives B. So maybe G is a different compound. For example, if G is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), when heated, it decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So B would be Na2CO3, but the melting point of Na2CO3 is about 828 C, which doesn't fit. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps G is sodium carbonate monohydrate (Na2CO3·H2O), which upon heating would lose water and become anhydrous Na2CO3. But the melting point of the monohydrate is around 277 K. Oh wait, if G is the monohydrate, then heating it would produce Na2CO3 (anhydrous) and water vapor. But the problem states that when G is heated, B is released. So perhaps B is the H2O?

Wait, no, because B is a solid. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Let me try another approach. Let's think about the product of X reacting with a keto acid having 2 oxygen atoms. So if the product has 2 O, maybe it's H2O, but that's not a product of a reaction with a keto acid and X. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester, but that has more O's.

Wait, perhaps the product is an acid anhydride, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base, and the keto acid reacts with it to produce a salt. For example, if X is NaOH, and the keto acid is acetic acid (CH3COOH), the reaction would produce sodium acetate (CH3COONa) and water. Sodium acetate has more O's than 2, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the product is something else. Wait, what if X is something like Hg(OH)2? Then reacting with a keto acid might produce a mercury salt and water. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavy metal, like lead, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the problem says that the product of X and a keto acid has 2 O atoms. So maybe the product is something like CO2, but that doesn't make sense because X is a reactant, not a product. Alternatively, perhaps the product is H2O, but that's only O and H.

Wait, maybe the product is a carbonyl compound, but that's more about functional groups than the number of O atoms.

I think I'm getting stuck on this part. Let me think about the other parts again.

Substance X has a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is something like Cl (with 35Cl and 37Cl). Or maybe something like Hg, which has a lot of isotopes. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like D2O (deuterium oxide), but that's a heavier isotope of H.

Wait, another possibility: X is a diatomic molecule like H2 or O2, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, going back to the reaction between X and Y. Y is a liquid, and the reaction releases CO2. So Y might be a liquid acid, like sulfuric acid. So X could be a carbonate, like CaCO3. But then, Y would be H2SO4. Reacting CaCO3 with H2SO4 would produce CO2, water, and calcium sulfate. So the precipitate G would be CaSO4, which is a solid. But calcium sulfate is sparingly soluble, so it would precipitate. Then, when heated, G (CaSO4) would not decompose to anything because it's already anhydrous. So that doesn't fit with B's melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. Let's say X is NaHCO3. Y is H2SO4. The reaction would produce CO2, H2O, and Na2SO4. So the precipitate could be Na2SO4 if it's insoluble. Wait, Na2SO4 is soluble in water, so it wouldn't precipitate. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a liquid like water, but then the reaction would produce something else.

Wait, maybe Y is a salt solution. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is something like O2 (but that's a gas and I don't think it's from a reaction with X). Alternatively, maybe it's an oxide, but the product would have more O's.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone, but that requires more O's. Hmm.

Let me think about what's used in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, H2SO4, THF, etc. If X is a reagent, perhaps it's NaOH. But does NaOH fit the earlier parts?

If X is NaOH, then when it reacts with Y (a liquid), perhaps Y is an acid. So NaOH (liquid?) reacting with an acid would produce a salt and water. Wait, but NaOH is a solid, not a liquid. Unless it's dissolved in water.

Wait, but the problem says Y is a liquid. So if Y is a liquid acid, like H2SO4, and X is NaOH (solid), then reacting them would produce Na2SO4, water, and release gas? No, that wouldn't produce CO2. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about other reagents. Maybe X is Hg(OH)2, which is a strong base. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the gas W is CO2. So perhaps the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. Another possibility is that X is a carbonate and Y is a strong acid. So for example, Na2CO3 (X) reacts with HCl (Y) to produce CO2, water, and NaCl. So the precipitate G would be NaCl, but NaCl is soluble, so that's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a weak acid, and the salt formed is insoluble. For example, X could be Ag2CO3? Wait, but silver carbonate isn't very stable. Alternatively, perhaps X is BaCO3. If Y is H2SO4, then the reaction would produce BaSO4 precipitate, CO2, and water. So G would be BaSO4, which is a precipitate. Then, when G is heated, BaSO4 is stable and doesn't decompose. So B would be BaSO4, but its melting point is around 1580 C, which doesn't fit the 4 C.

Hmm, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate of a group 1 metal, which when reacted with a strong acid produces a soluble salt. But then there's no precipitate. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the reaction is between X (a carbonate) and a weak acid, producing a weak acid salt which is insoluble.

Wait, perhaps X is CaCO3, Y is HNO3. The reaction would produce Ca(NO3)2, which is soluble, so no precipitate. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydroxide. For example, X is NaOH. Y could be something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a carbonate, but then X would have to be a metal to displace it. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate, and X is a metal that reacts to produce CO2. I'm getting stuck.

Let me think about the product with the keto acid. Suppose X is NaOH and the keto acid is acetic acid. The product is sodium acetate, which has formula CH3COONa. That has 2 oxygen atoms in the acetate ion (O in COO^- and O in Na+? No, wait, sodium acetate is CH3COONa, which has two oxygen in the acetate group. So the product would have more than two O atoms, but the problem says the product has 2 O atoms. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the product is a different compound. Perhaps X is something like Mg(OH)2, which when reacting with a keto acid (like acetic acid) would produce Mg acetate, water. Mg(OH)2 + 2 CH3COOH → Mg(CH3COO)2 + 2 H2O. The product (magnesium acetate) has more than two O atoms. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe the product is something like H2O, but that requires X to be a proton donor and the keto acid to be a base, which isn't the case.

I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should think about the possible options given.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

These are likely the sums of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So X must be a compound with two elements, and the sum of their lightest and heaviest isotopes' atomic masses.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 25. That would be, for example, H (1) and Cl (35). Wait, 1 (H) + 35 (Cl) is 36, not 25. Alternatively, perhaps it's O (16) and F (19), 16+19=35, which is option A.

Option C is 31. That could be O (16) + N (15), but that sums to 31. Or maybe C (12) and F (19), 12+19=31.

Option D is 29. Could be O (16) and Li (7), 16+7=23, no. Or maybe F (19) and something else. 19+10=29, but no element has 10. Alternatively, maybe O (16) and Na (23), which sums to 39. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the elements are H and Cl. H's lightest isotope is H (1), and the heaviest isotope could be Cl-37. Wait, but wait, the problem says to sum all the lighter and heavier isotopes for each element. Wait, no: the question says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." Wait, that could mean that for each element in X, take the lightest and heaviest isotopes, sum their masses, and add them together for all elements.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule of two different elements.

Wait, if X is HCl, which is a gas, but Y is a liquid. HCl is a gas, not a liquid. Alternatively, perhaps X is a solid.

Wait, another thought: X is NaCl. So the elements are Na and Cl. Na's lightest isotope is Na-23 (atomic mass ~23), and the heaviest is Na-25 (atomic mass ~25). Cl has lightest as Cl-35 (~35) and heaviest as Cl-37 (~37). Wait, but I'm not sure if the problem is asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes of each element.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound where each element's isotopes are summed. So for X, each atom's isotopic masses are added. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the lightest and heaviest elements in X are H and Cl. So H's lightest is 1, heaviest (like D, deuterium) is 2. Cl's lightest is 35, heaviest is 37. So sum would be H:1 + Cl:35 = 36? Or H:2 + Cl:37=39? But looking at the options, 35 is one of them, but option A is 35.

Alternatively, if X is a compound with elements H and O, then lightest H (1) and heaviest O (18). 1 +18=19. Not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps X is something like CaCO3. The elements are Ca, C, O. But the question says 'the lightest and heaviest elements present in X'. So, elements present are Ca, C, O. The lightest is C(6) or O(8)? Wait, carbon is 6, oxygen is 8. So the lightest element is C, the heaviest is Ca (20). So C's lightest isotope is 12 (carbon-12), and heaviest is 14 (carbon-14, but natural abundance is low). Ca's lightest isotope is 40 (Ca-40), and the heaviest is Ca-48 (atomic mass ~48). So sum would be 12 + 48 = 60, which isn't an option.

Hmm, maybe X is a compound with elements H and O. So lightest element H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 1+16=17, not an option.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the elements are O and S. O is lighter, S is heavier. O's lightest is 16, heaviest is 18. S's lightest is 32, heaviest is 34. So 16 +34=50, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are F and O. F's lightest is 19, heaviest is 21. O's lightest is 16, heaviest 18. So sum is 19 +18=37, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the elements are C and O. C's lightest is 12, heaviest is 14. O's lightest is 16, heaviest 18. So sum is 12 +18=30, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements like N and O. N's lightest is 14, heaviest 15. O's 16 and 18. Sum 14+18=32, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the elements are O and Cl. O's lightest 16, heaviest 18. Cl's lightest 35, heaviest 37. Sum 16 +37=53, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are H and Cl. H's lightest 1, heaviest 2. Cl's lightest 35, heaviest 37. Sum 1+37=38, no.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere with this. Let me think about the options again. The options are 25, 29, 31,35.

Looking for combinations that sum to these numbers.

Option B:25. Possible combinations: 1 (H) +24 (like Mg) =25? So H and Mg. So if X is MgH2, which is a compound. But in that case, the elements are H and Mg. H's lightest is 1, heaviest (deuterium) 2. Mg's lightest is 24, heaviest is 26. So sum would be 2 (heavier H) +26 (Mg) =28, not 25. Alternatively, 1 (light H) +24 (light Mg)=25. So option B is 25.

But is MgH2 a common reagent? I think Mg is often used as a metal, but MgH2 is a compound, maybe a hydride. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different compound.

Another option: 25 could be 12 (C) +13 (Al). But Al's atomic number is higher, but that would sum to 25. But I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, 25 could be F (19) +6 (C). 19+6=25. So if the elements are C and F, like in PFC compounds. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the sum is 35. That's option A. 35 could be 16 (O) +19 (F) =35. So if X contains O and F, then the sum of the lightest (O=16) and heaviest (F=19) isotopes would be 35. So option A is 35.

But what compound contains O and F? Fluorite is CaF2, but it doesn't have O. Alternatively, maybe a compound like OF2, but that's more a gas. Alternatively, perhaps X is a fluoride with oxygen, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a compound of H and F, like HF. But HF is a liquid, which matches Y being a liquid. Wait, but earlier I thought W is CO2, which comes from a reaction between X and Y. If X is HF, Y would be something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like NaF, but that's a solid.

Wait, let's think about the product of X and a keto acid having 2 O atoms. Suppose X is NaOH, and the keto acid is H2CO3 (carbonic acid). Then the product would be Na2CO3 and water. Na2CO3 has more than 2 O atoms, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps the product is a ketone, but that doesn't make sense because X is a reactant.

Wait, maybe the product is H2O, which has 2 H and 1 O. So the product has 1 O, not 2. So that doesn't fit.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should go back to the initial reaction and think about G and B.

If G is a precipitate and upon heating releases B, which has a melting point close to 4 C, then perhaps G is a hydrate that upon heating loses water to become an anhydrous compound. But the anhydrous compound would have a higher melting point, so perhaps B is the anhydrous form. Wait, no, because heating would remove water, making B the anhydrous form, which has a higher melting point. But 4 C is very low, so maybe B is a hydrate.

Wait, perhaps G is the anhydrous form, and when heated, it doesn't change, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe G is a different compound.

I think I'm going around in circles. Maybe I should look for the answer based on the options and the possible compounds.

The options are 25, 29, 31,35.

If X is a compound containing H and Cl, and considering isotopes, then H's lightest is 1, heaviest 2. Cl's lightest 35, heaviest 37. So the sum would be 1 +35=36 (if taking lightest of each element) or 2 +37=39. Neither is in the options.

Alternatively, if X is NaOH, the elements are Na (23) and O (16), H (1). The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). So their sum is 1 +23=24, not an option. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule of two different elements, each present in multiple isotopes. For example, X is Cl2, but Cl has isotopes. But Cl2 is a diatomic molecule, so each Cl is the same element. So X would be Cl2, but that wouldn't involve two different elements.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like HCl, which has H and Cl. H's lightest is 1, heaviest 2. Cl's lightest 35, heaviest 37. So the sum is 1+35=36, which isn't an option.

Wait, option C is 31. So if the sum is 31, perhaps it's 12 (C) +19 (F) =31. So if X contains C and F, like in PFCs, but I'm not sure what compound that would be.

Alternatively, another combination: 16 (O) +15 (N) =31. So O and N. So if X is a compound containing O and N, like nitric oxide (NO), but NO is a gas. Alternatively, maybe X is a nitrate, but that's more complicated.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound like NH4Cl. Then the elements are N, H, Cl. So lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35). So sum is 1 +35=36, which isn't an option.

Hmm, maybe the elements are N and O. N's lightest is 14, heaviest 15. O's lightest 16, heaviest 18. Sum is 14 +18=32, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the elements are C and O. C's lightest 12, heaviest 14. O's 16 and 18. Sum is 12 +18=30, not an option.

Wait, another idea: the sum is 31. So perhaps the elements are F (19) and S (32). 19+32=51, which isn't an option. Alternatively, F (19) and C (12). 19+12=31. So if X contains C and F, like in a compound such as CH3F. But I'm not sure if that's a common reagent.

But the problem states that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. CH3F is not a common reagent. Alternatively, perhaps X is something like DMSO (which has S and O), but that sum wouldn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: the sum is 29 (option D). So 17 (chlorine) + 12 (carbon) =29? No, 17+12=29? 17+12=29? No, 17+12=29? 17+12 is 29. Oh, yes. So if X contains C and Cl, then the lightest element is C (6), no. Wait, no, the lightest element is C, the heaviest is Cl.

Wait, no, the lightest element is C (6), the heaviest is Cl (17). Wait, no, Cl has an atomic number higher than C. So the heaviest element present in X is Cl, and the lightest is C. So their atomic masses are C:12 and Cl:35 (lightest isotope). So sum is 12 +35=47, not an option.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think about the options again.

Option B is 25. So if the sum is 25, what two elements have lightest and heaviest isotopes adding to 25?

Possibly, H (1) and Mg (24). So 1 +24=25. So the elements present in X are H and Mg.

If X is MgH2, which is a compound. But MgH2 isn't a common reagent, I think. Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavier isotope of H, like D (deuterium), paired with Mg.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if X is a compound like LiH, which is a strong base. The elements are Li (3) and H (1). So sum is 3 +1=4, which is not an option.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option B (25), but I'm not certain.

Wait, if X is NaOH, the elements are Na (23) and O (16), H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24, which is close to option B (25). But it's not matching.

Alternatively, if X is something like Hg(OH)2, which has Hg (lightest Hg-200, atomic mass about 200.59), and O (16), H (1). Sum would be 1 +200.59≈201.59, which isn't an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the elements are O and S. O's lightest is 16, heaviest 18. S's lightest 32, heaviest 34. Sum 16+34=50, which isn't an option.

I think I've tried all possible combinations. Based on the options and the possible elements, the only sum that fits is option B)25, which would be H (1) and Mg (24). So perhaps X is MgH2, though I'm not certain.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C)31, which could be O (16) and F (15), but wait, 16+15=31. Oh! So if the elements are O and F, sum is 16 +15=31. So option C is 31.

Wait, but oxygen's lightest isotope is 16, and fluorine's is 19 (wait, no, F's lightest isotope is 19? No, wait, fluorine's atomic mass is about 19, but the lightest isotope is F-19. So the lightest isotope for F is 19. So for O, it's 16, F it's 19. So 16 +19=35 (option A). But earlier I thought 31 could be O and F. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another mistake. If X contains O and F, the sum of their lightest isotopes would be 16 (O) +19 (F) =35, which is option A. So if X is a compound like OF2, which is a gas, but Y is a liquid. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Alternatively, if X is a compound with O and Cl, sum would be 16 +35=51, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C)31, which could be 12 (C) +19 (F)=31. So if X is a compound of C and F, like TFE (tetrafluoroethylene, but that's C and F), but I'm not sure.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on the options and the possible sums, I think the correct answer is option C)31, but I'm not entirely sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, which reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (CO₂), a precipitate G, and a compound B with a melting point close to 277 K (~4°C). Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W (CO₂):**  
   The molecule of CO₂ has 22 protons and 22 neutrons, making it a plausible candidate for gas W. This suggests that the reaction between X and Y produces CO₂.

2. **Precipitate G and Compound B:**  
   The precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y and releases B upon heating. B has a melting point of ~4°C, which is close to that of sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na₂CO₃·10H₂O). This indicates that G might be a carbonate or a hydrate that decomposes upon heating.

3. **Reaction with a Keto Acid:**  
   The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This suggests that the product could be a compound like water (H₂O), but further clarification is needed.

4. **Isotopes in X:**  
   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. This implies that X is a compound with elements that have multiple isotopes, such as chlorine (Cl) or oxygen (O).

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses:**  
   The question asks for the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options provided are 25, 29, 31, and 35. These values suggest combinations of light and heavy isotopes of elements like hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), fluorine (F), and chlorine (Cl).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (35):**  
  This could correspond to oxygen (O, lightest isotope 16) and fluorine (F, lightest isotope 19), as 16 + 19 = 35. However, X would need to be a compound containing O and F, which is less likely given the context.

- **Option B (25):**  
  This could correspond to hydrogen (H, lightest isotope 1) and magnesium (Mg, lightest isotope 24), as 1 + 24 = 25. However, MgH₂ is not a common reagent, and this combination does not align well with the described reaction.

- **Option C (31):**  
  This could correspond to carbon (C, lightest isotope 12) and fluorine (F, lightest isotope 19), as 12 + 19 = 31. This combination is plausible if X is a compound like CH₃F or a related reagent in organic chemistry.

- **Option D (29):**  
  This could correspond to hydrogen (H, lightest isotope 1) and sodium (Na, lightest isotope 23), as 1 + 23 = 24, which does not match. Other combinations do not fit the given options.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is **Option C (31)**, as it aligns with the possible elements in X and their isotopic masses. The compound could involve carbon (C) and fluorine (F), which are consistent with the described reactivity and the use of X in organic chemistry.
