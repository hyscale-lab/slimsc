Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target molecule. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. Then, at position 1 (which is adjacent to the aldehyde, I think), there's a substituent: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. Wait, that substituent is a methyl group that's attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, it's like a CH2 group where one hydrogen is replaced by -OH and another is connected to a cyclohexane ring.

So, the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group. Attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde (carbon 1) is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So, the structure would be cyclohexane with a -CHO group, and on the same carbon, a CH group that has an OH and a cyclohexyl substituent.

Now, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (-C≡CH) attached. So, the molecule has a triple bond between the cyclohexane and a terminal CH.

I need to figure out how to convert ethynylcyclohexane into the target molecule. Let's think about the possible reactions and reagents that can achieve this.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group. Aldehydes can be formed via oxidation of alcohols, especially secondary alcohols, but wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe via some kind of reduction or addition steps. Let me think about the possible steps.

Wait, the ethynyl group is a triple bond. One common way to modify triple bonds is through hydroboration, hydration, or hydrogenation. But let's think about the overall plan.

I think the general approach would involve functionalizing the triple bond. Let me outline possible steps.

Ethynylcyclohexane (starting material) → something → cyclohexane with a side chain that can be oxidized to an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into an aldehyde. But that might not be straightforward.

Wait, maybe let's think about the triple bond. If I have ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps I can first add a hydrogen across the triple bond to make a cyclohexane with a methylene group (CH2CH2?), but that doesn't seem right. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So, the triple bond is between the ring and the CH2CH.

Wait, no. Ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a substituent where one carbon is attached via a triple bond to another CH, making it -C≡CH.

So, to go from -C≡CH to a substituent that includes a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and eventually an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond can be functionalized by adding a group. One common way is through the addition of a Grignard reagent or via some kind of nucleophilic attack. Alternatively, maybe using a dihydroxylation to make a diol, but that's more for double bonds.

Wait, another approach: the triple bond can be converted into a ketone or aldehyde via oxidation. Wait, but the triple bond is between two carbons. Let me think: oxidation of the triple bond can lead to a diketone or something else. Hmm, maybe that's not the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps adding a functional group to the triple bond. For example, using a hydroboration reaction to add an OH group. But wait, hydroboration is generally for alkynes? Or wait, no, hydroboration is for alkenes. For alkynes, there's other methods, like the use of mercurinium ions.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible reaction sequences in the options given.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reagents.

Let me look at the options and see the possible reactions.

Option A: 
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Wait, that's a typo I think. The third step is Ba(OH)2, then another step 3? Maybe it's a mistake. Let me check.

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li in liquid NH3
3. O3, H2O
4. NH4OH

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3, (CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li in liquid NH3
3. O3, (CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Hmm, okay, so each option involves different reagents. Let me think about each step in the options and what they might do.

First, looking at each first step:

Option A's first step: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, especially in elimination reactions. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl, which is a methylating agent. So perhaps this is an alkylation step, but with NaNH2 as a base. Maybe it's a Birch reduction? Wait, Birch reduction is using NaNH2 and NH3, but here it's NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 and CH3Cl. Maybe the ethynyl group (sp-hybridized) is deprotonated by NaNH2, making a strong base. Then, methyl chloride could act as an electrophile. Wait, but the ethynyl group is CH2C≡CH? No, ethynyl is -C≡CH, attached to the cyclohexane. So, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is C6H11-C≡CH. So, the end is a CH2 group attached to the triple bond.

Wait, maybe the first step in option A is deprotonating the alkyne. NaNH2 is a strong base that can deprotonate terminal alkynes. Once deprotonated, you have a cyclohexyl acetylide. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would be an alkylating agent. So, the acetylide would attack CH3Cl in an alkylation. So, the triple bond would become CH2CH2Cl? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the acetylide would be a strong base. CH3Cl is a primary alkyl chloride, which can undergo an SN2 reaction. So, the acetylide (nucleophile) would attack CH3Cl, substituting Cl with the acetylide. So, the product would be CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane? Wait, no, the acetylide is the deprotonated ethynyl group, so when it attacks CH3Cl, the triple bond would now be CH2Cl-C≡C-cyclohexane? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is alkylation of the ethynyl group. So, after NaNH2 and CH3Cl, the triple bond is extended by a CH3 group. So, original structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH. After alkylation, it becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2Cl? Wait, no, because CH3Cl is methyl, so the substitution would add a methyl group.

Wait, maybe it's an alkyne alkylation. So, the acetylide is formed from ethynylcyclohexane using NaNH2, which deprotonates it, and then CH3Cl adds a methyl group to the acetylide. So, the product would be cyclohexane with a CH2CH2Cl group? Hmm, I'm a bit unsure here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step in option A is a Grignard-like reaction. But I'm not so sure.

Moving on to the second steps:

Option A's second step is H2/Pd. That's hydrogenation. So, the triple bond would be hydrogenated to a single bond. So, if the first step added a methyl group, then in the second step, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so CH2Cl-CH2-cyclohexane? Hmm, but wait, the triple bond is converted to a single bond, so two H2 molecules would add across the triple bond to make a single bond, perhaps with some substituents.

Wait, after the first step, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into an ethyl group with a Cl at the end. Then, hydrogenation would saturate the triple bond into a single bond, so the substituent becomes CH2Cl-CH2-cyclohexane. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Option B's first step is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So similar to option A, but with ethyl instead of methyl. So, perhaps the triple bond is extended by an ethyl group. Then, the second step is Li in liquid NH3. That's a method for Birch reduction or for deprotonating and alkylation. Alternatively, sometimes Li in NH3 is used for elimination or for forming alkenes via dehydrohalogenation, but in this case, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, Li in liquid NH3 can be used for the reduction of carbonyl groups, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's used for alkylation of aromatic rings, but that's more for like Friedel-Crafts. Hmm.

Option B's third step is O3 followed by H2O and NH4OH. Ozone is used for ozonolysis of alkenes, breaking double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if step two produces an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it. But I'm not sure.

Option C's steps: first, NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate (hydrogenation). Then O3 with (CH3)2S (which is a reductive workup, I think). Then Ba(OH)2.

Option D's first step is NaNH2 and methanol. Hmm, methanol is an alcohol, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol could act as an electrophile. So, perhaps the same alkylation as before, but with a methoxide group?

Wait, let me think again about the target molecule. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane, and on the same carbon, there's a CH group connected to a cyclohexyl group and an OH group.

So, perhaps the process involves installing the cyclohexyl group and the hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a secondary alcohol. But how do we get that secondary alcohol?

Hmm, perhaps the ethynyl group can be converted into a substituent with a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. But wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)- group on the same carbon as the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is functionalized to add a cyclohexyl group and an OH group on the adjacent carbon, which can then be oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the sequence of reactions involves:

1. Alkylation of the triple bond to add a substituent.

2. Hydrogenation to make a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form hydroxyl groups.

Hmm, let me think.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule has a structure where the cyclohexane ring (let's say ring A) is connected via a CH(OH)cyclohexyl group (ring B) to the aldehyde.

So, the CH group is attached to ring A (the cyclohexane with aldehyde), and then has a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a substituted ethyl group, then through some steps, an alcohol is formed, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone, which is then reduced to an alcohol, and then some kind of alkylation occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a CH2 group with substituents.

Wait, perhaps we can think of the target molecule as having a structure where the aldehyde is on a cyclohexane ring, and the adjacent carbon has a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. So, the aldehyde is on C1, and C1 also has a CH group with OH and cyclohexyl.

Hmm, perhaps the steps involve:

- Adding a substituent to the ethynyl group.

- Hydrogenation to make a single bond.

- Oxidation to form an aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the connection to the cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is extended with a substituent that later becomes the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a CH2 group with certain substituents. Then, some kind of cyclopropanation or ring-forming reaction could add the cyclohexyl group.

Hmm, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group via alkylation of the ethynyl group. Then, hydrogenation would make CH2CH2 groups, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another idea: the target has both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. That suggests that perhaps a substitution reaction occurred where a leaving group was replaced by both groups. But how?

Wait, maybe the triple bond is converted into a ketone. So, after oxidation, the ethynyl group becomes a ketone. Then, perhaps the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, which is then oxidized to the aldehyde. But where does the cyclohexyl group come in?

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is functionalized to introduce a hydroxyl group, which can then be used for some kind of substitution.

Wait, let me think about the reagents in each option.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then O3, (CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

So, step 1: Alkylation of the triple bond to add a methyl group. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH2Cl-C≡C-cyclohexane after step 1? Or wait, does methyl chloride (CH3Cl) get added as a methyl group via alkylation? So the triple bond becomes CH2Cl-C≡C-cyclohexane? Or perhaps the acetylide attacks the methyl chloride, leading to CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Wait, wait, more accurately, NaNH2 deprotonates the ethynyl group, making the acetylide. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would undergo an SN2 reaction with the acetylide, adding a methyl group. So, the triple bond would change from C≡CH to C≡C-CH3. So, the product after step 1 would be CH2CH3 (but wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so adding a methyl would make -C≡C-CH3? Or is it -C≡C-CH2Cl? Hmm, no, because methyl chloride is CH3Cl, so the acetylide would attack, giving -C≡C-CH3, but that doesn't involve Cl. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. It deprotonates the terminal alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane) to form the acetylide ion: cyclohexane-C≡C⁻. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react via an alkylating agent. The acetylide (a strong nucleophile) would attack the CH3Cl in an SN2 mechanism, replacing Cl with the acetylide. So, the product would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So, the triple bond is now between two carbons, each attached to the cyclohexane and a methyl group.

So, after step 1 in option C, the structure is (cyclohexyl)C≡CCH3.

Then, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is hydrogenation. So, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond. So, (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Hydrogenation of an alkyne (C≡C) under H2 and Pd would add two H's to each carbon, converting C≡C into CH2-CH2. So, the product after step 2 would be cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me think: the alkyne is (cyclohexyl)-C≡C-CH3. Hydrogenation would add two H's to each carbon, making (cyclohexyl)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the structure is cyclohexane attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH2CH3 group? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the hydrogenation would convert each triple bond carbon into a CH2 group. So, (cyclohexyl)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the molecule becomes (cyclohexyl)propane?

Wait, no, perhaps not. The initial structure after step 1 is (cyclohexane)C≡C-CH3. So, when hydrogenated, each of the C≡C carbons gains two H's. So, it becomes (cyclohexane)CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the molecule would be cyclohexane with a propyl group attached: cyclohexylpropane.

Wait, that doesn't seem to help in getting the target molecule. So, perhaps this isn't the right pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe after hydrogenation, the molecule is (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH3, a straight chain.

Then, step 3 is O3 followed by (CH3)2S. Ozone is used for ozonolysis of alkenes, but the molecule is now a single bond. Wait, but after step 2, is there a double bond? No, because it's hydrogenated. So, O3 won't react unless there's a double bond. Hmm, that's confusing. So, perhaps option C is not the right path.

Option B's steps: first, NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So, similar to option C, the triple bond is extended with an ethyl group.

After step 1, the triple bond becomes C≡C-CH2CH3 (if ethyl chloride is used). Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. Li in NH3 is a strong base, often used for elimination reactions or for deprotonation. Alternatively, it can be used for the Birch reduction. Wait, but after adding an ethyl group via alkylation, the structure would be (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, step 2: Li in NH3.

Wait, perhaps the Li in NH3 is used for deprotonating an acidic hydrogen. For example, if the molecule has an alpha hydrogen, like near the triple bond, it could be deprotonated to form a lithium acetylide again. But not sure.

Alternatively, Li in NH3 could be used for elimination, forming a double bond. If the compound after step 1 is (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3, perhaps elimination under Li/NH3 could form an alkene. Wait, but that's if there was a leaving group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the molecule is (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, step 2 is Li in NH3, which could cause deprotonation, but where? Maybe the ethyl group has a β-hydrogen that's acidic. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkyne with a substituent that allows for elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li/NH3 is used to reduce the triple bond into a trans double bond via a deprotonation mechanism. But I'm not certain about that.

Then, step 3 in option B is O3 followed by H2O and NH4OH. Ozonolysis requires a double bond, so if step 2 creates a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

Hmm, perhaps the plan is to create a double bond adjacent to the cyclohexane, then ozonolyse it to form a ketone or aldehyde.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the target molecule again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane, and the adjacent carbon (position 1) has a CH group with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a secondary alcohol which can then be oxidized to an aldehyde. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a diol via some process, but that's more for alkenes.

Wait, another idea. Maybe the ethynyl group is used to introduce a hydroxyl group and a substituent. For example, via hydration of the triple bond.

Wait, the hydration of an alkyne can be done using H2O and a catalyst, which gives a ketone. But if it's a terminal alkyne, like ethynylcyclohexane, hydration would give cyclohexylacetaldehyde (if done with HgSO4 and H2SO4, which is the oxymercuration method). Wait, oxymercuration of a terminal alkyne may produce a ketone because the triple bond is between two carbons, both of which are R groups. Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne (the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and a CH group). So, hydration would give a ketone? Or an aldehyde?

Wait, hydration of a terminal alkyne (like ethyne, HC≡CH) gives an aldehyde (HCHO). So, ethynylcyclohexane, which is C6H11-C≡CH, would, upon hydration, give C6H11-CH2-CHO. So that's cyclohexylacetaldehyde.

Wait, that's interesting. So, if I can introduce an aldehyde group by hydrating the triple bond, then perhaps that's a key step.

But looking at the options, I don't see any option that includes a hydration step. So, perhaps the triple bond isn't being directly converted to an aldehyde, but via another pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is being converted into an aldehyde through a different reagent.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group on adjacent carbons. That suggests that perhaps an oxidation step is involved, converting a secondary alcohol to an aldehyde.

So, perhaps we need to form a secondary alcohol first, then oxidize it to an aldehyde.

But how to get that secondary alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a secondary alcohol via some functionalization.

Wait, considering the options, let's think about option D.

Option D: 

1. NaNH2, methanol.

2. Li in liquid NH3.

3. O3, (CH3)2S.

4. NH4OH.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is CH3OH. NaNH2 is a strong base, which would deprotonate the ethynyl group, making an acetylide. Then, the acetylide would react with methanol. But methanol is a poor electrophile, but perhaps under basic conditions, it can act as an electrophile. Wait, in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, would it lead to some kind of alkylation?

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol via an SN2 mechanism. So, the acetylide (nucleophile) attacks the methyl group in methanol, leading to a substitution. So, the product would be CH3-O-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Wait, but perhaps more accurately, the acetylide would attack the proton in methanol, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the acetylide replaces the hydroxyl group in methanol. So, OMe group would attach to the acetylide.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide would deprotonate methanol, but methanol is not very acidic. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is converting the alkyne into a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the NaNH2 and methanol is causing an elimination, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps in step 1, the ethynyl group is alkylated with a methoxide group. So, the product would be (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH3.

Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. Hmm, this could be a Birch reduction, but Birch typically reduces aromatic rings. Alternatively, perhaps it's a strong base that abstracts a proton, leading to an elimination.

Wait, if after step 1 the molecule is (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH3, then step 2 with Li in NH3 could deprotonate and cause elimination. But where is the proton? Maybe the oxygen has an acidic hydrogen. But OCH3 isn't very acidic. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated again, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation followed by some reaction.

I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should try to think of another approach.

Let me think about the target structure again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane, and the adjacent carbon has a CH group with an OH and a cyclohexyl group.

So, perhaps the ethynyl group is first extended with a substituent that can later become the OH and cyclohexyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve:

1. Alkylation of the triple bond to add a substituent.

2. Hydrogenation to make a single bond.

3. Oxidation to form a carbonyl group.

4. Some kind of cyclopropanation or ring-opening to form the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a diol (using something like HgSO4 and H2SO4, which is a hydration agent for alkynes to diols), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the steps in option C again.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → adds a methyl group to the triple bond.

So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, so (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH3.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But after step 2, there's no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So, maybe this isn't the right path.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation step is partial, but I don't think Pd would do that. It typically fully hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds.

So, perhaps option C is not the correct sequence.

Option D:

Steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forms an acetylide and then reacts with methanol.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → maybe a Birch reduction or elimination.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Hmm, not sure.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → ethyl group added.

2. Li in NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

3. O3, H2O, NH4OH → ozonolysis and workup.

So, after step 1, we have (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond. So, (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 → (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, unless it's a different process.

Wait, perhaps the Li in NH3 is used to deprotonate and eliminate, forming a double bond adjacent to the triple bond. So, after step 1, the structure is (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH2CH3. Elimination would require a leaving group, but there isn't one. So, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is causing a dehydrohalogenation, but without a halogen, I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a trans double bond. Wait, Li in NH3 can sometimes effect the deprotonation of alkynes to form lithium acetylides, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the Li in NH3 is used in a hydrogenation step, but that doesn't align with the reagents.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible functional groups and how they can be formed.

The target molecule has an aldehyde and a secondary alcohol (or perhaps a CH(OH) group) on the same carbon. To form an aldehyde from an alkane, we need to oxidize a secondary alcohol. To form the secondary alcohol, perhaps a reduction of a ketone or a dihydroxylation followed by some steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group can be converted into a ketone, then reduced to a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: in the target molecule, the cyclohexyl group is attached to a CH(OH) group which is on the same carbon as the aldehyde. That suggests that the CH(OH) group comes from a substitution reaction where a leaving group is replaced by both the cyclohexyl group and the hydroxyl group. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is first converted into a bromide, then substituted with a cyclohexoxide group. But that's just a guess.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves the following steps:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a substituent.

2. Hydrogenation to make a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form ketones or aldehydes.

4. Workup to form aldehydes and alcohols.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Wait, looking at the options, option B's steps include O3 and H2O, which is ozonolysis, and then NH4OH, which is a reductive workup. So, maybe the ozonolysis is breaking a double bond into two carbonyl groups, which are then reduced.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

- Alkylate the alkyne to add a substituent.

- Hydrogenate to make a single bond.

- Introduce a double bond via some method.

- Ozonolyse to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group (step 1 in options A, C, D).

2. Hydrogenate to make a single bond (step 2 in options A, C, D).

3. Introduce a double bond via elimination (step 2 in option B, using Li in NH3).

4. Ozonolyse the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

5. Workup to form aldehyde and alcohol.

So, perhaps the steps are as follows:

- Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylate to add a substituent (like methyl) → hydrogenate → form a single bond → introduce a double bond via elimination → ozonolyse → form carbonyl groups → workup.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, let's think about option B again.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylate the alkyne, adding an ethyl group.

So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in NH3 → maybe elimination to form a double bond. So, (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH2CH3 with a double bond somewhere? Or perhaps converting the alkyne into an alkyne again, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the Li in NH3 is causing a deprotonation and elimination, leading to a double bond adjacent to the cyclohexane. So, (cyclohexyl)CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 → (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is causing a reduction of the triple bond to a trans double bond. So, the alkyne becomes an alkene. So, (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2CH2CH3 would have a double bond somewhere, but I'm not certain.

Then, step 3: O3 followed by H2O and NH4OH. Ozonolysis of the double bond would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, if the molecule after step 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two parts, each with a carbonyl group.

But I'm not sure how that leads to the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps form a diol, which can then be oxidized to form the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde.

So, how to form a secondary alcohol from an alkyne.

One method is to hydrate the alkyne into a ketone (HC≡CH → H2C=O, but that's formaldehyde). Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane's hydration would give cyclohexylacetaldehyde. But that's an aldehyde, not a ketone. So, perhaps that's not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps the correct reagents are Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, and H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is the hydration of an alkyne to form a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A includes Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O as steps 3 and 4. So, perhaps step 3 in option A is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, and step 4 is a hydration step (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O).

But I'm not sure. Let's think.

Option A's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation of the alkyne, adding a methyl group.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2 → strong base, possibly elimination or saponification.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → this is the oxymercuration reagent, which hydrates alkynes to ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne is alkylated with methyl chloride, becoming (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenated to (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps causing elimination to form a double bond. So, (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH3 → (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2 with a double bond somewhere? Not sure.

4. Then, H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O would hydrate any triple or double bonds. But after step 3, if a double bond is formed, then step 4 would hydrate it into a ketone or an aldehyde.

Wait, but after step 2, the triple bond is gone, so step 4's reagents might not have a target. Unless step 3 creates a new triple bond, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 in option A is a different step. Maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for saponification, but there's no ester present.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence isn't clear, but perhaps option C is better.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylate alkyne to (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH3.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis, but no double bond present. So, this won't work.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and need to think about the correct order.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation of the ethynyl group with methyl chloride to make (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenation to (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH3.

3. Ozonolysis of a newly formed double bond, but where would the double bond come from? Unless step 2 produces a double bond, but hydrogenation of a triple bond to a single bond doesn't do that.

Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, there's a double bond somewhere else. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the correct pathway is to first form a secondary alcohol, then oxidize it to an aldehyde.

How to form a secondary alcohol from ethynylcyclohexane.

Perhaps:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a substituent.

2. Hydrogenation to a single bond.

3. Oxidative cleavage to form a carbonyl group.

4. Reduction to form an alcohol.

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation to add a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl substituent.

But I'm not seeing how.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forming an acetylide that reacts with methanol to form a methyl ether.

2. Li in NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps to form aldehyde and alcohol.

Wait, perhaps this is the path.

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methanol. The NaNH2 deprotonates the alkyne, forming the acetylide. Then, the acetylide reacts with methanol (as an electrophile) in an SN2 reaction, leading to (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH3.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. This is a strong base and can cause elimination. The (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH3 would undergo elimination, perhaps losing the OCH3 group and forming a triple bond again, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is used to deprotonate and form a lithium acetylide, which could then react further.

Alternatively, perhaps Li in NH3 is used to reduce the triple bond into a trans-alkene. So, the triple bond becomes a double bond.

So, after step 2, the molecule would be (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, the structure is (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH3. Then, step 2, Li in NH3, causes elimination, removing the OCH3 group and forming a new substituent.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Then, step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Finally, step 4: NH4OH. This is a reductive workup, perhaps turning ozonides into aldehydes.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

In option C's steps:

1. Alkylation with methyl chloride → (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate → (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH3.

3. Ozonolysis. But after step 2, there's no double bond, so ozonolysis won't do anything. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that the hydrogenation in option C's step 2 is using calcium carbonate as a catalyst, which might indicate selective hydrogenation, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Option B's steps:

1. Alkylation with ethyl chloride → (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond. So, (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2CH2CH3 with a double bond somewhere.

3. Ozonolysis → cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup.

But I'm not sure how that leads to the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the hydrogenation in step 2 of option C is not complete. Wait, no, Pd is a catalyst for full hydrogenation of triple bonds to single bonds. So, I don't think that's the case.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reagents in the options again.

Looking back, the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group on the same carbon.

The substituents on that carbon are:

- Aldehyde group (-CHO)

- Hydroxyl group (-OH)

- Cyclohexyl group (cyclohexyl)

So, the carbon has three substituents: CHO, OH, and cyclohexyl.

Wait, that's three substituents on a carbon that was originally part of the cyclohexane. How is that possible? Oh, wait, perhaps the target molecule has the CH group with those substituents.

Wait, perhaps the target is a cyclohexane ring where a CH2 group is attached to the ring, and that CH2 is further substituted with an OH and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, no, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the substituent is a methyl group (CH) that is substituted with hydroxy and cyclohexyl. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a -CHO group on the same carbon.

Wait, that may not be possible because a carbon can't have four substituents unless it's a quaternary center. Let me think: the carbon in question is connected to:

- The cyclohexane ring.

- An aldehyde group (CHO).

- A hydroxyl group (OH).

- A cyclohexyl group.

That's four bonds, which isn't possible unless it's a sp3 hybridized carbon with four substituents. So, perhaps the structure is such that the carbon is attached to the ring, the aldehyde, the hydroxyl, and the cyclohexyl.

Wait, but that's four substituents, which would require the carbon to have four bonds, which is possible, but perhaps it's a CH group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct synthesis involves:

1. Adding a methyl group to the triple bond.

2. Hydrogenating the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form a carbonyl group.

4. Workup to form the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

But I'm not entirely confident. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess. Considering the target has an aldehyde and an adjacent CH(OH)cyclohexyl group, I think the correct steps involve adding a substituent, hydrogenation, and then ozonolysis to form the aldehyde.

Looking at the options, option C's steps include ozonolysis after hydrogenation. So, perhaps the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) and a CH group substituted with a hydroxyl (-OH) and a cyclohexyl group. The reagents must functionalize the ethynyl group (-C≡CH) to achieve this structure.

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: The ethynyl group is deprotonated to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride (CH₃Cl) via SN2 to add a methyl group, resulting in (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenation converts the triple bond to a single bond, yielding (cyclohexyl)CH₂CH₂CH₃.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or saponification, but no clear role in forming the target structure.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Hydration reagents, but no double or triple bond remains after step 2, making this step ineffective.

This sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: The ethynyl group is deprotonated and alkylated with ethyl chloride (CH₃CH₂Cl), forming (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH₂CH₃.
2. **Li in liquid NH₃**: A strong base that could induce elimination or deprotonation, potentially forming a double bond.
3. **O₃, H₂O, NH₄OH**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but no double bond is formed in step 2, making this step ineffective.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup reagent, but without a double bond, no cleavage occurs.

This sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: The ethynyl group is deprotonated and alkylated with methyl chloride (CH₃Cl), forming (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenation converts the triple bond to a single bond, yielding (cyclohexyl)CH₂CH₃.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but no double bond is present after step 2, making this step ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, but no clear role in forming the target structure.

This sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: The ethynyl group is deprotonated, and the acetylide reacts with methanol (CH₃OH), potentially forming (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH₃.
2. **Li in liquid NH₃**: A strong base that could induce elimination or deprotonation, potentially forming a double bond.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which could be formed in step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Reductive workup to form aldehydes and alcohols.

This sequence has the potential to form the target molecule by introducing a double bond in step 2, which is cleaved in step 3 to form carbonyl groups, and further modified in step 4.

### Conclusion:
Option D provides the most plausible sequence for synthesizing the target molecule, as it includes steps to functionalize the ethynyl group, form a double bond, and perform ozonolysis to introduce the necessary functional groups.
