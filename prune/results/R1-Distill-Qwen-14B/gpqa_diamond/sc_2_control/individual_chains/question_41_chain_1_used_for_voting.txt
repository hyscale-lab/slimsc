Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. I remember that when objects move, especially at significant fractions of the speed of light, relativistic effects come into play. But wait, the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so maybe I don't need to consider acceleration effects, just relative velocities.

The setup is a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But in this case, the glass is moving, so how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, but speed of light in a medium is always c/n, regardless of the motion of the medium. Or does the motion of the medium affect it? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Because according to relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, but what about in a medium? Like, if the medium is moving, does that change the observed speed of light in it?

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but that's from the perspective of someone at rest relative to the medium. So if the medium (the glass) is moving relative to the lab frame, how do we compute the speed of light in that medium as observed in the lab?

I think this involves adding velocities using the relativistic addition formula. Because the glass is moving, the light's velocity as seen from the lab would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass frame, but relativistically.

Wait, let me think. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So from the glass's frame (which is moving at velocity v relative to the lab), the light's speed is c/n. So to find the lab's frame, I need to use the velocity addition formula.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). Since c is 1 here, it's u' = (u + v)/(1 + u v).

In this case, u is the speed of light in the glass from the glass's frame, which is c/n. Wait, but wait, c is 1 here, so the speed inside the glass is 1/n.

So u = 1/n. So substituting into the velocity addition formula, the observed speed u' is ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v ).

Wait, but that's the speed of the light as seen from the lab. So the numerator is (1 + n v)/n and the denominator is (n + v)/n. So the entire expression simplifies to (1 + n v)/(n + v) divided by (n + v)/n, which is (1 + n v)/(n + v) * n/(n + v) ? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, I think I messed up the substitution.

Wait, u is 1/n, so substituting:

u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate the denominator:

Numerator becomes (1 + n v), denominator becomes (n + v).

So u' = (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v), option C is (1 + n v)/(n - v), and others are different.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To determine the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the speed of light in the glass (from the perspective of the glass) is \( \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the index of refraction.

Since the glass is moving relative to the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula to compute the speed of light as observed in the laboratory frame. The formula is:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u \) is the speed of light in the glass relative to the glass, which is \( \frac{1}{n} \).
- \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.
- \( c = 1 \) (the speed of light in a vacuum).

Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) into the formula:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \).

From the given options:
- **Option A** matches this result: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \).
- **Option C** (\( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \)) is incorrect because it uses \( n - v \) in the denominator, which does not align with the relativistic velocity addition formula.
- **Options B and D** are also incorrect as they do not match the derived expression.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
