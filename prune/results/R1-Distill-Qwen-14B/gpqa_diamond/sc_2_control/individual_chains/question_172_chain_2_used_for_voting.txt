Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. So the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The stars are in LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So that means we can use the Boltzmann equation here, right?

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels in a system. The formula is something like (n₂/n₁) = exp( - (E₂ - E₁)/(k T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. Wait, but in this question, the energy difference is given, so E₂ - E₁ is that 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait no, actually, the energy difference is the difference between the two levels we're considering. So let's make sure about the signs. If E₂ is higher than E₁, then for higher temperatures, the ratio n₂/n₁ would be larger, because the exponential becomes less negative.

In the problem, in star 1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific level. So for star 1, the population in that level is higher. Let's say n1_2 is the population in star 1 and n2_2 is for star 2. So n1_2 / n1_1 = 2 * (n2_2 / n2_1)? Wait, no. Wait, wait, the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So for the same energy level, n1 is twice n2. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the populations between the two levels. Like, for star_1, the ratio of the excited level to the ground level is twice that of star_2.

Wait, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So the ratio of the excited state population to the lower state population is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

So, let's denote n1 as the population in the excited state for star_1, and n2 for star_2. So n1/n1_lower = 2*(n2/n2_lower). But wait, since both stars are in LTE, each star's photosphere follows the Boltzmann distribution. So for each star, the ratio depends on their respective temperatures.

Wait, for each star, the ratio is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( - (ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the upper and lower levels. Since the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, that's ΔE = E_upper - E_lower.

So for star 1, the ratio is n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
And for star 2, it's n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem says that n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower)

So putting it together:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, let's take the natural log of both sides to make this easier. So,

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Rearranging terms:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

So,

(ΔE)/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because (1/T2 - 1/T1) is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ), right? Let me check: 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So yeah.

Then, substituting back, the equation becomes:

(ΔE/(k)) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but the question is giving us ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, I don't know if that's needed for the equation since the options don't have numerical values. So perhaps the equation would involve the ratio of the temperatures.

Wait, but let's think again. Let's rearrange the equation:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ]

Hmm, but wait, the options don't have any constants, so perhaps the equation is written in terms of the temperatures only.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's see the options. The options are:

A) ln(2) = [ T2 / T1 ]

No, that doesn't look right.

B) ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2 )

Hmm, not sure.

C) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )^2

No, that's (T1-T2) over (T1 T2 squared), which seems unlikely.

D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, that's exactly what the equation I derived is, but without the ΔE/(k) factor. Oh wait, because in the equation, the left side is ln(2), and the right is [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] multiplied by (ΔE/k).

Hmm, but wait, perhaps that's not the case. Because in the equation, I have (ΔE)/(k) multiplied by (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) equals ln(2).

But the options don't have the ΔE/k term. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me go back.

We have:

n_upper/n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Given that n1_upper/n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower)

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Bring the ΔE/(k T2) to the left:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 ) ] = ln(2)

So,

ln(2) = [ (ΔE)/(k) * (T1 - T2) ] / ( T1 T2 )

Hmm, but without knowing the value of ΔE, can this equation help us? Maybe the options are structured in a way that the equation is expressed without the constants.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to write the equation in terms of T1 and T2, so the options are just about the structure, not the constants. So, which option matches the structure?

Looking back at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). But that's missing the ΔE/k factor, which would be a multiplicative term. So none of the options seem to have that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the signs. Let me double-check. The energy difference is E_upper - E_lower = ΔE. So for star 1, the exponent is -ΔE/(k T1). If T1 is higher, the exponent is more negative, making the ratio smaller. So if star_1 has a higher temperature, the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) would be smaller, which would mean that star 1 isn't twice as excited as star_2 in that level. Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is higher when the exponent is less negative. So if T is higher, the exponent is more negative: so n_upper/n_lower is smaller. So if star_1 has more excited atoms, then it must have a lower temperature, because the exponent is less negative, so the ratio is higher.

Wait, in the problem, star_1 has twice as excited, which is higher. So n1_upper/n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower).

So, let's say:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take ln again:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Bring terms with T to left:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2 )

Which is same as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Hmm, but none of the options have a ΔE/(k) term. So perhaps the question is only about the structure of the equation, and the actual constants are not part of the options.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But in our equation, the left side is multiplied by (ΔE/k) which is a constant. So the equation in option D would only be correct if ΔE/(k) is 1, but that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something in the setup. Let's think of the problem differently. Maybe the question is about the ratio of the probabilities of excitation, leading to the ratio of the populations.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the excitation temperature or something else. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the ratio of the populations is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), and the setup is that this ratio is twice.

Wait, another approach: Let's say that the excitation is higher in star 1, so the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) is larger in star_1.

So for star 1, ratio R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Star_2: R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Given that R1 = 2 R2.

So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Rearranged:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2 )

Which is:

(ΔE)/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2 )

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But again, the options don't include the ΔE/(k) term. So perhaps the question expects us to select the equation structure that matches, regardless of the constants.

Wait, but the options are:

D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is the same as the structure, except without the ΔE/k factor. So perhaps the question expects us to ignore the constants and match the structure. But that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Because (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) has units of inverse Kelvin, while the left side is dimensionless. So, that can't be correct unless the equation is multiplied by a constant with units of Kelvin.

Hmm, wait in the equation I have:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

So the right-hand side has (ΔE/(k)) which is energy/(energy per temperature) → (energy * temperature)/(energy) → temperature. So the whole right side is (temperature) * (T1-T2) / (T1 T2) ), which has units of (K) * (K^{-1}) → unitless, which matches the left side.

So, but without knowing the value of (ΔE/k), which is energy per (Boltzmann constant), which is 1.38e-23 J / 1.38e-23 J/K = 1 K. Oh wait, wait, wait! Because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Whoa! Oh wait, so (ΔE)/(k) = 1 K. That makes the equation:

ln(2) = [1 K * (T1 - T2)] / (T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Because the K and the denominator's K's would cancel. So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is exactly option D.

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars, star_1 and star_2, based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation is used to relate the relative populations of two energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE):

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1, the excitation ratio is twice that of star_2, leading to the equation:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring the temperature terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}} = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the structure of option D. The other options are incorrect because they do not align with the derived relationship between the temperatures.
