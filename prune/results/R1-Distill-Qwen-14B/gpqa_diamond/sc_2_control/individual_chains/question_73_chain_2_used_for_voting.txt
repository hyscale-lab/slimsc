Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two speeds. Oh right, I remember the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Here, u is the speed of the first astronaut (0.6c) as seen from the second's frame, and v is the speed of the second astronaut (0.5c) in the original frame. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that straight.

Wait, actually, the relative speed would be from one astronaut's frame to the other. So, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction, from A's perspective, what is B's speed?

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. Let's say the original frame is the rest frame. Astronaut A is moving at 0.6c in the positive x-direction. Astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, B's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, that would be ( -0.1c ) / (1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.1428c. But since speed is positive, it's 0.1428c in the opposite direction. But the options have positive relative speeds, so I guess the magnitude is 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So the relative speed would be approximately 0.14c. But wait, am I calculating it correctly?

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the frames. The problem says the two astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction. So from the perspective of the astronaut moving at 0.6c, how fast is the other moving?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of one astronaut as being stationary and the other moving. Let me pick astronaut A (2m) as the one moving at 0.6c. So in A's rest frame, the speed of B would be u' = (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²), where u is B's speed in the original frame (0.5c) and v is A's speed (0.6c) in the original frame.

Wait, no, actually, the formula is when you have two velocities u and v, the relative velocity as seen from the frame moving at v is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So in this case, u is the speed of B in the original frame, which is 0.5c, and v is the speed of A in the original frame, which is 0.6c. So from A's perspective, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c² ). That simplifies to (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c, and it's in the opposite direction. But the problem just asks for relative speed, which is a positive value, so 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. For each astronaut, we need to calculate their relativistic kinetic energy and rest mass energy and sum them.

Wait, the total energy would be the sum of their rest mass energies plus their kinetic energies? Or perhaps it's the sum of their total energies, which include rest mass and kinetic. Because each is moving, their total energy is gamma * m c².

So for astronaut A, mass 2m, moving at 0.6c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E_A = gamma * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B, mass 3m, moving at 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E_B = 3m * 1.1547 c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So the total energy is E_A + E_B = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c², which is about 5.96 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5mc².

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the energy is 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (speed of the first astronaut) and \( v = 0.5c \) (speed of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the relative motion is in the opposite direction, but the problem asks for the magnitude of the relative speed. Thus, \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

From the options, the relative speed is \( 0.14c \) and the total energy is \( 5.96m c^2 \). Thus, the correct answer is:
