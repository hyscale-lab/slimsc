Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a bit, and that causes the spectral lines to shift periodically.

The question says that two stars with the same mass (like the Sun) each have a planet similar to Neptune. The RV method detected them. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the star's mass, as well as the orbital period and the inclination angle. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) * (1/( (P)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term goes away. Also, since M_p is much less than M_star (Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So simplifying, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star)^(1/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ) multiplied by some constants.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = [ (2πG) / (c) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) P^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and sin i is about 1 (assuming edge-on, which gives the maximum velocity). Also, e=0 for circular orbits. So K ≈ [ (2πG)^(1/3) * M_p ] / [ c^(1/3) * M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ]

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), because all the other terms are constants (same M_star, same M_p for both planets). Wait, the planets have similar masses to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both. Since the stars are same mass, M_star is same.

So K ∝ 1 / (P^(1/3)).

So if K1 is 5 milliangstroms and K2 is7, then K2/K1 is 7/5 = 1.4. But wait, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K2 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) * K1? Wait, no, let me think. Let me write the proportionality.

K ∝ 1/ (P^(1/3)) => K = C / P^(1/3), where C is a constant for same M_p and M_star.

So for each planet: K1 = C / P1^(1/3) and K2 = C / P2^(1/3).

So K2/K1 = (C / P2^(1/3)) / (C / P1^(1/3)) ) = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

So rearranging, (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

We can solve for P2/P1. Let me write it down.

Let me take the ratio K2/K1 = 7/5.

So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(7/5)^3 = P1/P2.

So P1/P2 = (7/5)^3 = 343/125 ≈ 2.744.

Therefore, P2 = P1 / (343/125) ) = P1 * (125/343) ≈ 0.364 * P1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So Period of #2 / Period of #1 = P2/P1.

From above, P2/P1 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter.

Wait, but the options are: A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.

So the answer would be option A) ~0.36.

Wait, but why? Because a larger K means a shorter period? Because K is higher when the period is shorter. Because higher velocity (more movement of the star) could mean either a more massive planet (but same here) or a shorter period (since the star has to move quickly, implying a tighter orbit, so shorter period).

Wait, let me think again. If the orbital period is longer, that means the planet is farther from the star. So the star's velocity (as measured by K) would be lower for a longer period because the planet is moving more slowly in its orbit—its orbital speed is lower. So higher K would imply shorter period.

So planet #2 has a larger K (7) than planet #1 (5), so it has a shorter period. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, meaning it's about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.

So the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? So it's shorter, so the factor is less than 1. So the answer is A) ~0.36.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

For Planet #1 and Planet #2, we have:

\[
K_1 = \frac{C}{P_1^{1/3}}, \quad K_2 = \frac{C}{P_2^{1/3}}
\]

where \( C \) is a constant that depends on the masses of the planet and the star, which are the same for both planets. Taking the ratio of \( K_2 \) to \( K_1 \):

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{\frac{C}{P_2^{1/3}}}{\frac{C}{P_1^{1/3}}} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the ratio is:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5}
\]

Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\frac{7}{5} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Raising both sides to the power of 3:

\[
\left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{343}{125} \approx 2.744
\]

Rearranging to find \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is:

**Answer: A**
