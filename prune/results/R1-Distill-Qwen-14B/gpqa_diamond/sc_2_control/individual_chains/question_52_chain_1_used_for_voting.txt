Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and break it down.

So the question is about a star with certain characteristics. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and its radius is 1.5 solar radii with a mass of 1.1 solar masses. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. They say this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—when there are no spots vs. when there are.

Wait, the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels is decreasing when there are spots. So I need to find the ratio (n1/n2) when no spots, divided by the ratio when spots are present. Because the ratio decreases, that means the denominator (when spots are present) is larger than the numerator (no spots). So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Hmm, I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if E is the energy difference between level 2 and level 1, then higher energy levels have lower populations at lower temperatures.

Wait, the energy difference is (E2 - E1) = h c / λ, where λ is the wavelength. Oh wait, the problem says the transition corresponds to 1448 Å, which is about 144.8 nm. That's in the UV range, but I'm not sure how that directly affects this.

So for each scenario (no spots, spots), I need to calculate the ratio (n1/n2) and then find the factor.

First, when there are no spots, Teff is 6000 K. When spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Wait, but how does this affect the photosphere? Well, the effective temperature is an average, but I'm guessing that the spots are cooler regions. So when the star has spots, the photosphere's overall temperature is lower. But wait, the problem says that the photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the entire photosphere is considered to have a lower temperature when spots are present. Wait, but the spots are cooler than the surrounding, right? So maybe the average is lower.

But regardless, since the problem states that the photosphere's Teff is 5500 K when spots are present, I should just use that as the temperature in the Boltzmann equation for the spotted case.

So let me calculate the ratio for each case.

The ratio is (n1/n2) = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). But wait, since E2 is higher than E1, if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So higher temperature would lead to a smaller ratio (because the exponent is positive, so exp(x) is larger as x increases, but wait wait, let me think.

Wait, no. The formula is n1/n2 = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution says that n_i/n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E2 is higher than E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive, so n1/n2 = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). So, when E2 is higher than E1, this ratio depends on the temperature.

So the higher the temperature, the smaller the exponent's value. Because (E2 -E1) is positive, so (E1-E2) is negative, making the exponent negative. So exp(negative) is a fraction, and higher T makes the denominator kT larger, making the exponent less negative. So the ratio n1/n2 would actually increase as temperature increases when E2>E1.

Wait, let me take an example. Suppose E2 is higher, so E2 - E1 is positive. Then at higher T, (E2-E1)/(kT) is smaller. So when you take the negative, it's -(positive)/(kT), which is more negative as T decreases. So exp(negative) is smaller when T is smaller. So for higher T, the exponent is less negative, so the ratio n1/n2 increases.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Boltzmann factor is n_i/n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then E_i is E2, E_j is E1. So:

n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So n1/n2 = exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So when temperature increases, the exponent becomes a smaller negative number, so the value of n1/n2 increases. So higher T, higher n1/n2.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the ratio (n1/n2) would be higher when Teff is higher (no spots: 6000 K) than when Teff is lower (spots: 5500 K). Wait, but the problem says that when spots are present, the ratio decreases. That contradicts what I just thought.

Wait, no. Let me read the problem again. It says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels ... decreases when the star has spots." So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't.

But according to my earlier reasoning, a higher Teff (6000 K) would lead to a higher (n1/n2) ratio. So when the Teff decreases to 5500 K, (n1/n2) would be lower. Which matches the problem statement.

So when there are spots, the ratio is lower. So the factor we're looking for is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

So let's calculate this factor.

First, calculate the ratio for each case.

The energy difference ΔE is h c / λ. Let me compute that. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

ΔE = h c / λ = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (1448e-10)

Calculating that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = (1.9878 / 1448) * 1e-15 J

1.9878 / 1448 ≈ 0.001373. So ΔE ≈ 0.001373e-15 J = 1.373e-18 J.

But maybe it's better to convert this into eV because the Boltzmann constant is in eV/K units. Let's compute ΔE in eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So:

ΔE (eV) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9878e-25 / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 = approx 1.373e-18 J. So that's right.

Then 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx 8.57 eV. Okay.

Wait, wait a second. 1448 Å is 144.8 nm. The corresponding photon energy for 144.8 nm is higher than for visible light. Since E = hc/λ, yes, higher energy. So 8.57 eV is correct, as 100 nm is ~12.4 eV. So 144 nm would be around 8.57 eV. Makes sense.

Now, the Boltzmann factor for each case.

When there are no spots, T = 6000 K.

The ratio (n1/n2) = exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

But since E2 > E1, this is exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So:

ΔE = E2 - E1 = 8.57 eV.

k is Boltzmann's constant, 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So for T=6000 K:

(ΔE)/(k T) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) )

Let me compute that:

Denominator: 8.617e-5 * 6000 = 8.617e-5 * 6e3 = 8.617e-2 = 0.08617.

So 8.57 / 0.08617 ≈ 99.4.

So (ΔE)/(k T) ≈ 99.4.

So the ratio (n1/n2) is exp(-99.4) ≈ a very small number. Hmm, but wait, that can't be right. Because 8.57 eV is a lot of energy, and at 6000 K, the thermal energy kT is much smaller. So the exponent is about 99.4, which is a very large negative number. So exp(-99.4) is practically zero.

Wait, but that would mean that n1 is much larger than n2, which makes sense because higher energy level (E2) would have very few atoms at 6000 K compared to lower level E1.

Wait, but when the temperature drops to 5500 K, what happens?

Let me compute it.

T = 5500 K.

ΔE/(k T) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 * 5500)

Compute denominator: 8.617e-5 *5500 = 8.617e-5 *5.5e3 = 8.617e-2 * 5.5 ≈ 0.4739.

So 8.57 / 0.4739 ≈ 18.09.

So the ratio (n1/n2) becomes exp( -18.09 ) ≈ 1.3e-8.

Wait, but wait. Let me correct this. Because when the temperature changes, the ratio changes. Let me compute the ratio for both cases.

Wait, I'm getting confused because the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. Wait, when the spots are present, the Teff is 5500 K. So (n1/n2)_spots = exp( - (8.57) / (k * 5500) )

Similarly, (n1/n2)_no_spots = exp( - (8.57) / (k * 6000) )

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the exact values.

Wait, but wait. Let me perhaps compute the exponents for both cases.

For no spots:

Exponent = (E2 - E1)/(k T) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) )

Compute denominator: 8.617e-5 * 6e3 = 8.617e-5 *6000 = 0.51702 eV.

So 8.57 / 0.51702 ≈ 16.58.

So exponent is 16.58.

So n1/n2 = exp(-16.58) ≈ approximately 7.2e-8.

Wait, wait a second. No, wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Wait, let's compute it correctly.

Wait, the exponent is (E2 - E1)/(k T). So for no spots, T =6000 K.

So E2-E1 =8.57 eV.

k*T = 8.617e-5 eV/K *6000 K = 0.51702 eV.

So (E2-E1)/(k T) =8.57 / 0.51702 ≈16.58

So the exponent is 16.58.

So n1/n2 = exp(-16.58) = ?

Hmm, exp(-16) is about 1.1e-7, exp(-17) is about 3.1e-8. So 16.58 is between them. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using natural logarithm base. But perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio of the two ratios.

Wait, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Which is [exp(-ΔE/(k T_no))]/[exp(-ΔE/(k T_sp)))] = exp( [ΔE/(k T_no)] - [ΔE/(k T_sp)] )

So factor = exp(ΔE/(k) [1/T_no - 1/T_sp] )

Let me compute that.

ΔE/(k) =8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) )= 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99400 K.

So 1/T_no =1/6000 = 0.00016667 K^-1.

1/T_sp =1/5500 =0.00018182 K^-1.

So [1/T_no - 1/T_sp] = 0.00016667 -0.00018182 = -0.00001515 K^-1.

So factor = exp(99400 K * (-0.00001515 K^-1) )

Compute 99400 * (-0.00001515) = -1.507.

So factor = exp(-1.507) ≈ 0.221.

Wait, that would mean that the ratio when no spots is about 0.221 times the ratio when there are spots. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present, so (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. So the factor (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots should be greater than 1.

But according to this calculation, it's 0.221, which is less than 1, implying that the ratio when no spots is lower than when spots are present. That's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me re-express the formula.

The ratio is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Which is [exp(-ΔE/(k T_no))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T_sp)))] = exp( (ΔE/(k T_sp)) - (ΔE/(k T_no)) )

Wait, because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents. So:

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b).

So a = (-ΔE)/(k T_no), b = (-ΔE)/(k T_sp).

So (a - b) = [ (-ΔE)/(k T_no) ) - ( (-ΔE)/(k T_sp) ) ] = ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_sp) - 1/(T_no) ) ].

So factor = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T_sp -1/T_no) )

Let me compute that again.

ΔE/k = 8.57 eV / 8.617e-5 eV/K ≈ 99400 K.

1/T_sp = 1/5500 ≈1.818e-4 K^-1.

1/T_no =1/6000≈1.667e-4 K^-1.

So 1/T_sp -1/T_no = (1.818e-4 -1.667e-4) = 0.151e-4 =1.51e-5 K^-1.

So (ΔE/k)(1/T_sp -1/T_no) =99400 * 1.51e-5 ≈99400 * 0.0000151≈.

Calculate:

99400 * 0.0000151 = let's compute:

0.0000151 * 1e5 =1.51, so 99400 is 994 * 100, so 994 * 1.51 ≈ 994 *1.5 =1491, plus 994*0.01=9.94 → 1500.94.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute 99400 * 0.0000151:

99400 * 0.0000151 = 99400 * 1.51e-5.

Which is equal to 99400 *1.51e-5 = (99400 *1.51) * 1e-5.

99400 *1.51 → 99400 *1 =99400, 99400 *0.5=49700, 99400 *0.01=994 → 99400 +49700=149100 +994=150,094.

So 150,094 *1e-5 = 1.50094.

So the exponent is approximately 1.50094.

So factor = exp(1.50094) ≈4.48.

So the factor is about 4.48, which would correspond to option C) ~4.5.

Wait, wait, but previously I thought the factor was exp(1.5), which is about 4.48, so option C is ~4.5. So the correct answer would be C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels using the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The problem involves two scenarios: when the star has no spots (\( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) and when the star has spots (\( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta E \)
The wavelength of the transition is \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Using \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), the energy difference is:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the ratio for each case
The ratio of populations is:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \). For \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k T} = \frac{8.57}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})(6000)} \approx 16.58,
\]

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2}_{\text{no spots}} = \exp(-16.58) \approx 7.2 \times 10^{-8}.
\]

For \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k T} = \frac{8.57}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})(5500)} \approx 18.09,
\]

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2}_{\text{spots}} = \exp(-18.09) \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-8}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the factor
The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{7.2 \times 10^{-8}}{1.3 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.54.
\]

### Step 4: Refine the calculation
To refine, the factor can also be expressed as:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\Delta E / k \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E / k \approx 99400 \, \text{K} \), \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(99400 \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right)\right).
\]

Compute \( \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001515 \, \text{K}^{-1} \), so:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(99400 \times 0.00001515) \approx \exp(1.507) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**.
