Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question involves two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm. Let me see what I remember from my classes.

The problem states: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Oh right, because they're moving in the same direction, but at different speeds. So for the relative speed, I think it's not just subtracting the velocities in a classical way, because when you're dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just do a simple subtraction. I remember that special relativity has a specific formula for adding velocities.

So the first part is finding the relative speed. Let's think about that. In classical mechanics, if two objects are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is just the difference. But in relativity, it's more complicated because of the way velocities add up. Oh, right! The formula for adding velocities in relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, wait, that's when you have two frames moving relative to each other. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

Wait, no, actually, the formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving at u and v in the same direction, as observed from a stationary frame, would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). But wait, wait no, wait. Let me think again. Because if the two astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the same direction, then from the perspective of the first astronaut (the one moving at 0.6c), the second astronaut (moving at 0.5c) would seem to be moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Wait, no, no. Wait, because if the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second is moving at 0.5c, so their relative speed as seen by the first would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, but wait, actually, the formula is: if you're on a frame moving at velocity u relative to a stationary frame, then the velocity of another object in your frame would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So in this case, the first astronaut is moving at u = 0.6c. The second is moving at v = 0.5c. So the relative velocity between them, as measured by the first astronaut, would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me calculate that.

Wait, let me compute the numerator first. 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - ( (0.6c * 0.5c) ) / c². The c^2 in denominator: 0.6c * 0.5c = 0.3 c². So 0.3 c² / c² = 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity is (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.142857 c. The negative sign just means the second astronaut is moving in the opposite direction relative to the first astronaut's frame. So the magnitude is about 0.142857 c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's the relative speed. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, which is about 0.14 times the speed of light.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 0.14c for v_rel, and option D is also 0.14c. So that's correct for the relative speed part.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm. So each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, and the total energy would be the sum of their individual energies.

Relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for each, we need to calculate their gamma factor, multiply by their respective masses, and sum them.

So astronaut 1 has mass 2m and velocity 0.6c. Let's compute gamma for him.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2 has mass 3m and velocity 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² ≈ 5.964 m c².

Hmm, looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 m c², which matches, and v_rel=0.14c. So option C is v_rel =0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2. So that's the correct choice.

Wait, but why is option B E=4.96 mc²? Oh, maybe if someone added the velocities classically, but that's not correct here. Alternatively, perhaps someone thought to add the gamma factors in a different way. But no, the energy calculation is straightforward. Each's energy is computed individually and summed.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at velocities \( u \) and \( v \) in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass \( m_1 = 2m \), velocity \( v_1 = 0.6c \):
  \[
  \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
  \]
  \[
  E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
  \]

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass \( m_2 = 3m \), velocity \( v_2 = 0.5c \):
  \[
  \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
  \]
  \[
  E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
  \]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
