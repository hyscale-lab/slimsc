Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states as well as pure states. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ><ψ|, while mixed states are statistical ensembles of pure states.

Wait, so the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That looks familiar. Oh right! That's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because in a two-level system, the maximally mixed state has equal probability for both states, so 0.5 each. That makes sense because the trace should be 1, and the diagonal elements are 0.5 each.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I think qubit space is often represented in terms of Bloch vectors. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a single qubit, any state can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector pointing from the origin to a point on or inside the unit sphere. So the state is a mixed state when the vector r has length less than 1, and pure when it's on the surface (length 1).

The general form for a density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let's expand that. The I matrix is 2x2 identity, so I/2 is [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]]. The r·σ would be r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. So each term is a matrix.

Wait, the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute that. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (I)/2. 

Wait, but that can't be right. Because I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so I/2 would be [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]]. But the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is exactly I/2. So yeah, ρ is I/2.

Now, using the Bloch vector form: ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. So if ρ is I/2, then (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. Subtract I/2 from both sides, we get (r·σ)/2 = 0. So r·σ must be zero matrix.

What's r·σ? Let's think. It's r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. For this sum to be zero, each coefficient must be zero. Because σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices, which are linearly independent. So each term must be zero. Therefore, r_x = 0, r_y=0, r_z=0. So the vector r is (0,0,0). 

So the geometrical position is at the origin. That would correspond to the maximally mixed state. Because the origin in the Bloch sphere represents the completely mixed state, which has no coherence and equal probabilities for both states.

Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the probabilities for the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) are equal (0.5 each). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, any state can be written as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector representing the Bloch vector. Expanding this, the identity matrix \(I\) contributes \(\frac{1}{2}I\) to the density matrix, and the term \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\) depends on the components of \(\mathbf{r}\).

For the given \(\rho\), we observe that:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right) = \frac{1}{2} I.
\]

This implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), as the density matrix has no off-diagonal terms and only the identity term contributes. Since \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) consists of linearly independent matrices, the only solution for \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\) is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). Thus, the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).**
