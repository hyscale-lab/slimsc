Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds to metal ions like Ca²+.

The question asks for the concentration of calcium ions. Wait a second, if the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, that means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But because EDTA forms a complex with Ca²+, the free calcium concentration in solution should be really low, right? Because most of the calcium is tied up in the complex.

They also gave me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. I remember that the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2−, and Kf is [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

But in this case, the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, which I think means that all the calcium and EDTA are present in a 1:1 ratio because the complex is formed completely. Wait, no, that's not right. At stoichiometric, you have the same molar amounts, but not necessarily all complexed. Wait, maybe it's under ideal pH, which is given, so maybe it's at the point where the EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex.

Wait, maybe I should model the problem. The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaEDTA^2−] as 0.02 M. But when this complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. So the dissociation reaction is:

CaEDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10. But the reverse reaction would have a K equal to 1/Kf, right? Because K for the dissociation is 1/Kf.

So the dissociation constant K_d = 1/Kf = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So the expression for K_d is [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]/[CaEDTA²−] = 2e-11.

But wait, if the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²−, then initially, before dissociation, [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. But upon dissociation, some of it breaks down into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. Let me define x as the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So:

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is likely very small compared to 0.02)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x

So plugging into K_d:

(x)(x) / 0.02 = 2e-11
x² = 0.02 * 2e-11
x² = 4e-13
x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5?

Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches this. So the concentration of calcium ions is about 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but I should double-check my steps. Did I get the K right? The formation constant Kf is [complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). So the reverse, Kd is [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]/[complex] = 1/Kf. Yup, that's correct.

Also, since Kf is a large number, the complex is very stable, so x should be really small, so the approximation [CaEDTA²−] ≈ 0.02 is valid. So x² is 0.02 * (1/Kf) = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13, yeah. So x is 2e-6.5, which is about 6.3e-7 M. So option C is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \rightleftharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) at equilibrium. Since the dissociation is small, we approximate:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times K_d = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
