Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is given by v = sqrt(kA²/m), where k is the spring constant, A is the amplitude, and m is the mass. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things are a bit different.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So, I guess the kinetic energy can't be treated classically anymore. I think in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy.

The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². But wait, in the relativistic case, the potential energy might be similar, but the expressions for energy and momentum change.

So the system obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx, but we have to consider relativistic mechanics. The total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy.

At maximum displacement, the oscillator is at rest in terms of velocity, so all the energy is potential. At maximum speed, it's moving the fastest, so all the energy is kinetic. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, maximum speed occurs when the oscillator passes through equilibrium, so at that point, all the energy is kinetic. Because the potential energy is zero there.

Wait, no, wait. The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is ½ k x², so when x is maximum (amplitude A), the potential is maximum, and kinetic energy is zero. When x is zero, the oscillator is moving fastest, so kinetic energy is maximum, and potential is zero. So in the relativistic case, at x=0, the kinetic energy is maximum, which would be E = K = gamma mc² - mc². Because gamma is the Lorentz factor, so E = K + mc² = gamma mc². So K = (gamma - 1) mc².

But wait, where does the potential energy come into play? Since the oscillator is conservative, the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) should be conserved. But in relativity, is the potential energy still considered separately?

Another thought: Maybe the total energy is (gamma) mc², which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic. But when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the potential energy is maximum, so the kinetic energy is zero. So in that case, the total energy would be the potential energy plus rest mass energy.

Wait, but in the classical case, the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², and the total energy is (1/2)kA². So in relativity, the total energy E would be equal to the potential energy plus the kinetic energy. But at maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)kA² + mc²? No, that can't be right because in relativity, E includes rest mass energy already. Wait, no, wait: in the classical case, the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) is (1/2)kA². So in relativity, I think the total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The total mechanical energy in the classical case is (1/2)k A², which is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². So perhaps the total energy is (gamma) mc², which equals the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy, which in turn equals the potential energy at maximum displacement.

Wait, but the potential energy in the harmonic oscillator is ½ k x². So at x=A, the potential is ½ k A². So in the relativistic case, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy E is the potential energy plus the rest energy? Or is the rest energy already included in the potential energy?

I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe a better approach is to consider the conservation of energy. The total energy at any point is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement, the potential is ½ k A², and the kinetic is zero, so E = ½ k A². Wait, but that doesn't include the rest mass energy. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up different concepts.

Wait, in relativity, the total energy includes the rest mass. So if the oscillator is part of a system, the total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and the mechanical energy. Or maybe in this problem, the potential energy is part of the total energy. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², and the kinetic energy is relativistic. So at any point, the total energy E = (gamma) mc² = (1/2)k x² + K, where K is the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, but at maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy K is zero. So E = (1/2)k A² + 0 = (gamma) mc². But wait, (gamma) mc² would just be mc² when velocity is zero, because gamma is 1 when v=0. So that would imply (1/2) k A² = mc². But that can't be correct because the amplitude A should be related to the spring constant and mass, not the speed of light.

Wait, perhaps in the relativistic scenario, the potential energy is not just (1/2)k x². Maybe the energy considerations are different. Alternatively, perhaps the equation of motion is modified.

Wait, the force is F = -k x, which in Newtonian mechanics leads to F = m a = -k x. But in relativity, the equation of motion changes. Oh, right! The equation of motion for a relativistic oscillator isn't the same as the Newtonian case. So perhaps I need to derive the equation of motion.

In special relativity, momentum p is gamma m v, and F = d p / dt. So F = gamma m a + (gamma^3 m a²)/c² v. Hmm, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator can be written as (d²x/dt²) + (k/m) x = 0, but with relativistic corrections. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is different. Let me think. The force is F = -k x. But relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v. So F = dp/dt = d(gamma m v)/dt = m [d(gamma v)/dt ].

So F = m [ (gamma v)^2 / (c²) ) * a + gamma a ].

Wait, maybe I should consider the force equation. Let's see, F = -k x.

In Newtonian mechanics, F = m a. But with relativity, F = gamma^3 m a^2 v / c² + gamma m a. Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I can write the equation of motion as:

F = d (gamma m v) / dt = -k x.

But this leads to a more complex differential equation. Perhaps it's non-linear and difficult to solve. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use energy considerations. The total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. At maximum velocity, the oscillator is at the equilibrium position (x=0), so the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy K is (gamma - 1) m c². So, the total energy E is gamma m c² = K + rest energy = (gamma - 1) m c² + m c² = gamma m c². Which checks out.

But how does the potential energy come into play? At maximum displacement, x = A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential energy is maximum.

In the classical case, the potential energy is ½ k A², and the total energy is ½ k A², which equals (1/2) m omega² A², where omega is sqrt(k/m).

But in the relativistic case, perhaps the potential energy is ½ k A², and the total energy is E = ½ k A² + m c². Wait, does that make sense?

Wait, that can't be because when the oscillator is at rest (x=A, velocity zero), the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy would be E = m c² + ½ k A². And when it's at x=0 (maximum speed), the potential energy is zero, so the total energy E = gamma m c².

So setting the two expressions equal: gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2) k A².

Wait, that's an equation we can solve for gamma. Let me write that:

gamma = 1 + (1/2) (k A²) / (m c²).

Hmm, but wait, gamma is always greater than 1, so (1/2) (k A²)/(m c²) must be positive, which it is.

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). Wait, no, because (1/2) k A² is the potential energy, so 1/2 k A² = (gamma - 1) m c²? No, wait, when x=A, the potential is ½ k A², and the kinetic is zero, so the total energy is E = ½ k A² + m c².

But when x=0, E = gamma m c² = ½ k A² + m c².

So gamma = 1 + (½ k A²)/(m c²).

Hmm. So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, that's a bit of an equation. Now, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so we can set that equal to 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me compute gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (2 m c² + k A²) )/(2 m c²) )

Wait, but gamma must be greater than or equal to 1, which it is.

So from gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ), we can solve for v.

So let's write:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Wait, but let me compute 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) as gamma.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me let (k A²)/(2 m c² ) = some term, say, alpha.

So alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Then gamma = 1 + alpha.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha )².

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha )².

Then, v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha )².

Let me compute 1/(1 + alpha)^2:

1/(1 + alpha )² = 1/(1 + 2 alpha + alpha² )

But perhaps it's easier to compute 1 - 1/(1 + alpha )².

Which is [ (1 + alpha )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha )^2.

Expanding numerator: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha² -1 = 2 alpha + alpha².

So, v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha )^2.

But since alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), and likely small unless the amplitude is very large, maybe we can approximate for small alpha. But the answer options don't seem to involve approximations, so perhaps we need to keep it exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in deriving gamma. Let me go back.

Wait, earlier I thought that at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic is zero, so E = (1/2)k A² + m c². At x=0, the kinetic is (gamma -1) m c², so E = gamma m c².

So equate the two: gamma m c² = (1/2)k A² + m c².

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So that's correct.

So, substituting back, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me let (k A²)/(2 m c² ) = a.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + a).

Square both sides: 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2.

So, v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2.

Which is [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2a + a²) -1 = 2a + a².

So, v²/c² = (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

Factor numerator: a(2 + a) / (1 + a)^2.

But a = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So, v² = c² * [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a )^2.

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can express v in terms of a and c.

Wait, another approach: let's go back to the equation.

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2.

We can write this as:

v²/c² = ( (1 + a )^2 - 1 ) / (1 + a )^2.

Expanding the numerator: (1 + 2a + a² - 1 ) = 2a + a².

So,

v²/c² = (2a + a²)/(1 + a )^2.

Factor numerator: a (2 + a ) / (1 +a )^2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, let's factor (2a +a² ) as a (a + 2 )

Denominator is (a + 1 )^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ a (a + 2) ] / (a + 1 )^2.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Let me compute this expression.

Wait, let me compute (a + 2 ) / (a +1 )^2.

But maybe it's better to compute this in terms of a.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the denominator as (a +1 )^2 = a² + 2a +1.

The numerator is a(a +2 )= a² + 2a.

So,

v²/c² = (a² +2a )/(a² + 2a +1 )

= [ (a² + 2a) ] / ( (a +1 )^2 )

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator as a (a +2 ), but I'm not seeing a clear simplification.

Wait, maybe I should compute this expression in terms of a.

But perhaps the answer options can give me a clue.

Looking at the options:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, looking at the options, I think that none of them match exactly what I have. Let me compute each option.

Wait, let me compute the expression I have:

v = c * sqrt( (2a + a²) / (1 + a )^2 )

Where a = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

(2a + a²) = a(2 + a )

Denominator: (1 +a )^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( [a (2 + a ) ] / (1 +a )^2 )

= c * sqrt( a (2 + a ) ) / (1 +a )

Wait, but none of the options seem to match this directly.

Wait, let me compute option B:

Option B: v = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, let me compute the term inside the square root.

Compute denominator: 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) = 1 - a.

So, 1 + 1/(1 - a ) = ( (1 -a ) +1 ) / (1 - a ) ) = (2 - a ) / (1 - a )

So, v = c sqrt( (2 - a )/(1 -a ) )

Hmm, which is different from what I have.

Wait, other options:

Option A: sqrt(1 +1/(1 - a )^2 ), where a is (k A^2)/(2 m )

Wait, because in option A, the denominator is 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m )

So, in option A, the term is 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m ))^2 )

Hmm, that seems more complicated.

Option C: v_max = sqrt(k A²/m ), which is the classical answer. But in relativity, that's not correct because of the gamma factor.

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Hmm, let me compute that.

Compute 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2, where a is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which is ( (1 +a )^2 -1 )/(1 +a )^2 = (2a + a² )/(1 +a )^2.

Which is exactly the same as the numerator and denominator I have.

Wait, no. Wait, the expression I have is v^2/c^2 = (2a +a²)/(1 +a )^2, which is (2a + a²)/(1 +a )^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2a +a²)/(1 +a )^2 )

= c * sqrt( (a (2 +a )) ) / (1 +a )

Hmm, but option D has v_max = c sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + a )^2 ] )

Wait, 1 - 1/(1+a )^2 = [ (1+a )^2 -1 ]/(1+a )^2 = (2a +a² )/(1+a )^2.

Which is exactly the same as what I have for v²/c².

So, v_max = c * sqrt( (2a +a² )/(1+a )^2 ) ) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1+a )^2 )

Which is exactly what option D says.

Wait, option D says:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Yes. So, substituting a = (k A^2)/(2 m c² ), then 1 + a = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so 1/(1 +a )^2 is 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

So, option D is v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Which matches my calculation.

Wait, but earlier I thought my expression was v² = c² (2a +a²)/(1+a )^2.

Which is equal to c² [ (1+a )^2 -1 ]/(1 +a )^2 ) = c² (1 - [1/(1 +a )^2 ] )

Which is the same as option D.

So, the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Option D: v_max= c√[1−1/(1+(kA²)/(2mc^2))² ]

Yes, that's exactly what I found.

So, the answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), spring constant \( k \), and maximum amplitude \( A \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations. The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so the total energy is purely potential, given by \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2 \). At maximum speed (\( x = 0 \)), the total energy is entirely kinetic, expressed as \( E = \gamma mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

Equating the two expressions for total energy at \( x = A \) and \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Let \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + a
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + a)^2
\]

Rearranging:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = \frac{(1 + a)^2 - 1}{(1 + a)^2}
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = \frac{2a + a^2}{(1 + a)^2}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{\frac{2a + a^2}{(1 + a)^2}}
\]

Substituting \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}
\]

This matches **Option D**. The other options are inconsistent with the relativistic energy analysis:

- **Option A**: Incorrectly includes a term \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m} \), which does not match the relativistic derivation.
- **Option B**: Incorrectly includes a term \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), which is not derived from the relativistic energy balance.
- **Option C**: Represents the classical result, which does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
