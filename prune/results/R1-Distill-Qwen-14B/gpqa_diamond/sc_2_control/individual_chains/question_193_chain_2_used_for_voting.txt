Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. They've observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, parallax is usually denoted by the symbol 'π' or sometimes 'p'. Parallax is inversely related to distance—so as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Wait, the formula given is number ~ 1/(plx^5). So that's like N ~ 1/(π)^5. But I remember that parallax π is equal to 1 over distance (in parsecs) divided by 10, or something like that. Oh wait, parallax π in arcseconds is equal to 1 / d, where d is in parsecs. So π = 1/d. So d = 1/π.

So, if the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(π^5), substituting d in terms of π gives N proportional to (1/(1/d))^5 )= d^5. Wait, no, wait. Let me do the substitution correctly.

Wait, π = 1/d (since d is in parsecs). So 1/π is d. So 1/(π^5) is (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is asking, when you move a little bit further away (per unit distance), how does the number of stars change? So I think the question is about the rate of change of N with distance, like dN/dr.

Wait, but if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr is 5d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would increase with d^4. Or wait, no—the way the question is phrased, "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)"—maybe they're asking for the number of stars in a shell at radius r, as opposed to the cumulative number within radius r.

Wait, no, I think the question is about the number density in a shell. Because in astronomy, when you count stars in a region, you're considering a volume. So the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr would be N(r) dr proportional to 4π r² dr multiplied by the number density at that radius.

Wait, but the given relation is N varies as 1/π^5. Let me perhaps think in terms of integrating over a volume.

Wait, wait, no. Let me get this straight. The number of stars in a region is given as N ∝ 1/π^5. But π is 1/d. So substituting, N ∝ (1/(1/d))^5 )= d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, that can't be right because that would mean the number of stars increases rapidly with distance, which doesn't make much sense. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again.

The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/π^5. So when parallax increases (which is when distance decreases), the number of stars increases? Because 1/π^5 would get bigger as π gets smaller (since π is 1/d, making d bigger when π is smaller). Oh, so as distance increases (d increases), parallax π decreases, and 1/π^5 increases. So N would increase with d^5.

Wait, but that would mean that there are more stars further away, which isn't right because the density of stars in our galaxy tends to fall off with distance from the galactic center. But maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where the number increases with distance. Hmm.

But regardless of whether that makes sense in reality, the question is about the mathematical relationship. So if N is proportional to d^5, then when you're looking at the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r, the number would be proportional to something else.

Wait, but the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr would be N_shell = N(r) * 4π r² dr. Because the volume of the shell is 4π r² dr, and if the number density is N(r), then the number in the shell is 4π r² dr * n(r), where n(r) is the number per volume.

Wait, but in this case, the question says that N varies with parallax as 1/π^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is a constant.

But wait, wait. No, N is the number in a region, but perhaps we're treating N as the number per unit volume, the number density. Because if N were the total number, it would depend on the volume as well. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply stating the relation between N and parallax π. So N = const * (1/π^5) = const * d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Now, how does N change as a function of distance? If N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a given region (volume) increases with d^5.

But the question is about how the number changes per unit distance. So perhaps they're asking about the derivative of N with respect to r, but that would be dN/dr = 5 d^4. So the number increases with r^4.

Wait, but the options don't have r^4 as an answer except option C. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) ~ r^3
B) ~ r^5
C) ~ r^4
D) ~ r^2

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about it another way. The number of stars per unit volume at distance r is the number density. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number density n(r) is N divided by the volume of the region. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the total number in a volume would be n(r) * volume.

But perhaps the question is simplifying things by considering a particular way of counting stars. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is considering the number of stars in a certain solid angle or something else.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars observed in a region with a certain parallax. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, higher parallax means closer distance. So if N ∝ 1/π^5, then N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, N increases. But how does the number change per unit distance?

Wait, perhaps the question is treating N as the number per unit volume. So if N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr = 5d^4. So per unit distance, the number increases as r^4. So the answer would be option C.

But wait, this seems a bit off because the number of stars per unit volume should decrease with distance in a typical galaxy model, but perhaps this is a different scenario. So maybe the correct answer is option C, ~ r^4.

The question involves determining how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\pi^5} \), where \( \pi \) is the parallax. Parallax is inversely related to distance (\( \pi = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs). Substituting \( \pi = \frac{1}{d} \) into the given relationship, we find \( N \propto d^5 \), meaning the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

To determine how the number of stars changes per unit distance, we consider the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \). Since \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dd} \propto d^4 \). This indicates that the number of stars per unit distance increases with \( d^4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
