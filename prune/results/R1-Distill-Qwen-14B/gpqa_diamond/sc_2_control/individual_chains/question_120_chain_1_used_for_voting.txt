Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power laws.

Wait, first, I should remember what parallax is. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that the distance to a star is inversely proportional to its parallax. So, distance (d) is approximately 1 parsec divided by the parallax (in arcseconds), right? So d ≈ 1/plx, where plx is in arcseconds.

Now, the problem is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. I think this has to do with how the number of stars depends on the distance. Because if stars are uniformly distributed, their spatial density is the same in all regions. But when we observe them, their distribution in terms of parallax isn't uniform because of the inverse relationship between distance and parallax.

Wait, so if stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density (n) is constant. The number of stars within a certain volume depends on that volume. So, let's think about the volume of space between two distances. Let's say we're looking at a thin shell between d and d + dd. The volume of that shell is approximately 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in this shell would be n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since d = 1/plx, so plx = 1/d. So, when d increases, plx decreases. Maybe I should express everything in terms of plx.

Let me substitute d with 1/plx. So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 dd. But wait, I need to express dd in terms of d plx. Hmm, because plx is a function of d, so when d changes by dd, plx changes by something.

Let me think. Since plx = 1/d, so d plx is the derivative of d with respect to plx. Let's compute dd as the derivative of d with respect to plx. So, d = 1/plx, so dd = -1/(plx^2) d plx. Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm approaching this correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I can express the number of stars in terms of parallax. The number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx would be proportional to the volume of that shell. Let's compute the volume.

Volume between plx and plx + dplx. Since d is 1/plx, when plx changes by dplx, d changes by dd. So d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but I'm trying to find the volume in terms of plx. So the volume is 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're dealing with magnitudes or counts, perhaps the absolute value is what matters.

So substituting, d² = 1/plx² and dd = (1/plx²) dplx (taking absolute value). So volume is 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake in expressing dd. Let me be precise. Let me find the change in d when plx changes by dplx.

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So, the volume element (dV) between plx and plx + dplx is 4π d² dd. So substituting the expressions:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - 1/(plx²) dplx )

But the negative sign just indicates direction, so when plx increases, d decreases. But for the magnitude of the volume, we can ignore the negative sign. So,

dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx ) → wait, no, because dd is (1/plx²) dplx in magnitude, so:

dV = 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * ( (1/plx²) dplx ) )

Wait, that would be 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx ) → 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when plx increases by dplx, the distance d decreases, but the volume depends on d², so the product d² * dd.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's express the number of stars in terms of parallax.

The number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is approximately 4π d² dr. But dr is related to dplx because d = 1/plx. So when plx changes by dplx, d changes by dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx. So, dr = - (dplx)/(plx^2).

So, substituting into the volume:

dV = 4π d² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - dplx/(plx^2) ) )

The negative sign indicates direction, but since we're considering the absolute value, we'll take the positive:

dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx² ) ) = 4π (dplx / plx^4 )

So, the number of stars in that shell is n * dV, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume). So the number of stars is n * 4π dplx / plx^4.

But the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is (n *4π / plx^4 ) dplx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the options are about the number per unit range of plx. So, for a given plx, the number of stars in a small range dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4 * dplx. So the number per unit plx (dplx → 1) would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

But looking at the options, option A is ~ 1/plx^4. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Another approach: Since stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density (n) is constant. The number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is n multiplied by the volume of the shell at that distance.

The volume of the shell is 4πd² dd. But since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, substituting:

Volume = 4π (1/(plx)^2) * (1/(plx^2) dplx )

So, Volume = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Therefore, the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of plx (dplx) changes with plx. So for a small dplx, the number is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is ~ 1/plx^4 → option A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought sometimes the dependence is on 1/plx^3. Let me think about another way. If you think of the density in parallax space, the number per unit parallax interval should account for the fact that as parallax decreases, the volume element increases more rapidly.

Wait, another way to think about it: The number of stars in a given parallax interval (dplx) is related to the volume in space. Because a lower parallax (higher distance) corresponds to a larger volume. So for a fixed dplx, the number of stars is higher when plx is small because the same dplx corresponds to a larger volume.

Wait, wait, no. For example, think when plx is 1 arcsec. The distance is 1 pc. The shell's volume is 4π (1)^2 * (1/1^2) dplx → because dd is (1/(1)^2) dplx = dplx. So volume is 4π * 1 * 1 * dplx = 4π dplx. When plx is 2, the distance is 0.5 pc. The volume is 4π (0.5)^2 * (1/(2^2) dplx) → 4π * 0.25 * (0.25 dplx) → 4π * 0.0625 dplx. So as plx increases, the same dplx corresponds to a much smaller volume. Hence, the number of stars is proportional to 1/(plx^4).

Wait, so the number of stars per unit plx is n * 4π (d^2) * (dd). Which, as we've calculated, is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer should be option A: ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that the distance to a star is inversely proportional to its parallax, \( d \approx \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Since stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density (\( n \)) is constant. The number of stars in a thin shell between distances \( d \) and \( d + dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \).

To express the volume in terms of parallax, we substitute \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) (ignoring the negative sign for magnitude). The volume becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars in this shell is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx} \). The number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d\text{plx} \)) is therefore proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

This analysis shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Among the given options, this corresponds to:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
