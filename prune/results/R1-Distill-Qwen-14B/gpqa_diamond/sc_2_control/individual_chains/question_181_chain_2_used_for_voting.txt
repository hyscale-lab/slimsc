Okay, so I've got this physics question in front of me about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands after the pp-III branch stops in the Sun's core. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I need to find the ratio flux(band1)/flux(band2).

Wait, first, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. There are different branches, I think. The pp-I branch is the simplest, involving just protons fusing into helium-4. The pp-II and pp-III involve more steps, maybe involving boron or other elements. Oh right, the pp-III branch is one of the steps where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus (like in the process that produces boron-8, which then decays into lithium and a positron or something). So if the pp-III stops, that particular part of the proton-proton cycle is halted.

But how does that affect neutrino production? So the Sun emits neutrinos mainly through the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle. The dominant neutrinos are the electron neutrinos from the fusion processes. The pp-III branch is a minor part, but stopping it would affect the overall neutrino production.

Wait, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. I remember that neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, and the Sun's core is about 8 minutes away from the Earth. So if the pp-III stopped, the neutrinos from that process wouldn't reach us yet. But wait, the question states that the flux is very large, so maybe it's considering the current flux that's arriving here. Or perhaps, the neutrinos are produced in the Sun's core, and the stopping of pp-III affects the production of neutrinos that are about to be emitted, which would then affect the flux on Earth. Hmm, but 8.5 minutes ago, the Sun's neutrinos would have left the Sun already. Wait, no, because the Sun's radius is about 7e10 cm, so the light travel time is about 8 minutes. So if pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would have just barely left the Sun, but probably haven't reached Earth yet. Wait, no—because Earth is 1.5e13 cm away, which is much farther. So the neutrinos would take about 8 minutes to get from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would not have arrived yet. So the neutrinos currently arriving are from before the pp-III stopped. Oh wait, but the question is about the current flux. So maybe the pp-III was stopped, so the neutrinos from that process are no longer being emitted. So the flux would be lower in regions where pp-III contributes.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The neutrinos are produced in the Sun's core. The Sun's core is about 8 minutes light travel time from the surface, but neutrinos can pass through the Sun without interacting much, so they escape quickly. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, any neutrinos from that process would have left the Sun more than 8 minutes ago and would have reached Earth by now. So the current flux is unaffected because the pp-III is producing neutrinos that are already on their way. Hmm, but maybe the question is considering the production in the core, so the neutrinos are being produced and then emitted. So if the pp-III stops, then the flux of neutrinos from that source would stop. But since the question is about the ratio after the pp-III stops, perhaps the flux is changing because the production has changed.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit different. The neutrinos are produced in different energy ranges depending on the process. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos at certain energies, particularly higher energies perhaps. If the pp-III stops, that source of high-energy neutrinos stops, so the flux in certain energy bands would decrease.

But what's the typical energy of neutrinos from the pp-III branch? The proton-proton chain primarily produces neutrinos with energies around a few tens of keV. Wait, no, wait. The main proton-proton chain produces neutrinos in the ~10s of keV. But the pp-III branch is a side reaction that contributes to higher energy neutrinos.

Wait, in the pp-III branch, the process is:

p + ³He → ²H + e⁺ + ν_e (this is part of the main pp process), but maybe the branch where a ³He captures a proton to form ⁴He, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, the pp-III branch involves the formation of ⁷Be, which later captures an electron to become ⁷Li and emits a positron and a neutrino. Those neutrinos are called the ⁷Be neutrinos, I think, and they have higher energies than the main pp neutrinos.

Ah, right! The main pp neutrinos are from the process where a boron atom decays into lithium, releasing a positron and a neutrino. Those neutrinos are around ~0.4 MeV (400 keV). The ⁷Be neutrinos are from the electron capture by ⁷Be, which produces a neutral helium and a neutrino. Those have higher energies, like around 1.4 MeV, but wait, no, I might be getting confused. Let me think. The ⁷Be neutrinos are from the decay of ⁷Be, which is in the Sun's pp process.

Wait, the main pp process produces neutrinos in the 10s of keV to a few hundred keV. The ⁷Be neutrinos are higher, perhaps around 1.4 MeV. So if the pp-III branch is stopped, the production of ⁷Be neutrinos would stop, meaning that the higher energy neutrinos from that process are no longer being emitted.

But the question is about two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, if the pp-III is stopped, the ⁷Be neutrinos (which are higher energy) would no longer contribute. So the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would decrease, because those are higher energies. But wait, if the pp-III contributes to higher energy neutrinos, stopping it would mean that the flux in band 2 (800-900) would drop, while the lower band (700-800) might not be affected as much.

Wait, but the main pp process emits neutrinos in lower energies. So band 1 is 700-800, band 2 is 800-900. If the pp-III is stopped, and the pp-III is responsible for some of the higher energy neutrinos, then maybe the flux in band 2 would decrease more than band 1.

So, what's the typical flux ratio? Let's think about the solar neutrino spectrum. The main pp neutrinos are around 100-400 keV. The ⁷Be neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV, which is 1400 keV—so that's in band 2 (800-900) and beyond. So if the pp-III process is stopped, then the flux in band 2 would drop more than band 1, as band 2 has a significant contribution from the ⁷Be neutrinos.

Wait, but band 2 is 800-900 keV. The ⁷Be neutrinos are at 1400 keV, which is higher than 900. So perhaps they don't contribute to band 2 either. Hmm, that complicates things. So maybe the ⁷Be neutrinos are in the 1-3 MeV range, so they're in higher energy bands than the ones mentioned.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up different types of neutrinos. The ⁷Be neutrinos are part of the solar neutrinos, but perhaps they are in higher energy ranges than the ones considered here. So, if the pp-III is stopped, wouldn't the higher energy neutrinos (like ⁷Be) no longer contribute, which are in higher energy bands beyond 900 keV.

So, if the main pp neutrinos are up to ~400 keV, and the ⁷Be are at higher energies, then the bands 700-800 and 800-900 keV would have lower flux if the ⁷Be (pp-III) is stopped.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio after the pp-III stops. So initially, the flux in band 2 (800-900) is lower compared to band 1 (700-800) because the solar neutrino flux drops off at higher energies. But the pp-III process contributes more at higher energies.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the solar neutrino spectrum. The main pp neutrinos peak around 300 keV or so, with a tail going up to higher energies but with lower flux. The ⁷Be neutrinos are higher, around 1.4 MeV, which is beyond the bands given. So, if the pp-III stops, the flux in the higher energy bands (like band 2) would decrease more than in lower bands.

But the question's bands are 700-800 (band 1) and 800-900 (band 2). So if the pp-III is stopped, which produces higher energy neutrinos, then the band 2 would have less neutrinos than before, because those are the higher energies. But band 1 is in the mid-range. Wait, but the main pp process does produce some neutrinos above 700 keV, but their flux decreases with energy.

But I'm not certain. Perhaps the total flux is dominated by the main pp process, which is in lower energies. So when the pp-III is stopped, the higher energy neutrinos (like those in band 2) would have a lower flux than before. But if the main pp process is still running, which produces a lot of neutrinos in lower bands, then the flux in band 1 is still high, but band 2's flux is lower.

So the ratio would be flux(band1)/flux(band2) would increase. Because band1's flux is less affected than band2's. So if the flux in band2 drops more, the ratio would be higher.

Wait, but if the pp-III contributes neutrinos into higher bands, then maybe the flux in band 2 is mostly from pp-III. So if that's stopped, the flux in band2 would drop a lot, while band1's flux remains about the same.

Assuming that before stopping, the flux in band2 was, say, 10 times less than band1. If pp-III contributed a significant portion to band2, then after stopping, band2's flux might be much less. So the ratio band1/band2 would go up.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the typical solar neutrino flux. The main pp neutrinos peak around 0.3 MeV (300 keV), and the flux decreases as energy increases. The ⁷Be neutrinos are at higher energies, but their flux is a small fraction of the total. So, the main contribution to band 1 (700-800 keV) comes from the main pp process, while the main contribution to band 2 (800-900 keV) comes from the same main pp process but at higher energies, but with lower flux. However, if the pp-III is stopped, then any neutrinos from that process would no longer contribute. But wait, the ⁷Be neutrinos are at 1.4 MeV, so they don't contribute to band 1 or 2. So perhaps the pp-III produces neutrinos in some other energy range.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch produces a different kind of neutrino. Wait, I think the pp-III branch is the process where a helium-3 nucleus captures a proton to form boron-8, which then decays into two helium-4 nuclei, a positron, and a neutrino. That process produces ⁸B neutrinos. The ⁸B neutrinos have energies around 15-17 MeV. So they're way higher than 900 keV. So they don't contribute to either band 1 or band 2. So stopping pp-III would stop the production of ⁸B neutrinos, which are in higher energy ranges beyond the bands in question.

Wait, but the question is about the pp-III branch stopping. So if pp-III is stopped, the ⁸B neutrinos are no longer produced. Those are in very high energy, so they are not in the 700-900 keV range. So their flux is zero in both bands. But the main pp neutrinos are still being produced, so the flux in bands 1 and 2 would be as before, except for any contribution from the ⁸B neutrinos, which are negligible in these bands.

Wait, that can't be right. So the main pp process (pp-I and pp-II) produce lower-energy neutrinos, and the pp-III produces higher-energy neutrinos (like the ⁸B). So if the pp-III stops, then the higher-energy neutrinos (like 15 MeV) are no longer produced. But in the bands 700-800 and 800-900 keV, the neutrinos are from the main pp process.

So in that case, the flux in both bands would remain the same, because the pp-III doesn't contribute to these bands. So the ratio would be same as before.

Wait, but that can't be right either. Because the main pp process's flux drops with energy. So, the flux in band1 (700-800) is lower than in the lower bands, and band2 (800-900) is even lower. So the ratio of band1/band2 is higher than 1. Or is it?

Wait, the solar neutrino flux decreases with increasing energy. So, the number of neutrinos per unit area per second (flux) decreases as energy increases. So, band1 (lower energy) has higher flux, band2 (higher energy) has lower flux.

So initially, the ratio is flux1/flux2 = (n1)/(n2) = (higher number)/(lower number), so the ratio is greater than 1. For example, if n1 is 10 and n2 is 1, the ratio is 10.

But if the pp-III is stopped, but pp-III doesn't contribute to these bands, then the ratio remains the same. So the ratio would still be about 10, as the main pp process is the main source.

Wait, but if the pp-III is stopped, perhaps the main pp process is still running. So the flux in both bands comes only from main pp. So the ratio remains the same. So the answer would be 1, but that's option C. But wait, that's only if the pp-III doesn't contribute to these bands. But maybe the main pp process's neutrinos are the only contributors in these bands, so the ratio is determined by the main pp's energy spectrum.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III process contributes neutrinos at lower energies as well. Wait, but the ⁸B neutrinos are high energy, so they don't contribute here.

So if the pp-III is stopped, and it doesn't affect these two bands, then the flux ratio remains the same as before. But what is the ratio of the main pp neutrinos in these bands? The main pp flux drops with energy exponentially or something like that.

Wait, in the main pp process, the neutrino energy distribution is such that the flux decreases with energy. So, for band1 (700-800 keV) and band2 (800-900 keV), the flux in band1 is higher than in band2. So the ratio is greater than 1.

If the pp-III process contributes mainly to higher energies (like 15 MeV), then stopping it doesn't change the flux in bands 1 and 2. So the ratio remains as it is.

But what is the typical ratio of band1 to band2 in the main pp neutrinos? Let's think about the energy distribution. The main pp process produces a spectrum that drops as energy increases. So, the number of neutrinos in higher energy (band2) is less than in lower (band1). So, for instance, the number in 700-800 might be about 10 times that in 800-900. So the ratio would be 10, which is option A.

But wait, the question is about the ratio after the pp-III is stopped. If the pp-III doesn't contribute to these bands, then the ratio remains the same as before. So the answer would be option C, 1? But that contradicts the earlier thought that the main pp's flux decreases with energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes significantly to the flux in band1 and band2. But wait, if the pp-III produces higher energy neutrinos (like 15 MeV), then it doesn't contribute to either of these bands. So the ratio is determined only by the main pp process.

Wait, but if the pp-III is stopped, perhaps the proton density in the core changes, which could affect the main pp process. Because the pp-III is part of the overall pp chain. But the question says that all other reactions remained as they were except the pp-III branch stopping. So the main pp process (pp-I and pp-II) continue.

So, the main pp process is still ongoing. So the neutrino flux in bands 1 and 2 are only from the main pp. So the ratio is determined by the main pp's energy distribution.

In the main pp process, the neutrinos have a distribution where their number decreases with energy. So, the flux in band1 (lower energy) is higher than in band2 (higher energy). So, the ratio flux1/flux2 is greater than one.

But how much greater? The main pp neutrinos have a spectrum that peaks around 300 keV, and the flux decreases exponentially with energy. So, the number of neutrinos in 700-800 keV is much less than in lower bands, but compared to 800-900, perhaps the ratio is about 10.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers. Let me think about the relative fluxes. The main pp process flux is a function of energy E as something like F(E) = F_0 * exp(-E/(kT)), where kT is the temperature in keV. The Sun's core temperature is about 15 million K, which is about 1.3 keV (since k is ~8.6e-5 eV/K, 15e6 K * 8.6e-5 eV/K = ~1.29 keV). So F(E) ~ exp(-E/(1.3 keV)).

At E=700 keV, the exponent is -700 / 1.3 ≈ -538. So F(700) is practically zero. Wait, that can't be right. Because the neutrinos from the main pp process have energies up to about 400 keV, right? Wait, wait, the main pp neutrinos are produced in the reaction where a boron-8 decays into two helium-4 nuclei, a positron, and a neutrino. The maximum energy of that neutrino is about 1.4 MeV (since the boron is about 8 MeV, so the neutrino can take up to about 1.4 MeV, but I'm not exactly sure).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main point is that the neutrino flux from the main pp process decreases rapidly (exponentially) with energy. So, the number of neutrinos in higher energy bands (like 700-800 and 800-900 keV) is much less than in lower bands.

But wait, if the main pp process is the only source of neutrinos in those bands, and if the pp-III doesn't contribute, then the ratio of flux1/flux2 is determined by the main pp spectrum.

So for E in 700-800 and 800-900 keV, the flux in each band would be the integral of F(E) dE over each band.

Assuming F(E) = F_0 * exp(-E/E_0), with E_0 around 0.3 MeV (300 keV), then for E much larger than E_0, F(E) drops rapidly.

So for E=700 keV, which is E=0.7 MeV, F(0.7 MeV) = F_0 * exp(-0.7/0.3) = F_0 * exp(-2.333) ≈ F_0 * 0.096.

Similarly, for E=800 keV, F(0.8 MeV) = F_0 * exp(-0.8/0.3) = F_0 * exp(-2.666) ≈ F_0 * 0.068.

The flux in band1 (700-800) is roughly the integral from 0.7 to 0.8 MeV. Let's approximate it as the average F(E) multiplied by the band width (0.1 MeV). Similarly for band2 (800-900 keV), F(E) goes from 0.068 to 0.0498 (exp(-0.9/0.3)=exp(-3)=0.0498).

So, the average F in band1 is (0.096 + 0.068)/2 ≈ 0.082, and in band2 (0.068 + 0.0498)/2 ≈ 0.0589.

So the ratio band1/band2 is 0.082 / 0.0589 ≈ 1.39. Hmm, around 1.4. But that's much less than 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp neutrino spectrum is different. Another way to think about it is that the main pp produces neutrinos with energies up to about 400 keV, and beyond that, the flux drops off. So, the 700-800 keV band is already in the region where the flux is negligible. So, the main contribution is from lower energies, and the flux in band1 is much smaller than in lower bands, but band2 is even smaller.

Wait, but if the main pp process doesn't contribute much beyond 400 keV, then the neutrinos in 700-800 and 800-900 are negligible. So, if the pp-III is stopped, and it's producing neutrinos in higher energies, then the flux in those bands would be even lower. But if the pp-III's neutrinos are in higher energies than 900 keV, then the flux in bands 1 and 2 would be the same as before, assuming the main pp is the only source there.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute to the 700-800 keV range, which would mean that their stopping would reduce the flux in band1, making the ratio flux1/flux2 lower.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to summarize.

The question is about the flux ratio of two neutrino bands after stopping the pp-III branch. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos (like ⁸B with ~15 MeV), which are outside the given bands. The main pp process produces neutrinos up to around 400 keV. So, the main contributors to band1 and band2 are the main pp neutrinos. But since the main pp neutrinos' flux decreases with energy, the flux in band1 is higher than in band2.

So, the ratio flux1/flux2 is greater than 1. How much greater?

If the main pp neutrinos have a spectrum that drops exponentially, then each higher band has much less flux. So, the ratio could be around 10, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the main pp process's neutrino flux in 700-800 is negligible compared to 800-900. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: solar neutrino experiments like Super-Kamiokande measure the total flux and energy spectrum. The main pp neutrinos contribute to lower energies, and the higher-energy neutrinos (like ⁷Be and ⁸B) are a small fraction. So, in the energy range of 700-800 keV, the main pp process's flux is already minimal, and the ⁷Be and ⁸B neutrinos are at higher energies (like 1.4 MeV and 15 MeV, respectively). So, the majority of the neutrinos in band1 and band2 are from the main pp process, but since the pp-III doesn't contribute (as it's stopped and its neutrinos are higher), the ratio remains as it was.

Wait, but if the pp-III is stopped, which produces higher energy neutrinos, then the main pp process continues, so the flux in band1 and band2 are still from the main pp. So the ratio is the same as it was before.

So, what is the typical ratio of flux in 700-800 to 800-900 from the main pp process?

Assuming the main pp flux drops exponentially, the ratio would be (F(700) - F(800)) / (F(800) - F(900)).

But without knowing the exact distribution, perhaps I can make a rough estimate.

Assuming F(E) ~ exp(-E/0.3), then:

F(700) = exp(-700/300) = exp(-2.333) ≈ 0.096.

F(800) = exp(-800/300) = exp(-2.666) ≈ 0.068.

F(900) = exp(-900/300) = exp(-3) ≈ 0.0498.

Band1 (700-800): average between 0.096 and 0.068 is ~0.082.

Band2 (800-900): average between 0.068 and 0.0498 is ~0.0589.

So the ratio band1/band2 ≈ 0.082 / 0.0589 ≈ 1.39.

But that's not any of the options. The given options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

Hmm. So that suggests the ratio is around 1.4, which would be closest to option C (1). But maybe my assumption about the spectrum is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp neutrinos' flux drops more steeply. Suppose F(E) peaks at 300 keV and falls off more sharply. Then, the flux in 700-800 would be negligible compared to the peak. So, if the main pp process's flux is F(E) = F_0 * exp(-E/0.3), then the flux in 700-800 is F_0*(exp(-700/300) - exp(-800/300)).

exp(-700/300) = exp(-2.333) ≈ 0.096.

exp(-800/300)= exp(-2.666) ≈ 0.068.

So, the integral for band1 is F_0*(0.096 - 0.068) = F_0*(0.028).

Similarly, band2 is F_0*(exp(-800/300) - exp(-900/300)) = F_0*(0.068 - 0.0498) = F_0*(0.0182).

So the ratio band1/band2 is (0.028)/(0.0182) ≈ 1.538.

Still around 1.5, so the ratio is about 1.5, which is close to 1. So the answer would be C) 1.

But wait, I'm not confident. Another thought: the main pp neutrino energy spectrum is roughly a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution with a temperature ~0.3 MeV. The number of neutrinos above a certain energy decreases with E^2 or something. But for the purposes of this question, perhaps the ratio is approximately 1. So the answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is A) 10, because the flux in lower bands is ten times higher. But without precise data, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the main pp flux is much higher at lower energies. The neutrino flux decreases by a factor of about 10 for each 0.3 MeV increase in energy. So from 600 to 900, which is 300 keV, that's an increase of 1. So the flux would decrease by a factor of 10^ (300/300) )= 10^1=10. So from 600 to 900 keV, the flux drops by a factor of 10. So the flux between 700-800 is roughly similar to 600-700, but perhaps the ratio between 700-800 and 800-900 is about 10.

Wait, but 700-800 is 100 keV, and 800-900 is another 100. If the flux drops by a factor of ~10 over each 100 keV in this high-energy region, then the ratio would be about 10.

Wait, no, because the flux is dropping by a factor of 10 each 300 keV. So from 700 to 800, the factor would be less than 10. Alternatively, if the flux drops to about 1/e (about 37%) every 0.3 MeV, then from 700 to 800 (100 keV), which is 1/3 of 0.3 MeV, the flux would drop by a factor of exp(1/3) ≈ 1.395, or about 39.5% decrease. So the flux in 700-800 would be about 60% of the flux at 600-700, but I'm not comparing 600-700 here.

Alternatively, the flux in 700-800 is F1, and 800-900 is F2. The ratio F1/F2 would be the ratio of the fluxes in two consecutive 100 keV bands.

Assuming the flux drops by a factor of about 10 for each 300 keV. So from 700-800 to 1000-1100, the flux would drop by 10. But between 700-800 and 800-900, it's a 100 keV step, which is about 1/3 of 300 keV. So the flux would drop by a factor of exp( (100/300) * (1/0.3 MeV) ) ≈ exp(1/3 * (1/0.3)) ? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the exponential function.

The flux F(E) = F_0 * exp( - E / E_0 ), where E_0 is about 0.3 MeV.

The ratio F1/F2 is [exp(-700/300) - exp(-800/300)] / [exp(-800/300) - exp(-900/300)].

Which is [0.096 - 0.068] / [0.068 - 0.0498] = (0.028)/(0.0182) ≈ 1.538.

So about 1.5. So the ratio is approximately 1.5, which is close to 1. So the answer would be C) 1.

But the options don't have 1.5; the closest is C) 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the flux from the main pp process is negligible in those bands, and the pp-III contributes significantly. So if the pp-III is stopped, the flux in band2 (higher energy) would drop more, so the ratio increases.

Wait, but if the pp-III contributes to band2, then stopping it would reduce flux2, making the ratio flux1/flux2 higher. So, if originally the ratio was 1, and after stopping, it's 10, then the answer is 10.

But I'm not certain whether the pp-III contributes to those bands.

Wait, I think I need to make a decision based on my reasoning. The main pp process's neutrino flux decreases with energy, so the ratio band1/band2 is higher than 1. But without knowing the exact factors, the options given are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

If the main pp process's flux drops by a factor of 10 over each 300 keV, then between 700-800 and 800-900, the ratio would be about 10^( (800-700)/300 ) = 10^(1/3) ≈ 2.15. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is close to 1, so the correct answer is C) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands, 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core hypothetically stops. The pp-III branch is associated with higher-energy neutrinos, such as the ⁸B neutrinos, which are produced at energies around 15 MeV, far above the bands in question. Therefore, the pp-III branch does not contribute significantly to the flux in bands 1 and 2, which are dominated by the main proton-proton (pp) process.

The main pp process produces neutrinos with a spectrum that peaks around 0.3 MeV (300 keV) and decreases exponentially with energy. This means the flux in higher energy bands (like 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) is much lower than in lower energy bands. The flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) is higher than in band 2 (800-900 keV) because the flux decreases with energy. However, the exact ratio depends on the detailed shape of the spectrum.

Using an approximate exponential model for the flux, \( F(E) = F_0 \cdot \exp(-E/E_0) \), where \( E_0 \approx 0.3 \, \text{MeV} \), the flux in each band can be estimated. For band 1 (700-800 keV), the flux is roughly \( F_0 \cdot (\exp(-700/300) - \exp(-800/300)) \), and for band 2 (800-900 keV), it is \( F_0 \cdot (\exp(-800/300) - \exp(-900/300)) \). Calculating these values gives a ratio of approximately 1.5. However, this value is not one of the provided options.

Given the options (10, 0.01, 1, 0.1), the ratio closest to the calculated value is 1. This suggests that the flux ratio between the two bands is approximately 1, as the main pp process dominates both bands, and the pp-III branch does not significantly contribute to either.
