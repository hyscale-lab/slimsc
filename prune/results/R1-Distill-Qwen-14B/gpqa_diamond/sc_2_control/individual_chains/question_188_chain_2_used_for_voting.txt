Okay, I have a question about crystallography here. Let me see if I can figure it out. So, the question is about finding the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are related to the crystal structure and the unit cell parameters.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral. Oh right, a rhombohedral crystal system has all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So the lattice parameters a, b, c are the same, and all angles α, β, γ are the same too. In this question, each angle is 30 degrees, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance... does that mean the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstrom? I think so because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is equal to a, but I'm not entirely sure. But since it's a rhombohedral system, the structure might be more complex, but maybe the lattice parameter is indeed the interatomic distance. So let's assume a = 10 Angstrom.

The question is to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by... I remember it's related to the reciprocal of the structure factor or something involving the Miller indices. Oh right, the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (2hk cosα) + (2hl cosβ) + (2kl cosγ) )) ) divided by something? Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, the correct formula is d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) ), where α, β, γ are the angles between the lattice vectors. Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees here.

So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1. Let's plug those values into the formula.

So the denominator becomes sqrt( (1² + 1² + 1²) + 2( (1*1) cos30 + (1*1) cos30 + (1*1) cos30 ) ) )

Calculating the terms:

1² + 1² + 1² = 3.

Then the other part: 2 times ( cos30 + cos30 + cos30 ), which is 2 * 3 * cos30.

Cos30 is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660.

So 2 *3 =6, 6 *0.8660 = 5.196.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 5.196) = sqrt(8.196).

What's sqrt(8.196)? Let's calculate. 2^2 is 4, 3^2 is 9. 8.196 is between 8 and 9. Let me compute 2.86 squared: 2.86^2 = 8.1796, which is close to 8.196. Hmm, maybe 2.864^2: 2.864 *2.864. Let me compute 2.86 *2.86: (2 + 0.86)^2 = 4 + 2*(2)(0.86) + 0.86^2 = 4 + 3.44 + 0.7396 = 8.1796. But our target is 8.196. The difference is 0.0164. Let me try 2.864^2: 2.86^2 is 8.1796, 0.004^2 is negligible, but cross terms: 2*(2.86)*(0.004) = approx 0.0229. So 8.1796 + 0.0229 is 8.2025, which is a bit higher than 8.196. So maybe it's approximately 2.863.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator method. Alternatively, I can note that 2.86^2 = 8.1796, 2.863^2 is about 8.196. Let me calculate 2.863^2: 2.86^2 is 8.1796. Then, (2.863)^2 = (2.86 + 0.003)^2 = 2.86² + 2*(2.86)*(0.003) + (0.003)^2 = 8.1796 + 0.01716 + 0.000009 ≈ 8.196769. That's very close to 8.196. So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So denominator is 2.863. Then d = a / 2.863. But a is 10 Angstrom. So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.491 Angstrom? Wait, that can't be right. Because 10 divided by 2.863 is around 3.49 Angstrom, but the options are around 8 to 10 Angstrom. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, I think I might have the formula wrong. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, I think I confused the formula. The correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cosα + hl cosα + kl cosα) ), but wait, because α = β = γ in this case.

Wait, no, the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos α + hk cos β + hk cos γ) ), but wait, that doesn't seem right. No, wait, the correct formula is d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) )

Wait, no, because in a general hexagonal system, the angles are different, but in rhombohedral, they are the same. So for a rhombohedral system, the formula simplifies to:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos α + 2 hl cos α + 2 kl cos α )

Because α = β = γ.

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So denominator is sqrt( 3 + 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30) )

Which is sqrt(3 + 2*(3 * cos30) )

Wait, cos30 is approximately 0.8660.

So 3 * 0.8660 = 2.598.

Multiply by 2: 5.196.

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 5.196) = sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So d = a / 2.863. But a is 10 Angstrom. So 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom. But the options are all around 9-10. Hmm, that's a problem. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a second, perhaps the interatomic distance isn't the lattice parameter a. Oh, maybe I misunderstood the question. The interatomic distance is the distance between atoms in the crystal, which for a simple structure like a rhombohedral might be a, but perhaps in this case, the lattice parameter is larger. Wait, no, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a. But in a rhombohedral structure, maybe it's a different relation.

Wait, maybe the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral system isn't simply 'a'. Let me think about the structure. A rhombohedral system can be considered as a cube deformed along the space diagonals. So the interatomic distance might not be the same as 'a' in the same way as a cubic structure. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the interatomic distance as the length of the vector between two atoms in the basis, which could be more complex. 

Wait, perhaps the lattice parameter 'a' is not the interatomic distance but rather, the interatomic distance is the edge length of the unit cell. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the rhombohedral system has a basis with more atoms, so the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms in the basis, which could be different from 'a'. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance being given is the edge length 'a' of the unit cell, which I think is the case here.

Wait, but then why is the interplanar distance so small? Because the options are 8-10. So maybe I have the formula wrong. Could the formula be different for rhombohedral systems?

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck. The general formula for d-spacing is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) + 2 (hk cos γ)/(a b) + 2 (hl cos β)/(a c) + 2 (kl cos α)/(b c) ) )

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and α = β = γ = θ.

So substituting, the formula becomes:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/a0² + 2 (hk cosθ + hl cosθ + kl cosθ) / a0² )

Factor out 1/a0²:

d = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cosθ + 2 hl cosθ + 2 kl cosθ )

Which is what I had earlier. So the formula seems correct.

So for (111), the denominator is sqrt( 3 + 6 cos30 ), which is sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) ) = sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, let me compute 3*sqrt(3). sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 3*1.732 ≈5.196. So 3 +5.196=8.196. So the denominator is sqrt(8.196)≈2.863.

So d= a / 2.863. a is 10, so 10 /2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are much higher. So that can't be right. Hmm. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the angles are 30 degrees, but in the formula, do we use the angle between the lattice vectors, or is it the supplementary angle? Because in crystallography, sometimes the angles are measured as the angles between the edges, but I think the formula uses the angle between the lattice vectors as given.

Wait, for example, in a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees, so cosα is zero. So in the formula, for cubic, the denominator would be sqrt( h² +k² +l² ), which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the formula from another source. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter, but something else.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along the edge, which could be less than the lattice parameter if the basis contains multiple atoms. For example, if the basis has two atoms, maybe the distance between them is half the lattice parameter. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the rhombohedral system can be treated as a special case of a hexagonal system, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance is a function of the structure factor. Wait, no, the interplanar distance is given by the formula I used.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this differently. Let me recalculate the denominator.

Denominator: sqrt( (1^2 +1^2 +1^2) + 2*(1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30) ) )

Which is sqrt(3 + 2*(3*(sqrt(3)/2)) )

Simplify inside the sqrt:

3 + 2*(3 * 0.8660) = 3 + 2*2.598 = 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

So d = a / 2.863. a=10, so d=3.49 Ang. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I have a wrong formula.

Wait, wait another thing. Maybe the formula calculates the reciprocal of the d-spacing. Wait, no, the formula is correct. Because when the denominator is higher, the d-spacing is smaller.

Wait, but the options are 8-10 Angstrom, which is much larger than the a=10 Angstrom I assumed. So perhaps my assumption about a=10 is wrong.

Ah! Wait a second, perhaps the interatomic distance is not a, but the distance between two adjacent atoms in the crystal. In a rhombohedral system, the unit cell might have more than one atom. Oh, right, perhaps each lattice point is a single atom, and the lattice parameter a is the distance between neighboring lattice points. So if the interatomic distance is the same as a, then my initial approach is correct. But then the interplanar distance comes out way too small.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the relationship between the interatomic distance and the lattice parameter. Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is not the same as the lattice parameter 'a' because of the angles. Let me visualize a rhombohedron. It's a cube that's been deformed so all edges are equal but angles are not 90 degrees. So the nearest neighbor distance is along the edge, which would be 'a'. So I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, but the options suggest that the correct answer is approximately 9 Angstrom. How can that be? Because the a is 10, and the formula gives d= ~3.49. Unless the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the formula. Let me think: maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt(...), but a is the interatomic distance. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/d = ... which would make d smaller. Wait, no, the formula is correctly d = a / sqrt(...).

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = (a) * sqrt( ... ), but that would make d larger. No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the angles. Wait, the angles given are 30 degrees. The cos of 30 is about 0.866, which is correct. So that part is right.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the angles between the reciprocal lattice vectors? Or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach, like the Miller-Bravais indices or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for rhombohedral is different when the angles are not 90 degrees.

Wait, another approach: in a rhombohedral crystal, the relation between interplanar spacing and the lattice parameters can be found using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors (30 degrees here).

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So d = a / sqrt(1 +1 +1 + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) cos30 )

Which is the same as I did before. So same result.

Hmm. But the options are way higher than 3.49. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is about the (100) plane or another plane. No, the question says (111).

Wait, maybe I messed up the Miller indices. Wait, (111) refers to the plane intercepting the axes at 1,1,1. No, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the angle given is the angle between the crystallographic axes, but in the formula, the angles are between the vectors. So if the crystal has angles of 30 degrees, then the cosine is correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again. The given options are all around 9, which is close to a=10. So what if the formula gives d= a/sqrt( (1^2 +1^2 +1^2) + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * cos(60 degrees) ), but why would that be?

Wait, no, the angle is given as 30 degrees. But perhaps I should use 60 degrees. Wait, why? Because sometimes in some definitions, the angle used in the formula is the angle between the reciprocal vectors, not the direct lattice vectors. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the supplementary angle. For example, in some cases, the angle between the edges is 180 - 30 = 150 degrees. Because when the lattice vectors have an internal angle of 30 degrees, the angle between vectors when viewed from the other side could be 150 degrees. But I'm not certain about this.

Wait, let's try using 150 degrees. cos(150) is -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 2*(3*(-0.866)) )

Which is sqrt(3 + 2*(-2.598)) = sqrt(3 -5.196) = sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the formula I'm using is for a hexagonal system, which has different angles. But no, rhombohedral is a separate system.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another formula. Let me think about the general approach. The interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The reciprocal lattice vector components are h, k, l multiplied by the reciprocal basis vectors. The magnitude of the reciprocal vector is sqrt( (h a* )^2 + (k b* )^2 + (l c* )^2 + ... ), but this seems complicated.

Alternatively, the formula can be written as:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/a² + 2(hk cos γ)/(a²) + 2(hl cos β)/(a²) + 2(kl cos α)/(a²)

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and α=β=γ=30 degrees. So substituting, this becomes:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/a² + 2(hk cos30 + hl cos30 + kl cos30 )/a²

Which simplifies to:

1/d² = [ h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos30 ] / a²

So,

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos30 )

Which is the same as before.

So for (111), denominator is sqrt(3 +6 cos30) = sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d= a/2.863=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are about 9 Angstrom. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter a, but the nearest neighbor distance is different. For example, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a, but in a body-centered cubic, it's a√3/4 ≈0.866a.

But the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps a is larger than 10. Let me think—maybe the interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral system might be a * sin(θ/2) or something like that.

Wait, no. Let me think about the unit cell. In a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a. In a face-centered cubic, it's a√2/2. In a body-centered cubic, a√3/4. But in a rhombohedral system, what's the nearest neighbor distance?

Hmm, I'm not sure, but perhaps in a rhombohedral system like a primitive cell, the nearest neighbor distance is along the edge, which is a. So if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, a is 10.

But then, the d-spacing is about 3.49, which is not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the (100) plane instead. Let me compute that quickly.

(100) plane: h=1, k=0, l=0.

Denominator becomes sqrt(1 +0+0 + 2*(0 +0 +0)*cos30 )= sqrt(1) =1.

So d= a/1 =10 Angstrom. But that's one of the options, option D. But the question is about (111), not (100).

Hmm. So perhaps the correct approach is to look for another formula. Alternatively, perhaps I need to use the relationship between the interplanar distance and the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula I used is for the (hkl) plane in a cubic system, but not rhombohedral. But I thought rhombohedral is a different system with a= b= c and angles α=β=γ=30.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different formula specific to rhombohedral systems.

Wait, another approach: using the volume of the unit cell and the structure factor. But that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the unit cell vectors. Let me denote the three vectors as a, b, c, all with magnitude 10 Angstrom, and each pair having an angle of 30 degrees.

The (111) plane corresponds to the plane whose normal vector is (1,1,1). The interplanar distance can be found by finding the reciprocal of the projection of the vectors onto the normal direction.

Alternatively, the interplanar spacing is the distance between adjacent planes in the direction perpendicular to the plane. So, perhaps I can model this.

The unit cell vectors are a, b, c, each making 30 degrees with each other.

The plane (111) is defined by intercepts at (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). The normal vector to this plane is (1,1,1). The distance between two adjacent planes can be found by considering a point on the plane and moving along the normal direction by a distance d, which brings it to the next plane.

Alternatively, using vector algebra: the distance between two points in the direction of the normal vector.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute using the reciprocal vectors.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) (1, 0, 0) * ... wait, no, the reciprocal vectors are defined such that their dot product with the original vectors gives delta functions.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal vectors can be a bit complicated. But perhaps the magnitude of the reciprocal vector for (hkl) is given by:

|G| = sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ) * (2π/a)

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the interplanar distance is d = 1 / |G| * 2π.

Wait, no, the interplanar distance d is related to the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector as:

d = 2π / |G|

Which would mean that |G| = 2π /d.

But I'm not sure if this approach helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is correct, but my assumption about a is wrong. So to get d= approx 9 Angstrom, let's see what a would be needed.

If d = a / sqrt(8.196) =9, then a=9 * sqrt(8.196) ≈9 *2.863≈25.767 Angstrom. But the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not a but a function of a and the angles. Let me think about the distance between two atoms in the same row, column, or whatever. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the distance between nearest atoms is not a, but a multiplied by some factor. For example, in a simple cubic, it's a. But in a rhombohedral, the nearest neighbor distance could be a * sin(θ/2), where θ is 30 degrees.

Wait, let's compute that. sin(15 degrees)=0.2588. So a=10, the nearest neighbor distance would be 10 * 0.2588≈2.588 Angstrom. But that's even smaller than our previous result. So that can't be.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula I've used is for the (100) plane, but the question is about (111). Wait, no, I've already computed for (111).

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the inverse of the formula. Wait, why would that be? No, the formula gives d correctly.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the angles are measured as the angles between the edges when viewed along a certain direction, but perhaps in the formula, the angles used are the ones from the unit cell, which might be different.

Wait, perhaps I should reverse the approach. Let me compute the given options and see which one fits.

Option A: 9.08.

So d=9.08, a=10.

Compute denominator: a/d =10/9.08≈1.101.

So denominator must be 1.101.

Which is sqrt(3 +6 cos30 )=1.101?

Wait, sqrt(3 +6 cos30)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

Wait, a/d =2.863. So d= a/2.863=10/2.863≈3.49. So no, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3 +6 cosθ, and set that equal to (a/d)^2.

But if the options are around 9, which would imply d is about 9, then a/d is about 1.111, so 1.111^2=1.234.

So 3 +6 cosθ=1.234 →6 cosθ= -1.766 →cosθ≈-0.294, so theta≈107 degrees.

But the given angles are 30 degrees. So that can't be.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula entirely. Let me look up the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, I'm supposed to imagine this, but perhaps I can recall that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar spacing for (hkl) is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosα ), where α is the angle between the edges.

In that case, for (111), it's same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is different because in some cases, the formula uses twice the angle. Oh! Maybe the angles in the formula are the angles between the reciprocal vectors, which are 180 - 30 = 150 degrees. Let me try that.

So cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 +2*(3*(-0.866)) )=sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the angles used in the formula are the angles between the face normals or something else. I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the planes in terms of vectors.

The plane (111) has a normal vector along (1,1,1). The unit normal vector is (1,1,1) divided by its magnitude, which is sqrt(3).

The distance between the origin and the plane is given by the formula |(0,0,0) · n - d| / |n|, but I'm not sure how that applies here.

Wait, no, the distance from the origin to the plane (111) in the unit cell is |d| / |n|, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is the length between two adjacent planes, which is along the direction of the normal vector.

Wait, the plane equation is x + y + z = d. The distance between two consecutive planes along the normal direction is the interplanar distance.

Hmm. The normal vector is (1,1,1), which has a magnitude of sqrt(3). The distance between two points on consecutive planes is the interplanar distance.

But how does this relate to the lattice vectors?

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal vector for (111).

The reciprocal vector g for (hkl) is given by:

g = (h a* )i + (k b* )j + (l c* )k,

where a*, b*, c* are reciprocal basis vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal basis vectors can be defined as:

a* = (1/a) (1, 0, 0) - (cosβ)/(a sinα) (0,1,0) - (cosγ)/(a sinα) (0,0,1)

But this is getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to look for a standard formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula I used is correct, but the interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter a, but a function of a and the angles. For example, in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance could be a multiplied by sin(theta / 2), where theta is 30 degrees. Let's compute that.

sin(15 degrees) ≈0.2588. So nearest neighbor distance would be 10 * 0.2588 ≈2.588 Angstrom. But that doesn't fit with the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is a multiplied by some other factor, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe in a rhombohedral system, the interatomic distance is not along the edges but along the face diagonals. So the nearest neighbor distance is along the face diagonal. So for a cube, the face diagonal is a√2, but in a rhombohedral, it would be something else.

Hmm, but the face diagonal in a rhombohedral system would involve the angle between vectors. Maybe the distance would be a multiplied by sqrt(2 - 2 cosθ), where theta is 30 degrees.

Let me compute that: 2 - 2 cos30 = 2 - 2*(0.866)=2-1.732=0.268. sqrt(0.268)=0.517. So the nearest neighbor distance would be a * 0.517 ≈10*0.517≈5.17 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should just proceed with the formula I have, even though the result doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo, and the correct answer is not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I have a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the angles given are the angles between the face normals, not the lattice vectors. So if alpha is 30 degrees, the angle between the vectors is 180-30=150. But then we'd have cos(150)= -0.866. Let me try that.

Compute the denominator again: 3 +6*(-0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. That's impossible, sqrt of negative number. So no.

Hmm. Maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, no, that would give a larger d, but not matching the options.

Another thought: perhaps the formula should be d = a/(h² +k² +l² + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ), but that would be d = a/(sum), not a/sqrt(sum). Let me try that.

So for (111): sum=3 +6 *0.866=3+5.196=8.196.

So d=10/8.196≈1.22 Angstrom. That's even smaller, which doesn't help.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed, but I'm not confident.

But looking back, the options are much larger than what my formula gives. Unless I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is d = a / (sqrt( h² +k² +l² ) + something ). Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by something.

Wait, another way: in a simple cubic system, d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But in this case, the angles are 30, so it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the formula is a / [ sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta ) ]

Wait, no, that's for a different case, perhaps when the angles are 180 - theta.

But let me try that. For (111), denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 6 *0.866 ) = sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196)= imaginary. So no.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option A)9.08 Angstrom, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, perhaps I should compute what (10/9.08) is. 10/9.08≈1.101. So sqrt(3 +6 cos30)=2.863. So 2.863≈1.101? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the formula is d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ )^(-1/2) )

Which is the same as before. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the angles given are the external angles, so perhaps the formula should use cos(180-30)= -0.866.

But then, for denominator, it would be 3 +6*(-0.866)= -2.196. So sqrt is imaginary, which is impossible.

Hmm. I'm out of options. Perhaps I should choose the option that gives a denominator closest to 2.863, but I don't see how. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me try to look up the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Upon reflection, I think I might have swapped the formula. The correct formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / [ sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosα ) ]

Which is what I used earlier.

So unless there's a miscalculation, the result is 3.49 Angstrom, which isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps the angles in the formula are the angles between the reciprocal vectors. So if the crystal has angles alpha, beta, gamma, the reciprocal vectors have angles 180 - alpha, etc. So cos of 150 degrees would be -0.866.

But then, as before, the denominator becomes sqrt(3 +6*(-0.866))=sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible. So that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe the question is about the interatomic distance in the (111) plane, not the interplanar distance. No, the question asks for interplanar distance.

I'm at a loss. My calculation doesn't match any of the options provided. Perhaps I made a wrong assumption about a being the interatomic distance. If a were instead some other parameter, perhaps the result would fit. But without more information, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the formula is wrong, and the correct approach is to use the formula for a hexagonal system, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different for rhombohedral, and I should use 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) + ... but that's what I did.

Another possibility: perhaps the angles given are in radians, not degrees. Let me try that. 30 degrees is pi/6 radians≈0.5236 radians.

cos(0.5236)= approx 0.8660, same as before. So no change.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a factor. Let me think: the formula I'm using is for the conventional unit cell, but perhaps the basis contains more atoms, so the interatomic distance is different. But I don't have enough information about the basis.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about a different type of rhombohedral system, such as a hexagonal close-packed structure, but that's a different crystal system.

Hmm. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is option A)9.08 Angstrom, despite my confusion. But I don't see how this fits.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let me recompute.

Denominator: sqrt(3 +6 *0.866) →3 +5.196=8.196. sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

Yes, that's correct. So d=10/2.863≈3.49.

But the options are much larger. So I'm not seeing where I went wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different formula where the interplanar distance is a multiplied by the denominator. That would give d=10*2.863≈28.63, which is even larger than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt(...), which would make it much larger. But that would give d=10*2.863≈28.63, which is not an option.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator and multiply by a. No, that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps the angles are measured as the angles between the planes, not the lattice vectors. But I don't know how that would change the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the supplement of the angles. For example, if the formula uses 180-30=150 degrees, but cos(150) is -0.866. Then denominator becomes sqrt(3 +6*(-0.866))=sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

Thus, I'm forced to conclude that either I made a mistake in the formula, or the options are incorrect, or perhaps I misread the question.

Wait, perhaps the question says interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, but I should have considered that as the distance between atoms in the (111) plane, i.e., the distance along the plane. But that's different from the interplanar distance.

Hmm, but the question asks for interplanar distance, which is the distance between planes. So that doesn't help.

In conclusion, I'm stuck. I think the correct approach leads to d≈3.49 Angstrom, but that's not among the options. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C)9.54 Angstrom.

Wait, let me compute 10 / sqrt( (1+1+1) + 2*(1+1+1) )= 10/sqrt(3+6)=10/sqrt(9)=10/3≈3.333, which is close to 3.49. But none of the options are near that.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different formula, such as d = a / (h² +k² +l² + 2hk cosθ ), without the square root. So for (111), denominator is 3 +6 *0.866=8.196. So d=10/8.196≈1.22 Angstrom. No, that's way off.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to settle on option A)9.08 Angstrom, but I can't see how it fits.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{hkl} \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)}}
\]

Here:
- \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) (interatomic distance assumed to be the lattice parameter),
- \( h = k = l = 1 \) (for the (111) plane),
- \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \) (angles between lattice vectors).

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
The denominator is:

\[
\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
\]
\[
2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma) = 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ)
\]
\[
\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]
\[
2(3 \cdot 0.866) = 2 \cdot 2.598 = 5.196
\]

Thus, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( d_{111} \)
Using the formula:
\[
d_{111} = \frac{a}{\text{denominator}} = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 3: Compare with the options
The calculated interplanar distance (\( \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \)) does not match any of the provided options, which are all in the range of 8–10 Å. This discrepancy suggests either:
1. The formula used is incorrect for this specific case.
2. The interpretation of the interatomic distance as the lattice parameter \( a \) is flawed.
3. The question or options may contain an error.

Given the mismatch, the closest plausible answer based on the options provided is **A) 9.08 Å**, though the reasoning for this result is unclear.
