Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. We need to identify the final product. The options are A to D. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI acid-catalyzed cleavage of alkenes, especially in the context of removing protecting groups or in certain elimination reactions. Wait, no, wait—red phosphorus is often used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but with something like NH3 and heat, right? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh, wait, no—red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Or wait, no, that's with H2O. Hmm.

Wait, wait, I think I might be confusing it with other reactions. Red phosphorus with ICl3 is used for the substitution of certain groups, but in this case, the reagent is HI. Oh, maybe it's the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride? No, wait, if you have an acyl chloride, adding HI might do something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction.

Wait, but looking back, the reaction is between Compound X and red phosphorus and HI. I think that this is a situation where the compound is a nitrile. Because I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using red phosphorus and HI. So if X is a nitrile, then treatment with red phosphorus and HI would give a carboxylic acid.

But wait, let me think again. Another possibility is that the compound is an alkyne, and the reaction is for hydrogenating the alkyne. But with red phosphorus and HI, I think that's more about the hydrolysis of nitriles. So perhaps X is a nitrile.

Now, let's look at the spectral data to figure out what X is.

The IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests an -OH stretch or possibly an alkyne (sp C-H stretch). But I'm not sure. Wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl peak, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a nitrile. Wait, nitriles have a strong C≡N peak around 2200-2260 cm-1. But the IR given doesn't show that. So maybe it's not a nitrile. Hmm. Then maybe it's an ester? The 1720 cm-1 is typical for esters. Or a ketone? Alternatively, an acid chloride would have higher wavenumbers, like around 1800.

Wait, but looking again, the IR has a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound has aromatic rings.

So now, the NMR data:

The 1H NMR shows several signals.

First, a peak at 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an -OH proton. But wait, in an acid, the OH would be around 10-12 ppm, and broad. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10 ppm, and maybe a triplet or something else. Hmm. But given that with red phosphorus and HI, maybe the starting material is an ester or a nitrile that becomes a carboxylic acid. Wait, if X is an ester, then perhaps upon reaction, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but let's look at the other NMR signals.

At 8.0 ppm, doublet, 2H. That seems like aromatic protons. Also, 7.2 ppm, another doublet, 2H. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene ring. So two doublets suggests that it's a para-substituted, perhaps with two substituents in the para positions.

Wait, let me think. If it's a para-substituted benzene, then in the NMR, you might see two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So the 8.0 ppm would be the more deshielded (downfield) protons, and 7.2 would be the less deshielded ones. So perhaps the substituents are electron-withdrawing groups in the para positions.

Wait, but then the 10.5 ppm peak could be an -OH from a carboxylic acid. But wait, if X is an ester, then reacting it with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze the ester to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if X is a nitrile, then it would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but let's think about the other parts of the NMR.

There's a peak at 2.9 ppm, multiplet, 1H. That could be a CH next to an electronegative group, perhaps a neighboring oxygen or something. Then, 1.7 ppm, multiplet, 2H. Maybe these are adjacent to each other, perhaps a CH2 group. Then, 1.4 ppm, d (doublet), 3H. That's probably a CH3 group attached to a CH that splits into a doublet. And 0.9 ppm, triplet, 3H—so that might be a CH2CH3 group, as the triplet is typical for a CH2 next to another CH2 (like in an ethyl group, where the CH2CH3 would be a triplet).

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a branched chain. Let's see: the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) and 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H), and the 2.9 ppm (1H). So maybe that's a group like CH(CH2CH3)CH2-, but wait, let me see. Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group attached in a certain way.

Wait, looking at the NMR shifts again.

The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are doublets each for 2H, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So maybe the substituent is at the para position, like a substituent that's a chain, leading to another part.

So, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a side chain. Let's consider that.

The substituent on the benzene is a group that has a chain leading to an oxygen or a functional group. Wait, but if the IR has a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, that could be an ester group. So if X is an ester, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction. If X is an ester, say R-O-CO-Ar (aryl ester), then treatment with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze it to the carboxylic acid, ArCOOH, and the corresponding alcohol, ROH.

But wait, in the NMR, do we see any oxygenated groups besides the 10.5 ppm peak? The 10.5 ppm could be the -OH of the carboxylic acid. So perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction produces a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which is characteristic of an -OH proton. So if X is an ester, then after hydrolysis, the product would be a carboxylic acid, which would have an -OH proton around 10-12 ppm.

But wait, in the original NMR of X, the 10.5 ppm peak is present. So if X is an ester, then after hydrolysis, we get a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, which would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid under these conditions.

Wait, but let me think about the reaction mechanism. Red phosphorus in HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction is: R-C≡N + HIO4 or HI → RCOOH + other products. So if X is a nitrile, then the product would be a carboxylic acid.

But looking at the NMR of X, if it's a nitrile, then the 1720 would instead be a nitrile's C≡N stretch, which is around 2200-2260 cm-1, but in the IR data, the 1720 is present, so maybe X isn't a nitrile. So perhaps X has a carbonyl group, like an ester or ketone.

Wait, but another possibility: the compound is a ketone. The 1720 cm-1 is lower than typical for ketones, which are usually around 1700-1750. So maybe it's an ester, which has a carbonyl around 1720-1740.

So, X is an ester.

So, let's think about the structure. The benzene ring has a substituent which is an ester group, perhaps.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm peak would then be from another group; wait, but if X is an ester, then the 10.5 ppm might not be part of X. Hmm, but the NMR of X includes that peak. So perhaps X is a carboxylic acid, but wait, why would X have an ester, then?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile. But then, as I thought earlier, the IR would have a peak around 2200 cm-1, which isn't present here.

Wait, maybe the 1720 cm-1 is from an aldehyde. But an aldehyde's C=O is around 1720 cm-1. But aldehydes also have a characteristic peak around 9-10 ppm for the aldehyde proton. But in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad peak, which could be an -OH, maybe from a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the IR doesn't show a broad peak around 3000-3500 cm-1 for an -OH stretch. Wait, the IR data says 3400–2500 cm-1. Hmm, that's a broad range, which might include an -OH stretch. So maybe X has an -OH group, like a carboxylic acid. But then, why would it react with red phosphorus and HI? Unless it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps X is a nitrile attached to a benzene ring. Then, when treated with red phosphorus and HI, it would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

But then, in X's NMR, the 10.5 ppm would have to be something else. Alternatively, maybe X is a methyl benzoate ester. Hmm.

Let me try to sketch a possible structure based on the NMR.

The benzene ring shows two doublets, which suggests para substitution. So the substituent is at the para position, perhaps a group like COOR (ester) or a substituent with a chain.

The NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH group, which is split by a neighboring group. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be another CH2. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH attached to something else.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-COO-R group, but wait, let me think in terms of the substituent on the benzene.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. For example, maybe a butyl group attached to the benzene. Let me see. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is a CH2CH3 (ethyl group). The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) would be a CH3 attached to a CH that's next to something else. The 1.7 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 between the two.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Because a sec-butyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the NMR would show the CH(CH2CH3) as a triplet or something else.

Wait, but let's think about the substituent. If the substituent is a propyl group, maybe -CH2CH2CH3, then the NMR would have the CH2CH3 as a triplet at 0.9, the middle CH2 as a quartet around 1.7, and the CH3 as a triplet around 1.4? Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, which would be a sec-butyl group. So the substituent on the benzene is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, but considering the NMR signals:

- The triplet at 0.9 (3H) would be the CH2CH3 end of the ethyl group.

- The doublet at 1.4 (3H) would be a CH3 attached to a CH group. So perhaps it's a CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, but how does this fit together?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to the benzene. So like -CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's a butyl group.

Wait, but let's think about the integration and splitting:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) → likely an ethyl group's terminal CH3.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) → a CH3 attached to a CH group that's split into a doublet. So perhaps a CH(CH3) group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) → two protons, perhaps a CH2 adjacent to a CH group.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → a CH group adjacent to another group, perhaps next to an oxygen or an aromatic ring.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene. Wait, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group? Wait, but that would have different NMR signals.

Wait, another approach: the substituent's structure is based on the NMR. Let me try to build it step by step.

The substituent is attached to the benzene ring. It has a chain that includes:

- A terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, triplet) → part of an ethyl group.

- A CH3 group attached to a CH (1.4 ppm, doublet) → this CH is attached to another group.

- A CH2 group (1.7 ppm, multiplet) → adjacent to the CH and maybe another CH2.

- A CH group (2.9 ppm, multiplet) → adjacent to the aromatic ring and perhaps another group.

So the substituent could be something like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene? But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's a three-carbon chain with branching. Let me think: the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps it's an isobutyl group. The isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. But wait, that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So the NMR would have a CH(CH3)2 group. The CH would have a triplet if attached to a CH2. But in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, which is split by a neighboring group. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a propyl group attached to a benzene ring. So the substituent would be -CH2CH2CH3. But then the NMR would show different splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, either straight or branched.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests it's adjacent to a CH2. So perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH3. But then the adjacent CH2 would show a quartet around 1.7 ppm, and the next CH2 would show a triplet around 2.9 ppm. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the substituent would be a sec-butyl group. Let me think: the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but let's see the NMR:

- The ethyl group (CH2CH3) would show up as a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), with a neighboring CH2.

- The CH(CH2CH3) would have its own CH3 group at 1.4 ppm as a doublet, because the CH is attached to another CH2 group, which could split the signal into a doublet.

- The CH2 adjacent to the aromatic ring would be at around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet, perhaps a triplet or quartet, depending on neighboring groups.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which suggests it's a CH group adjacent to something else. So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, and then there's another group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but with another substituent. Let me try to think of the substituent as -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene. But that would make it a pentyl group or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane ring or something, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. But that might be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So the substituent would be a isopropyl group attached via a methylene. But then the NMR would show the isopropyl's CH3s as a septet, I think.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should look at the options provided and see which one makes sense.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C)4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D)1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, the options are all either substituted benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings with alkyl groups.

So, the reaction is of X with red phosphorus and HI. If X is a nitrile, the product would be a carboxylic acid. If X is an ester, the product would be a carboxylic acid. If X is a benzene ring with an ester group, then the product would be a benzoic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would imply that X was a 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride or ester, which upon hydrolysis gives the benzoic acid.

But wait, let's think again. The reaction is X + red phosphorus + HI → product.

If X is a nitrile, then the product is a carboxylic acid. So for example, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Alternatively, if X is a benzoyl chloride, then the reaction would produce the carboxylic acid.

But looking at the NMR of X, which is the starting material, let's see.

The NMR of X includes a 10.5 ppm peak, which I thought was an -OH. But if X is an acid chloride, that would show a different NMR. Alternatively, if X is an ester, the 10.5 ppm peak would not be part of it.

Wait, but if X is a nitrile, then the 10.5 ppm peak would not be from X. So that suggests that maybe X is a nitrile, and the product is a carboxylic acid with an -OH group at 10.5 ppm.

Wait, but in the NMR of X, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet integrating to 1H. So if X is a nitrile, perhaps it's a phenyl nitrile with an -OH group elsewhere. That doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzoic acid. But then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI—what would that do? I'm not sure. Maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps X is a methyl benzoate. So the ester group is attached to the benzene ring. Let me see: methyl benzoate would have an ester carbonyl at 1720 cm-1 in IR. The ester's methoxy group would show up as a triplet around δ 3.8 ppm, but in the given NMR data, there's no such peak. So perhaps X isn't a simple methyl ester.

Wait, maybe X is a propanoate ester. Let me think. The substituent would have a chain leading to an ester group.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a propyl ester group, like benzene-1-carboxyethyl something. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a carbonyl group, making it an ester or a nitrile.

Alternatively, considering the options, perhaps the correct product is a carboxylic acid, which would be option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the starting material X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile. Upon treatment with red phosphorus and HI, it would hydrolyze to the benzoic acid.

But wait, the NMR of X (the starting material) would then have certain features. Let me see.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, then the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, as in the data. The substituent is at the para position, so the aromatic protons would be a pair of doublets. Then, the substituent is a sec-butyl group: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

So, the substituent's structure would be:

Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–, but attached as a substituent. Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-, but in the correct structure, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. So, the NMR would have:

- The ethyl group (CH2CH3) as a triplet around 0.9 ppm.

- The CH(CH2CH3) would have its own CH3 as a doublet around 1.4 ppm.

- The CH2 adjacent to the benzene would be a multiplet around 2.9 ppm.

Wait, let me think about the splitting. The substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the structure is:

Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–.

So, the CH2 next to the benzene would be a quartet, perhaps, due to coupling with the adjacent CH group. The CH group would be a triplet because it's next to the CH2 and the CH2CH3.

But in the NMR data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which could correspond to the CH group. The 1.7 ppm (2H) could be the CH2 group adjacent to the benzene, which might couple with the CH and another group, giving a multiplet. The 1.4 ppm (3H) is a doublet, which would be the CH3 attached to the CH group, which is next to the CH2.

And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the ethyl group's CH2CH3.

So, putting it all together, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, making the starting material 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile.

Then, upon treatment with red phosphorus and HI, the nitrile group is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, like 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate. In that case, after hydrolysis, it would become benzoic acid. But the NMR of X would have to match an ester, which might not fit.

Wait, but in the given NMR of X, the 10.5 ppm could be an -OH group, which would suggest that X is a carboxylic acid. That doesn't make sense because then the reaction would be something else.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

If X is a nitrile, the product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI is a carboxylic acid. The NMR of X (the starting material) would not have an -OH group, because nitriles don't have hydroxyl protons. So the 10.5 ppm peak in X's NMR must be something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a propargyl alcohol or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm peak is from an aldehyde proton. But aldehydes typically have sharp signals, and the chemical shift is around 9-10 ppm. But in X's case, it's a broad peak, which would suggest it's an -OH group.

Wait, perhaps X is a phenol. But then, the 1720 cm-1 peak would be something else, like an ester or a carbonyl group.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe another approach is better.

Let's look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would be the product if X is a nitrile. So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, then the product is option C.

The NMR of X (the nitrile) would not have an -OH group, so the 10.5 ppm peak would have to be from something else. Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound.

Wait, but the given NMR of X includes a 10.5 ppm peak, which is a broad singlet. So if X is a nitrile, that peak must be from another group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a methyl benzoate ester with a substituent. Let me think: if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid methyl ester, then upon treatment with red phosphorus and HI, it would hydrolyze to 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

In that case, the NMR of X would show the ester's methyl group as a singlet around 3.8 ppm. But in the given data, there's no such peak. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an alkyne. But then, I don't know how the reaction proceeds.

Another thought: the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester or a ketone. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are for aromatic C=C.

So, perhaps X is an aromatic ester, like methyl benzoate with a substituent.

But if X is an ester, then the product would be a carboxylic acid, which would have an -OH group, matching the 10.5 ppm peak.

So, X's NMR would have:

- Aromatic protons as two doublets.

- The ester's OCH3 as a singlet around 3.8 ppm, but that's not present in the given data.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, let's think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. So if X is a nitrile, the product is a carboxylic acid. The 10.5 ppm peak in X's NMR would then be something else. But I don't know what that would be.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an aldehyde. Then, the product would be a carboxylic acid, but I don't know about that.

Alternatively, maybe X is a ketone. But then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would not produce a carboxylic acid. Unless under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a substitution. For example, if X is a benzyl chloride and reacts with HI, it would undergo substitution to give a benzyl iodide, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration or elimination, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Maybe I should try to match the NMR data to the options.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The structure would be:

Benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position.

The benzoic acid would have a COOH group, which has an -OH proton. That would explain the 10.5 ppm peak in X's NMR—wait, no, because X is the starting material, and option C is the product. So X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, which doesn't have an -OH group. So why is there a 10.5 ppm peak in X's NMR?

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Perhaps X is the product, and the reaction is something else. No, the question says X reacts with red phosphorus and HI to give the product, which is one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not a hydrolysis. Another reaction involving red phosphorus and HI is the cleavage of alkenes to form diols or other products. Wait, but that would require X to have a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe X is a benzene ring with a nitrile group and an ethyl group, and upon reaction, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, let's think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its structure would be a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in the para position. So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, then the reaction would produce option C.

In the NMR of X (the nitrile), the aromatic protons would be two doublets (8.0 and 7.2 ppm). The substituent would be a sec-butyl group attached to the ring.

The substituent's NMR would have:

- The ethyl group (CH2CH3) as a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

- The CH3 attached to the CH as a doublet at 1.4 ppm.

- The CH2 adjacent to the benzene as a multiplet at 1.7 ppm.

- The CH (quartet or multiplet) adjacent to the benzene and the CH(CH2CH3) at 2.9 ppm.

So, in the NMR of X, the 10.5 ppm peak would be something else. Wait, nitriles don't have an -OH group. So where does that peak come from?

Maybe X has another functional group, like an alcohol. But then, the IR would show an -OH stretch around 3200-3600 cm-1, which is in the given IR data (3400–2500 cm-1). So X could be a phenol.

Wait, if X is a phenol with a nitrile group, then upon treatment with red phosphorus and HI, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid, and the phenol would remain.

But then, the product would have both a phenolic -OH and a carboxylic acid -OH, which might complicate the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propargyl alcohol derivative, but I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit confusing, but I think the most plausible option is that X is a nitrile, and the product is a carboxylic acid (option C). The 10.5 ppm peak in X's NMR must be from another group, perhaps an -OH, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a methyl ester and a substituent. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. So, looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid, which is likely the product.

So, the starting material X is a nitrile, and the product is a carboxylic acid.

Thus, the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the spectral data provided for Compound X:

### IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Suggests the presence of an -OH group or possibly an sp C-H stretch (alkyne).
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Indicates a carbonyl group, likely from an ester, ketone, or aldehyde.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, confirming the presence of a benzene ring.

### NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of an -OH proton, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH group adjacent to an electronegative group.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH₂ group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet, likely from a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely from a CH₂CH₃ group.

### Reaction Analysis:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. This suggests that Compound X is likely a nitrile, and the reaction produces a carboxylic acid.

### Structure of Compound X:
Based on the NMR data:
- The para-substituted benzene ring indicates a substituent at the para position.
- The substituent includes a CH group (2.9 ppm), a CH₂ group (1.7 ppm), a CH₃ group (1.4 ppm, doublet), and a CH₂CH₃ group (0.9 ppm, triplet). This matches the structure of a **sec-butyl group** (-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)).

Thus, Compound X is likely **4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile**.

### Reaction Outcome:
When 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the nitrile group (-C≡N) is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

Answer: C
